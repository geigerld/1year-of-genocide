more than a month into the war on Gaza we're starting with the coverage in the US freedom of expression is under the gun in the land of the free in the UK Canada and Australia the journalistic resistance starts with the basics the terminology in use and India is generating its own kind of Gaza coverage it is one-sided and at times dangerous hello I'm Richard gizbert as Israel's ground Invasion enters a dangerous new phase we're focusing on the one country with the power to stop the Carnage in Gaza the United States close to 11,000 Palestinians have been killed the UN has called The War Zone a children's graveyard the living find themselves trapped among decaying bodies in the debris American officials continue to stand by Israel in public when the cameras are gone their counseling restraint or so they say the 4-Hour humanitarian pauses that Israel put into effect on Friday are what passes for Progress that still leaves another 20 hours a day for the Israeli military to bomb civilians fleeing their homes across American news networks the argument that Israel's Mass Slaughter of civilians is a justifiable Act of self-defense often goes unchallenged and there has been far too little discussion of a ceasefire some Us Media Outlets though have produced powerful accounts of this asymmetrical War but there is an unmistakable undeniable chill with too many voices silenced criticism of Israel can keep you off the American Airwaves out of print or even cost you your [Music] job Israel sees the parades in the rallies for the ceasefire and they see no parades and no rallies for the return of the hostages or the removal of Hamas the United States is the armor of Israel the United States is the Diplomatic protector of Israel and that's why the discussion here matters a great deal we're in a religious War here I am with Israel do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself level the place there's actually two conversations happening in the US there's a popular conversation amongst people receiving their information directly from the ground they they the door of the hospital and completely different conversation amongst those who are consuming their information from more popular sources of media Gaza is not now Under Siege Israel has been under siege for 75 years to understand how biased American media coverage of the war in Gaza can be just turn on the television you can see it in what is condemned and what is condoned in who is the humanized and who is not in what is questioned and to what extent our newspapers our journalists our cable news networks are not pushing American officials enough they're not asking them to condemn the Israeli Prime Minister talking about genocidal Biblical verses to justify their military campaign the goal is to destroy Hamas Hamas is creating these casualties not Israel I I don't think anyone's asking NE well some people may be asking is real to apologize but that's not what I'm asking about I don't think to this day there is a single editorial board um in the United States that has actually called for a ceasefire in spite of the Carnage you know you're actually seeing some Israeli press take stronger and Bolder stances as opposed to newspaper editorial boards here in the country that have more or less fallen in line with what the state Department's party line is you have seen um American politicians like Marco Rubio or Nikki Haley using genocidal language of about Gaza and I'll say this to to prime minister Netanyahu finish them Marco Rubio said I don't think there's any way Israel can be expected to coexist or find some diplomatic off-ramp uh with these Savages and neither of those comments were treated with the kind of shock they deserved to be treated with Americans were among those horrified by the gruesome images they saw on October 7th after hamas's attack that killed more than 1,400 Israelis since then too many in the US media have been taking their cues from the Biden Administration it's insistence that what Israel is doing despite the killing of more than 10,000 Palestinians somehow remains an act of self-defense almost every military analyst has said that a ceasefire could give Hamas that opportunity to regroup and Carry Out Future attacks and we saw more than 2/3 of Americans now want a ceasefire it is is a growing movement that is insufficiently reflected in the mainstream media commentary which often draws the line well short of that what about Israeli officials that I that I've talked to about these calls for a ceasefire they say that just gives Hamas time to regroup interviewees tend to repeat the Israeli media's talking points on Hamas hospitals and human Shields the storing of Munitions all kinds of explosives under hospitals under refugee camps under civilian targets the use of civilians uh as really just tools of War um by Hamas those are claims that Israel has made many times before but have never been verified on the question of representation and who gets to be heard a body speaking for Arab and Middle Eastern journalists says it is deeply troubled by reports the journalists of Middle Eastern descent are being sidelined from report reporting or commenting on the current War while suggestions for nuance and precise language in reporting are being ignored in newsrooms there's not necessarily you know this red line that editors have that you know you're not allowed to say this or you're not allowed to say that there is a culture of fear in our institutions here about talking honestly and freely about this because whenever something that sheds light on human rights violations committed by Israel there's usually a massive push back campaign and people are afraid of it newspapers like the New York Times And The Washington Post have done an admirable job um of reporting uh on what's going on in Gaza I've seen plenty of Stories of the coverage of Civilian harm in Gaza cable television by contrast you know because of the sort of nature of cable TV it's sort of short segments kind of favoring sound bites the sort of type of analysis you're getting there is just truncated and often um misinformed when taking in the coverage of Gaza or even scrolling through their social media Americans should consider who they are not hearing from voices that have been silenced journalists who have been fired over the positions they have taken online they include a New York Times magazine writer who signed a joint letter opposing the Israel Gaza war was questioned by her editor about that and ended up resigning after the editor of Harper's bizarre magazine tweeted that Israel's cutting off power to Gaza was inhuman the Magazine's parent company Hurst banned its employees from expressing personal political opinions on social media this goes beyond news outlets into the art world the new york-based magazine art Forum fired its editor-in chief after he signed a petition calling for a ceasefire one that neglected to condemn hamas's attack on October 7th it seems like the top Executives of these uh corporate media Outlets are actually in a pitched battle with the producers who want to tell a different story I have been blacklisted by several outlets as I've been told by producers my Clips have also been censored and even though they've aired live have not been posted on their websites the explanations for it is that I either made the anchor look bad or that I'm too advoca none of the reasons provided have to do with I said something that wasn't true or I was uh inflammatory in any way it was literally other reasons in order to craft a particular kind of story where we can express empathy for Palestinian lives but not point the finger about why they are being killed in a genocidal campaign and who is doing it to express support for Palestine brings many different risks it risks you um being ostracized within the broader media World it risks you not getting uh career opportunities it risks you being on the front page of a tabloid newspaper um you know and labeled a terrorist sympathizer and that is reflected in both the coverage from the last month and also the broader climate of repression that we have seen in so many different areas of public life after almost a month of locking the international media out of the war zone and then disputing the reporting of Palestinians inside Gaza Israel finally allowed some Western journalists to enter this past week under certain conditions the reporters have to be embedded with Israeli forces that act as their protectors and ultimately their editors as a condition to enter Gaza under IDF escort Outlets have to submit all materials and footage to the Israeli military for review prior to publication I applaud CNN and others were at least telling their audiences that their information is filtered by the Israeli State CNN has agreed to these terms in order to provide you the viewers a limited window into Israel's operations in Gaza but I think that should have done more to push back against the conditions that first that they had to be embedded with the Israeli military and that second none of their coverage would be published without the approval of the state so literally all that's filtering out is State propaganda the population will be able to go from the north to the South surely and all freely in order to get the IDF do what it need to do in order to do demolish Kamas and I think here it's incumbent upon audiences to exercise scrutiny why why is Israel preventing a Foreign Press from entering Good Morning America on ABC News where they said this was a rare short and quite intense opportunity to see what the situation is like in Gaza on the ground it's only rare if you are overlooking all of the journalism from inside Gaza going towards the violence not away from it through unbearable conditions to actually bring the world these stories I just was to give water to my grandma and right here a house there around three dozen journalists inside Gaza have been killed reporting through unimaginable personal emotional trauma losing their families and to erase all of that is very very shameful and when you close your eyes at night what is it you think about that is not to dismiss some quality American news coverage of this war and its impact on Palestinian civilians this CNN interview with a nurse who worked in Gaza will stick with viewers there were children with just massive burns down their faces down their necks all over their limbs and because the hospitals are so overwhelmed they are being charged immediately after and still US News output is pulling its punches on the scale of the killing the mass displacement the crimes against humanity in examining this war perhaps Americans need to reflect on some of their own Colonial history to remember that all colonizers including Americans started out by occupying the land of the other the fact that for most Americans they cannot critically examine Israel also represents their own blind spots of understanding themselves as living within a settler racial Colony as benefiting from white supremacy on lands that are still colonized and not seated by over 500 indigenous Nations everything that we can critique Americans for failing to see in the humanity of Palestinians reflects their own inability to see themselves so Palestine here is not an exception the rule is a colonial framework and a liberal understanding that somehow we've overcome colonialism which is not true we continue to exist in an enduring Colonial reality the vast majority of mainstream news outlets in the US are corporate owned elsewhere in the anglosphere though publicly funded broadcasters are taking heat over their coverage of the Gaza story and some of that as Nick mad explains comes from within first up Richard is the BBC in the UK Ramy Rim the Network's correspondent in Beirut sent an email to director General Tim Davy expressing his concerns he argued that historical context and significant information including expert opinion that Israel's actions could amount to genocide was either entirely missing or not being given due prominence when Davy failed to reply to that email rayim shared it with the rest of his colleagues at the BBC in Canada a lawyer journalist had similar things to say about cbc's coverage he interrupted a speech the network CEO Katherine Tate was giving you are not telling the truth as an organization about the genocide happening in Gaza before the eyes of the world in Australia more than 200 employees at ABC met to point out issues again over terminology and the Network's Reliance on Israeli military's talking points they also called out ABC's refusal to use certain terms such as occupation apartate and genocide even Invasion but just back to the UK for a moment and an instance of Journalism that Rose to the challenge Channel 4's sakander kamani was embedded with the Israeli military in Gaza when they came across Palestinians fleeing the bombardment we're not allowed by the military to go any closer Israeli soldiers can prevent journalists embedded with them from interviewing gazan refugees what they cannot do is stop those news organizations from working with Palestinian reporters to tell that side of the story footage filmed on the salahudin road by Palestinian journalists gives you a true sense of scale and showcasing the scale of this tragedy is something Channel 4 has been very effective in doing thanks Nick Israel's hasbara campaign its PR effort to win diplomatic backing and shape public perception is an overdrive these days not that it's really needed in places like India prime minister Narendra Modi has been crystal clear clear in his backing of this war New Deli says it sees it as an act of counterterrorism and self-defense just last month when the UN voted in favor of a humanitarian pause India abstained Indo Israeli relations have been on the upswing for the past few years now the image of Israel is a Hightech prosperous nation that survives in a region populated by quote unquote enemies resonates with many Indians and they've been showing their support through posts online rants on television with some disinformation thrown in to skew how this conflict is understood the listening posts minak shiavi now on the pro-israeli messaging that's coming out of India and why it matters Israel is at War we didn't want this war it was forced Upon Us in the most brutal and Savage way 2 days after Hamas Fighters burst out of Gaza and carry out one of the most audacious attacks on Israeli territory prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's office posts this video online Hamas will understand that by attacking us they've made a mistake of historic proportions within minutes the message has thousands of shares and replies numerous Israeli posts demand netanyahu's resignation but there's another set of messages from Indians and they are all in so the responses from Indian accounts have been extra Ary to say the least sometimes they put up posters in which they say we stand with Israel sometimes they put Graphics of two hands in a clasp painted with Israeli and Indian Flags sometimes theyve just tried to reflect on how this conflict in Gaza mirrors the kind of challenges that India faces security wise when we try to understand why is there such a widespread interest in India with respect to this particular conflict one of the things is a shared experience of ter terrorism when October 7th happened hamas's attack on Israel in India almost immediately parallels were drawn with the 2611 experience which were a major terrorist attack happening on the Indian city of Mumbai in 2008 to me it had a lot of shades of our own 2611 uh when you had terrorists coming from Pakistan on boats and uh uh creating the rampage that they did this major space that Israel suddenly started to occupy in the Indian imagination was because that common threat was found the same radical jihadist islamist terrorist thinking that Israel is a victim of we are a victim of as well Israel is fighting this war on behalf of all of us Israel is fighting this war for you and me new delhi's support for Israel was Swift and unequivocal prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted in solidarity an Indian news Outlet as though on Q went on a war footing themselves channels that just a few months earlier had not seen fit to send their journalists to cover unprecedented violence in India's Northeastern State of Manipur they dispatched reporters all the way to Israel heavy bombs are being used right now to take out the Hamas leadership and you know there is collateral damage proclamations of Vengeance and calls for Mass killing were issued from Indian news Studios policy 1 for one the coverage I think has been extremely sensationalist and dramatic there was a reporter who was asked to quiet down by Israeli soldiers because of how loudly he was trying to cover what was happening then there's another reporter from a channel who was reporting from a paraglider after reports came out that Hamas crossed the border on paragliders there's also been misinformation shared by Indian news channel there was a video of a group of people carrying what looked like a dead body but when they put down the person the person got up and walked away so this uh video was shared with the claim that Palestinians are faking the death of the victims but this video turned out to be from 2020 and it was shot in Jordan uh during Co lockdown and it was by a bunch of people who were trying to flout the the lockdown rules whereas in the past Israelis would send out disinformation or their talking points and they they would land on American and British mainstream media platforms now you have large Indian accounts amplifying this just a few days ago a BJP leader addressed a rally and he invented a set of of his own lies and then lamented about the kind of small pockets of support that some Indian Muslims have shown or displayed for Palestinians uh in India and he asked them do you want Hamas to come to India this is how hate and misinformation works you keep repeating something again and again again and again that you know there is Islamic Terror and how Israel is trying to protect itself and then there is a Muslim threat in India and how Hindus are trying to protect themselves and if you keep repeating this there comes a time when people who are consuming this or who may be misinformed when they see that Muslims are treated with a lot of violence they can one justify it or two just say that they deserve it so what happens is that you take away how a normal human being would react to someone who is facing violence and this is essentially what hate and disinformation achieves modern day India and the state of Israel came into being within a year of each other India through its independence from British rule in 1947 Israel through its expulsion of Palestinians and the establishment of the state in 1948 on the question of Palestine India's independence leaders Mahatma Gandhi and jawaharlal nehu they were vocal in their support in 1936 when Palestinian rose up against the British and their push for a Jewish State Neu compared Palestine with India under colonial rule he talked about a gross betrayal of the Arabs by British imperialism Palestine was not an empty land it was well populated with little room for large numbers of colonists is it any wonder that the Arabs objected to this intrusion a little more than 10 years later when the United Nations voted to create the state of Israel there were only three non-arab countries that voted against that resolution India was one of them times have changed so have the geopolitics historically speaking I mean I'm refering to the post 1947 era which is when we got Independent India and Israel haven't really had a very nice or cozy relationship that you probably see now that has come after 2014 which is when Prime Minister Modi has come to power shom oh what a great great day great day and of course one of the reasons is that both these countries have nationalistic governments and that perhaps is one of the ideological uh reasons why uh you know the relationship has taken off so relations between you know India and Israel did not start with Narendra Modi but what happens in 2014 is Modi and Netanyahu meet properly officially at the UN General Assembly in New York and they agree at that moment to quote tear down the remaining walls between the two countries India purchases around 50% % of all weapons sold by Israel per year and India is also beginning to co-produce weapons and they're working in agriculture they're working in Tech they're working in cyber security 2017 was the first time that an Indian Prime Minister actually traveled to Israel and you see a kind of an um you know upgrade in the relations ever in the past month India has reaffirmed its support for the establishment of a Palestinian State the so-called two-state solution uh towards establishing a sovereign independent and viable state of Palestine New Delhi has also sent medical and disaster relief Aid to gazans how much of that made it pass the Israeli blockade and into the strip is not known the war is a big story in India and as it rages on it is folding into another even bigger domestic story India is going into a huge election next year and this issue will serve as a way to consolidate the Hindu nationalist base in India it serves Modi very well electorally to be seen as close to Israel as a country that's able to put Muslims in their place but it's also about modernizing the state the BJP has pushed this narrative that in order to be a strong militaristic Global player it had to be close to Israel all this rhetoric around minorities and the domestic sentiment with respect to minorities I think it is really not understood well and it is often you know foreign media that falls for a certain kind of narrative and that leads to a rather skewed understanding of how Indian societies actually operate I think it is too soon to tell how this war will will play out when it comes to um elections in India next year but there are already po that are claiming you know you have to stand up against Islamic terrorism otherwise what would happen in India is what is happening in Israel so for Hindus to protect themselves from this threat is to reelect Prime Minister Modi just one final note those of you watching on YouTube may have had to jump through a few Hoops to see our latest reporting having to sign in because of age restrictions or simply not being recommended our content now there are a number of reasons for that but one of the biggest has to do with advertisers companies that don't want their ads up against images of the suffering that this war has produced we are not going to change the way we cover this story just to please an algorithm so if you value our journalism please share it it is more important than ever that these stories are heard we'll see you next time here at the listening
