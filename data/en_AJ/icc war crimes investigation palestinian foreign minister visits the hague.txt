while the Palestinian foreign minister Riad al- Malaki is visiting the Haag to push for a war crimes investigation against Israel he says he's received assurances that Israel will be investigated for its actions in Gaza Maliki says the attacks serve only one purpose this time the war that Israel is waging is different this time the war is a war of Revenge that war this war has no real objective rather than the total Destruction of every livable Corner Place in Gaza well let's speak to Neve bker he's across this for us in the ha in the Netherlands NE we just heard a little of what Malaki said there what else did he cover well there's been an awful lot of busy diplomatic activity by the Palestinian foreign minister he's been in jeda in Saudi Arabia he's been of course earlier this week at the UN Security Council and now to the Palestinian Mission here in the hag the home of international Justice the international criminal court the international court of justice also known as the world Court uh well as you mentioned the foreign minister did suggest that after an hour or so long meeting with Kareem Khan who's the chief ICC prosecutor that the court has agreed to investigate allegations of war crimes crimes against humanity genocide and the forc deportation of people there is a caveat though it could take many many years for any kind of ruling to be made the ICC um it also doesn't have a police force so it can't force uh member countries that are signatories to uh the ICC to hand over wanted um individuals also Israel uh is not a party to the Rome statute does not recognize the authority of the ICC so why is it doing this well it's all about legal accountability it's all about reminding the International Community of The Wider context of the conflict that's going on at the current time NE I see the Palestinians are also pursuing a judgment from the international court of justice as well that's right again this is all about International accountability this uh is a result of a vote at the UN General Assembly late last year that gave the international court of justice the the power to give its legal opinion over Israel's occupation of Palestinian land uh where in the process now of uh seeing written submissions oral submissions from uh those sides that are party to this case will take place uh in February before a judgment later on in the year again it's all about shining the international Spotlight and what Palestine says is a long and accelerating process of settlement building and it's continued occupation NE Barker there with that report for us from the ha in the Netherlands thank you so much Neeve well let's now bring in tamama kamut he's a professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies and he joins me again in the studio T there have been calls for the ICC to investigate both Hamas and Israel for violations of international law I'm curious about what you make of the icc's response to what's been taking place in this conflict it it seems remarkably different to its approach to what happened in Ukraine uh exactly Nastasia that's that's their opportunity now to uh to to really show the entire world and prove to the entire world that IC is a is a serious organization and that it's not politicizing any crimes I mean we have seen uh the the how fast it acted to issue an arrest warrant against uh uh Putin a president of a superpower like Russia Russia is not even a member of the IC but they were very fast and they were very they did it because obviously there was uh they had the support they needed to do it and politics also play here but when it comes to Palestine I'm sorry let me get back a little bit and and the the arrest warrant was for what for moving relocating relocating Ukrainian children from uh a safe orphan in Ukraine to a safe orphan in Russia orphanage in Russia correct what's happening in Gaza is massacring children by thousands they're being massacred and Mr Khan is still silent now why did he even wait for for analy the the Palestinian foreign minister to go there he should have acted immediately he does not need a visit from the Palestinian foreign minister to to start to open an immediate investigation and and and and an issue an arrest warrant for n and all the Israeli Army generals who are committing war crimes because Israel is a state it's a country it's a member of the UN so it has obligations to respect international law Hamas is not a state it's it's a milit party you know but for sure Israel by international law is obliged to protect also civilians in Gaza who are under Israeli occupation so all these double standards and you know it might take for years for them to look into issues also access issues right but but Thomas forgive me for jumping in I because I do want to ask you the question that NE raised do you think that the threat of legal accountability will actually change any decision- making when it comes to this conflict any decision making uh I mean if is still treated the way it's treated by the US and its allies in the west I don't think anything will happen it's still it will act as it's it has this protection it's a country above International LA because it has its protection this protection and Status sadly from its allies so tamama kamut uh professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for graduate studies thank you for joining me again Tama
