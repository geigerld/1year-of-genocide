we can now bring in Dr zad shahash he is a resident of Gaza and also I believe a medical doctor dror thank you so much for your time with us here on Al jazer can I ask you for your response to what we've seen tonight you're a medical doctor you're watching the aftermath of what's believed to be an air strike on a hospital let me ask what you're thinking right now okay well uh actually what what happened is terrible and horrible because those people all of them are civilians they they fled from their houses and reach to a place that they believe it's a safe because according to the international law the hospitals are a safe place so Mo most of them move there and the rest of the Palestinians who left their houses ER that they believe the houses is a in a dangerous area they they moved to H schools or to the hospitals actually in in in one minute all of them killed the AL hospital this is related to a a Christian Society in Gaza so there's a church inside the hospital so we believe many of Christians already killed as well so the number right now is a more than 500 ER the 500 already did but we believe the number will reach more than 1,000 so this is a massacre so we ask all the people now actually most of the medications and the the medical equipments already finished we ask the international organization to help to to provide whatever they can any kind of assistance but no no one can provide because already the Border closed so we ask the people in all over the world to help to assist the Palestinians the gazans now we are we are dying every minute we are dying we we we we cannot even focus about the PS which is everywhere but even even that the basic needs are not available so no water no electricity no internet no communication so actually the that's situation is unavailable uh so we we need the word to help now we can see I believe that can see thousands so I just wanted to ask about your location because I understand that you live not far and you're speaking to us from not far from Gaza City where obviously 1.1 million people were told to evacuate a lot of them have ended up in South and Central Gaza including a huge number of the people who were Sheltering at this Hospital what is the situation like now where you are are there is there is there anyone left no actually the majority of the Palestinians in Gaza mov to the south region or the the south of Gaza because they receive warning from Israel and as well the the plane ER spread like aures uh and everyone ask every want to to move outside Gaza City but even those people who left Gaza City and go go to the south of Gaza as well they they have been attacked so even in the middle of Gaza in canun and Rafa the the south governorates of of Gaza St as well under attack so no place is safe in Gaza the the Kuwaiti Hospital in in actually which is the the last point in the south of G Gaza stet already threatened and receive a warning from Israel to be destroyed so you you cannot imagine once we are working inside the hospital and suddenly we receive a warning to destroy the hospital so what about the patients what what about the the pregnants what about the the the children who are who who are in the operations so everyone run run away everyone fled so screaming crying so we the situation actually the worst ever I've seen in my life even if I I I traveled to to many countries and attended many wars this is the worst ever I've seen in my in my life doctor you mentioned pregnant women there we know that the UN is saying there are 50,000 pregnant women trapped right now in the Gaza Strip some I believe 5,500 of them are due to give birth this month obviously that there are and beyond that a huge number of people who who require urgent medical care we've just been watching really heartbreaking pictures on our screens of families there who appear to to be dealing with not only the trauma of what's happened but but also the grief of of trying to Grapple with with what's happened this evening let me ask you as a medical doctor in the Gaza Strip right now do you personally believe that medical facilities and medical personnel are being targeted actually there's a lack in everything so the medicine is is not enough uh the the disposables uh not available so we we we we ask anyone in the street we ask the pharmacist the priv sector to to help us and later on we will uh we will give them the money we ask anyone to to help us now everything is not enough now actually the the main hospitals in Gaza only receive the emergency cases now for the pregnant for for anyone has any kind of diseases we ask them to move outside the hospital we cannot receive anyone in the normal case so all the the the pregnant we are them to go to another hospital to the private hospitals or to the charity hospitals but we cannot receive those in in in the government hospitals because the all all government Hospitals now only for for emergency now I think you know also many of the main hospitals in the in the north governorate of Gaza already out of service because even they are destroyed or they ask them to evacuate the the hospital so all the area in the north of Gaza already evacuated now they are focusing the attacks focus on Gaza City after this we don't know they will move to the South maybe to another governorate but the situation in Gaza now we believe it's like the third world war on Gaza which is destroyed everything even hospitals schools most chur everything under attack in Gaza doctor I just want to I just want to clarify one thing there do you believe that you as a medical professional and medical facilities in Gaza are currently being targeted with air strikes again again I I cannot hear I'm I'm sorry I was asking you doctor if you believe as a medical doctor in Gaza right now that medical facilities are being deliberately targeted with air Stripes yes yes I I I believe so because we we ask the international organization to provide us with a with a supplements with the medicines but all of them ER regret to us and they said we cannot provide you anything even the private companies now we know some private companies they have some some devices but they said if we open the stores and provide you these kind of devices like CT scan ER and other other kind of uh equipments the the the air strike will destroy our stores so they regret as well we ask the international organization to provide they coordinate with the Egyptian side to provide us with all kind of of assistance but as well in the Egyptian side they said we receive a warning from Israel in case we provide you anything they will destroy the tracks so now we are alone in this world we believe we feel lonely we struggle alone we cannot receive anything actually the situation is very hard and the conditions are unbelievable in Gaza Dr zad shahash there both a resident of Gaza and a medical doctor himself doctor thank you so much for your time with us here on Al jazer and we really wish you and your family all the best please do stay safe let's now go to our correspondent Tark Abu aam he's on the ground there for us in southern Gaza from Khan yunes Tark can you give us a little bit of an update as to what you're hearing I I know the Gaza Health Ministry is saying now we're looking at at more than 500 dead said what do we know about exactly what happened tonight well uh another bloody night uh happens inside the Gaza Strip a very sad night also for the gazans and locals inside this perceived uh spot uh till this current moment the Palestinian Ministry of Health is trying to identify and to count the number of victims and casualties reported and resulted from the Israeli attack on Al Arab a Hospital central the Gaza Strip uh this place has been been attacked by the Israeli air strikes uh cing till this current moment around uh 500 uh Palestinian killed uh without any prior warning uh till this number even we don't know the Identity or even the uh the future uh of the doctors and medical workers inside this Hospital even this Hospital also contains uh more than hundreds of Palestinians who have been wounded due to the Israeli earlier bombardment of the Gaza Strip the current situation inside the Gaza strp is considered to be a state of of emergency every single place in the Gaza Strip had been largely bombarded uh this hospital it has been has been bombarded without any prior warning and it contains a lot of displaced people who were evacuated from the houses in and Eastern uh areas of the in the Northern areas of the Gaza Strip uh those uh those areas those citizens those those citizens have been those citizens have been evacuated from the houses and they find that this place is a very safe shelter for them it's also important to say that those citizens did not find protection so they thought that's going to be safe uh place for them and even these hospitals have been bombarded also nine parts of nine hospitals were partially damaged due to the Israeli ongoing strikes the current situation requires an international intervention in order to afford the protection for Medical Teams and even to open humanitarian corridors in order to deliver urgent humanitarian aids to locals inside the Gaza Strip T I just want to clarify something for our viewers who've been with us for some time there are two pictures you're seeing on your screen right now the one on the left is actually alifa hospital where the injured from that other Hospital bombing are being brought we initially thought that was the other hospital and I just want to clarify that so we've been seeing a large number of injured people being brought in there on stretches and in the top right of your screen where it looks very dark that is the aftermath of the bombing what's believed to be the bombing of the Ali Arab hospital that that's in central Gaza T we know that that wasn't the only place that was bombed tonight unra the UN Refuge Agency for Palestinians um said that one of their shelters a school was also bombed and and six people were killed there what do we know about what there well uh uh and a school located in al- magazi refugee camp Central the Gaza Strip uh Central the central govern side the Gaza Strip has been bombarded with without any prior warning claiming the life of six innocent Palestinians inside this uh Place uh this place is considered to be uh an international uh shelter for uh displaced people who really evacuated from the Northern areas and Central areas of the Gaza Strip to the southern areas meanwhile this hospital this uh school has been bombarded and despite the fact that it has it is located in the in the in the central uh in the central governate which is close to the southern governate of the Gaza Strip also uh this uh facility uh must be protected by the principles of the international law because it's considered to be as a refugee Center which really can host a lot of displaced people and provide them with different kinds of humanitarian AIDS uh uh to be able to cope with the current situation Tark Abu AUM there on the ground for us in the southern Gaza Strip thank you so much TK and please do stay safe yourself we can now speak to nebba fak uh she is the spokesperson for the Palestine red present society and she joins us now on the line from rala nabal can you tell me your your reaction when you first heard about what's happening this evening and I imagine your your your teams are pretty active on the ground yes so what happened is just a genocide it's overwhelming it's heartbreaking you can't even imagine foring civilian calili who are in front of the hospital medical facility and a hospital this is a side it's a war time um more than 500 Palestinians including medical staff have been killed in this um air strike Israeli air strike many are still trying to be evacuated our teams now are responding in the ground trying to evacuate those who who have lost their Liv and trying to save as much people as as they can from those who have been injured um the situation is just in believe unbelievable you can't even imagine taring a hospital um many Palestinians the number of of this many people are asking why this number is so high because um including of these um civilians are Palestinians who have told Refugee in in front of the hospital because they thought they would be in a saf Place uh when they are in the hospital but this is not the case in Gaza this is not the case in Palestine since everything is a target for Israeli in strikes everything that means everything homes schools hospitals infrastructures medical workers roads even even places of worship have been under intense bombardment residential buildings have been raised to the ground the situation is just so unbelievable it can't be described I'm just wondering what the world is still waiting for what the world still wa all of this is just simply war crimes those civilians who were in front of the hospital were forced to leave their homes under the evacuation order they had to leave their homes because is the occupation forces as a million2 200,000 Palestinians to evacuate their homes sorry not ask FS to evacuate their homes those who are in Gaza and the north to evacuate their home to the South and since they can't afford evacuating to the C because simply there's no safy place in Gaza there's complete destruction of the infrastructure and Road there is no Transportation they can't even make it and they are forced to evacuate themselves under continuous bombardment the only available par law for them is going to a hospital thinking that they would be in a safy place but unfortunately this is not the case in Gaza until this moment we have lost at least 500 civilians including medical team um I really seem so much worried about my team I have already lost four colleagues who are paramedic they were on Beauty in Gaza trying to save people life but they have to lose their life while they were intentionally targeted I'm saying here intentionally targeted because Israeli occupation forces targeted a prcs ambulance who was uh which was on a duty trying to evacuate inured people and it was intentionally targeted the ambulance was found and all of the staff in it three colleagues were killed because of the Israeli airri our emblem is on top of the ambulance and it should be a respected emblem all over the world but it was targeted intentionally because there is no way it can't be seen it is very clear from all angles but Israel intentionally bombed our ambulance and after less than 30 minutes we had to leave another colleague who was shot directly with live ammunition and we lost four colleagues in this escalation this should be stopped we call for the International Community we already call it twice we call them to stop the evacuation order immediately we are under the risk of being bomed at any second we have received three warning from the Israeli occupation forces to evacuate Al Hospital which is in Gaza we have refused to evacuate we don't have the means to evacuate 400 patients who are some of them in the Intensive Care Unit plus 100 thousands of Palestinians who are also inside our Hospital who have to Refugee because they don't have any place to go as a humanitarian organization we can't turn about our back to our people just shut down the hospital and go and that's what we are asking the word stop turning your back to us you have you have to start doing anything just to try to pressure Israel to stop this genocide stop this loss stop this ongoing bombardment for civilians and please we call to ensure the protection of our medical missions facilities so we according to the international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention nabal fasak there nabal firstly I'm so sorry for your loss the loss of your colleagues I do want to ask you one more question you've said that you believe that you your teams and medical facilities in Gaza are being deliberately targeted by Israeli air strikes and as we know the siege meanwhile is continuing no food no fuel no water you yourself have said that the supplies are running low given the situation there do your teams have have the capacity to to respond to an incident of this magnitude 500 people dead and and obviously so many more injured so unfortunately not even our organization also all of hospitals Ina are running out of Fu which is needed to have the electricity which also extremely needed to run our ambulances this is plus the medical supplies and medicines due to the large scale of this emergency we are working on full capacity trying to save as much people as we can however it is important that the International Community world leaders to intervene immediately to stop the evacuation order that is already threatening hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are still stuck in their homes and in school without having water or having food or having electricity they simply have nothing only fear only fear of what is going next when my turn will be coming to lose my life they feel vulnerable they can't even protect themselves or protect their families the same for the hospitals like us as alot hospital we are in a continuous fear of being bombed at any moment this is the case after receiving three continuous warnings from the Israeli occupation forces to evacuate the hospital our paramedics are still on duty for the 11th day although they are under the thft of being targeted because of the Israeli warnings although they have already lost four colleagues we have recorded at least 15 different violations against our medical missions since the beginning of the escalation four were killed um five were injured one of them is in a critical injury eight of our ambulances were damaged nbal I'm I'm so so sorry for your loss and and we really do wish you all the best you and your teams all the best with your work nabal farak there the spokesperson for the Palestinian red cresant Society speaking to us from ramala thank you nabal for joining us at this very very busy time for you um I do want to remind anyone who is joining us now of what you're seeing in your screen we are watching the injured being brought into alifa hospital this is in the aftermath of what's believed to be an Israeli air strike on the atly Arab hospital that the Gaza Health Ministry says has killed at least 500 people hundreds of families were Sheltering at that hospital when that blast took place let's bring in Maran bashara he's aler a senior political analyst he joins us now from London Maran we've watched a bombardment continue now for 10 days but does something of this magnitude change the calculus here well certainly today was uh worse than anything we've seen before um the idea that a school is bombarded a hospital is bombarded apartment buildings are bombarded hundreds many hundreds of civilians die within hours that's a a Perpetual Massacre this is a massacre on a on a scale we haven't seen probably since the second world war and uh it is not uh you know more of the same uh talk about collateral damage this is not collateral damage in in a war situation the last two days we've heard from the Israeli leaders notably the Israeli president himself isak Herzog saying that there there are no innocent Palestinians in Gaza saying that they are all responsible for the attack on Southern Israel and hence this massacre does in fact uh take the shape of a genocide because there is now a stated clear intent to hurt the Palestinians they are not collateral damage killed by mistake in a bombardment of the Gaza Strip these are now targeted even the people who are fleeing for their life to the South are being bombarded clearly no one is safe in Gaza nowhere is safe in Gaza nothing is see you guys Maran we've seen well attempts at the UN Security Council for a resolution nothing's happened there there have been calls multiple calls from Human Rights organizations for some kind of a ceasefire also a humanitarian Corridor neither of those things have happened where are we at now in terms of of mediation or or some path forward does what we're seeing tonight change the political calculus potentially for members of the International Community it must of course but the International Community has proven to be impotent and indifferent in large part and clearly the part of the International Community that uh has been flexing its muscle it has been basically empowering Israel watching uh the German Chancellor today just you know wants to make you cry uh as if never again means never again to certain people not to humanity as if the Palestinians are people of a Lesser God than Jews such indifference such cynicism such hypocrisy on the part of western leaders uh this week today uh simply ignoring Palestinian Sovereign really uh you know what makes one question uh a number of things that one thought were Conant but back to your question I think I think there is a way out in the next 24 hours and and please listen carefully because this is important those who are meeting with President Biden tomorrow Palestinians jordanians and Egyptians yes they are all on the American payroll yes they are dependent on American assistance but they are also Arabs and Palestinians and instead of more backs slapping with the Secretary State they need now today in light of this massacre make their position clear we will not meet with President Biden tomorrow unless there is a ceasefire this should have been their position already before today's Massacre but now that today's massacres with hundreds perhaps more of Palestinian deads thousands of casualties within one day this definitely requires a Palestinian Arab position okay at least a Palestinian position those Palestinian officials in Aman who are getting excited about meeting the American president should take a political position a moral ethical position on the side of their people by simply saying we will only meet if you the American president put pressure on Israel that is also in the American payroll not just American payroll four plus billion dollars a year from the American taxpayers certainly the American president has leveraged with this genocidal Israeli government and I think it would be not only a huge embarrassment this will probably be the biggest setbacks of all setbacks of the past two three years if Arab leaders especially the Palestinian leader tell the American president look we cannot afford to be complicit in your supported war crimes against the Palestinian people anymore I think it's doable I think they can get away with it and I think it will put enough pressure on President Biden as he makes his long flight to Aman Jordan to reconsider and to start putting applying some pressure on the isra government to stop their Massacre against the Palestinians Maran as we watch these pictures here and we're watching pictures from alifa hospital where a lot of the injured have been taken after that blast at the Ali Arab hospital and and you and I have spoken about how the US position or the US tone on the humanitarian situation in Gaza has shifted somewhat over the last few days as we see these pictures including a huge amount of injured children and women and as we look at these numbers which we've gotten from the Palestinian Health Ministry at least 500 dead what does this mean for Biden's trip you've spoken a little bit there about what Arab leaders should be demanding of Biden what is Biden's position in going into those conversations that he's going to be having with Netanyahu he's going to be facing huge amounts of pressure at home absolutely look uh we've seen a bit of a trajectory the past few days since secretary blinkin started his uh tour of the Middle East back and forth between Arab capitals and clearly there's been some slight change in tone we are no longer talking about ethnically cleansing the Palestinians and throwing them into siai so-called humanitarian Corridor really really orwan ugly term of terming ethnic cleansing but now the Secretary of State is talking about safe Zone well that's another or willan concept that's clearly shown it itself to be today that's just another way of Israel being able to Target bombing civilians even those who are fleeing for their lives even those who are injured in hospitals even those who are looking for shelter so there is a change of tone but there isn't a real change in policy and that's the problem the American Administration knowing that the world is watching and it must be taking some initiatives aside from its unconditional support to Israel's genocidal war and it has become now truly genocidal war in Gaza they need to create the impression that they also care about human life and that they want to help with the humanitarian disaster but in in fact by giving Israel the green light K blanch unconditional support to carry on with its bombardment of Gaza they are not helping at all they're simply putting a bandaid over a cancerous policy that is leading to a continuous permanent Perpetual Massacre of a people who are basically more or less unarmed and just trying to survive Maan bashara the AL jazer senior political analyst sharing those thoughts with us from London thank you very much Maran well I want to take you to some live pictures now that we're getting out of rala as you can see thousands of people have come out onto the streets of that City and the occupied West Bank in solidarity with the people of the Gaza Strip This this has all happened in the the immediate aftermath of this blast at the atle Arab hospital where the Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 people have been killed a huge amount of emotion and a huge amount of solidarity being shared there on the streets of rala well let's now bring in Tamara al-rafi she's the spokesperson for the UN relief and works agency that looks after Palestinian refugees uh tomara thank you so much for joining us and I know what is an incredibly busy time for you Tamara I I want to get to what's happened at this Hospital in just a moment but one of your facilities an unra shelter was also bombed this evening what happened there hi and thank you so much for hosting me and hosting Ona and bringing and amplifying the voice of uh Palestinian civilians in Gaza on your on your on your screen it's very very important that we keep telling that story our initial reports the reports from my colleague at unra and Gaza are of direct Israeli fire attacks on two refugee camps in the middle area of Gaza maazi and B as a reminder around a million people moved from the north northern part of the Gaza Strip to the South to the middle and South so the middle and South areas of Gaza are incredibly packed densely populated and an attack on densely populated refugee camps where um people uh displaced people are Sheltering in un schools and un premises is something that is utterly shocking to me and to my colleagues it is a very Stark violation of international humanitarian law and I am lost for words right now about people having been displaced into was into a building that has a blue flag of the UN who left the building during that attack came back because they have nowhere else to go people are coming back to a place that came under attack Tamara is there any doubt in your mind that these facilities that were hit were clearly identified as un facilities and places of Refuge absolutely we clearly identify all our buildings and we share the uh coordinates the GPS with all the parties and we share them very very regularly because we're aware of the movement of population and we're aware that people are seeking shelters shelter in our in our in our premises in our facilities so yes affirmative all our locations are shared tomorrow how many people are we talking about who were in these shelters when they were hit this evening that particular building in the maazi camp hosts hosted 4,000 internally displaced people so these are people who either lost their homes or ran away for their lives thinking that they would be safe in a un in an HRA building and and I'm just wanting to get an understanding here you said that a lot of them have now gone back to to the site of that bombing what is the situation like there now for them I mean obviously I know supplies have been running low for some time The Siege continues is there any form of shelter left for them there is very very little for them uh in that and in many other unaa shelters unfortunately because Israel is barring the entry of fuel and water and food and medical supplies and hygiene supplies because of that total siege that Gaza has been under for now over 10 days everybody who is staying in Ona facilities Ona buildings is not getting the kind of assistance that they should be getting simply because we do not have it my colleagues are are running on a liter of water per day they are rationing the calorie intake so that whatever Food Supplies are left can be stretched to the maximum there's no fuel coming into Gaza to to enable a water desalination plant to work for us and my colleagues to get um clean drinking water and for the bakeries to use clean water to make bread it is very very very desperate in Gaza right now Tamara you've spoken there about people who were displaced a million Palestinians We Believe were displaced who followed an evacuation order from northern Gaza you said they were they they they headed south to Central and Southern Gaza we know that hundreds of those families were also taking shelter at the at the Ali Arab Hospital which was also hit tonight and and right now we're watching pictures on our screen of of people the injured people from that blast who've now been taken to another hospital uh I'm I'm just wondering your reaction to that tomorrow I mean as you say these are people who were evacuated people who were displaced people who've now been well taken any semblance of safety has been removed let me ask you for your reaction to what's happened this evening at at the AI Arab Hospital the news were shocking the news were shocking to us at unra the but the news were shocking to us as human beings to think that a hospital can be targeted with so many injured and sick people inside it but also so many civilians who are neither sick nor injured but thought that they would be safe in a hospital this is really shocking on a humanitarian and on a human level tomara Al Rafi there the spokesperson for the UN relief and works agency speaking to us from Aman in Jordan um one of their facilities well two of their facilities were also hit tonight tomorrow thank you so much for your time with us here on Al jaaz and we really wish you and your colleagues all the best with the work that you do thank you
