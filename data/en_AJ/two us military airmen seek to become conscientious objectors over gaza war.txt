now two active members of the US military are seeking resignations on conscientious grounds over American complicity in the warn Gaza Air Force personnel Larry abar and xan betancort say they can no longer be complicit in Israeli war crimes that are being aided and abetted by the country they signed up to serve us anti-war organization estimates there are at least 40 other military personnel seeking resignations on the same grounds well Larry abber a senior Airman on active duty in the United States Air Force joins us now he does not speak for the military he's speaking for himself he joins us from Rota in Spain thank you so much for your time sir how difficult was it for you to come to this decision to leave the mil military what led you to this point yeah and thank you um for me it honestly wasn't a difficult decision um me joining the military in the first place was uh partially due to I mean all of us we want to serve people uh the American people specifically obviously but um there's no um there's no serving the American people in uh in our current policies um we're doing a disservice to to people around the world and uh and I strongly feel that so that's why I had to to apply for as a conscientious objector um which has a long history in other conflicts as well as uh Vietnam and Iraq so um I'm actually proud to uh kind of you know go in the footsteps of our uh of our prior conscientious obors and at what point during the war over the course of the last eight months did you go okay I've had enough I can't do this anymore honestly really early on um I think in November I I actually learned about uh conscience Insurance objecting uh and I looked more into it and I didn't know if I would qualify or not um but the I think a lot of service members don't actually know entirely uh what it is and and uh what their rights are and so I think it's extremely important to uh highlight uh conscien conscientious uh objector and and show people like uh it that it is an option and you can take it I think a lot of service members uh feel that they they don't know what to do and and they don't know how to um how to act in this moment in in the past almost a year now um and I think this is applying for separation whether it be through contad subjection uh or another form of administrative separation um um is going to go a long way Larry apologize for interrupting but how have your superiors and colleagues re reacted to your decision to do this um well it doesn't really uh go internally I haven't really been super public with it until now um but when I have brought it up to certain people well they haven't really uh they've never either heard of the term or um so I I've had to explain what it is to people uh but yeah and what do they make of the reasons you give them that you are leaving that that you want to leave the Army uh I don't think a ton of people actually have an opinion I think uh most people are kind of focused on their own careers and their own lives um I don't think many people have an opinion either way and and what about your colleagues how how do they generally view the war in Gaza is it something that's on everyone's radar do you discuss it um discuss the US's support for Israel yeah it's sort of a taboo subject um many people won't speak on the issue because um if you I I think most people can can agree that um what is going on is wrong uh in in almost every way but uh to speak on it while in service uh is basically taboo because you'd be speaking against uh US policy um and so I think a lot of people are afraid to even touch the topic you also went on a hunger strike earlier this year which can't have been uh very easy and and presumably very difficult for those close to you what why did you make that decision um I got to a breaking point where I just didn't know what to do and um another major reason for it was uh the self imulation of Aon bushnel um and the silence afterwards of our leadership uh in the military and uh in the government uh nobody would even speak say his name uh and he was an active duty uh service member so it it was um for me a pretty easy decision to to just go straight to DC and and try to figure out um how I can help and how I can uh put my voice out there and how did how did your uh how did the Army react when you did that I believe you did it when you were on leave y so I I I took leave and I went to DC um and I tried different forms of uh protest and and other ways to help um and then uh yeah they recalled me from my leaf and sent me back after I tried to speak to the chief of staff um but ultimately it it ended up in a letter of reprimand uh which isn't a major form of punishment at all so uh I think for other people who are looking to do something uh I I wouldn't discourage anyone from uh acting in protest and you have small children I believe and uh have really been affected by some of the images you've seen from this war can you talk us through how you felt uh yeah I'm not sure how anyone can see the uh images coming out of Gaza not feel um some sort of way uh I think a lot of people may try to avoid uh looking but I I can't I feel like I can't do that as a father and as a service member um and so uh it's been disturbing to see children that look just like my own um dead and and um named in in that fashion and uh yeah again it was a very easy decision to come to this conclusion and uh and oppose what's going on really good to uh speak to you Larry I senior Airman on active duty United States Air Force thank you for
