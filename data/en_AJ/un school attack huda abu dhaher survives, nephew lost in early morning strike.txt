It is very, very difficult to wake up to the sound of rockets. Body parts are falling outside and inside the square. Gas is being fired. The children have died from the air. The street has blood like this. My nephew was martyred. His hand and leg were gone. A 10-year-old child. His mother in Egypt is suffering. Her sister is injured. Her sister is injured. What is her fault? This mother comes and cannot find anything.  She finds her son a martyr. She neither said goodbye to him nor saw him. This is not his suffering. I see children like this. This woman had an injury to her leg. Her son had a blood rash on his leg. Her mother-in-law had a bruise. There were injuries to her head, mouth, and hand. I mean, what is his fault? This is the big argument. How old is the child? This is a mustache, playing like any other child. The world is happy to learn to live in safety. We do not sleep on missiles. We live on missiles. We live in safety. In the corner of the Arab countries, we wake up on missiles and sleep on missiles. The child was neither a burden nor a burden. There is security in a school that has the safety of the home, safety, etc. Safety. Where do we want to go? Where will we be abandoned? We will not emerge steadfast in our homes no matter what. The rubble, we want to stand, and we want to remain on the rubble, no matter what happens and no matter what the Jews do to us
