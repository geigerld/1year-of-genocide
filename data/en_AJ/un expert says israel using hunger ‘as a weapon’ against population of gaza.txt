Aid agencies are warning of an increasing risk of famine in Gaza with more than 90% of the population now deemed to be at least at a crisis level now that's the third phase of the ipc's global food and security scale with phase five classified as famine that level is already being experienced by a quarter of the population in Northern Gaza the others there also fall into emergency or crisis levels of food insecurity 15% of internally displaced people in Gaza are already and famine nearly half are estimated to be experiencing emergency levels of hunger huge amounts now in the South 15% of people are living in stressed levels of food insecurity that's the second phase on the scale the rest are experiencing crisis emergency or famine levels of hunger well let's bring in Michael faky he's the UN special rapporter on the right to food and a professor of law at Oregon University he joins us now from Eugene in Oregon Michael this word famine it's obviously a technical term it has very specific connotations so a certain proportion of children for instance need to be dying in order for it to be used we know that that is now happening in parts of Gaza but I wonder if if a technical threshold like this can be a bit of a distraction I mean this is a graded scale right the level of starvation below famine is still profound thank you Nastasia no I think you're quite right in terms of of course there's a technical definition it measures the number of people affected uh about one it looks for one out of three children uh being acutely malnourished um but ultimately what famine means is an a significant increase of rate of people dying from hunger and malnutrition and the challenge is how do you measure that in the midst of a war yeah so what we're hearing is yes there's a significant risk of famine but now I'm wondering are we actually in a famine it's unclear so what is clear is that all children under the age of five in Gaza so that's 335 children are not getting enough nutrition that means they're all at the risk of permanent physical and cognitive impairment what doctors call stunting their future is at stake Michael I want to talk about the speed and the scale of this we keep hearing the word unprecedented but I wonder if you can help us put this in context there have been famines declared in places like Somalia Yemen Ethiopia that got a lot of publicity how does this compare right and I'm always careful not to compare different famines every catastrophe and every atrocity is its own has its own Dynamic the what's what's unique about this one has been the speed and how complete we've never seen 2.2 million civilians made to go hungry within weeks so we've never seen this degree of hunger used as a weapon so quickly and so completely uh uh ever Michael you you said it's being used as a weapon so the pattern of Israeli attack the borrowing of food Aid in your mind that tells us about the intent here well exactly to understand how did this happen so quickly it doesn't happen by chance starvation wherever it happens is always the result of political choices and this is the same case here so first Israel declared a Siege on October 9th and immediately imple implemented a Siege now which meant they blocked all food water fuel and medicine to civilians now we're seeing a ickle of humanitarian relief make its way in but what we're hearing from un agencies is that uh humanitarian relief is not reaching most of Gaza so it's not enough so the current Siege is one cause but this is also an ongoing problem there was a 16year blockade before this so even before the war half of people in Gaza were food insecure and 80% depended on Aid so already Israel made the situation precarious through um through a blockade then it imposes a Siege during the war then it destroys civilian infrastructure so Israel has destroyed hospitals homes roads um making everyday life impossible and finally what I'm receiving reports is the destruction of the food system itself meaning Israel has destroyed approximately 22% of agricultural land it's destroyed 70% of fishing boats and has denied Fishers access to the Sea so even if uh Gaz gazin wanted to feed themselves Israel is destroying their food system so you put all of these combined this is why we we're seeing this risk of famine happen so quickly Michael from what you're were saying it sounds like you believe that this is systematic we've also seen the destruction of farms and attacks on farmers in the occupied West Bank what in your mind is Israel's aim here I mean their declared aim has been to push out Palestinians out of Gaza they've said as much in in black and white terms they've used dehumanizing language they've called the Palestinian people animals and they've targeted civilians simply because they're Palestinian um so and their aim is again from what we keep hearing and in black and white terms this is not reading between the line lines it sounds like to occupy Gaza even more and to push out Palestinians as much as possible Michael you are the UN special rapporter on the right to food what can the UN do right now other than ask Israel to let more food in I mean through formal channels we've seen everything we've seen the security Council we've seen the Secretary General we've seen the general assembly we've yet to hear from the Human Rights Council before we turn to the UN I think people on the streets have the answer millions of people are Marching In the Streets demanding an end to the war and immediate humanitarian relief it's now time for the governments to work together through the US and to put real pressure on Israel its allies have done nothing to prevent this this risk of famine and this risk of genocide so now it's time for people to continue pressuring their governments and for governments to economically pressure Israel to diplomatically pressure Israel and politically pressure Israel to stop uh um uh this famine we've spoken a lot here Michael about intent as many Aid agencies have pointed out the use of starvation as a weapon of war is a war crime so what sort of accountability can there be will there be I to call it a war crime in legal terms what that means is to we can try and hold individuals accountable through international criminal courts through International court of justice through National courts the problem of focusing on International laws of war is it's often after the fact after the fighting ends and it goes after individuals and it still allows the laws of war still allow for killing of people and Israel will make the argument that it is out of military necessity that it is starving people and that's a legal argument it's allowed to make now time will tell whether that is factually true or not um but I think what's actually more important to frame it back as a human rights concern there's a risk of genocide and we've seen genocide actually unfolding and there's no exception to genocide there's no exception to targeting and killing Palestinians simply because they're Palestinian Michael fakri there the UN special rapporter on the right to food thank you so much for joining us on Al jaer sir thank you very much
