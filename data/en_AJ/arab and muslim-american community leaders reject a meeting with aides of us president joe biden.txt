29 leaders of Arab and Muslim American Community groups have rejected a meeting with White House officials they say they're taking a stand in response to US policies on Gaza and have criticized President Joe Biden's support of Israel the meeting was scheduled in Chicago for Thursday so joining us live from Chicago there's TK KH he's an attorney activist and board member in the Chicago chapter of American Muslims for Palestines tar welcome to Al jaer so you were invited to this Biden meeting this white house meeting and you declined why did you do so a host of organizations were invited a Chicago being uh one of them our uh rejection and opposition to this meeting is laid out in our letter that I helped uh spearhead and the the the basic undertone and the basic uh message is fairly simple we met multiple times there's been many meetings and the demands have been made abundantly clear to this Administration time and time again and and the Biden Administration has rejected those uh calls has rejected those demands so now Biden Administration um reached out to meet to discuss what exactly um there was there is no meeting of the minds so why meet um you know exactly what the demands are you know what is happening on the ground there's no new information there's not a single piece of information that I can provide that we can provide to the Biden Administration that they don't already know don't you think this would have been a good opportunity to a your grievances on what what would have been a public platform or do you think it would have just been used by uh the administration as a pH all well the demands that um have been have been made time and time again is essentially essentially would have been the same demands that would have been made at that meeting so why do we keep regurgitating the same talking points the same demands when the administration is obviously not responding to it now any type of measure that the administration takes to quote unquote try to alleviate this the situation or increase humanitarian Aid the bid Administration can end this right now with one phone call that's all it takes one phone call we provide Israel with uh us-made weapons we provide Israel with financial aid we're the ones that protect Israel at the United Nations we provide diplomatic cover so Biden could end all of this in one hour if he truly wanted to so you want to schedule another meeting with local leaders in the Chicago land area to discuss what exactly the very thing that we've been demanding all along which is a permanent and immediate ceasefire so you want to meet fine we will condition a meeting on the call for a ceasefire not have another meeting to demand it again if you don't meet President Biden and White House officials what weight can these American Muslim groups bring to bear on the administration and their position uh on Gaza which does seem to be shifting a bit doesn't it diplomatically well I mean because because of the immense pressure that has been put on the administration but that doesn't mean that there's a moral calculus here the political calculus is okay maybe we need to start maybe we need to provide some kind of trickling of Aid which is what this uh what this temporary mechanism this this temporary report is essentially uh for it's it's to it's to Showcase to the world and to the American people that hey you know we're doing something about it but you could do something much greater than that and in a quicker time frame this port will take about 60 to 90 days to to put together to facilitate aid while you're providing that same the same entity that's committing a genocide in Gaz with more weapons so you want to play the role of firefighter as well as arsonist at the same time that contradictory policy will not fly with the leadership here in Chicago the administration is not been entirely one way on this the vice president Cara Harris has been calling for ceasefire okay well let's take a look at her words she called for a temporary ceasefire and a temporary ceasefire means hey let's bring back the uh let's let's make this a focus on the hostages as opposed to the destruction and the slaughter of the Palestinian people in Gaz so a temporary ceasefire so that we can fulfill one one aspect of it and then Israel can resume its bombing campaign and it's genocidal acts after that it was never a call for a permanent and immediate ceasefire that's been the call that's been the demand for five plus months and the Biden Administration can effectuate that with one simple phone call and he refuses to do so so meet for what it's counterintuitive it's counterproductive and I view it as a net negative and we as a community as a leadership Community as a collective view it as a net negative as opposed to a net positive what do you make of the US efforts to uh get Aid into Gaza it's just another cynical move Aid so you want to provide the people of Band-Aids while also carrying an axe in the other hand that kind of uh contradictory policy we see right through it so at all the while you provide Israel with the necessary means with us-made weapons to commit a genocide the the first Liv stream genocide in the history of the world and at the same time you want to trickle down Aid as well so you want to heal the wounds but cause greater wounds at the same time that kind of policy is not based on any kind of moralistic grounding that's not based on a principal stance that's based on some type of political expediency and political posturing and we as a leadership Community are not falling for it TK Hal from the Chicago chapter of American Muslims for Palestine thank you thank you for your time
