but life across some parts of the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem has come to a standstill Palestinians are closing their shops pharmacies bakeries and solidarity with people in Gaza they're demanding an immediate ceasefire and want countries around the world to put more pressure on Israel to stop its indiscriminate attacks Alan fiser reports from occupied East Jerusalem normally this would be one of the busiest streets in East Jerusalem the traffic is normally bumper to bumper on the pavement on the sidewalk walk Well normally people are walking three or four across it's very hard to move here very easily but today it's a lot different and why is that because there's a general strike you see that the shutters are down on all the stores from the sport shop to the accessory store to the cafe to the phone shop all of them closed today now we've been speaking to some of the shop owners they say it's a small sacrifice to make to make a stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza it's estimated they'll lose around 600 $ a day today some more some less but they think it's important to make the point that they want to see an end to the war in Gaza and we spoken to the people who would normally shop here and they're being slightly inconvenienced but they're watching what's happening in Gaza from a distance and they feel helpless that they can do nothing so this is something tangible something they feel that is showing a measure of support for the people who are Under Fire in Gaza and it's not just here in the occupied in occupied Jerusalem it's also happening in the occupied West Bank and internationally as well we're hearing reports of stores being closed in am man in Jordan and also in Beirut and Lebanon all showing Global support for the people in Gaza now will it make much of an impact in Jerusalem it'll hit the economy slightly because just look all of these stores are closed in The Wider Israeli economy it'll have some impact but remember the Israeli economy is struggling anyway because of the cost of the war and globally well there'll be a ripple but but not much but that's not what's important what's important is people here are sending a message it may not be very loud but they think it's very important to say they want to see an end to the war in Gaza and they want to see it end soon Alan Fischer Al jazer in occupied East Jerusalem let's speak now to Zan basari he's joining us live from rala in the occupied West Bank and zann you were at a demonstration earlier in rala where people were showing their solidarity with those in Gaza what were they telling you well the day here in ramala and the occupied West Bank started very slow for a Monday it is the beginning of the week and the stores were all shuttered schools were closed no students were attending University classes all in solidarity with this National strike that organizers hope goes Global a strike in in solidarity with the Palestinians of Gaza calling for a ceasefire now in the Square just behind me there was for a few hours this afternoon it became a hub of activity once again normally from dawn to dusk it is packed and crowded here in the heart of romala the seat of the Palestinian Authority but today we only saw a few hours of activity this afternoon when protesters came out and they were chanting all kinds of slogans in in calling for an end to the war calling for an immediate ceasefire critical of their own government of President Muhammed Abbas for not doing more not being able to do more anti-israeli chance uh even taunting them at times saying that we will die so that Palestine can live load your bullets in the barrel and shoot at us we don't care about our death so a a great deal of defiance from Palestinians here living in the occupied West Bank and this economic disruption for a day it was disruptive but it was also festive it was certainly a family affair uh protesters were out uh with their children kids were painting a canvas on the on the road uh decorating it with Palestinian Flags uh messages of love to the Palestinians of Gaza that are still going through Israeli bombardment there was a large poster of the faces of children thousands of whom have been killed since the war on Gaza began since the Israeli carpet bombing of that area began so a great deal of support of solidarity with their fellow Palestinians in Gaza and people were telling us that is the least they can do to shutter their shops for a day and stand up in the face of this ongoing Israeli aggression and often times they say it is the only thing they can do Palestinians know that they cannot raise a military to rival israels they do not have the back in support of a military political and economic Powerhouse like the United States they don't have any sort of big government at their back they were telling us that all that they can do is continue to raise their voice in hope that the International Community hears their calls for a ceasefire now their calls for an end to the war in Gaza there are calls for freedom from an occupation that has been going on for decades now 75 years three4 of a century zann thank you very much for that that zann basav joining us live from rala in the occupied West Bank
