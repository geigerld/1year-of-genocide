hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question why have American evangelicals become Israel's strongest backers let's get to the bottom [Music] line throughout the war in Gaza and for decades before that American evangelicals have been some of the most powerful voices for Israel and that's saying a lot 30% of Americans describe themselves as evangelicals conservative Christians are the backbone of the Republican party's support for Israel and they dve the national debates on abortion on immigration on education and even race they believe that God made a promise to the Jewish people designating Palestine as their Homeland and they see the creation of Israel in 1948 as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy this idea known as Christian Zionism can be traced back for centuries so with all the weight that conservative Christians have in the US how much of these ideas are driving American policy on the Middle East and is the catastrophic War waged by Israel over the past few months mon in Gaza sparking a debate among Christian churches in the country today we're talking with Jonathan katab co-founder of the Palestinian Human Rights group Al Hawk board member of Bethlehem Bible College and author of beyond the two-state solution Jonathan thanks so much for joining us I have to admit this terrain is one that I don't often talk about which is you know the religious dimensions of conflict and National interest tell us what we should know about Christian Zionism well Christian Zionism is is an old phenomena uh and there are different kinds of Christian zionists but the broad uh thread that connects them all together is a uh a political position on Zionism in Israel based on some interpretations of scripture uh some of them are really far out uh some of them believe that it's the duty of Christians to support Israel uh because that helps the Jesus come back again the second coming it's tied into their interpretation of prophecies and end times you may have heard about the Left Behind series or the late great planet Earth these are very popular sensationalized uh expressions of Christian Zionism that says that the end of the world is near uh the creation of the state of Israel is a harbinger of the second coming of Christ and that somehow Christians are supposed to support uh this uh state of Israel uh as as part of God's plan uh for the world now not all Christian zist believe that what do what they do believe is that somehow it's the duty of Christians to support the in gathering of the Jews uh and to support the state of Israel they take one uh verse in scripture in Genesis where God says uh to Abraham I will bless those who bless thee and curse those who curse thee through your seed will all the nations of the world be blessed so people say we need the blessing we want the blessing uh so we want to support the state of Israel because that's the way to obtain God's blessing the problem of course is that this is a totally false interpretation of scripture because the New Testament says that the seed of Israel is used in the singular who is Christ it is through Christ that all the nations of the world are blessed and not through Netanyahu or the state of Israel I find it interesting because I think this is a a certain strain of the Evangelical movement that has that that talks about the conflict that's unfolded today almost in holy war terms which we haven't seen with political power but this does have political power yes this is really a very fascinating thing uh and it doesn't only apply to Christian zionists uh the state of Israel and the Zionist movement has actually sought the support of well known anti-semites as long as they are politically in their corner like uh hungary's Orban for example um like President Trump uh people who are bigoted anti-semitic who hate Jews but who are willing to support the state of Israel are welcomed by Netanyahu and his elk and John HEI is a perfect example uh in his theology he actually very anti-semitic at one time he says God doesn't even answer the prayers of Jews uh but but the this uh strange political wedding between anti-semites and the Zionist movement is also available for Christian zionists you can you can hate Jews you can think that they are uh you know God is going to curse them uh very recently I heard about a uh Pastor in a big mega church uh we were trying to ask them to pray for the children of Gaza and he says no no no no I don't want to do that I don't want us to create trouble because you see I believe in the prophecy all these Jews are going to gather there and then with a big smirk on his face says they're all going to die because Armageddon they're all gonna be destroyed except for those who accept Jesus Christ as their savior so this guy who really doesn't like Jews who thinks they're all going going to be destroyed is still going to politically support Zionism in the state of Israel not because he really loves Jews or cares about them but because it fits in his Twisted theology well I'm want to ask you in a moment Jonathan about hamas's ideology just to you know be fair and talk about different corners of this equation but um another puzzle piece in this confusing for me anyway is that the ambassador of Israel to United Nations gilad um eron actually went to the Cornerstone Church went to um Texas where where John haggy is based and um uh Christians United for Israel are are are based and and he made the following statement he says Hamas ideology is the same as that of Isis Al-Qaeda and the Ayatollah regime in Iran does it worry you to see a leading Statesmen from Israel serving in the United Nations allied with uh John haggy and this uh Christians United for Israel well uh let's be very clear I am not an apologist for Hamas uh their uh philosophy their ideology is islamist but it's a much more mild form of islamist certainly not Isis uh they certainly like the appeal of religion and I think one must realize that with the failure of Arab nationalism throughout the Middle East uh there is greater uh interest in an Islamic uh form of politics but Islam is such a broad spectrum it's it's like Christianity you can be a Christian Marxist you can be a Christian uh Sufi you can be a Christian Mystic you can be a Christian liberal or a Christian conservative or a Christian radical so Islam is a very broad uh thing it's not monolithic and frankly at least the people that I know from Hamas are quite mild quite moderate quite uh some of them are progressive there are some crazies of course uh but but then you find that in every religion and in every political movement uh I I think the Hamas leaders have made it clear that they are willing to accept a sort of long-term Hood now with Israel that they are willing to work with uh the PLO and the fat and the nationalists uh they are uh more religious in their uh political Doctrine but but they're not crazy fundamentalists they certainly are not uh like Isis and they have been very protective actually of the tiny Christian minority in Gaza throughout the years a lot of the rise of Hamas was because people were very disgruntled with fat and the Palestinian Authority who are very corrupt and inefficient at best and at worst they were serving the occupation and collaborating with it and sort of controlling its people as subcontractors for the Israeli occupation so of course people would reject that uh and and and would would go to lean towards a more religious outcome and and you have to understand uh people in Palestine and throughout the Middle East are religious but it's a mild kind of religion it's a deep faith that ultimately God is in control you see people living in calamities and raising their hands up and says God look what's happening to us we look to you for salvation so there is always going to be a religious component uh to people's uh views on politics and everything else the question is what kind of religion is it a moderate or is it an intolerant fanatical religion uh and and my at least my own uh experience with ham that it's a rather moderate form of uh Islam it's it's like almost like the Muslim Brotherhood uh rather than like Isis I'm not saying the Christian Zionist group in America is all power powerful but it does have power the the US um Embassy in Israel did move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in part because of this movement so there is muscle there and I'm interested in your study of this group gr and to what degree they see Palestine in in a future that may be more just more fair to both sides frankly well the Christian Zionist movement doesn't at all deal with the Palestinians uh for them the Palestinians either non-existent or they're the enemies of God because they're the enemies of the state of Israel uh I find that the appeal for Christian Zionism is very Broad but it's very thin it's not very deep it's not as fundamental to their identity as issues like abortion for example or homosexuality for them support for Israel is like a default position that they haven't thought much about because they were never really asked or questioned or challenged on it it's it's it's a default position my my uh interaction with Christian Zionist has been that they are very shallow they don't really know the facts for them it's just a given that Israel because they read about Israel in the Bible and they equate the Israel of the Bible with the modern day state of Israel they equate the Palestinians with the Philistines that were being frankly ethnically cleansed uh by the Hebrew tribes in the Old Testament they sort of jump over 2,000 years of history and they jump over most of the New Testament so when you sit with them and to talk to them and you quote the Bible to them uh they are very liable to change their positions but you have to talk to them in biblical terms you have to quote scripture to them you can't quote to them international law what do they care you can't quote to them the dangers of World War I they say bring it on that's the end times that's the second coming that's wonderful you have to talk to them about Christ's love Christ's compassion uh Christ being the Prince of Peace uh Christ being open to everybody uh to Salvation for God so loved the world not just the Jewish tribe that he gave his only begotten son so whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life right when you talk in that language to many Christian zionists they say h we never thought about that maybe you're right maybe there is room for us to talk and to discuss uh the problem is that most people who who oppose Christian Zionism uh don't use that language instead they say you know you're crazy you you uh we can't live our lives we can't run our politics based on what you say because it's destructive and they say Okay destructive it is this is what we believe this is what the Bible teaches uh God said it I believe it that settles it right what is your sense Jonathan of how much this may affect President Biden's view of the situation you know Biden is not a Christian Zionist he is a Catholic Christian who is a believer in Zionism but we should not merge those two together but how do you feel Joe Biden is influenced by this Conservative Christian framing I think less so than for example somebody like Michael Pence or Pompeo from the old Administration they were evangelicals and they were Christian zionists uh I think Biden is more of a politician uh I don't think his Christian faith really is involved too much in in in his politics he is a Catholic as you uh mentioned and the pope has been very clear about what uh the Bible what Christians uh really need to do about uh the current crisis in Gaza uh so I'm not I don't think uh uh Biden is himself a Christian zionists you find more Christian Zionist among white evang angical uh who tend to be more Republican uh than Democratic so Christian Zionism is a phenomena more closely allied with the Republican rightwing uh politicians uh but but there are people who are manipulative these are politicians they don't really care they don't really believe that's not what motivates them rather it's in interests one of the reminders to for many Americans and many around the world that there are Palestinian Christians was a horrible incident in which a mother and daughter um were shot by um Israeli snipers while they were seeking refuge in a church uh in Gaza would love to hear about Palestinian Christians and their view of this their differences with the American Christian Community if there are I mean I'd love to kind of see where they are are on the map how important are they in this equation right now which is which is horrible but they are there you're one of them well Palestinian Christians have always been an integral part of the Palestinian national movement uh from the days of George habash to the days of uh George Antonius even before that one of the creators of the pan Arab nationalist movement mement uh so so Christians have always been part of the Palestinian nationalist movement both because of their commitment as Palestinians but also because of their uh belief in separation of church and States we say the Homeland belongs to everybody but my religion belongs to God it's between me and God what will it take uh with your work and others to elevate the notion that nonviolent movements non-violent protest and resistance may be a better answer while we're in the you know horrors of War right now I think what it takes is a few victories uh Palestinians generally are not a very militant people we have very militant vocabulary we talk uh Blood and Guts and power and and right rles but actually most of the Palestinian political movement from the 30s to this day has been boycotts uh appeals to the United Nations protests organizing negotiations Alternative forms hunger strikes for prisoners most of our activism has been nonviolent but it has not used a nonviolent rhetoric we have used a very violent rhetoric armed struggle the gun will speak uh no voice shall be raised above the voice of the gun uh but but in in in actual practice we haven't been uh very violent in our struggle with Zionism we have been largely nonviolent but we haven't used the rhetoric the language of nonviolence I mean until the BDS movement which sort of in an organized ized fashion triy to use nonviolence but we've had the great March of return in Gaza we have almost daily activities of nonviolence in the West Bank protests strikes uh hunger strikes fasting raising slogans raising the flag even getting shot for raising the flag uh working on human rights documentation uh we have been re very active in nonviolence but we haven't usually used the language of nonviolence we we have used the language of armed struggle uh sometimes very bloody violent we will make the ground burn under the feet of the occupiers very violent language but but our activities have been largely nonviolent what does your gut tell you about where this conflict is going well see two things happened on October 7th one of them was military the attacks of Hamas were first military they breached the wall they attacked soldiers they attacked military install installations they took over a number of army bases uh they killed about 300 soldiers and captured many that was a military operation nobody talks about it they also attacked civilians and took civilians hostages that was wrong that was a war crime in many cases taking hostages civilian hostages was was illegal under international law everybody concentrates on that portion of what happened in October 7 uh rather than the military aspect and and I think many Palestinians were fascinated with the military aspects here comes a group that actually breached the wall we tried non-violently to approach the wall and the snipers killed 62 of us in one day 62 unarmed Palestinians walking towards the wall were each killed by snipers in one day uh so that uh people uh were attracted Ed to the military aspects of armed struggle which Hamas Illustrated that even under the very difficult circumstances of Siege uh they were able to do something uh militarily so in that sense it it really helped uh shift the balance of power which was so totally in favor of Israel it it it created a little bit of a uh I wouldn't say parity but a little bit it Shrunk the gap between Palestinians and Israelis on the other hand it really increased the fears and the traumas of Israelis uh and so therefore their reaction was just massive uh genocidal I mean they they really went all out to try and recreate the deterrent but they will never be able to succeed in that in in that aspect they will never be able to restore the deterrence restore the element of fear that's not going to happen well we'll have to leave it there thank you so much for joining us Palestinian human rights lawyer Jonathan katab co-founder of the Palestinian Human Rights group Al Hawk really appreciate your cander thank you very much so what's the bottom line Evangelical Christians are Major Force in societies around the world but the truth is they've helped supplant functioning multi-ethnic multifaith communities around the world with sectarian divisions and religion infused intolerance in Israel the Jewish people have support of many evangelicals because of the role Jews play in the Old Testament of the Bible they sort of see the Jewish people as part of their own story and conservative Christianity brings their political strength to Israel's cause particularly today in this war on Gaza there's just no doubt that religion is a driver on both sides of the Palestine Israel issue and all political issues but the aspects of Tolerance and empathy that are part of all religions are getting drowned out by sectarianism and hate the belief that one religion will ultimately Prevail above the others that's dangerous and it makes it much harder to have discussions on how to bring Justice and Better Lives to both Palestine and Israel and that's the bottom line
