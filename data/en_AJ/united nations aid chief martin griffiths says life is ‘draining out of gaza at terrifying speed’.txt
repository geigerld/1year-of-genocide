let's bring in Omar sure uh Omar is a professor of security and Military studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies Omar something that the UN said when they reacted to the killing of of of of these Palestinians waiting for food yesterday was they said we can't we we didn't deliver that Aid because we can't deliver any Aid to Northern Gaza because deconfliction doesn't work anymore I need you to explain to our viewers what that is deconfliction what it means and what it means that it's not working so deconfliction cells is a coordinating is a coordination form ideally between the two combating sides so between shall we say the Palestinian resistance on one end and the IDF on the other and they will have a communication line and they will coordinate where the fighting should be and when there's some form of humanitarian assistance going on they will communicate to be able to organize this so there are no accidents no shooting by accidents no misunderstandings no abuse use of the humanitarian corridors and the humanitarian um uh supplies for one side or the other um but since this cannot happen then there should be uh some some form of mediators usually with a third side since there's no third side uh uh realistically and there's a complete mistrust between the IDF and and the Palestinian resistance so what we what we're seeing is and what we should expect actually is uh more and more um possible war crimes or accidents whichever way you want to put it uh but very uh very serious when you don't have these type of deconfliction cells so this would be the UN deconflict around delivery of Aid would be the UN saying we're sending in trucks we're sending in trucks to this place this location at that time this is what it will look like don't attack this area at that time is that right uh don't attack this area that's one but also protect this area and try to and try to organize how this Aid is going to be delivered whether from the areas where the uh the IDF is in control War where where Hamas is in control so ideally it should be a commanders on local commanders uh localized commanders in these two in in this specific area whether I don't know bate commanders or or hire on the IDF side or from Hamas side some of the Battalion commanders and they would be actually talking or having a representative talking to the uh the UN or whatever human when the UN says deconfliction we can't bring Aid because deconfliction doesn't work in the past there there their aid convoys haven't been attacked by Hamas right un agencies have never said well Hamas has attacked our Aid convoys that's why we're not going they've said our Aid convoys have been attacked by the Israeli military and that's why we're not going yeah um so when they say deconfliction isn't working that means they can't secure commitment for the is from the Israeli military to not attack Aid that's uh that it looks like so it looks like so because so far the shall we say the areas or the apparent control in in these areas is by the IDF and therefore they have the upper end in in in these areas and therefore they're more and more responsible uh and they are also the occupation Force so they they have more and more responsibilities in these areas to provide security for the humanitarian aid but combat is chaotic you know you can have accidents that you don't expect so that's why it's very important to have the these type of either uh mediator Le deconfliction cells or deconfliction cells by representatives from the from from both sides but but can I point out you say you say combat is chaotic and I understand that of course I think all our viewers can understand that but what Aid agencies delivering Aid to Northern Gaza have said recently has not been oh we were caught in crossfire or we got caught in the middle of a gunfight it what they've said is our Convoy has been attacked some have said it was deliberate others didn't go there but they've said it was attacked by the Israeli military it doesn't sound like they're getting caught in crossfire yeah it it could I mean it could be we need more to know more and more about the details of what happened it could be um you cannot yesterday there was okay so to bring it to yesterday there was no Crossfire involved yesterday even the Israeli military never said we were fighting Hamas in that area they said we felt threatened and that's why we opened fire yeah it's Hamas maybe Hamas is not even there this is part of the issue you know the the the chaos here can can come from uh a a miscalculation by a shall we say a battalion commander on the in the IDF side that decides that well this is a threat and I'm going to act on it or um on the other side someone decides that okay the Israelis are attacking so I'm going to use this situation to fight back and and then chaos happens so it could be a miscalculations that's why you have you need to have a bit of a higher up in terms of the command and control structures either talking to each other or talking to a mediator and there needs to be a minimum of trust it's a very fleeting trust it's a it's just a trust to deliver some aid for population that is starving and it needs this Aid desperately so it needs to this very very short window of opportunity to be able to deliver that and it and it needs to be organized and that's why it's called the confliction everybody has them in in most conflicts that I know of they were there even in in some of the very the most intense ones uh they were there sometimes they were they are abused um okay no no denial about that but and sometimes they fail and that can be one of the reifications but they are very very necessary they're not sufficient but they're the has said that that it it seems at least that the trust no we know the trust is completely broken down because the UN is saying deconfliction is not working Omar Shore thank you so much for explaining that to our viewers this hour thank you
