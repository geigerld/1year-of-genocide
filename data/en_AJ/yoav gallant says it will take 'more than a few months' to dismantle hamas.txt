Israeli Minister of Defense of Galant says that it'll take a few more months to dismantle Hamas in a meeting with the US National Security adviser Dr Sullivan Galant stressed that Israel's operations in Gaza were going to be a long War Bennett Smith joins us now from uh Tel Aviv obviously a great deal to discuss uh by Mr Sullivan uh and those meetings with Israeli officials and a great deal to listen to as well for both sides well Jake Sullivan has been is carrying a message from Joe Biden the US president has weathered enormous International criticism over his continued unwavering support for Israel and its prosecution of its war against Hamas and Biden has rein restated his commitment to Israel says the US will continue to support Israel but he's warned that public opinion could shift in grave ways for Israel's security and Sullivan is carrying that message to the Israeli government he said before he left the US Jake Sullivan said that he would be discussing a timetable with the Israeli leadership on uh to end the war and he urged urged Israel's leaders to move to a different phrase from the kind of high intensity operations we're seeing now so he's been having those meetings with Israel's leadership we understand he's probably still in a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu but he's not getting much enthusiasm for this idea of a timetable the Israelis have not suggested that they are committing to a particular fixed timetable you heard uh Galant say just before to Sullivan that you know this is going to take many more than just a few months Hamas has spent years building up its capabilities and it's going to take us a long time to combat Hamas in the way that we want to great deal of speculation and talk Bernard about what's going on within the war cabinet and how to move forward either with oper operations or with mediation what more are you hearing about this well we know that the families of the captives are very frustrated they are not hearing anything about negotiations at the moment they've said uh a statement earlier on today that they feel the government is playing Russian roulette and they want an update due to the Fatal freeze in talks well it seems that the war cam is in agreement that there's no point in the mosad head traveling to Kata at the moment because Israel's war cabinet believes hamas's leadership in Gaza has lost touch with lost contact with hamas's leadership in Doha so there's no point going to Doha because there's no way of finding out what's ham what Hamas wants the difference we think in the war cabinet is that uh Benny Gant wants the cateres to in the meanwhile proactively try and find out uh what what Hamas wants while Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense minister they prefer to take a passive approach to wait and see what Hamas comes up with benett Smith Force there with that update from telie thank you
