we've been reporting the second exchange of Hamas captives for Palestinian prisoners hit a snag late on Saturday here are some of the sticking points that led to a delay of several hours Hamas accuses Israel of violating the agreed upon no fly zone over Southern Gaza Israeli drones are also not allowed in the Skies over the north between 10:00 a.m. and 400 p.m. local time Hamas says humanitarian Aid deliveries have fallen short of what was promised and that the aid is not getting into Northern Gaza Israel denies this saying more than 50 trucks have entered the north hamas's armed Wing the cassam brigades says Palestinian prisoners are not being released according to seniority that means according to how long they've been detained as was agreed also some of the women and children involved in the swap were just weeks away from finishing their sentences we can speak to gazi hammad you are a member of the Hamas political Bureau based on what happened yesterday both the the snag as we've just described it uh in releasing the Israeli captives and then the flurry of diplomacy and then the actual release of the captives based on all of that do you think that Hamas is going to release more captives today look first of all we are we are committed to the agreement and we respect the agreement and we have no problem to to to continue and to fulfill our commitment uh but I think we discovered in the last two days that Israel they manipulating with the different things and and they have many violation in the in the agreement regarding shooting people in the ground in the time of the truce in the changing the names of the prison Palestinian prisoners in the the movement of the air jets in Gaza Strip many things I think we told them about this violations but yesterday I think we were surprised that very few trucks reach North Gaza you know situation that is very critical very hard people are suffering from starvation and we we ask him now to move more trucks at least 200 trucks for people there especially for food and U medicine and other things but we were shook that just three trucks reach reach G and yesterday so sorry if I can jump in the UN let's address these issues one after the other the UN says that 61 trucks of aid went into Northern Gaza Saturday is that enough for you do you have a threshold do you have a number that you have required a number of trucks or a volume of Aid that Hamas has required must reach the northern part of Gaza the agreement says that at least at least 200 trucks uh must move from the Egyptian side to the palestin side and we at least most of them will reach must reach the North uh in the first day about the three trucks and this was a big surprise big shock for us and yesterday only 61 you in the north of Gaza we have more than 600,000 people about maybe 200,000 people in the uh displaced regions or or places so we need more more more tracks to move there is there a number have you put a number on the amount of Aid that needs I think it is it is we talk to the H and different parts that there is possibility to send more and more tracks to the north there is no limitation for this but I think U we were surprised that only 62 or 61 TRS only reach the north of Gaza uh today we want we put more guarantees because yesterday we have strong contacts with the Egyptians with the country with different parts with the United Nation in order to take guarantees that today that 200 trucks must Reach people there and if not I think we will take other other other measures because they must respect what does that mean what does that mean other measures what happened yesterday we delay we stop the the implementation of the process it take more time but I think today I think we want to be sure 100% that that trucks will reach so right now it's almost 12:30 Gaza time as as far as things are going today do you see any reason anything that would cause Hamas to once again suspend or even stop the release of captives on day three of this ceasefire look we are interested to complete this process we have no problem we respect our commitments and we want to continue we had put good condition every day with the country with the Egyptians with the United Nations with all people and we are very interested to to to continue and to to finish this process but I think the manipulation and the playing is coming from the Israel side in different things as I mentioned before so I think that today we want to continue we prepare everything today but it depends on what happened especially in the the trucks which reach in the North or according to our list which sent to the different to the mediators regarding the the names of the prisoners women children let's talk about that because h provides a list sir let's talk about the names of the Palestinian prisoners that Hamas wants to see released because Hamas provides a list of the captives that it releases right and that list is provided to the mediators and then to Israel before captives are released so very early this morning Israel said that it got the list of captives that Hamas is scheduled to release today I'm wondering whether the same thing is happening on on the other side meaning do you receive do you vet do you approve a list of palestin prisoners to be released each day look I don't want to go in in more details but I think we have a clear mechanism regarding the list the list of the hostages when we receive it when we send it to the mediators we have contact with the icrc I think there is a there is a complete process clear process uh and I think that we respect this is yesterday and before that and today I think we'll move in the same same ways the same method but we need the Israeli side now to respect the agreement and not to change in the list of the names of the children or the women this is what what caused the problem to to to drop and to to make people here angry or upset about the behavior of the Israel side but as I said now we are walking day and night in order to pray everything to be clear what kind of prisoners what kind of prisoners do you want to see Israel release I think we have we have already we have list we have list we we have list of the 300 prisoners including children and women and I think now that the mediators they have this list we need them to release from this list now but sometimes they they bring some people from out of the list and this is not accepted by by Hamas you know after its attack on October 7th Hamas said that it had enough captives to release all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails since then Israel arrested 3,145 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank that means there are now far more Palestinians in Israeli jails than there were before hamas's attacks your thoughts on that look I think this is our our main job of even from the operationa is to release all the prison prisoners and in the detes in the Israel Detention Center this is a holy object for the for Hamas and for the Palestinian people and I think we are supported by by people inside and outside even with all three people in the world now I think we have now a chance to do that uh we have some military in the in our hand I think we are ready to make a comprehensive deal uh I think when when we finish this point of hostages and the children and women I think we are ready now for the next stage in order to make a swap and exchange for the the the the prison in the Israeli detention and we are ready to release all of the all of the solders and officers in our hand and to clean and to release all the prisoners from the Israel and and have you re have you got any engagement show any kind of consessions in this point has Israel engaged with this this idea of a total Swap and you told me the same thing two days ago you're willing to to release all the captives that Hamas is holding uh in exchange potentially for Israel releasing all the Palestinians that's more than six 7,000 now 7,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails have you got engagement from Israel on this issue look I think maybe Israel now sometimes show kind of arrogance that we are not as this started the beginning of this operation against Gaza and they said said we will not negotiate with Hamas we want to break the bond of Hamas we want to destroy everything of Hamas we will bring the hostages with the military power but I think they failed to do that they fa is that a no no traction bring theost no I think now they now they are convinced that they can do that through through the negotiation only through the negotiation and we as Hamas and and the resistance we succeeded to impose our condition to release prisoners now to allow for their assistance and to do many things so I think that this is a big victory for the Palestinian people and a big failure for Israel which at all the time slog against that they are ready to destroy everything in Gaza and to bring everything by military power but I think they failed to do that currently is it your expectation that the ceasefire will continue beyond day four before beyond the current 4-day deal we are working in this I think we are now interested it is our priority now to stop the aggression of our people to serve murdering and massacr and genocide in Gaza we have good context with the c with the Egyptians with the Turkish with different I think most of people even people in Europe more all of them they said that we are interested to stop this brutal war in Gaza we want to stop the genocide against Gaza there are no goals for Israel now in Gaza now that they kill just about 15,000 civilians most of them children the woman what they are going to do in Gaza now after that so I think we are working with different parts in order to uh stop this war and to stop this aggression against people will do everything politically or in different means in order to stop the aggression we hope that we can extend the the the truth or C and to give people more time in order to pre in order to RK in order to to that that they can move in the street can go to the markets can they find food I hope that we are doing our our p in order to extend the the the F sir What About Us Nationals do you intend to release Americans I know the Americans in general we are we are abset from the policy of the American Administration and we know that all the time they are supporting Israel they give him time now to kill and more we said frankly from the beginning of this war that United States is a part in this crime part in genocide part ethic cleansing is there any negotiation right is there any negotiation right now that involves releasing American Nationals currently in Hamas captivity look we are not looking for this is nationalities American and Russian we have different nationalities now we are have a list we are moving in step by step it is organized very well in Hamas organization and we have good contacts with the mediators I think the process is going very well regardless that this is American or Russian or different we are interested to release all the civilians and to release some of the children and women from the Israeli detention centers and gazi hammad a member of hamas's political Bureau thank you for joining us on the program thank you
