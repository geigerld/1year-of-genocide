the Red Sea is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world but now hoofy fighters from Yemen are attacking vessels forcing major companies to reroute operations how will this impact global trade and what can be done to secure the Red Sea this is Inside [Music] I'm SEL vaner welcome to the program the ripple effect of Israel's war on Gaza is causing a maritime crisis in the Red Sea one that may have major implications for the global economy and trade Iranian backed houthis have been carrying out attacks on Commercial vessels the fighters say that they're targeting ships linked to Israel in protest against the war in Gaza as a result several major firms have suspended operations in their strategically important Waterway the United States has announced a coalition task force to respond to the attacks but how effective will that be and what impact will the disruptions have on the global economy we'll discuss all this with our guests after this report by Victoria Gaton commercial ships under attack by iranian-backed houthi fighters in one of the world's most important shipping lanes since the war on Gaza started more than two months ago houthis have used missiles and drones to attack vessels they say are supplying Israel at least 12 shipping companies including Denmark's MK and oil giant BP have suspended operations in the Red Sea because of safety concerns this is not an Israeli trade problem this is a global trade problem um the attacks are very very wide ranging they're taking in ships from all different types of flag and have potentially very very serious consequences for Sea farers from all around the world the conflict is centered around a crucial Maritime Corridor connecting Europe and the Mediterranean to Asia 12% of global trade passes through it avoiding the Red Sea and taking a longer Route Around the southern tip of Africa increases travel time and drives up prices the cost of the fuel um the cost of increased insurance and the fact that the ships and the containers are then out of place this disruption just escalates all of that means that the costs for consumers are going to increase in an effort to prevent further attacks the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced the formation of a multinational Naval task force to patrol the Red Sea during his visit to Israel on Monday these attacks are Reckless dangerous and they violate international law and so we're taking action to uh build an International Coalition to address this threat and I would remind you that this is not just a US issue uh this is this is an international problem and it deserves an international uh response the houth accus the Coalition of militarizing the sea and say it will not stop their Naval operations which aim to support Palestinians in confronting Israeli aggression all of which risks pushing the region into further turmoil Victoria gonb for Inside Story let's bring in our guests now in Ottawa is tomuno a non-resident fellow at the sa Center for strategic studies in Brussels is James Moran a former EU ambassador to Egypt Jordan and Yemen and in Plymouth is stavos Karen peridis a lecturer in Maritime economics at the University of Plymouth and head of the maritime transport research group thank you um gentleman for joining us stavos first question goes to you how much damage does this do to global trade oh okay straight to the not $1 million doll question but the one billion doll question first of all thanks for having me Paul here it's a great honor to be and as we're discussing earlier on is a it's a great fact that we're trying to have that coverage to a very important topic for the global trade uh it has a big damage you know if we go back nearly two years ago as you may remember for the blockage of the sus Canal back in March 2021 um from that area is on a daily basis we have 9.5 billion of trade passing so as you can imagine uh that is causing a lot of impact to the overall trade the global trade and is also increasing the length of the journey so it's approximately 10 extra days for for vessels carrying the goods from Asia to Europe and by that we're having more costs in terms of the transportation of the goods and of course they're going to be more delayed so as you can imagine that has a huge noon effective overall Supply Chains Are you able to so that our viewers can can get a concrete sense of what this means for them for the consumer this means that you can have energy consumer goods that are stuck on ships for an extra two weeks compared to what was scheduled how much does that drive up the cost of everything that's on that ship for instance it's kind of difficult to give you a number now because you know like we have to see first of all how the freight rates are going to react we've seen them increasing we also seen the oil price getting a bit of increase because of that uh I think if the overall situation escalates and continues like that uh then we're going to see an increase in both both in the oil and also because as we know nearly 50% of the operational expenditure of the vessels is oil so if the oil goes up the freight rat will go up by definition and we also have to add on top the extra Voyage time so that means that the overall transportation of the goods is going to be more lengthy and more more uh delayed depending of course on the various sectors so for instance if we're talking about containers that is going to increase another 10 days as we said earlier on but the good news is that we're ending the Christmas season so it's going to be capacity in the system h on the other side I think for for Tangers that's not going to be the case because Tangers were already uh loaded and um that's going to push uh faster the increase in the freight rates for for oil so you know we have to see it on specific segments and we I cannot give you an aggregate number but definitely we're going to see an increase about the timing of this when would we expect to actually see the difference in prices you said because this is the Christmas season there's capacity in the in the markets um does that mean that what in January or would it be February when you start seeing the the price increase really hit consumers uh to to be frank you you have to consider that if we're talking about containers at the moment uh that means that U you know the goods that we have ordered for Christmas they have been already delivered you know it's the 19th of December it's couple of days before Christmas so everything is kind of been delivered so we're heading towards the quiet season January and February is the the quiet season so that means there is capacity in the container sector to absorve any kind of extra need of course after you know um we have to think in a lead time you know when you're placing an order it takes nearly 35 days to come from Asia to Europe so we have to consider that when the trade is going to recover after the Chinese New Year when it's going to be around end of February and things like that uh then the trade start picking up again and that means that the orders we going to place lateer January that is going to have an knon effect in container shipping the the one we're going to see more obvious of course we're going to see a small increase in the overall Freight rate because of the additional uh cost that as I said for the traveling of the for the transportation of the goods but I think after February March we're going to see a bigger effect if the overall situation continues which I hope it wouldn't okay I'm with you and that's really interesting and it's an interesting reminder that that due to the nature of how this works there is by definition a lag in between the time when there's a disruption in the supply chain such as what we're seeing now in the in the um Southern Red Sea and the moment when the the end consumers will actually feel it um that is good to know at the outset of this conversation TOA what is the endgame for the houthis here I'm getting all the big questions out of the way at the top of the show that's a difficult question to answer also because the houthis are not very transparent we don't know exactly what it is they're trying to do but generally speaking we can say that there's a number of objectives that they have one of them has got to be domestic and and in media conversations we focus a lot on the regional or strategic Dimension but there's also a domestic Dimension the houthis uh have de facto won the Civil War in Yemen not completely but in practice they have they are now the deao governing Authority in the capital in the Northwest they control something like 60% of the population they've won and now they are trying to move into a bit of a post-war phase um they are in discussions with Saudi Arabia to formalize the Saudi withdrawal that post-war phase will be challenging for the houthis the economy is a mess the houthis have shown to be abysmal managers of the economy so one aspect here that we do have to keep in mind is that they're probably trying to mobilize prop Palestinian feeling within the yeni population that is under their control but also in parts of the country that they don't control that has to be an objective but beyond the domestic element there's also significantly a regional a regional element having won the Civil War in Yemen the houthis feel very much emboldened and they want to establish themselves as a regional power and we see that in their relations with Saudi Arabia and the UAE we see that in them uh sending missiles and drone attacks on Israel and also now on the Red Sea so ultimately I think we have to combine both the regional and the domestic um element okay we're going to dig into that with James and by the way in this conversation we're going to pingpong obviously between the effects on trade and the the regional implic ation because because obviously these two are connected it's the hou's ability to strangle the trade in the Red Sea which is such an important Waterway as we as we laid out at the top of the show which gives them this importance regionally and which could have Regional consequences and that my question that James is my question to you with this us-led Coalition now in in the Red Sea um it already was you know the US fifth fleet was is based in Bahrain so they were around there but we moving now closer to a regional War I'm not sure about that but I think um we'll have to U have to watch it very carefully in the months to come um but this uh International Maritime cooperation uh is interesting it's not the first time we've seen it in the Gulf of Aiden in the past of course we had the operations against Somali pirates uh which turned out to be successful in the end there was the European operation at Atlanta the Chinese joined in and in a pretty significant way uh and I suspect and I hear that Outreach at the moment is going to not only European countries and Gulf countries but also to China which has a big interest in calming down things in the Red Sea given the enormous trade that flows through there to European markets and vice versa so the strong interest coming from a lot of different parts of the area should also mention Egypt of course which is uh risks losing major much needed foreign exchange revenues from the SE Canal uh so long as ships are being um sent around the Cape of Good Hope so a coalition of Interest here is is pretty strong uh against the actions that the hooes have taken the exception of course is Iran Iran being a big supporter of the hotis the main arm supplier to the hotis and also with an interest probably in uh spurring destabilization in the region given its position uh Visa Israel and so on but the overwhelming interest seems to me to be a common one and I think we're going to see quite a lot of action there not just from the west but also maybe from the Asian side too you mentioned Iran what is the level of involvement that they have in houthi operations specifically in the houthi you know putting so much military pressure on this uh shipping Lane yeah I mean there certainly been an important factor militarily but um we shouldn't imagine the hooes are uh the creatures of Iran uh the hotis have their own agenda uh for reasons also well laid out by your previous speaker there domestically they're very keen to consolidate their position with the population at home uh and whatever that takes um and the Arians are in an alliance with them yes there is the Shia connection between the two although they're very different branches of the Shia Muslim faith uh so that shouldn't be overdone either um so yes I mean there is um there is a common interest with Iran but Iran doesn't necessarily control what the hoo is do okay you say there's a convergence of Interest this next question goes to saos if there's a convergence of Interest so many people and this makes intuitive sense so many countries um have an interest in this Waterway remaining safe and shielded from houthi attacks and that's why uh the US has set up this multinational force is it possible is it possible to Shield their given that there are 20,000 ships that pass through this um uh the this Naval Corridor every year is it possible to Shield them from houthi attacks with the with the Coalition as it's been set up that's a you know that's a that's an operational question for the military people and to be honest I'm not having that kind of background I'll try to to answer from previous experience as James I think mentioned earlier on we did learn some lessons on that from the anti-piracy efforts though exactly that's where I was going you know we we had the operation the NATO Shields down there when they managed to tackle the the piracy in Somalia and it was a very successful operation I have to say and I think that that's you know a lesson that we can get from the overall operation that's like you know if the countries come together and they have a common Target uh they can achieve that so I I don't know how operationally H is and or the emn is are and how capable they are but I'm thinking that if you know countries like the US the UK Spain and also China as we heard earlier on that has joined in the past that kind of attempt and you know Chinese government has mentioned several times that on its interest to maintain all the arteries open for global trade because as we know um China has the nickname of the global Factory so they really want to be able to send all their goods uh around the globe so I think it's in the interest of most of the countries around the globe so that's why they're going to put a lot of effort I think to maintain the artery open and you know we have also to consider an equation that Panama Canal has a lot of issues at the moment because of the global warming and a lot of goods cannot be SE from that route so that is also increasing further the importance of the Su canal and the transportation of the goods through the Su Canal to Tom your view on this is is this operation doable is it possible with a few no not just a few with US Naval assets French Naval assets there are 10 countries in this Coalition is this possible to essentially make this Waterway safe enough for all those ships to decide to reroot their traffic through there given that more than 12 companies so far have said we're we're not we're not sailing through this Waterway anymore it's going to be very difficult uh and and part of the uh answer to that question is going to depend on what are the rules of engagement uh which are still not completely clear a lot of detail is yet to be announced is it going to be purely defensive or are American assets and the region ships in the Red Sea going to retaliate uh against houthi assets against houthi surveillance radar missile launch uh who the port installations on the Red Sea Coast we don't really know that yet uh the Americans have been cautious in in not committing to directly hit uh houthi assets that would be complicated um the houthis feel very emboldened right now they feel borderline cubistic I think um because they do perceive that they are unchallenged inside Yemen which is uh probably an accurate assessment as they have been able to push back against Saudi Arabia now they are negotiating with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's withdrawal from Yemen it's not a peace process right it's a negotiation of the houthi victory so right now the houthis feel that they really have the bigger end of the stick so can a maritime mission in the Red Sea help to protect some of the ships uh by air defense mechanisms and so on yes but will it be enough to convince as you said the many companies that are as we speak more and more of them announcing that they will not Transit through the red Red Sea that's difficult and I'm as of now I'm I'm not convinced that it's going to fully work I certainly hope so but it's it's going to be a a major Challenge and and by the way something and again this is this question is operational in nature um to my if you want to address it go ahead James if you have thoughts as well go ahead and and if this is a detail then we can move on but the um Western Country specifically France has mentioned look they are sending they meaning the houthis they're using shahad drones which cost about 20 $330,000 they're very cheap and we're shooting them down with missiles that are worth about a million Euros so this raises question of whether this Western Coalition is sustainable as it's presently constructed the way in which these Western countries intend to protect this Waterway if they're hemorrhaging millions of dollars of Euros in missiles when Yemen will be able to launch these really inexpensive drones is that something that the Western countries can sustain um perhaps James yeah it's interesting uh to think back a few years to operation at Atlanta it was a different um schema um in the end it was successful not only because of um countering the attacks by the Somali pirate boats the skips that came in and threatened the container and oil traffic going through but also because it was decided to hit the um the pirate installations on the Somali Coast it took a long time for that operation to happen but when it did it was probably the major factor in stopping uh the piracy coming out of Somalia uh in a different context here but nevertheless I think probably the same sort of inflection point is probably going to be reached at some juncture uh when uh any International maritime protection force is going to have to decide whether or not it takes on the missile launching sites on land of the hoo of course should that happen there are dangers there because you risk getting involved in the yemeni what's left of the Yemen Civil War now the huis may have won for the moment but they haven't yet Consolidated their position and there is a danger they are getting dragged into yet another civil conflict within Yemen so this is a very difficult uh uh thing to achieve and I suspect there will be a lot of head scratching in military planning um places in Washington and elsewhere as to when and if that should happen in other words attacks on land against the hotis if they continue with their current policy however let's not forget at the end of the day the hoo is justify all of this uh because they want to support the Palestinian cause anybody that's been to Yemen knows just how strong the feelings are about that if the Gaza War comes to an end that Also may have an effect on the hooi strategy you raised a very interesting point there you rais a very interesting point which is as you say that the the houthis are doing this in the name in support officially of Palestinians in Gaza um do you think that what they're doing in the Red Sea right now by by putting this military pressure on this Waterway do you think that can actually move the needle in the Israel Gaza War it hasn't so far I doubt it frankly I I don't think it's going to be a a major factor in changing the positions of the principal players certainly not the Israelis and I doubt the Americans in that war um so um I don't think there will be a direct effect on on that that will depend on other things but should the Gaza War come to an end should we move on to the next stage whatever that may be um then uh the hotis May well um dial down their actions because uh they're they're kind of left high and dry so to speak in terms of what they're trying to do stav Ros what would it take for the major shipping companies to give the green light to go back through the Red Sea because at least 12 of them as as of the time of recording of this show have pulled out of this route and they're rerouting what would it take is there a benchmark where they say for them it's a business decision right they need to make sure it's safe enough to be able to send all their goods correct and and you said exactly what is all all about what is driving the decision is it's businesses and also we have to they have to balance between risk and profitability so they have to find out is it worth it to pass through the Red Sea at the moment or should they be more secure and spend a bit of more time uh stretch a bit of more of my assets and my capabilities so I can have a safe uh passage navigation and I think that's a question that the each individual company has to take because as you know each company has different business strategies and different uh business cultures So based on their own uh ideas and beliefs they're going to move forwards Toma as you watch all of this unfold we're in a we're a what may be an inflection point here right the US is just uh bringing together this International Coalition to try and secure this Waterway as you watch this unfold we don't know yet exactly where this goes How This Ends what are you going to be watching out for what signals are you interested in I will be watching for the Rules of Engagement in more detail as I mentioned a few minutes ago for the Coalition and what that implies for uh POS possible retaliation against directly against hthi assets inside Yemen it's not clear to me if the US wants to do that for fear of escalation H in the Red Sea and Beyond with the houthis and perhaps with other armed groups that Iran backs throughout the region but also for fear of houthi retaliation I mean right now there's a very delicate balancing act that is being being played in those political talks between Saudi Arabia and the houthis they have been going on for a long time now more than a year there have been rumors of an imminent deal between Saudi Arabia and the houthis for a long time now it keeps on getting pushed back one of the reasons why it keeps on getting pushed back is that the houthis again perceive that they have the big end of the stick and that they are consistently asking for more trying to extract more concessions for Saudi Arabia so this might also be part of the houthi calculus here to try to extract more concessions to legitimate to consolidate and to institutionalize their domination of what they want to be uh now a a phase of post war at Yemen so if the US retaliates and hits houthi assets radar sites surveillance sites Port installations on the Red Sea Coast uh that may be in a way the best way to establish and narrow terms a deterrence in the Red Sea which is probably necessary to reopen it to shipping but the risk in doing that is that the houthis would retaliate not necessarily only against the us but possibly also against Saudi Arabia or the UAE or other countries in the region um which would throw off potentially other political uh Dynamics at play notably those Saudi houthi talks so this is a very difficult equation for the us to try to figure out to try to strike the right balance um because actions that may be necessary on one front may cause damage on another front so I'm I'm not sure what the the right way out for the US is here James if we gameplay this what do you think are the realistic scenarios I mean one one that we've kind of put out there um is well perhaps this this multinational Naval Force actually neutralizes the houthi threat uh to this Waterway I suppose that's one positive scenario what do you think are the other realistic ones I think there's a fair chance that the deterrent effect of that multinational Force particularly if it's not just Western countries uh but if the gulf I think the gulf probably would be very supportive whether it will join in materially I don't know and ex for bahin bahin is the only Arab country in they hav't yet except for bahin and you would have expected that given this the base of the US Fleet but um uh also important as I said before is China and to some extent Japan and some of the Asian countries if they join in to I think that would be um there a massive deterrent not only to the hotis but also to the Iranians don't forget the Iranian relationship with China plays in the background here as well and it might just be successful without having to launch major attacks on the um mainland of Yemen uh certainly one would hope for that um realistic H perhaps um but um maybe one's hoping for too much here but there is this danger that if uh the multinational Force whatever it's called does get dragged into further civil conflict on the Arabian Peninsula that could be pretty dangerous for all people all concerned and we shouldn't exclude that and we don't have much time left in the show but can I get you to address quickly something that Tuma has said several times that the houthis may have an eye not just on the uh Israel Gaza War but also on their peace deal that they're currently negotiating uh with the Saudis and this may help them put pressure on the Saudis your your views on that I think up to a point that might might work um but uh I'm not sure it will it'll make their situation that much better there is a bit of hubis somebody mentioned hubis earlier amongst the hooes at the moment there there is a danger that they're overreaching here uh they have a strong interest to calm things down with Saudi Arabia uh they don't want to get uh back into the sort of situation they were in three or four years ago uh and if they do their own position domestically will be tremendously weakened uh it's not that Saudi Arabia necessarily will re-enter a Civil War in Yen but they have to be very careful about that in what they're calculating so I think so far but no further perhaps could be the principle uh here if the hoo is are trying to do that Visa leverage on the Saudis okay well we'll leave it at that that completes the regional picture of this conversation thank you so much to all of you gentlemen too James Moran
