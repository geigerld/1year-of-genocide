well let's take a closer look at the ceasefire proposal that's actually being discussed the first phase would be a temporary truce during which Hamas would release women the elderly and wounded captives in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons the second phase would include a permanent end to the hostilities and the release of all remaining Israeli captives and the third phase would be the Reconstruction of Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased captives to Israel let's get more on this with the Hamas spokesman Osama ham and good to have you back on the show what is your assessment of these talks so far well thank you for having me um I have to start by saying till now we didn't hear any clear information about what had happened yesterday it seems to me that till now the the mediators are still talking to the Israeli side the same way which had happened in last May in last may I have to remind everyone that we have agreed on the suggestion of the mediators and after three weeks the Israelis have said no three weeks of negotiations with the Israelis the outcome was negative till now the mediators are talking about Bridging the gaps but it's clear that the gaps from the Israeli side they are adding more conditions they are talking about some new issues which I believe they are trying to undermine the process anyway till now we did didn't hear any positive signs from the mediators we hope to hear those signs because our position is still clear if we were invited to participate for the executive Implement for the suggestions we will do that otherwise we don't need more negot well I did want to ask you why you're relying on mediators to give you information about these talks not sending a delegation yourself well this this this is the process it's it's how it happened they talk to the Israelis and they come back to talk to Hamas if there was a positive reaction from the Israeli side till now it seems that there was no positive acceptance from the Israeli side we have talked to the mediators early three days before yesterday and we told them if there was a clear answer from the Israelis that they accept your mediation they accept your proposal we are ready to participate it seems to me till now the the Israelis they didn't say yes yet how much how much leeway are you willing to give we've seen the Israeli side Netanyahu particularly push for Israeli control of the Philadelphia Corridor to keep checkpoints inside Gaza are these issues that Hamas is willing to give ground on well it was clear from for we have received guarantees from the American side through the mediators the brothers in qar and Egypt that the Israeli withdrawal will be complete from Gaza including Philadelphia X and RAF Cross Point H from our side our position is clear we want an a complete Israeli withdrawal and according to the maps which which is supposed to be included to the agreement there will be no Israeli presence on Philadelphia and cring point and we have received also a clear position from the Egyptian side that they will not accept the Israeli presence anymore if there was a ceasefire this is the first round of talks that has taken place without Ismail hania he was the chief negotiator of course he was assassinated uh in tan how does that complicate efforts for Hamas at the table well uh let me start by saying that the assassination of was a clear sign from Israeli side especially nyaho that he's not willing to have a CE fire Arrangement and he's trying to undermine the process in different ways uh our decision was to go forward in the negotiations and to to achieve the goal the ceasefire the Israeli withdrawal and the the reform reconstruction of G now yir is the head of Hamas and he was following the negotiations through the period of the presence of brother is Han so I believe as principles there is no changes in Hamas position and the same delegation is following up the negotiations and they will continue their work under the supervision of hen who was involved all the time about the negotiations does Hamas accept that now is the time for a ceasefire and now is the time for compromise difficult compromises given that the death toll in Gaza has passed 40,000 people an astonishing toll taken on the Gaza population well I have to remind the everyone that uh the 40,000 people who were killed they are our own people so we and secondly from uh after the the Paris initiative we have a clear position welcoming this initiative and showing our willing to have a a ceasefire all the time the one the side who was undermining the process was the Israeli side we have accepted the initiative of the mediators in April the second initiative in May and the third initiative in June and every time the Israelis face that with massacres killing hundreds of Palestinians assassinations and the new conditions everyone understand especially the mediators that the side who's undermining the process still now is the Israelis and they are not showing a real will to accept a ceas fair and I hope also to see the American position making the needed pressure on the Israeli side who's counting on the American position and and still undermining the process okay Asama Hamden good to speak to you thank you very much for taking the time to join us here on Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our
