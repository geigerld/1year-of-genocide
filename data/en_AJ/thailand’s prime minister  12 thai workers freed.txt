reporting from occupied East Jerusalem it is 20 minutes past 400 p.m. which was the time when as of now we expect we could at any point see movement on the release of captives from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners uh from uh inside Israeli jails now Thailand's prime minister you heard Rory talking about Thai Nationals that are that have been held in Gaza Thailand's prime minister has confirmed on social media that 12 Thai workers who were taken captive by Hamas have been released this has happened on the sidelines of the deal that's going to see the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners uh Palestinian prisoners released Bangkok had been holding separate talks to repatriate about two dozen Tha Nationals taken captive by Hamas from Southern Israel on October the 7th let's bring in our diplomatic editor James Bay James a lot of moving parts right now um I'm just finding out about the Tha Nationals being released this is I I suppose this is consistent to to some extent with what Hamas with what we've known about these negotiations which are there are these negotiations between Hamas the main ones Hamas Israel uh I beg your pardon mediated by Qatar between Hamas and Israel but they're also bilateral negotiations apparently between Hamas and other countries whose Nationals they're holding yeah the cat forign Ministry spokesman when he was giving the details um about 24 hours ago of uh the main deal said this is just a deal uh involving Israeli captives and potentially Israeli jeel Nationals on one side and Palestinian prisoners on the other but we know that there are other Nationals involved and we know that there were these 23 ties who were taken um captive uh back on October the 7th now what were these T Tha Nationals doing uh in southern Israel they were agricultural workers uh and uh Thailand had been very strongly making the case that they are not part of the conflict that is going on they just have happen to be in the area they are not rich people they were doing a pretty lowly job there uh in southern Israel they're not parties to this conflict and they should be released and what is interesting is Thailand's been trying to get as much support as it can um for their release and it's been speaking uh to a country that it has reasonably good relations with which is Iran and Iran has been doing we believe mediation on behalf of Thailand for these Nationals also worth given that the the caty channel is the is the main channel of of communication to Hamas worth telling you that the Iranian foreign minister was here in Doha in the last few hours so I think significant we're all waiting for the Israeli captives that are part of this formal deal um but that's going to involve 12 people uh sorry 13 people we think we've already got 12 people 12 Tha Nationals uh released uh now confirmed by the Thai um prime minister this is 12 out of 23 of course we don't know how many of those 23 are still alive and when whether any of the Thai Nationals died uh in in the 47 days of Israeli bombardment of Gaza one really simple thing that lesson from from this latest news that 12 Thai workers have actually been released is that this is somehow working there is a mechanism we've been talking about the mechanics of the deal we've been explaining to our viewers that this is quite complicated uh that there needs to be trust between these two Ides Israel and Hamas clearly there has Hamas has found a way to release captives when it came to the Thai Nationals absolutely and I it's not clear to me yet whether the international Committee of the Red Cross were the facilitators for this but I think that's probably likely and they are the facilitator We Believe of the first batch of Israeli captives the 13 that were expecting to be released anytime soon and it's also worth telling you here in this Newsroom there are people pouring over all of the live pictures coming from the from the scene at the moment to see if we see anyone crossing the border at Rafa well it seems that 12 Tha Nationals have crossed that border and no one saw them you know you know I was going to say it's unlikely that we're going to see something on these live pictures but actually I could be completely wrong we don't know what to expect I mean maybe maybe a group of captives shows up and and they're caught on these life shots we don't know which is why we're looking at them every every second can you explain to our viewers can you address the notion of how fragile this is the reason we're talking so much about the mechanics of the deal is because when the mediator has presented how this was going to work he was at pains to explain you know we're we're watching this every second because it could go wrong yeah well after the events of October 7th and after everything that's happened since in terms of the intensity of the bombardment there's absolutely no trust between the two Central parties here and so they've had to try and make a a a plan um that would not build trust but build momentum into the process and so what you've had is the Ceasar temporary Ceasar coming into effect and then this staged process of um C captives um will be released Israeli captives by Hamas and then also as we're seeing now Palestinian prisoners uh released by Israel and if both sides have got something from day one then we think there'll be set of lists prepared for day two with another batch of um people that are hold held by herass women and children held by Hamas and then another batch of um prisoners uh women and children that are held by Israel in Israeli jails Palestinians and then day two can go on and it's going to be like this it's going to be day by day they're obviously very very concerned about some sort of accidental violation of this that that some way uh the the the the um the ceasefire will be broken and I can tell you there is a control room here in Doha the kataris have set up realtime links direct links with the Israeli side with Mossad with lines to the Israeli military and of course um Qatar has a direct line to Hamas as well the idea being if there's some sort of problem some sort of minor violation that they can transort it there and then and it doesn't become something that brings down the whole of this uh plan ceasefire of 4 days and I think many are hoping that this can extend beyond 4 days so this is it you were talking about momentum the point of momentum obviously is to go beyond the four days explain that because the qari mediators again were saying this is this is Phase One essentially these four days and for us uncertain and usure unsure and fraught with with risk and difficulty as they are the mediators are hoping that this can take us into day five six seven and maybe Beyond well then you start to have a problem because it's very hard to to know how many days exactly and because because we don't know um with regard to Hamas and we don't think Hamas hold all of the captives in Gaza how many of these captives are alive so we don't know how many women and children there are in total alive because I have to say once you go beyond the women and children on both sides the stakes start getting much much higher um both sides will want more in return and remember the stated position of the Israeli government backed by the us as well which is that Israel retains its right of self-defense after October the 7th and Israel is making it clear that it hasn't finished with its aims of this war and that they will be restarting this war now could they be um persuaded not to do that my own view is having seen the intensity of the way they prosecuted this War I think when they say they mean to resume it they mean that yeah so far they have fulfilled their promises when it comes to attacking Gaza and um and bringing bringing unprecedented Firepower to Bear uh in this war thank you very much James Bay Al a senior diplomatic editor for joining us
