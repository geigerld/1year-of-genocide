Ramadan is normally a time when Muslims come together to fast worship and reflect but after 5 months of unimaginable violence people here will instead have to endure the pain caused by Israel's Relentless war on Gaza I came here to buy but I can't find anything to buy there's nothing no dates or milk or anything one can't find anything for their children all these canned goods are full of germs that infect the stomach we need vegetables and fruits to feed our children because they've weakened and died from Hunger more than 2 million people are being forced to live with little to no water or food Israel is refusing to let enough Aid in the supplies that do exist are unaffordable the holy month has added meaning here I think this Ramadan will add to the tragedies of the Palestinian people a new tragedy and a new torment the city situation is very difficult and any person who says that they can endure the pain of this month financially spiritually mentally look over all of this Market in vain no one can afford to buy anything every single person in Gaza has lost a loved one or knows someone who has and friends and families are torn apart unable to celebrate together this year's Ramadan is different from previous Years first of all we are far away from our loved ones our families relatives and friends in the north everything is different Israel's indiscriminate attacks have destroyed or damaged at least 184 mosques in Gaza but faith is undiminished across the strip and Palestinians say they'll keep praying for the war to end Julie dger Al jazer
