Israel says it gives adequate notice before bombing an area but the number of Civilian casualties is still mounting Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate countless times since October the 7th first they were told to leave their homes in the north and go south of Wadi Gaza many moved to Khan yunes in the south then the Israeli Army issued evacuation orders for parts of Khan Yunis as it intensified strikes and ground operations there but it only gives people a few hours notice Ro have been destroyed and bombing it doesn't stop meaning moving anywhere is extremely difficult and dangerous the UN says 1.9 million Palestinians more than 80% of the population have been forced from their homes either by Israeli attacks or Israeli evacuation orders meanwhile some Israelis have expressed a desire to return to settlements in Gaza which were abandoned nearly two decades ago in the end we will have no choice probably but to rule there in Gaza we obviously must rule militarily we will have to rule and it could come to that returning to gush kti it's simply reality will oblige Israel to Ru Gaza there might be such a thing in history in reality I'm a Believer yes God might force it to happen that way they are not talking about returning to the former settlements in Gaza yet but this is something that can happen because there might be no choice the IDF will have to rule there in Gaza in any case you can't ru if you don't have settlements there I believe we shall return to Gaza the question is when I have no idea I believe we shall return because the Gaza Strip belongs to us it is part of the boundaries of the promised land so we must return there well Toby Cadman is an international human rights lawyer he joins us now from the hag good to have you with us so I want to start by referencing a statement by the United Nations on October the 1 quoting or referring to a un expert as quote condemning the evacuation order as a crime against humanity and a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that was back on October the 13th what is the legality now of these repeated evacuation orders well thank you I think we've said since the very beginning that these uh evacuation orders um forcing gazans to to leave their homes with very little notice before their their homes are effectively destroyed and and larger areas of Gaza being flattened um we we've consistently stated that there's no there's no proper legal basis for doing that and the fact that the the is Israeli authorities repeatedly say that they give sufficient notice to civilians so that they can leave is there's still no justification um for for devastating civilian areas um and it's it's all the more worrying when we see certainly civilians being mov one from one area to another and then that other area then subsequently being attacked um and I think that the the the the evidence is obviously mounting up um for future prosecutions of of war crimes because it's being documented in real time we're seing statements we're seen seeing the conduct and the lack of justification the lack of proportional and the lack of distinction between military and civilian targets and coupled with that when you combine the two elements which you mentioned their evacuation orders telling people to go to the South but then the south southern areas themselves also falling victim to Israeli strikes that makes it even more questionable to put it politely well yes I think I think the the term that I've used before on on on this channel is it's it's perfidious um so when you're effectively giving civilians uh safe passage and to an area which is protected and then that era is is is then attacked um it's is reminiscent of July 1995 in sbera when um safe safe areas enclaves were were established and then we we saw what the outcome of that was more than 8,000 men and boys killed so it is it is deeply disturbing when we see this time and time again in adding another layer to that of course we should put it in the context of this is an area that under international law according to statements many statements by various un agencies and officials this is an occupied territory it's been under occupation since 1967 it is under siege for 16 years what is the legality then of then going and establishing settlements which is the Talk Amongst some right now there are even Israeli companies talking about building what they call developments in Gaza well certainly we we can we can go back to to the way that the the existing settlements and expansion of settlements has been viewed um certainly the former prosecutor of the international criminal court um fatti Ben suda had had stated that U the the establishment of settlements fell within the jurisdiction um of the international criminal court and of course um moving a population into an area under occupation is a war crime um and Israel is governed specifically by the Fourth Geneva Convention which governs uh occupation and you know we we we we've spoken about this repeatedly how the occupation is unlawful moving a population in an occupied area by the occup is unlawful moving those who are under occupation out or into different areas whether that is uh internally or externally is also prohibited and what we see now is statements coming out from from Netanyahu and and his government that they are now looking to move Palestinians completely out of Gaza um to occupy it and to to establish settlements it is all unlawful and again um I I hate to sound like a broken record but if this was happening anywhere else in the world we wouldn't be having this discussion having to establish that that this is unlawful of course it's unlawful we all know it's unlawful but it's it's about time that we actually took some concrete steps to prevent it getting worse and on that point particularly your point of if this was happening anywhere else in the world as I'm sure you're aware there's been criticism of the ICC prosecutor and the ICC itself because we've seen in other scenarios Ukraine being an example where there were allegations of war crimes even in cases where they were not able to send their investigators to the ground that war crimes investigations had begun and even arrest warrants issued for very powerful people why would you is it fair to say that the ICC has been too slow to move in this case I think it's uh fair to criticize it for for being uh slow to wake up I think what Karim Khan the prosecutor is doing now is trying to move things forward but you know we're we're at the stage even before October of this year there has been uh plenty of time um for the IC to to take to take action um Toby does that undermine and politicize increase the perception of politicization of justice and the ICC well absolutely and look I I think we we have to accept that there is no conflict more politically charged than the Israel Palestine conflict it is it is the most politicized conflict that that we we've experienced and we likely to experience um and and so you have to factor that into into the equation but the ICC is an institution that is supposed to be acting independent of politics and I think we have to take the position now that there is nothing preventing the IC from moving forward there's nothing preventing the prosecutor from properly investigating this and as we say we're seeing the evidence play out on our screens uh in real time that there there is a sufficient basis as there was in Ukraine to issue the arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin there is a sufficient basis for bringing arrest warrants for both those that committed the atrocities on the 7th of October and those Israeli officials who have have continued with the the language that they use the attacks flattening Gaza of establishing settlements that the time has come for there to be concrete action all right thank you so much Toby Cadman thank you
