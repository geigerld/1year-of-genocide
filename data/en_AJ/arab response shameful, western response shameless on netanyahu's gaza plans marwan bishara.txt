Egypt has warned against Israel's plan to Target Rafa gaza's southern city is along Egypt's border and satellite photos are revealing how Cairo is now building more checkpoints in November construction Crews began working on a raised strip of land 200 meters from the fence which divides Egypt from the Gaza Strip that land barrier has now grown to 14 kilm in length the Egyptians are also building a new concrete wall along the old border wall Israel's V to the south of Gaza is Raising tension with Egypt the two countries signed a formal peace treaty in 1979 based on What's called the Camp David Accords it lays out a complicated set of agreements about land and borders importantly it limits the presence of Egypt's military in the Sinai Peninsula a separate agreement was signed in 2005 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew from the Gaza Strip and as the Philadelphia cord it covered how the Rafa border Crossing was to be run as well as how Egypt could deploy guards along the border but Israel is now talking about relocating huge numbers of Palestinians away from Rafa Egypt has reportedly warned that any attempt to move people across the border could lead to the termination of the treaty and the other agreements between the two countries M jazer Maran bashara is here in the studio my wonder if the situation in Rafa worsens does Israel Israel seriously think it is still possible to be able to push Garin across the border considering what we're seeing by way of Egypt's reinforcements on that border it seems like it you know it seems like it um but but basically the the nany government or Netanyahu himself has been preaching for a good while now is that every time you tell me I can't do something I do it and nothing happens this is something like what Trump used to say you know um I recognize Jerusalem and you say something will happen nothing happens I I recognize the Goen Heights as Israeli territory nothing happens Nao says you warned me not to invade by land I did nothing happened you know the world some criticized some didn't mostly those who I need meaning Western Powers have been so hypocritical have been so appeasing to the Israeli government so basically netanyahu's appetite has grown with more killing more expansion more war crimes because he keeps doing it with impunity and now he thinks now that he's coming to the tip of the southern part of Gaza the Egyptians are warning the Americans are concerned the French are worried and he's probably laughing hahaa you know yeah I've heard that before why do I care what you keep saying because you actually never walk your talk yeah there appear to be a lot of nervous hang hand hand ringing moments particularly from Emanuel macron who has raised deep concerns about what all of this means I mean if you could put this into a historical context for us what would it mean what does it mean for us now to be talking about potentially the collapse of the Camp David ACC courts I think for the time being this is a warning this is not a real threat that is going to be actionable anytime soon among uh among the among the other rewards for the Camp David of Courts Egypt has gotten tens of billions of dollars from the United States and it continues to get aid from the United States it continues to be also dependent on the United States for various helps so Egypt has been a bit of an asset for the United States it's dependent on the United States and I don't I personally don't foresee Israel walking away from the Camp David courts but even if it does that doesn't mean that we're going to go back to the state of war between Egypt and Israel certainly not under CCE certainly under not this regime that's basically been even profiting from the War uh in Gaza with with all these you know corruption on the borders you know 5,000 to 10,000 per individual to leave Gaza and all of that so I think for the time being what the Egyptian regime insists on is that he's been helpful he's been quiet as genoside was unraveling in plain sight in Gaza so he just doesn't want any future resolution of the Palestinian issue to be resolved at the expense of the Egyptian security that's what he's saying he's basically begging the Israelis just don't push the Palestinians my way they're not my problem they're your problem right and he's actually helping out with the United States Saudi Arabia and Jordan and the palan authority they're all coming together to try to help Netanyahu imagine after Netanyahu carries all his war crimes now the Arabs and the Americans want to help him out deal with the day after when Netanyahu and we've obviously heard him quite a lot today speaking on two US networks um and also in recent days addressing members of his own government when he talks about quote total victory in Gaza who is he speaking to both to his public opinion and to those detractors who basically warning him that you are far off yeah if you remember just a couple of days ago as he was saying uh to his own uh you know crowd his own media he was saying uh We've destroyed two-thirds of hamas's forces the next day American intelligence told Congress that he only destroyed at best one-third of Hamas forces he was saying that we're going to continue with the war until we free the captives the next day the Biden Administration came out and said that's just humbug it's not going to happen the only way to free the cap is through diplomacy war is going to kill them right he went on and said we're going to maintain security over Gaza for the foreseeable future as well of course the West Bank and everything west of the Jordan River the Obama Administration said no no no no so this been one humiliation after another of the Biden Administration on the part of Netanyahu government what do we make of Rafa as an entire strategy because how Netanyahu plays this could have massive long-term implications on what happens next Hamas have said if this assault this ground invasion of assault happens there will be no captive exchange end to negotiations how seriously is Netanyahu taking that does it bother him oh I think he's I would think he's probably happy about it you know when someone has a certain megalomania uh and certain u worldview in his according to him in his book BB he's very hyper realistic and he only thinks in terms of power he doesn't think in terms of values and he thinks the the the value of few uh Israelis nothing compared with Israel's National Security or the value of Israel national security and he believes he is the guardian to Israel national security not the occupation not the genocide not you know of all of that now he thinks that he's defending Israel's expansion into the historic Palestine and if 100 or so captives are going to be in the way we let them be killed because that will liberate him for for from the pressures of the Biden Administration from the pressures of the day after and from the pressures of the public opinion or segments of the public Union at home in order for him to do whatever he wants to do in Gaza including the ethnic cleansing we just talked about and including the increas of settlements that we just talked about in the West Bank and maybe tomorrow in Gaza already much of his own fascist fanatic government is talking about restling Gaza Believe It or Not M many thanks as always M Bashar
