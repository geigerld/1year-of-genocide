the war on Gaza is high on the agenda at the Munich security conference Germany's chancellor Olaf Schultz has spoken as the US vice president camela Harris step vson joins us now live from Munich so what message are we getting well the war on Gaza is definitely high on the agenda here in Munich but publicly publicly we haven't heard much uh it's a very much discussed behind closed doors and one of the people involved in these uh meetings closed doors is with me right now it's Robert golop the prime minister of Slovenia and Slovenia has been one of the few EU countries who has been very vocal against Israel's aggression in Gaza you had bilateral meetings with the vice president of the United States CA Harris and with King Abdullah of Jordan is there anything you can share with us uh what is going on how are the developments is there going to be a ceasefire soon well one thing that I want to share is that there is a common consensus saying that we are very worried about the situation on the ground and that we shall do everything we can to prevent the attack of Rafa this is one common understanding apart from this yes there are there is a call outside for CE immediate ceasefire unfortunately some of my colleagues from the European Union are not backing this call we will need to do more in this regard and same goes for humanitarian Aid we need to do whatever we can to get more Aid on the ground as well so from the vice president of of the United States you didn't get any hopeful signs that this discussion would lead towards a ceasefire well the problem is that you need to discuss first and then of course the measures can follow but now we're really running out of time the two things that gave me some hope is that there was clear uh clear saying from the uh vice president about the right to self-determination for Palestinian people that doesn't help immediate but it could be a a promise a hope for the future uh when we discuss the two-state solution so let's hope this um you know uh really brings to some fruition later on but again it is that the situation right now Rafa and the release of hostages that we need to deal with immediately and hopefully there is going to be some development in the next days or perhaps weeks you said already that the EU is not United right are colleagues of yours who are not in favor of a of a ceasefire you said also The credibility of the international law is actually at stake here and there's we heard also the word hypocrisy mentioned right if you look at Ukraine and how uh people in Europe and and the leaders have reacted compared to what's happening now in Gaza so how how important is it to have this credability restored and what can you do to achieve that so the narrative within the European country Council goes like the strength of the European Union lies in its uni Unity so the more united the more strong and we're trying to apply the same rule to the Gaza situation as well uh slowly slowly we're getting forward but again I mean too many too many lives were been lost already so I'm not sure whether just looking for Unity will help so that means the unilateral or in small groups we will have to do more you also involved your country in an important case next week in the he about uh uh the illegality of the occupation of the Palestinian territories Slovenia is also at the Forefront of this case it also has to do of course with the restoration of this credibility of international law that you've been talking about you're also involved also in the reforms of the uh Security Council un Security Council where this veto has been hampering of course any decisions how how is is that looking you had meetings about this today yeah well when it comes to the reform on the security Council uh we don't have time for that we need to act immediately we need to find Solutions within the existing framework and uh leave the reform for better times I don't think really right now is the right timing for that when it comes to the uh Judicial System we do believe international law we strongly believe in that and in in that regard we are we also decided to uh join with advisory of opinion uh on the practices in the occupied territories and yes uh we will try to do our best uh in that regard as well thank you so much for your time here in uh in Munich and of course these discussions will still be ongoing and not only today but also tomorrow we will hear from the prime minister of qat later today and also uh from the president of Israel and that's de Von from Munich
