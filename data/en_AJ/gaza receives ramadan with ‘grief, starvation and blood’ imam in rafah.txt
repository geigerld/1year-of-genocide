Palestinians are experiencing a Ramadan like no other the Muslim month of fasting is being observed in the face of famine Israel is restricting what food medicine and life-saving supplies can get into Gaza a small amount of Aid was dropped by Parachute into the north where Israel's blockade is at its worst but it's nowhere near enough to meet the needs of people there the number of Palestinians who have died as a result of malnutrition and dehydration has risen to 25 instead of spending time together with family in their homes Palestinians who have already been displaced multiple times are under constant attack explosions occurred in the southern city of Rafa shortly after Dawn while 16 people were killed when a home was bombed in Gaza City and in occupied East Jerusalem Israeli forces blocked the entrance to the Alamos compound some Palestinian worshippers were beaten as they tried to enter NAD Abu sharak joins us you're an Imam sir and you're with us live from Rafa also in the southern part of the the Gaza Strip I wonder what do you say to worshippers at a time like this under these exceptional circumstances in the name of Allah the omnipotent the merciful Gaza is receiving Ramadan while the entire population is cloaked in Blackness we address Muslims in every corner of the world how can you accept to see the Gaz and suffering in this holy month the month of religious observances where Muslims observe fasting and other rituals we send out a cry an outcry to the Arab and Muslim population worldwide through Al jaaz can you accept this here in Gaza people are forsaken are left with nothing with no portable water our fellow gazin in the north have been besieged they are starving to death they are even forced to eat animals F Ramadan the holy month of Virtues rituals Humanity religious observances while Muslims dedicate their time day and night for prayers and supplications instead gazans are left to fight for their life to just to survive as the Israelis continues with with their barbaric attacks they have outperformed the German Nazis it is a state terrorism Israeli State terrorism they have outperformed all other types of form of terrorism they are wreaking destruction and killing slaughtering our people women and children innocent even babies they are left without milk or the least basic necessities any person of Gaza is reing under ruthless bombardment Shilling and starvation there is not a single house that is not mourning the loss of a loved ones and above all that we are starving to death instead this is the message we are sending out to the people of the world Gaza and the gazans are receiving Ramadan the holy month with grief sadness starvation and blood the whole world has forsaken us imagine if please stop this Cascade of blood sir so many mosques across the Gaza Strip have been either uh damaged or entirely destroyed as we have documented since the beginning of this conflict where do worshippers in this holy month of Ramadan worshippers in every Muslim country flock to mosques to perform prayers supplications and offer other rituals on every year we used to offer prayers including at evening and all night long prayers as you documented the Israeli occupation forces have destroyed not only our homes but only the houses of God mosques 90% of all mosques in Gaza have been totally destroyed others are partly damaged that's why we shephers are left with nothing but to offer prayers on the streets on the ruins of their own mosques yesterday for example in Rafa we offered Al prayers on the road we laid down our m s praying M or a piece of cloth to offer worshiping and off perform prayers this is the case and this is the situation this is repeated in all and every other destroyed most all over G this is what has become of Gaz and Muslims pray laying on the ruins of their own mosques on the streets however they are adamant to continue with their prayers they are adamant to continue to and maintain observing their religious rituals our resolve cannot be dented although the whole world has forsaken us I wish we had been ukrainians the whole world had moved heaven and for the sake of ukrainians Simply for being a people of fair complexion yet we gazin Muslims are abandoned failed forsaken by the entire world now humanity is at trial but we were have been forsaken more than one I'd like to jump in respectfully um Ramadan as we know sir is a Ramadan is a time for religious reflection uh normally ordinarily what can people in Gaza reflect on when they are as we know starving displaced not to mention in constant danger of being bombed this is a very good question they are praying offering supplications in every single prayers raising their hands and arms to God the almighty the omnipotent asking and praying supplicating asking for victory against those who have been wreaking killing destruction and Siege they are supplicating to God the almighty for Swift victory and then they are praying to God Almighty to provide them with the basic necessities of life imagine at least portable water clean drinking water which is totally absent in Gaza flour and bread is totally absent in Gaza namely in the north they have been supplicating to God Almighty to provide them with patience fortitude support they are also praying for the border crossings to be opened and this world to come to an end delivery Aid be delivered normally without condition this is the month of Virtues Of goodness however we are left without the basic necessities of life receiving month with Hunger stress first yet with fortitude and patience simply because we have firm conviction in God and firm faith in Allah NAD abush sharak an Imam in Rafa in southern Gaza thank you very much for joining us on the program this hour
