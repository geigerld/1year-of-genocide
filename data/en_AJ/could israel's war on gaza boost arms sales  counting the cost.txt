hello I'm alen s this is counting the cost on Al jazer your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week Israel keeps dropping tons of bombs on Gaza it wants to replenish its stock Western military contractors are eyeing big profits also this week more American weapons are being delivered to Israel how far will the US go with military aid to the nation and Israel's major offshore gas field is shut could geopolitical tensions threaten the nation's Ambitions to grow its gas [Music] exports Russia's invasion of Ukraine spurred a global rush to buy military equipment last year defense spending across the world hit more than $2 trillion dollar that is the highest level since at least the end of the Cold War that's according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute now the surge in armed sales has boosted the bottom lines of Defense Giants military contractors and investors are now all eyeing an explosion in financial turns as the war on Gaza drives up demand for arms in Israel shares in Lockheed RTX Northrop groomin and General Dynamics have all risen sharply since hamas's attack on Israel on October the 7th and while the Aerospace and weapon sector as a whole has seen an increase of 7% in value this is of course as thousands of people have been killed in Gaza entire neighborhoods flattened and even hospitals attacked during Israel 's military offensive on the Strip the UN warns war crimes may have been committed by both sides of the conflict well military contractors discussed how the war could be good for their business during their company earnings calls that's according to report published by The Guardian newspaper and the responsible statecraft Think Tank General Dynamics Executive Vice President of Technologies and Chief Financial Officer Jason akan was quoted saying the following you know the Israel situation obviously is a terrible one frankly and one that's just evolving as we speak but I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of that the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side meanwhile the Biden Administration is set to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weapons to Israel and US defense companies are ramping up production to meet the increase in demand miny contractors direct sales to clients represent a major portion of the global arms trade us arms manufacturers commercial sales abroad authorized by the Pentagon reached nearly $154 billion last year Well joining us now from London is Andrew Feinstein he's the executive director of Shadow World investigations also the author of the book The Shadow world inside the global arms trade many thanks for joining us on counting the cost so we have seen this surge in demand for defense companies defense shares is that something you see that will continue for a while oh absolutely these these companies and their share prices obviously thrive on conflicts especially the sort of conflict that we're seeing um in Palestine at the moment where there is a constant need for new equipment particularly what we call ordinance so missiles and bombs because as Israel drops bombs on Gaza they need to replenish those that stock immediately so that is a huge boom to these companies so you'll see a company like Lockheed Martin has seen an increase of 18% in its share price over the past month um since the second the 7th of October and is it us companies US contractors mainly who are benefiting from this or is this European manufacturers and UK manufacturers as well so the prime beneficiary is obviously the United States what is sometimes referred to as the military-industrial complex or the defense companies in the US the US supplies anywhere between 70 and 90% of all of Israel's military hardware that it imports from outside of Israel itself but Britain Germany Italy in particular follow fairly close behind for the remainder of that so companies like BAE Systems tson crook Leonardo would benefit alongside the locked Martins the northr grummond the Rons or RTX as it's now called and General Dynamics so it's a combination of American companies and European weapons makers as we heard me mention earlier I mean we we've heard how some defense companies been criticized for framing the Israel Gaza conflict as good for their bottom lines but they are in the business of selling weapons aren't they so it's not a surprise that war is good for business well no it's not but it raises a whole range of questions about the morality of this business I mean how I describe the business in in my book is a business that counts its profits in the billions but its losses are actually counted in human lives so I don't think the fact that war and conflict is good for their business should necessarily allow us to say that you know when rathon or RTX CEO Greg Hayes says as he did just the other day the fresh new contracts resulting from Israel's bombardment of Gaza would mean that across our entire portfolio we're going to see a benefit of this restocking this doesn't let them off the hook and in fact it's even arguable that they might have a case to answer for in terms of possible complicity in violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes when it comes to the US I believe us defense contractors need approval from the US government to sell weapons overseas so does that moral decision then fall on the US well in some senses but the reality of arms export controls in the US and in European countries in the United Kingdom is that these controls while they exist on paper in theory are barely utilized in practice so for instance the United Kingdom a few years ago issued what it calls an open license for ex ort to Israel so we don't actually know the Quantum of military equipment that Britain has exported to Israel because this license allows companies like BAE Systems and others to export as much as they want to Israel without any sort of authorization the same has just happened in the United States where they're talking about this massive new 106 billion authorization um to a number of what it would describe as friendly or Allied countries but in the case of Israel with that $106 billion almost 4 billion of that doesn't require any authorization at all so the moral impetus lies both with lawmakers and the executive members of government who are effectively giving themselves free reign to export as much as they want to Israel but also with the companies and yes it's good for company business but because you're going to get get an enhanced return for shareholders doesn't in any way negate the moral compromises of what your business is and what it's contributing to in Gaza at the moment we now have two big ongoing conflicts the war in Ukraine and of course uh the Israel Gaza war is there enough out there is there enough weapons out there to meet the demand uh caused by these conflicts sadly there is there is more than enough Weaponry that is produced in the world 40% of It produced by the United States itself there is more than enough Weaponry to go around in all of these conflicts and we shouldn't forget that what the situation in Gaza does is it also makes other conflict prone areas like Yemen for instance in a much more febrile position so it is quite possible that the insecurity the instability that we are seeing in Palestine could actually have impact on Yemen where there has been both a formal and informal ceasefire in place for a while but the sad reality is that there is more than enough military material or equipment to go around for the conflicts that are taking place and for any others that might arise Andrew Feinstein really good to get your thoughts executive director of Shadow World investigations thank you thanks meanwhile Belgian transport workers unions called on their workers to refuse handling armed shipments for Israel they said loading or offloading weapons would mean supplying organizations that kill innocent people the union cited a genocide is underway in Palestine while workers have seen armed shipments going in the direction of the war now Israel says it is targeting Hamas and not civilians in Gaza protesters supporting Palestinians blocked a US military ship allegedly carrying weapons for Israel at the Port of Tacoma in Washington Israel has received nearly $130 billion dollar in US security assistance since its Creation in 1948 that's more than any other country in the world now as a war on Gaz intensifies more American weapons including smart bombs and interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense system are being delivered to Israel President Joe Biden has vowed to keep supplying the nation with what it needs to boost its defenses Democrats and Republicans broadly agree on military aid to Israel but both parties have attached conditions to the bill Heidi Jo Castor reports from Washington DC with just a handful of members voicing any qualms about sending more US military aid to Israel the question isn't whether the US Congress will approve the Israeli aid but rather how and when this is not about party or politics this about the security of our world security of the United States of America President Joe Biden wants Congress to send $4 billion to Israel and as part of the same legislative package $60 billion to Ukraine the polls show public support for Ukraine among Americans is falling with conservative voters in particular expressing concerns about a growing US government deficit we want to protect our our and help and assist our friend uh Israel but we have to keep our own house in order as well the Republican controlled house took on the aid proposal first removing the money for Ukraine and insisting the money for Israel be offset by budget cuts to the Internal Revenue Service that's despite warnings the measure would reduce tax collection and ironically increase the deficit so no the House GOP proposal is not going anywhere it's it's it's it's going to it's dead before it even is voted on Democrats control the Senate and support keeping aid for Israel and Ukraine together in one package and in a rare sign of bipartisanship most Senate Republicans agree a break from their party members in the house everybody knows how strongly I feel about helping Ukraine and Israel like Israel Ukraine was the victim of an unprovoked attack by a repeat violent offender the US currently sends $3.8 billion a year to Israel it sent 124 billion since Israel's founding now the Senate is drawing up its own bill that puts money for Israel and Ukraine together in one package which is sure to tee up a showdown with the house version one that will have to be resolved before any money leaves the country Heidi Joe Castro for counting the cost Washington joining us now from New York is Colin Clark he's the director of research at the sufan group which is a global intelligence and security consultancy and a nonresident senior fellow in the National Security program of the foreign policy Research Institute thank you for joining the program I think it may surprise some to learn that Israel has been the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since the 1940s with most of that money spent on Military Support why have the US been giving Israel so much cash a small rich country and for so long well it doesn't surprise uh me or or most of the people uh in my circle I mean it's a common uh topic of discussion uh Israel Egypt as well uh receiving large amounts of US foreign assistance a lot of it dates back to the relationship with the US uh being one of Israel's primary backers and you know throughout uh you you know the US political system very strong links between Israel and the and the United States as one of Washington's closest allies for a very long time and is there bipartisan support for this military aid within Congress because there were some hurdles recently with the latest Aid package by and large there seems to be bipartisan support uh probably more so for Israel at this point then for Ukraine uh as that conflict continues to to drag on um I think it's fatigue excuse me I think it's fatigue that the conflict has been going on for his long people were expecting different results I think there was a lot of optimism that the ukrainians would defeat the Russians and now we're kind of it's the bright shiny object r on to the the new issue and people are paying attention to this until this gets old it's it's really the kind of EB and flow of uh I guess the amount of attention that the US public can pay to a specific issue at one time there are some polls that suggest that there are some Democrats Al in the minority who are not supportive of this military aid to Israel do you see at some point their numbers increase uh very likely uh over time especially as we continue to see civilian deaths I mean the numbers are staggering uh the images are are horrifying and so the longer this goes on uh you know frankly I think uh the more revulsion there will be at the just the the really high lethality count and uh there will be growing calls for ceasefire for humanitarian pause and for diplomatic pressure to bring an end to the conflict does the US Administration give this military aid to Israel unconditionally or are there caveats attached for example protecting the rights of innocent civilians I don't think any Aid is ever unconditional even if there are fewer strings attached to uh military aid to Israel it's always something that any us Administration is going to be looking at the US has continuously attempted to pressure the Israelis to uh you know to to mine civilian casualties uh it's just you're you're talking about fighting in a dense Urban environment which makes that incredibly difficult uh and I think again uh these images that are coming out are having a real impact globally but also on the US population domestically uh and as we see that we see Rising protests and demonstrations including on college campuses uh calling for the administration to uh to to really try to press harder for a ceasefire yeah I mean that's what I was going to ask you do you think we are seeing finally a moment where ordinary Americans even politicians are finally starting to question this Aid that has been going military aid that's been going to Israel for so many years I really hope so I I think you know it makes sense to take a step back and take stop stock of uh where the United States is sending money and what that money is being used for we saw this a couple of years ago uh with US military aid uh and weaponry that was being sent to the Saudis that was being used in the uh in the Yemen conflict right and and just some of the again devastating images coming out of Yemen pressure building on uh the administration to pull back uh and pull back support to that conflict to to to the Waring sides in that conflict so uh there's always going to be a reassessment but I would also caution not to overestimate the the US Public's uh interest in in foreign policy because uh issues that tend to decide elections are domestic largely and so I think there's a fleeting interest at the moment uh and that likely breaks down along demographic lines I think the younger generation tends to be far more passionate uh than than some older uh older generations and and you know just look at the polling uh for that for proof of that yeah I I'll pick you up on that the fact that Americans when it comes to voting are affected by domestic issues I guess the issue would be if this ends up costing their bottom line I mean there's been some concern isn't there that uh in order to pay for this uh it's people on the ground that may have to pay for it yeah 100% And I think if you look around the country there's a lot of areas within the United States where people are suffering they're you know uh out of work uh you know food inse and so there's a lot of questions of people saying why are we sending all this money overseas when we have so much work to do here at home and I think look that's a fair question right and that's something that should be part of the political debate there was the third Republican debate in Miami uh and and these are issues that uh need to be asked to politicians right who are running for political office why is this happening yeah very good to talk to you Colin Clark director of the research at the sufan group thank you thank you Israel is a significant gas producer and exporter to countries in the Middle East the nation was aiming to expand its export routs to Europe after the halt of Russian supplies but production at Israel's second largest offshore field was suspended on October the 9th after Hamas launched its attack on the country Rising geopolitical tensions could hurt investments in The Wider region and threaten Israel's plans to grow its exports now according to report by the consulting firm BDO Israel the nation's gas exports have dropped by 70% since it shut down the Tamar field that is worth more than $200 million a month well the field supplies the Israeli market and delivers gas to Jordan as well as Egypt which provides gas exports all the way to Europe natural gas Fields off the Israeli Coast account for nearly 70% of its power generation Israel is now seeking alternative fuel sources in order to meet its needs I'm joined now from our studio in Doha by Ahmed halali is's a practice director of the Mina region of the global Council thank you for your time sir so according to these figures by The accountancy Firm BDO Israel's exports of natural gas has dropped by 70% that sounds like a lot definitely I mean uh gas exports from Israel have plummeted by 70% and uh the the worst affected by this is its its nearest neighbors its biggest customers as as of today Egypt and Jordan the original volumes uh reaching Egypt now are 30% uh of the volumes that were reaching Egypt uh pre-war and Egypt itself was the export platform and the export infrastructure in Egypt the liquification terminals there uh Israel depended on those to then reexport its gas uh to Europe so those exports are therefore uh affected as well uh less Israeli gas is reaching International markets um and U uh internationally this will create a bit of a squeeze but with that said we shouldn't overstate the role of Israeli gas in supplying International markets because it only accounts for less than half a percent of uh International gas supply as compared for instance to a place like qar where we're sitting today which accounts for 20% of of global uh natural gas supply but in terms of Israel's own needs is it going to have to find alternative uh gas to fill the Gap well for Israel is fortunate in the sense that Tamar isn't its only active gas field it's its larger gas field also off the co the southern coast of Israel the Leviathan a much bigger field also operated by the US major uh Chevron can continue to supply and continue to step up other fields like Kish will continue to step up and meet Israel's uh Power Generation needs uh so it's energy security risks remain contained but if if the shutdown of Tamar does become a prolonged situation then will have to begin thinking about procuring gas internationally from other suppliers you talked about Egypt and Jordan to what extent are they going to be affected well respectively Egypt and Jordan uh imported U 7% and 4% of of their total gas supply uh from Egypt so um after the attacks those exports to Egypt ground to a complete halt they are incrementally back now but Egypt will is is I would say the worst affected and it has been uh since the summer when it had an unseasonably hot summer and weakened domestic production meant that Egypt was introducing rolling blackouts and has serious uh energy security situation on its hands because of uh this Interruption of Supply from Israel so Egypt is now having to buy uh from be from becoming a net exporter of natural gas is having to buy LG uh uh tankers and LG Supply from International markets and what about Europe because they were already seeing an issue in terms of Russia and receiving gas from Russia and they were looking for an alternative Supply and they turned to Israel now will they still be able to fill that Gap that Israel was filling I think they will because Israel was a marginal supplier of gas uh uh to Europe after the the the the Europeans calibrated the response to the Russian shot off of Gas by diversifying their export base so they went to Qatar and are now signing in other countries in the US and signing long-term Supply deals so I think they've they've Diversified enough to be able to weather uh this shock um uh now the war has caused a surge in in European gas prices in the Dutch uh uh forward the Dutch Benchmark that's that's looked at in order to gauge what's happening in in the gas markets uh they're 30% higher than uh October the 6th but that's not just because of what's happening in Israel and and Gaza it's what's happening in Australia with LG industrial action over there and a a shot off in a uh in a Baltic region uh pipeline so it's a multipolarity of of of factors that's causing uh Supply to be squeezed it's not just Israel okay that was really good to get your perspective Ahmed Halal practice director of the Mina region at the global Council thank you thank you very much for having me and that is
