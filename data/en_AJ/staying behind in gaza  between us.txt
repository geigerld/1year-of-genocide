since the war started my mentality was that I would never make it we go electricity no food no water we've had several air strikes that this temporary life this is the end for me here in razza so I need to make the most of it so I tried to maximize the amount of Good Deeds that I was doing and prepare myself mentally for life after death my name is Mansour Schuman I'm a Palestinian Canadian citizen journalist and between us despite leaving Gaza physically we're just getting started with the work that needs to be done a decision was made uh by myself and my wife earlier in 2022 that we wanted to live back closer to home home being a Palestine um I'm originally from Jerusalem uh my wife is originally from a town beside Gaza Strip October the 7th we woke up at the sound of thousands of rockets and we didn't know what was happening on November the 7th uh the Canadian government came back to us saying that they got approval for me and my family U to all leave Gaza I had a very open discussion with my family my wife and children would leave and I needed to be there to help the people with whatever I can even if it with as little as removing Rubble to help people get out I really hate what I'm doing now but we need to record this for the world it was the easiest decision I ever made in my life uh staying in Gaza honestly it was like um a calling from from God saying that Mansour uh you've been asking to to help people you've been asking um uh to try and tell the truth will this is your opportunity Mansour he's live in conun thank you so much Mansour for your time I believe that it was very important to continue doing what I was doing when it came to reporting news on different International TV stations radio broadcasts uh digital uh platforms and newspapers and later on that extended into the social media and into charity work we are here inside a refugee school we lived amongst you know tents inside NASA Hospital together with other journalists and social media influencers um every day we would lose a a member of our family a member or two or a member of our family would lose their own relatives the most difficult thing in my opinion is seeing the children suffer I remember seeing um a little girl standing on the top of her mother and father who were killed and she was crying on top of them and telling them dad mom please wake up you know it's time to go home why are you still asleep and image like that uh will will never leave my head uh watching these scenes day in day out I think this was the most difficult part of all of this I went with a few friends to check on the progress of the work we were doing a lot of charity work we had built 30 tents and we were going to up to 100 and to our surprise for the first time ever we found that there were Israeli troops like rushing with with their vehicles with their tanks and we saw people fleeing uh that area and we had to flee with them into kanun refugee camp so that was the start of me being away for 2 weeks away from any kind of internet connection because we tried to find a safe way back to ner hospital but we couldn't do that for 2 weeks because we were bombed by f-16s alhamdulillah after several attempts we were able to make it here back to n Hospital the second time I went missing they were were bulldozing the IDF the main gates of NASA Hospital attacking the schools around us so I decided with a few friends to make a run for it and we jumped over the west side of the wall of nasar hospital and avoided being shot by a sniper who killed two of my friends and injured one of them we made our way inside of kanun and again another two weeks this time between ruins after I came back to Naser you know I didn't find any of my my personal items so that included my phone my laptop everything all I had in my pocket was my passport and my wallet and I felt lost like I felt that wow like what what added value can I now do to the world like I can't continue my charity work because you know they've basically just bombarded canas to the ground I couldn't communicate with the outside world so um I contacted the Canadian government the the Consulate in Jerusalem I told him that look um I think it's time for me to to leave I felt that it was a mistake to leave Gaza I felt that I let my people down but then friends and family members told me that Mansour you don't need to be physically there in Gaza you know maybe you can add more value while outside until now I still feel I should have been in Gaza but the plan is to go back there this is our land this is our home
