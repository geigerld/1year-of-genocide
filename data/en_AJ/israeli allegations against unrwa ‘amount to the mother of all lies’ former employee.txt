an independent review of the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees has found that Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of its accusations unwa employees are members of Hamas and linked to the October 7th attacks on Israel the report by a former French foreign minister found Staffing lists had regularly been provided for vetting since 2011 but Israel did not raise concerns since that claim was made in January many countries cut their funding to unwa including the biggest funders the US Germany and the EU unwa supports 5.9 million people across five territories Gaza the occupied West Bank Lebanon Jordan and Syria often providing the basic necessities of life from food to schools and even infrastructure in refugee camps we'll bring in Gabriel eando who's joining us now from the United Nations Headquarters in New York Gabriel what is the takeaway message from this report and what more are we learning at this hour I think the takeaway message is very clear that uh this report gives a clean bill of health to unra when it comes to the issues of neutrality in fact they don't have any issues of neutrality that's the major takeaway here this report uh by Katherine Colona and three European human rights organizations was an independent report it lasted nearly three months for them to collect data they speak to over spoke to over 200 different people in interviews reviewed thousands of documents and visited unra offices and other offices in the region to reach their conclusions I'll read a couple key lines from here when it comes to neutrality the report states that unra possesses a more developed approach to neutrality than other similar un or NGO uh entities a more developed approach it also said that when it comes to uh unra staff members 32,000 of which uh work for unra uh it said that uh unra regularly gives entire lists of their employees uh information to Israel and at no time has Israel uh since 2011 ever come back to unra to say that they had any problem with any of the unra employees unra has extensive vetting processes according to this report report and vetting processes that are reviewed periodically including with their Freelancers they have 5,000 employees that are not full-time staff members and they go through the same vetting process and the same neutrality training that the full-time staff members do and in conclusion as you mentioned uh the report states that Israel of course has identified what they say are 12 unre employees that took part uh in October 7th and are affiliated with Hamas uh this report says confirms what we've been hearing from the secretary General's spokesperson for many months now that Israel has given no evidence of that to the investigators uh during this during the rep this report and their findings all right thank you so much Gabriel isand thanks for that update from the United Nations here's a look at unas assistance for Palestinians so the UN agency supports nearly 6 million Palestinian refugees right across the Middle East it runs 706 schools and 140 Primary Health Care Facilities it also provides food and cash assistance to more than 1.8 million Palestinians most of them in Gaza it employs about 13,000 staff 178 of whom have been killed in the Israeli attack since October the 7th more than 164 unaa facilities have been destroyed during the war and the US is the agency's biggest donor in 2023 it contributed $422 million to unwa we can now bring in Chris gunnis who's a former un spokesman joining us from London as someone who knows the agency so well Chris gunnis just give me your sort of initial reading to the findings of this report well I welcome this report and I think unra will welcome it because it confirms that unra is an indispensable Lifeline for the people of the Middle East the refugees it also confirms unra has established significant number of mechanisms and procedures to ensure compliance with humanitarian principles particularly neutrality and it says anra possesses a more robust approach neutrality than any other un or NGO organization this is key because right now there's this big debate about should other agencies take over should world food program do the food distributions in Northern Gaza well koder is saying unra has better neutrality mechanisms than all of these others and perhaps most significant Colona is saying clearly that though Israel has made these public claims about a large number of UNR employees that they are allegedly members of terrorist organizations evidence of this in other words these allegations that triggered this crisis remain unsubstantiated it would seem that the Israeli claims amount to the mother of all lies based on a dodgy and if I may just make one last point on the curriculum which you know this is often used as a stick to be HRA the technical report on which the colonal report is based says very clearly that anra has and I quote it's responsive to criticism of its textbooks and has initiated a range of initiatives to ensure neutrality of the teaching material it finds that unas education policies updated guidelines and manuals have become robust and adequate for purpose that I think is a ringing endorsement of unra even though it comes up with some proposals for donor relations and staff oversight but by and large I'm delighted with this report and I think H will embrace it before we talk about the proposals let me just ask you this I mean during your time at on did you ever witness sort of violations of the principles of humanitarian neutrality and how rigorous were the standards of neutrality for unwa well let's talk about the context because when you're dealing with occupation blockade the dispossession of the Palestinians that began in 1948 well of course there are going to be some bad apples and yes of course in the situation of War there will be neutrality problems the key test is not the problems but how unra has responded and anra as Colona has found has robust Mech mechanisms in place I am lived experience of the fact that whenever there were credible reports of neutrality violations HRA would would always investigate disciplinary action would always be taken up to an including dismissal from the agency and guess what we did that for years to the satisfaction of our major donors in 2017 for example there was a major audit by the American government audit office and after that root and Branch audit They carried on giving unra 350 millionar a year and that's why I say to the UK in particular but others they need to look at this report and say say we are providing you with a ladder on which to climb down to come back it's clear that UNR processes are robust and there is no longer any reason to continue withholding money from this agency which is doing life-saving work across the Middle East will these suggestions put forward in the report such as uh expanding the capacity of the internal oversight service providing more in-person training more support from donor countries do you think that these uh proposals are enough to appease those donors that have cut funding like the UK and the US well the donors know full well that in partnership with them unra has been using these very mechanisms that Colona is highlighting for years so yes I think the donors know very well that unra does have these donor relations mechanisms these oversight mechanisms in place yes of course more can always be done but I think the donors know very well what is there because unra has been working transparently with them for decades implementing this robust Zero Tolerance policy so yes it's time for the donors to come back okay Chris Gunners thank you we thank you for joining us out of London thank you very much we're now joined by our diplomatic editor James baz here in the studio James how damning is this report for Israel well Israel has made some very very serious allegations ations if you make serious allegations normally you're supposed to come up with some evidence to prove those allegations the UN has repeatedly said that it has not been provided by these with this information there's a separate report being done by the office of internal oversight that's another part of the UN they haven't got the information they want from Israel so if Israel is not providing the evidence why is Israel not providing the evidence and are these completely unfounded allegations that that is the simple question that is begged by by by by by the situation on the ground and when it comes to this issue that I was just discussing actually with Chris gunnis he raised it that one of the allegations that Israel uh puts forward is that unwa schools across the region use textbooks with anti-semitic content in them I'm not sure if you've taken a look at the entire report but from what you've seen has there been any evidence of that whatsoever and that is a repeated allegation that's been made by Israel no there isn't and um I I think it's worth saying that there are many figures in Israel who do not want anra to exist they've long not wanted anra to exist and one of the reasons for that I think is because unra provides state-like services and yes it's operated by the UN as a UN agency but it's Palestinians doing the work so it is a sort of part of a de facto Palestinian State also unra doesn't just work in East Jerusalem Gaza and the West Bank it also works in Syria in Lebanon in Jordan Andra is that link between the Palestinians who are there on Palestinian soil and the refugees the refugees who want a right to return who the UN when it set up um unra was assuming were going to go back home and that's a link that Israel doesn't like at all because that goes against the Israeli long-standing policy of not returning refugees absolutely absolutely um what about the um the issue of when the allegations came out back in January we saw a whole host of countries of course cut their funding to Ona some which restored it but we know that the UK and the US still have not do you think that this report is going to make a difference this is this is where the damage I think has already been done because there is now a bill that's gone through Congress saying the US is not allowed to restore the funding to unra until 2025 um well the US last year was $371 Million us that's a third of the funding from unra at a time when anra are the main body on the ground doing the work with such a dreadful cost to to their staff on the ground unra is needed more than ever many would say and that that dent of a third of the funding for the US and that's not coming back we know that because of uh because of congressional legislation in the UK uh they were waiting for this Colona report but already in the ruling conservative party very pro-israel MPS quite prominent some of them are saying no no we shouldn't give the funding um so these allegations even though there's no evidence to support the allegations are still doing damage and that means damage to those people on the ground in Gaza those that so desperately need humanitarian Aid a place where people have had nearly 7even months of bombardment and where people are dying now of famine okay and we'll wait to see what impact this report actually has but for the time being
