thank you for joining us we begin in Gaza where Israeli strikes have targeted displaced Palestinians in the southern part of the strip at least 15 people were killed in can Unis when Israeli Rockets struck a number of tents in the alasi neighborhood the injured were taken to Al AXA Hospital in Dar Al Bala for treatment more air strikes on residential buildings have also been reported in B lahia in Northern Gaza several Palestinians were killed there let's get an update with our correspondent on the ground h who joins us on the phone from Rafa so bring us up to speed with the situation this morning these latest strikes in KH Unis first yes well so far what we're looking at despite the devastation and the desperate humanitarian uh situations across the Gaza Strip there seems to be no lit up in the attacks across the Gaza Strip and we literally means everywhere every inch of the godp has been targeted within the past 24 hours but the worst of what happened is the fact that people at Al maasi evacuation Zone the very particular area where people since the initial weeks of this genocidal War were told and Order uh sharply by the Israeli military to evacuate to because it's a safe Zone it came under heavy bombardment we're looking at at least 15 people mostly women and children elderly who already had suffer from Health complications and miserable living condition all transfer reported to Al Hospital death in the in city but again an incident like this for a lot of people when we heard uh uh people expressing their frustration over the fact that it is happening in a in a a supposedly a safe Zone that shatters any remaining sense of Safety and Security for and already traumatized large portion of the population and the fact that they are intense really experiencing a problem yeah and they're being attacked and this is not the first time by the way it's just important to point out to our viewers this is probably the third time we've seen a maasi evacuation Zone come be coming under heavy aerial bombardment yeah that that uh area Al maasi has come under attack several times by the Israelis and I understand honey hospitals in the south are overwhelmed right now and injured people are actually being transported to the central area for treatment yes well the the casualties of this tragic attacks on alasi evacuation Zone were all transferred to Al hospital that's City and already overwhelmed exhausted health facilities and it's the only one in the Central Area providing services for the hundreds of thousand of people residents and displaced families in the area but since the uh the beginning of this genocidal War it has been experiencing lots of complications that including the insufficient medical staff available at the hospital the uh extreme shortage of medical supplies necessarily needed for medical intervention and saving lives the hospital is a midsize health facility doesn't have enough space to accommodate EV evacu L alone people with injuries coming to reported to the hospital so literally we're looking at the health facility where where its rooms are packed with injuries and and people evacuating inside the the the buildings also the corridors it's hard to even walk from one room to another from floor to another because of uh it's overcrowded right now and and that's why because people are taking it as a shelter and it's just becoming very difficult uh for doctors and for the medic team to provide anything necessary to save lives right now thank you honey for the update that's Al jazer is honey Mahmud on the line there from arfa in southern Gaza
