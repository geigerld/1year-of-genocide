we're joined Now by mansur Schuman he's a can Unice resident and Canadian citizen who chose to remain in Gaza to report on the war thank you very much for your time um firstly where are you now and what's happening around you I'm in nasar hospital nasar hospital is basically a very big Refugee center now it's also has a very big meia presence with access to electricity around the clock and an internet connection to allow us to communicate with the outside world continuously and what are you seeing at nasad hospital today on the second day after the ceasefire ended I'm seeing a continuous influx of displaced civilians coming this time from the eastern part of K Yunis where the IDF has gone 100 meters into the Gaza Strip inside Gara uh uh right now uh if you come into R Hospital you will find people from all over gazda strip north east west south n hospital is now slowly becoming the US shifa hospital I believe where people from all over the city are coming and and seeing it as the refugee Center for them everywhere you will find people trying to find a place to sleep to set up a tent for their families and patients trying to find anyone to try to take care of them and lying down on the hospital floors in order to have something operated on or something medication being applied on there Mr Schuman it's interesting that you're saying that NASA hospital has become like the new Al shifer Hospital which was gaza's largest medical facility and was bombed repeatedly Israel said that it did that that it was bombing Al shiffer because Hamas had a command center there now Israel is saying that Hamas has a Command Center in K Yunis where you are which makes it a war zone how are people there reacting to that yes yesterday Le were dropped on the people telling is now considered a war zone and that is dangerous and they should leave um people honestly have no no no other place to go because if they decide to leave ra no one there is no place left in ra for them to stay in and they believe that if if the IDF comes into kanun and pushes people even further out of then this means they will be forced outside of which means 1948 and 1967 thankfully until now the IDF didn't say that n hospital has a command and control center run by Hamas hence we think that until now we are safe here okay however several air strike belts please continue yeah several air strike belts around Naser Hospital uh continue throughout the day throughout last night something which we didn't um we didn't feel we didn't hear we didn't see in the first 50 days we feel it's a different kind of escalation now happening on KH unun even though before the ceasefire 44% of the casualties from the south which was regarded as safe by the IDF but now we are seeing full force uh missile strikes from the air from the Easter the land from the from the tanks on the land and from the warships in the sea continuous strikes here onun I think you heard the latest news about for example Med hammed hammed City which uh which basically was assisted and helped re build by the government yeah Mr Schuman what you're describing unfolding around you why did you decide to risk your life and stay in Gaza when you are a foreign National you could have left uh it's a privilege it's an honor to be here it's it's my duty uh it's my religious it's my humanitarian duty to be here if everyone uh uh leaves then who will stay to help the people here uh 2.3 million Palestinian civilians here are all my family the free people of the world are all my family the people here in are not just standing for Palestinians they are standing for the truth they are standing for what's right they believe in positive change not only for people in razza but for the whole world these are the values that we stand up for and we believe that we need to strive for and as long as I have a soul and a heart pumping in my heart I will continue my duty to getting the truth out and helping the people on the ground in any means possible together with many thousands of other volunteers here on the ground Mr Shuman we thank you very much for your time we wish you all the best that is Mansour Shuman live and kind Unice
