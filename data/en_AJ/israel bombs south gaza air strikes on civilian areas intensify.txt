well it's now 11 GMT that's just past 1:00 in the afternoon in Gaza where Israel is continuing its bombardment and ground incursion Israeli Jets and artillery have been hitting residential buildings and refugee camps in the strip including in southern Gaza where Israel had previously told Palestinians to flee intense fighting is now underway between Israeli forces and Palestinian Fighters inside Gaza City and the military wing of Hamas has fired a large barrage of rockets as you can see towards Israel Israeli military officials say some 250 Rockets have been launched since Friday morning Asad be begins our coverage Children Are Meant to play in the dirt but in Gaza it's their shroud the bombing has continued in areas that the Israeli military said were safe I was asleep I woke up I found myself under the rubble I didn't find anything all around me was logs and rocks I tried to move but I couldn't because there were a lot of rocks I kept screaming and calling for the people men came and carried me they put me in the ambulance civil defense teams frantically Traverse narrow streets of Han unus in the South Palestinians homes and lives continue to be ripped apart many have already moved from the north to the South making these areas even more densely populated than before when the Civil Defense teams came they were confronted by an unimaginable scene a residential area consisting of more than 50 houses as for the testimonies of the civilians and residents stating that this Square was highly populated by residents and internally displaced people it was targeted by more than 10 bombs launched by Israeli occupation forces we're talking here about hundreds killed the ceasefire has ended with more Bloodshed in Gaza there's fewer Hospital hospitals operating fewer emergency vehicles and if this rate of killing continues fewer Palestinians left in the Gaza Strip Asad B Al jazer well Israel's Army has issued new orders to further displace people in southern Gaza an area that was already declared safe Israel says it's now dividing the entire Gaza Strip into zones as you can see to let people know which areas to leave it's now saying that these districts you can see here in yellow in the town of Kan that's the largest city in the South they'll become Areas with heavy fighting Israel is ordering people to rather move to these three refugee camps here now the wording of the displacement leaflet suggests that the survival of Palestinians is now their own responsibility let's take a look at the situation on the ground after Israel isolated Gaza City up in the north its troops have been pushing further south along the strip's main artery you can see it there in Black that's the Salah Aline road we have reports that there's been fighting all the way down here in Al carara that's just about 5 km Northeast of Kan yunas now while Israel is telling Palestinians in conun to move further south towards Rafa as you can see there on the border with Egypt it's also been shelling the main roads leading to that area now one of the few remaining options to travel between gaza's north and south is that black Coastal Road there the al- rashed road but Israeli military vessels along the Mediterranean Coastline have direct line of fire over that and they've been shooting at Vehicles traveling along it well let's get more now from the ground in Gaza we can speak to hanim Mahmud he's in Kan yunas in the southern Gaza Strip honey are people following these evacuation orders I mean in Practical terms can they well so far it's very difficult to follow these instructions giving that the areas that have been ordered to evacu with are very very densely populated areas and then even when we look at uh the fact that if people wanted to follow these instructions and move to the designated areas we look at a very difficult situations on the ground in terms of roads and infrastructure for example salahadin Road has been destroyed the very area that connects the central part with the southern part of kanun it has been destroyed so people who are inside the central part are unable to evacuate even though like the central part is under heavy bombardment and earlier this week earlier of of last week they were ordered to evacuate to some new designated areas but here people in kanun City particularly at the Eastern side of Han unit the fact that the entire area has been divided into small zones blocks number the blocks very close to each other very dense in terms of population h it's very hard to move from one block to another to get to your safe area without passing through an already marked block that is dangerous so the the the the likelihood of of of dying in another block while moving to a safe area supposedly is very very high in addition that the uh the Israeli narrative is not is not well received here uh and because the lack of faith and a trust in what the is reallyi military is doing now for the world watching this M they might believe that okay the Israeli military is doing its best to have people avoiding being bombed but the fact on the ground for someone who is unfamiliar with the Gaza Strip and its geography and the density of the population it's very difficult here it's very difficult for people to move from one place to another and even the designated new areas are small pocket of of of sand areas that lacks a NE Necessities in terms of water supp supplies a food supply a Transportation uh uh people cannot get there easily now not only the road between the central part and center part is has been destroyed but also between Khan unun and RAF the very area the people were told to moveed to has also been destroyed so people end up walking to those areas it takes very long time unable to carry all of their belongings some of them this is their third time of evacuation to the supposedly safe areas it's the situations on the ground are very very difficult some people are making a decision of staying where they at because they say there's no difference of dying here or elsewhere in Gaza honey you're describing an Ever shrinking space for people and you mentioned there how difficult it is for people to get supplies especially as they're being crammed increasingly into these areas how are people holding up especially now that it seems that Aid is being restricted again too well sadly the people are going more hungry right now and and more thirsty as there's no access to clean water to drink people are resorting to either salty water coming directly from the sea or or contaminated water that has already proven to be very unhealthy and very bad for human consumption and we' seen example of of of cases of a spread of of infectious disease as reported by The Who and here at local Medical Teams report about cases of of new diseases the sprad of infectious diseases as a a result of consuming contaminated water but in terms of other supplies it's very very difficult whatever is available here in the southern part was was barely enough even with the with the entrance of a humanitarian a was barely enough for the resident of the Sun but with with 1.5 million people a little over than this of evacuees and this place the needs are more dire people tend when they are this place to consume more and to to be in need of more supplies compared to time when they are busy and going through their day-to-day activities the right now there is a need for more of those of humanitarian aided trucks but since the end of the Seas fire and the blocks that have been placed on the inurance of the Seas on on humanitarian Aid things started to to get very difficult so far there are three elements we should consider people haven't been at work for the past period today is the 56 days of the War uh no work no payroll people lack the necessary cash markets are empty even if you have the flow of cash available it's hard to fight the basic needs that you want from the market and if it's found the price prices are double and for some items has it tripled beyond the financial capabilities of the vast majority of the people here in in the southern part or or in the northern part of the Gaza Strip let's just remind everyone Gaza Strip has been under a blockade for the past 16 years already people are in poverty in extreme needs of support and and humanitarian Aid and we the P were multiple hundreds of NOS helping and supporting the population now without out of the picture the the the situations are very difficult and and and there is there is an immediate need for an intervention to save what's remaining of this of this Society honey mmud there reporting for us live from the ground and khun in the southern part of the Gaza Strip thank you honey
