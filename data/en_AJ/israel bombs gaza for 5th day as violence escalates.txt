hello we begin with the latest confrontation between Palestinian fighters in Gaza and Israel which is now in its fifth day in the past few hours Israel has bombed one house in B lahia in the northern Gaza Strip and others in Gaza City at least 33 Palestinians have been gilled since the bombardments began on Tuesday Rockets have also been fired from Gaza in the morning triggering warning sirens in southern Israel this comes as Egypt and the United Nations seek to secure ceasefire in just a moment we'll be hearing from Villa Marx who's standing by for us in the south of Escalon that's near the border with Gaza but first let's get an update from yumna say who's joining us from Gaza itself so tell us about the latest air strikes yumna yes Daren well uh the Israeli air strikes have intensified a lot this morning actually uh many homes have been targeted I'm talking about five story bu uh five homes uh three story buildings uh at least each home of them uh uh just this morning uh in B Lya in B hanon two in Gaza City one in and another inuk while two in beun and and and in b as I mentioned now uh uh there was a very cautious calm in retaliation by the palan factions uh in the past uh morning hours but then as MERS hundreds of MERS were caring and saying goodbye to Yad alhassani the latest Islamic Jihad uh commander who was killed yesterday in an assassination in his apartment in a ner city as they mourned him and took him to the cemetery where he was buried uh the barrages of rockets by the Palestinian factions have resumed uh towards the Israeli towns uh many of them have been going on uh just in these past few minutes Darin also I want to uh mention the targeting of B Cemetery by an Israeli air strike that just took uh a part a couple of minutes ago uh part of the cemetery was destroyed uh yumna so do you get the sense on the ground that things are then heading towards morph an escalation or towards uh some sort of ceasefire well the let me tell you about the latest statement by Al brigades the military wing of Islamic Jihad they said in front of the continuation of the assassinations and the bombing of apartments and civilian homes the Palestinian resistance will renew its mile bombardment of the occupied cities confirming the continuation of the confrontation and the Revenge of the free that's the operation called by the Palestinian factions uh they also added that the resistance has prepared itself for months of Confrontation now from all the bombardment that we have been witnessing last night and all uh morning hours uh now the retaliation of uh the exchange of fire between both sides uh they have these these confrontations do not show any uh signs of uh a soon or a a near or even a fruitful uh effort of any uh mediations towards a ceasefire and this has rised the the tension here the fear among the civilians and residents as we are going into uh the fifth day of a a continuous Israeli attack and a continuous exchange of fire between both sides thank you yum say thank you for that update from Gaza let's time bring in vill Marx he's joining us south of Escalon that's near the border with Gaza so villm what have you seen uh where you are well right now I can hear a a presumably Israeli military jet right above my head just about 60 seconds ago there was a very loud explosion directly above us in the distance there is a a long plume a trail from a projectile that looks to be one of the long range missiles that's been of great concern to the Israeli military over the last few days and in the last 10 minutes or so we've certainly seen a couple of the smaller plumes of smoke indicating that the Iron Dome the defense mechanism has been intercepting lower trajectory Rockets here here we've seen warning sirens have been going off not just in the smaller communities close to Gaza as happened early this morning but also in ashalon the city just a few kilometers up the road and then further up the coast in the city of azod an indication again that these longer range missiles are effectively getting through some of the Iron Dome mechanisms no report so far of any of the projectiles coming from Gaza landing on homes or of any casualties but one thing when we talk about the possibility of DS escalation is important to emphasize the deputy secretary of state for the United States Wendy Sherman has been talking she said on Twitter to the Strategic affairs minister here in Israel Ron durma calling for a deescalation in an attempt to try and Safeguard lives here okay thank you vill marks reporting from ashalon so the United Nations population fund for Palestine says that at least 417 people or more than 70 families have been internally displaced by the escalation of the conflict there are an estimated 47,000 pregnant women in Gaza giving birth to some 150 babies every single day we can now speak to Dominic Allen who's the United Nations population fund representative for Palestine uh Dominic Allen welcome to Al jazer I understand that you've been usually based in Jerusalem uh you've been stuck in Gaza since uh the latest fighting and the latest escalation began so uh can you just give us first of all your initial thoughts on what you've seen and heard in Gaza and particularly what are the biggest challenges women are facing as a result of this uh bombardment well thank you very much for having myself and unfp on your show today Daren um indeed we I'm speaking to you from the middle of Gaza where I hear from my window the Rockets exploding and getting a a sense of the escalation from from right in the middle of Gaza for for the UN for un FBA we're really concerned about the impact of the escalation and the impact of is having an exacerbating an already very difficult humanitarian situation this is uh one of the most densely populated places in the world with a huge amount of vulnerable people and children um for us for for un FBA our major concern is the impact of this escalation on on women and girls like you said especially pregnant women girls uh pregnant girl pregnant women and domestic violence survivors this Health Care system in Gaza it was already on its knees following the longterm blockade and the impact that that's had right these latest attacks have really made the situation worse all Gaz the numbers we have so far uh are are that at least three women have have been killed in Gaza so what sort of measures then are being taken by organizations like yours by the United Nations to protect the rights of women and to ensure their safety during these times Well indeed I think all gazans have have the right to live a life free of fear for their lives right now our concern is about about ensuring the the the access to healthc care facilities and hospitals I spoke yesterday with uh with the head of the elifa hospital biggest maternity hospital in Gaza looking after those pregnant women and she's reporting a reduced number of women coming to those birthing facilities be out of fear they're worried by walking the streets so uh from our side we're working as part of a coordinated response to look at all parts of the sectors but for us for the pregnant women to ensure that they can receive the support that they need both access for for the regular checkups and and support supplies that are already major needs are on the ground so we we're here and we're responding that must be very difficult a difficult response though because uh it's safe to say that the the healthc care system in Gaza uh has been severely weakened not only of course by the fighting that's going on right now but also by by the occupation yes as I said the um the the long-term chronic impact comes uh has a back has a context to this current acute crisis there are major needs in Gaza already existing and the Healthcare System requires significant amounts of support for us we're looking at what we can do to support the women and girls with their sexual reproductive Health needs um we're looking to provide from our side the dignity that they require through kits providing those supplies especially for those displaced uh families and and women that you spoke of earlier we want to make sure that there are shelters available for and support services available for those women who are also suffering from domestic violence gender-based violence as well okay we'll leave it there thank you Dominic Allen we appreciate your time with us joining us from Gaza
