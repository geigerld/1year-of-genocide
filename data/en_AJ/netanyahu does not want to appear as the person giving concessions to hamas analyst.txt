M joins us in our studio in Doha he's the director of the gulf studies Center at Qatar University maub it's good to have you with us what do you make of this moment where we are in ceasefire talks this is seems like a pretty critical moment um there's going to be a war cabinet meeting this evening which will ostensibly set the Mandate for the negotiating team that is expected in Doha tomorrow um but there have been other moments where we thought ah there's movement and then those hopes have been dashed correct and since Hamas uh Rel or what basically the news leaked about what Hamas has suggested um Friday afternoon the news came from Israel that there will be a cabinet meeting Saturday evening and then Saturday evening um the news CES actually the meeting has been postponed to Sunday or or Monday but at the same time the minister of War Gallant has called to a meeting with his security leadership would basically you talk about the chief of the staff and chabak and and mad that meeting was happening where demonstration was going on on the street actually and they were listening to what being said in the street uh that meeting I consider it an important meeting because it is a message to Netanyahu that there are other voices within Israel should be listened to and those are the list those are the people in charge in Real uh uh issues when it happened uh and let's remember that shabbach uh uh director he's the person who pushed Netanyahu to accept Palestinian to go to Ala mosque to avoid any kind of uh uh confrontation with the Palestinians so he wants to say to Netanyahu there is another perspective you have to listen I consider that meeting important is a brainstorming meeting so Gant comes to the meeting today with the war cabinet with ideas with um uh suggestions so he can put on at the table Galant being the Israeli defense minister so you're saying the security establishment in Israel has already had its meeting corre to to essentially um flesh out their position on these talks and Galant will kind of be their spokesperson right I'm following what you're saying when he goes to the war cabinet meeting which is sometime later today this evening absolutely in Israel we know at this war cabinet meeting there are competing voices right there's there's Netanyahu there's G as well they may not have all the same views it it sounds like a pretty make or break War cabinet absolutely we already have a statement from Gant that you know the the the government should show some flexibility or should you know should show some of new ideas uh to uh face this proposal by Hamas and also we are hearing from another politician which J Who basically split of of uh National Unity uh front he was part of Gant uh front basically he also have a strong voice now where he he wants to be added to the war he want to be added to the cabinet War he he he criticized the government there's no clear Direction he said the military has no clear Target yesterday he made a very interesting interview where he basically undermined everything net has done so far he was saying that this war basically endless and we don't know where are we going and that was basically I think a Hummer on Netanyahu uh internally so uh so it's not only Gans it's not only laid also there is another voice criticizing him from the political sphere itself rather and looking at what happened in the military act in the military front that is more pressure on Netanyahu uh so far so again this point that there there are going to be lots of different voices correct um at this war cabinet meeting so the policy really is is being fleshed out as we speak between now and that meeting something else I want to put to you there are two meetings this evening as I understand it War cabinet meeting and then the wider cabinet meeting where the entire Israeli government correct is being ask the same question of what do we negotiate do we agree is there a deal that we could agree to with Hamas Etc two levels of decision- making well plan Netanyahu does not want to appear that he's the person who's giving concession or um giving any kind of uh uh points to Hamas basically he wanted the war cabinet to decide come with a proposal take it to the wider uh cabinet where basically SM the Minister of Finance and B fear there so that are the voices basically always supported the argument that Netanyahu has so basically we are expecting whether uh radical voices from uh the cabinet or actually accepting what the uh uh uh War cabinet suggest to The Wider cabinet it is Will planned the plan from Netanyahu to avoid criticism directed to him that person it gives him political cover Absolut he gets a wider approval correct he wants a political cover he doesn't want to go and more importantly we have to look at the Mandate issue because today there is an important mandate issue you me which I mean giving more mandate to the negotiat team setting the boundaries for the negotiating where because in in in Paris meeting he criticized the director of mad why he crossed some of the lines in previous meetings now they say okay give us the Mandate where until where we can move on the discussion we are not there just to deliver message and take a message we want to discuss issues with details and that's another issue should be determined tonight yeah how much negotiating power will they actually have when they come to Doha corre this is all fascinating stuff we'll discuss it again but but the the key takeaway here is all of this is being hammered out in Israel today in the coming hours M thank you very much my pleasure
