well Israel's military says its war on Gaza has entered a new phase and that Hamas positions all across the strip will be targeted we're pursuing Hamas wherever Hamas is hiding in the north and in the South every rocket launcher weapons Depot command and Control Center Senior Commander underground infrastructure and any Hideout where our hostages may be held our war is against Hamas not against the people of Gaza to Tel Aviv now our cross Imran standing by for us there so Imran yes this so-called new phase very much underway with things expanding in the South that's absolutely right and the south is now the key point for the Israelis now the reason for this uh say the Israelis uh even during the ceasefire they were actually telling uh Israeli citizens that and through the media uh that this is where hamas's command and control center was that this is where senior leaders including Yahya sinir was now the route into the South leads through hunis we've seen a lot of Israeli military activity in that zone that's what they call it the Palestinians call it just bombardment and that's what we've seen and we've also seen Ground Forces go in now this is very alarming to the Americans because they've said very clearly uh to the Israelis that they cannot use the same type of intensity of bombardment that they did in the north of the country but that's exactly what we're seeing and the Israeli is very clear that they will conduct this war as far as they see fit but even 59 days into the war Hamas is still able to send Rockets into uh the Gaza from Gaza into the southern communi of Israel uh the last alarm going off about 15 20 minutes ago so that's still something that's happening and that does call into question the Israeli claims that they control uh the North and the central part of the strip so all this is going on meanwhile pressure very much mounting on Benjamin netan who from the families of captives being held in Gaza we heard from them earlier today let's just have a quick listen to this we are facing a very difficult emotional situation where the heavy disaster along with this ominous Silence has led 136 families to despair we request a meeting with the war cabinet to receive updates on the fate of our family members now now not tomorrow now if you don't have time for us we will go to someone else and we will find the one who will represent us Iman what more do we know about this request for a meeting between the families and the war cabinet well there was some hope for the families just a few hours ago it was announced that they were you to meet with the Israeli War cabinet the full Israeli War cabinet around about 8:00 p.m. local then that meeting got canceled ostensibly say the Israeli uh uh spokesman for the for the government that actually we needed to get a lot more members uh of the families there that not everybody could attend but that's uh been dismissed by the families we're hearing uh that they're incredibly disappointed that this meeting didn't take place um uh the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow so the families are hopeful that they'll be able to push their case now the bring them back Campaign which is the umbrella organization that represents the families has a significantly loud voice in Israel it is a pressure group that is able uh to influence uh a certainly public opinion by taking this meeting they'll want that pressure to directly translate into pressure on the people that can actually change things and what they're looking for is a ceasefire to get more people out now now this is going to be very difficult for the Israelis because Hamas have already said that the negotiations now are over soldiers and Military aged U men and women that they have in captivity in order to release those they want a much more permanent truce and we'll leave it there for the moment thanks for that IM rank reporting there from Tel Aviv
