speaking of the American response US President Joe Biden has defended Israel's raid on gaza's largest hospital he repeated Israeli statements that Hamas had its headquarters beneath alifa but neither Israel nor the United States has provided evidence to back up those claims here's the situation you have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters their military hidden under a hospital and that's a fact that's what's happened Israel did not go in with large number of troops did not raid did not rush everything down they've gone in and they've gone in with their soldiers carrying weapons or guns they were uh told uh told let me be precise we've discussed the need for them to be incredibly careful well let's bring in Jeremy skill he's an independent journalist and a co-founder of The Intercept News website he joins us now from Frankfurt in Germany Jeremy I want to ask you about the tone of those comments there that we heard from Biden he's obviously chosen to continue doubling down on the Israeli claim that there's this Hamas Command Center in or under alifa what do you make of this call well it's it's it's not surprising I mean Joe Biden in many ways is staking his credibility right now on Israeli intelligence and the Israelis have a multi- deade track record of lying of promoting false information of releasing doctored videos the United States going back to the Iraq War certainly has its own experience with promoting false intelligence so this is a real Gamble and I think that what we've seen is Joe Biden using his uh bully pulpit as the most powerful leader of the most powerful country in the world to give cover for the Israelis to continue their rampage this is a Dresden style bombing of Gaza where the Israelis have targeted civilians yes Target Ed civilians one in 200 gazin have been killed so what I think we saw here is the president of the United States who for 50 years has been one of the staunchest backers of Israel's worst war crimes once again sticking his deck out and we're told that there's essentially like a Hamas Pentagon underneath the shifa hospital maybe that's true maybe the Israelis are going to shock the world and they're going to provide that proof um but the fact of the matter is that alifa hospital is desperately needed there are children babies who were the niku um there are babies that have died because of Israel's military operations and so what the United States is doing in the form of Joe Biden the president is co-signing uh systemic Israeli war crimes and the raising of a population of 2.2 million people one in 200 of whom have now been killed since October 7th Jeremy I was looking at a bit of the history here and if I understand correctly Israel built a bunker under alifa back in the 1980s and they spoke about it fairly open at the time so what would the discovery of an underground facility there mean if they do actually find one right and it's not uncommon for hospitals the world over to have some infrastructure underneath it especially if you're in a country where there's constant fighting and our understanding is that in 1983 uh the Israelis built uh some underground tunnels and an underground operating room so you know right off the bat we have to say this you know if the Israelis simply reveal that there are tunnels under there or a room um it's because Israel built them now what Israel alleges is that Hamas expanded that network of tunnels and built more structures uh underneath it and you know it's not a secret many journalists have met with Hamas members in or around the vicinity of alifa Hospital the question is were they using it for a military purpose you know I watched the initial so-called evidence that the Israelis have released you know I'm I'm an American from the United States we're a washing guns I've seen more guns in in the homes of ordinary Americans than I've seen in this purported Hamas Pentagon under alifa Hospital Jeremy are we at a turning point potentially in this conflict will what is or isn't underneath alifa hospital will that change Minds either in Israel elsewhere I I don't think that this specific uh um raid that Israel is doing is going to change mind I think what it's going to do is accentuate the position that people have already started to take on who the real you know who sort of who is the gratuitous party here um certainly Hamas deserves condemnation for butchering civilians more than 800 civilians were killed uh on October 7th um but the fact is that Israel a member of the United Nations a nation state that is showered with American money and weapons is committing systematic war crimes and I think that you know 75 years we've been watching this pogram against the Palestinian people and I think the world is finally waking up on a level that is unprecedented so what I think Israel miscalculated I think they miscalculated the extent of what they did and I think that many nation states and there's dissent in the United States like we haven't seen since the Iraq War we now have 24 members of Congress calling for a ceasefire you have heads of state around the world uh openly accusing Israel of killing babies um this this is a shift that that um Israel has not been under this kind of global pressure ever well let me ask you about Biden's relationship to Netanyahu now I know you've written about his close support for Israel throughout his career you mentioned that earlier but how does he actually get along with Netanyahu the man how how's that whole dynamic going oh I mean they they they couldn't be bigger buddies you know Joe Joe Biden is kind of what likes to portray himself as a kind of folksy guy from Scranton Pennsylvania and he repeatedly tells the same stories he says about about Netanyahu oh I love you bb but I don't believe a damn thing you or I don't agree with a damn thing you ever say Netanyahu brags about his 30-year friendship with Biden Netanyahu notoriously couldn't stand Barack Obama so Biden was often in the position of sort of plating Netanyahu um as Obama and and Netanyahu had clashes but Joe Biden for 50 years in US public office has been one of the primary facilitators of some of the worst excesses of Israel's policy um in fact sometimes Joe Biden has taken a position that has been uh more extreme than Israeli leaders in the in the invasion of Lebanon in the early 80 80s uh the Israeli Prime Minister Manakin Bean said that Joe Biden was saying that it was justifiable to kill civilians um in Lebanon and and monin bean himself is a war criminal from the 1940s from the the original Naka so for for Makin Bean to have been shocked at Joe Biden encouraging or sort of justifying the killing of civilians speaks volumes um Joe Biden also says you don't have to be Jewish to be a I'm a Zionist he said I'm Israel's best Catholic friend no jo Biden knows exactly what he's doing he's very close to Netanyahu and he's given cover for some really horrifying war crimes that apparently are going to continue Jeremy skill there a co-founder of The Intercept News website speaking to us from Frankfurt Germany thank you for joining us on aler Jeremy thank you
