a top United Nations human rights official has resigned over the agency's handling of the war in Gaza in his resignation letter Craig MBA described Israel's actions as textbook genocide he spoke to Gabriel alisand usually the most difficult part of proving genocide is intent because there has to be an intention uh uh to uh destroy and whole or in part a particular group in this case the intent by Israeli leaders has been so explicitly stated and publicly stated by the Prime Minister by the president by senior cabinet uh ministers by military leaders that that is an easy case to make it's on the public record but it's important that we start using the language uh that the law sets out just as you know in recent terms every major international human rights organization Israeli human rights organizations Palestinian human rights organizations United Nations human rights mechanisms independent mechanisms have found that the situation in Israel and Palestine amounts to the crime of apartheid un needs to get used to addressing these particular violations just as we have in other situations when we ask the Secretary General in his office about genocide he won't use that term he says and previous Secretary generals have said that that is for courts to decide do you think that the Secretary General should start using the term genocide when it comes to what we're seeing happening in Gaza if we can allege that we see war crimes crimes against humanity as we have often done there's no reason to exclude uh where we see very strong evidence the possibility of genocide uh being committed and I think you're going to be hearing that term more and more in connection with what we're witnessing in Gaza um but institutions of course have to go through the necessary steps before they can make that pronouncement I as of uh today am an independent citizen not carrying the institution on my shoulders and I feel quite confident as a human rights lawyer in saying that what I see unfolding in Gaza and Beyond uh is genocide Joe Biden has recently said that after this conflict is over we need to get back to a two-state solution in your letter you say the Mantra of a two-state solution has become and I quote an open joke in the corridors of the United Nations where we are sitting right now is it really an open joke within the corridors of the United Nations explain and it has been for quite a long time if you ask somebody in their official capacity about the two-state solution they will repeat that phrase here over and over again as the official position of the United Nations indeed it is the official position of the United States but nobody who follows these circumstances either from the political side or from the human rights side believe one that a two-state solution is possible anymore there's nothing left uh for a Palestinian state that would be sustainable or just or or possible in any respect and everyone knows that and secondly that solution never dealt with the problem of the fundamental human rights of Palestinians so for example it would leave them as second class citizens without full human rights inside uh the green light inside what is now Israel proper and so when people are not talking uh from official talking points you hear increasingly about a one-state solution and what that means is beginning to advocate for the principle of equality of Human Rights instead of these old uh political taglines that would mean a state in which you have equal rights for Christians Muslims and Jews based upon human rights uh and based upon the rule of law it is what we call for in every other circumstance around the world and the question is why is the United Nations not calling for that in Israel Palestine as well
