okay if you're just joining us it is approaching 5 GMT that is 7 a.m. in Gaza and I want to bring you some breaking news as it gets down to the very last minute the Israeli military has announced in just the last few minutes that the ceasefire with Hamas will continue in light of efforts to release more hostages it is not yet clear for how long that ceas fire will be extended but I just want to bring you this latest information that is coming to us according to Hamas a statement from Hamas they have agreed to extend the truce for a seventh day uh which will uh given the truce has already gone on for six days that means one more day a statement coming from the Israeli military says the that the truce the Gaza truce will continue and uh in light of the mediators efforts to continue the process of releasing hostages and subject to the terms of the agreement that truce is going to continue so we are approaching just 7 a.m. in Gaza and Israel and that fragile Six-Day truce in that devastating war between Israel and Hamas it appears is now going to continue for at least another 24 hours let's go to our correspondent Imran Khan who joins us now live from occupied East Jerusalem it went down right to the wire it is just about approaching 7:00 a.m. in Gaza and Israel when that truce was expected that ceasefire to uh to to end but it seems now that it has been extended what are you hearing well we're hearing the IDF statement the Israeli Army statement which you just read out on air uh this statement is kind of worth unpacking here it says enlighted the mediator's efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostage and subject to the frames to the terms of the framework the operational pause will continue this is in STK contrast to what was happening just a few hours ago when we were hearing that Hamas had given the Israelis a list of 10 captives that they were going to release but that had been rejected now we have seen negotiations very hard negotiations take place over the few days about the what kind of names we should be on the list where they were going to come from where they were going to be released from which place uh things of that nature but there was never an outright rejection of names it was always uh about finessing this this outright rejection of names means that there was something else in this negotiation we don't know what that is the Israeli media is full of speculation uh suggesting that it may have been because uh there were some dead bodies in that list and that may have not been acceptable to the Israelis uh but once again the uh the Israeli Army issuing this statement a very last minute reply uh sorry um rest fite for the Palestinians in Gaza it was 10 minutes literally 10 minutes uh before the end of the ceasefire now there is a second part of the statement uh which says uh in light of the mediator's efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages um the operational pause will continue now that's an interesting bit as well because the International Community particularly Qatar Egypt and the US have really been pushing uh for this ceasefire now the last time a ceasefire extension was announced it was two days this one is only for the next 24 hours this goes to show you how hard FR these negotiations are uh how difficult it is for the qari mediators and Egypt and the us to get to an agreement but an agreement has been reached and it was reached with 10 minutes to go yes indeed uh Imran uh in the past it's worth reminding our viewers about how fraught the process normally is I mean it's it's day by day that this these lists are handed out uh and we have seen in the past issues with lists provided by Hamas But ultimately as we've seen now again the negotiators have managed to work through any problems that's absolutely right is something I was just talking about earlier there are these negotiations are incredibly uh fraud but you know Palestinians um have been released um is worth giving you uh some numbers right now um we're looking at at least um just going through my phone to get all the the details let's talk about the Israelis first there 23 ties one Filipino those are the international people that have been released 74 Israelis have actually been released in this now um that's actually quite a large number over the last 5 days normally what happens is you get 10 Israeli captives being released for every 30 Palestinian prisoners that are released that's been the ratio it's been a ratio that's kind of worked out the names as we say have been an issue there's a problem for Hamas here though because the people the vast majority of the people who have been released have been arrested uh since October the 7th or they're coming to the end of their sentences Hamas would like to see Palestinian prisoners that have a long time to go on their sentences to be released they're not getting that um the Israelis for their part have always maintained this ceasefire is only useful to them as long as Israeli captives are getting out this isn't about getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza it's not about uh independent observers or allowing independent un observers or journalists into the strip this is simply about getting people in there is another thing here though as well like we say this is a ceasefire extension for 24 hours uh that's the limit so far but the tough talk from the Israelis is we will go back into Gaza at a time of our choosing now there have been leaks from the war cabinet the Israeli War cabinet that suggest that the absolute final deadline for all of this is Sunday that will be a 10day ceasefire after 10 days that's the maximum the Israelis want to see this pause in fighting now clearly the international mediators and everybody would like to see this go on for much longer but the Israelis very very blunt in fact um there was a statement from the Israeli War cabinet it was a leaked statement uh saying that they would go in their time of they choosing and they've warned the Americans about this talking of the Americans Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State is in town right now he's in Tel Aviv uh he's meeting he's going going to be meeting with the Prime Minister and the president and senior members of uh the military there's an unwritten law uh of diplomacy here in Israel uh that says that no major offensives either politically or militarily should happen whilst a senior us uh Diplomat is in country that may have had something to do with this that may be that that's why they've extended it for 2 24 hours simply just to give uh the Americans um the feeling that they are coming in and there is still hope for a ceasefire extension to go in and bomb was an American is here is incredibly bad optic something the israelies would like to avoid okay for now Imran Khan there for us and occupied East Jerusalem many thanks for that update let's go to Tarak Abu AUM who's in hanun in southern Gaza so with 10 minutes to spare as you've been hearing that deadline that was due to expire right now has been extended We Believe for 24 hours that's what we're hearing uh what's your reaction there in Gaza yes uh the minutes that had preceded the announcement of the extension of the ceasefire for a new day was really critical and hot for Palestinians where fear and anxiety were taking control over all emotions of gazans inside the besieged territory where Palestinians lost hope at the last time and the last minute that there is going to be any new extension as Hamas from its side had give a sign for its forces to be ready for any possibility for the new renew fighting uh with the Israeli soldiers on the ground as there is no any official statement had been released just until the last uh uh minutes of the uh end of the previous cease fire but later Hamas had said that they have reached to and further extension for further one day which can give a clear sign that Palestinians will have a new day uh clear of the Israeli bombar now earlier today the majority of people start and even from earlier hours they start to return back again to the hospital in order to remain in and to be away from the Israeli possible renew of of bombardment and after they just heard the news that there's going to be a new extension for a new day they started to return back again to the houses just simply because they believed that in your renew fighting inside the Gaza Strip will bring Devastation and catastrophic consequences on different life aspects so clearly now Palestinians have had sense of relief and they can right now have moments of breathe as the the extension will B the way for further release of Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip and from the Israeli site more Palestinians will be released from the Israeli jails okay for now TK Abu aom there for us in khun in southern Gaza thank you for that
