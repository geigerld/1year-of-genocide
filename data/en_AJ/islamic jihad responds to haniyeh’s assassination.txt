now the deputy Secretary General of the Islamic Jihad Muhammad al- Hindi has spoken to Lebanese TV station al- mayadin he said this assassination is not only directed at the Palestinian resistance and Hamas in particular but also at Iran he went on to say Israel is on the verge of collapse and its reactions reflect confusion and an inability to achieve any of its goals he says it's the first time in its history that Israel is facing such resistance let's get more reaction now from the ground in Gaza Al Han Mahmud is in central Gaz in dear Al balahan we've been talking to you um all morning since this news broke so what sort of response has there been there from people who are waking up to the news there in Gaza uh to the news of is hania's killing in tran yes well the the vast majority of people from where we at right now are getting closer to us and asking several questions that it's hard to give a straight answer them because it's hard to predict what's going to happen the majority of people here are still hearing about what happened as of earlier hours of this morning the assassination of Hamas political leader smia in tahan there those who are quite frustrated and thought and thinking this is uh going to impede any progress to a ceasefire deal as they are exhausted very tired want into this uh dilemma the Milling that is taking place every single day there are those who think that uh this might be uh pushing the the the war to an end because Netanyahu has been searching for uh for an absolute Victory sign just to divert the uh or sway the public opinion among Israelis who are putting pressure on him and his government particularly the families of the uh of of the hostages in in the Gaza Strip but uh all in all what we're seeing here all of this is happening and the Israeli military continues to strike across the Gaza Strip we don't see any discernable impact on the the conduct of War just as we were preparing with this report the military Chopper in the central area for uh for about 5 minutes kept firing heavy machine guns on the Eastern uh area of the central uh uh part of the G particularly Al B evacuation camp that has been under evacuation orders for the past uh 3 days and and people are haven't been able to get back to their homes everywhere in the streets operations continue in ra City destroying the remaining part of the city there is heavy artillary that could be heard clearly every once in a while from the point we are uh reporting uh from people are uh giving mixed reactions right now and the the the dominating narrative right now do you want to see an end uh to the war either ways with with the assassination of a political leader or with something else they're hoping that this is going to put an end uh uh to the war as 10 months of this genocidal War has has have taken uh their TOS on on on people uh psychological uh well-being on their physical well-being on their livelihood the the safety and the security of their families and their their children 40,000 people one person made a comment about 40,000 people have been killed so far and this is not about Hamas this is not about its political leadership Israel is at war with the very existence of Palestinians whether here in the Gaza Strip and they've seen this in the past 10 months or in the occupied West Bank and throughout the past 10 months Israel have been raiding and detaining and and killing Palestinians in the occupied West Bank where Hamas is not active and here the vast majority of the 40,000 people have been among the civilian uh population so the reaction that we're getting here that Israel will continue to do what it's doing as a as a as a colonial Enterprise destroying an occupied population a colonized population and whenever is convenient they will play the card of no we are targeting a certain group that is responsible for what happened on October 7th all right Al is hany Mahmud live for us there in central Gaza in De Al balahan make sure to subscribe to our channel to the latest news from Al jazer
