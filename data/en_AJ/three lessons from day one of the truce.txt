well let's now bring in Sultan Barakat he's a professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University he joins me again here in the studio Sultan thank you for for joining me again thank you now as we're seeing that the people as well as Aid workers can a little more freely move around and they can assess the situation there on the ground in Gaza we're seeing like the the full extent of the destruction what's taken place over over the last nearly two months now does seeing that does that change that the amount of pressure on Israel it should uh ideally but I think uh also Israel will try and work its way out of this uh still and we could see the beginning of this yesterday in netanyahu's press conference with the Belgium and the Spanish U Prime Ministers when he tried to uh blame the UN for not being fast enough responding to the Palestinian needs he's only agreed to the ceasefire you know two days ago he expect the International Community to come and help the Palestinians as fast as possible now uh what what I think he's trying to do is is again confuse the picture overall as to the situation uh we all uh witnessed the way he uprooted more than a million people yeah and this is still very much in line with his bigger plan of uh displacing the Palestinians out of Gaza he's made all these people extremely vulnerable by taking them off their homes uh their infrastructure where they where they lived before and mov them into another side of Gaza and they become pretty fluid I mean there there are people that can be moved at very short notice now and then he threw them all into the lab of the International Community and say it's your responsibility now he's given them a break ceasefire and he expects people to come for their help so I think the situation there is very is unlikely to improve very quickly as a result of these four days but uh also add adding to that of course uh people on the ground were not briefed on the details of this agreement so they were not told that they can't go back to their homes in the Gaza City which still sealed off as far as the Palestinians are concerned no one can enter and that must have caused a lot of confusion for those who want to make sure that the relatives are fine they want to revisit their homes and so on uh and uh I think uh the the the the fact that they have to do all of this live these four days under the overall threat of continuing the war must be horrifying must be terrible because you you can't plan you cannot do anything except maybe buried their dead yeah that they have been engaged in well today is day two I mean there's there's only two more days to go I'm wondering what happens after the 4 days I mean Israel's obviously been preparing for a long War they've been very explicit about that in Israel at the moment we've been hearing from our correspondents repeatedly that the military continues to have very broad public support even though that's not not necessarily shared by Netanyahu but Netanyahu presumably knows or or feels that he's pretty much out as soon as the war ends so everyone's incentivized to keep it going yes well I think it would be slightly more difficult for him to keep it going now that people have tasted the possibility of releasing their hostages you know unharmed particular that they've all now been checked and they all look like they've been looked after they've been protected and uh I mean from what we've seen from ourside Clear the Palestinians have exerted a lot of effort to protect these people amongst this huge bombing that was going on so I think it would be much more difficult for him to say no we're going to go back to war and a lot can be uh maybe read in in the nature of the hostages that are to be released the waves that we saw yesterday today and yesterday they're really based on humanitarian women and children the old women and children uh even on the Palestinian side the ones that were released from the Israeli prison none of them is really what we call high value prisoner for Israel that is really affecting its security they were all part of the normal pattern of harassing the Palestinians now I think when we move into day three and four we'll probably see on the list uh more important names and then we can also tell whether there is a real plan for the future because depending on who Israel releases from its presence so someone like Marwan baruti if they decide that he can be included in this wave then clearly there is a prospect for some political position in the future well let me ask you then about the releasing of more prisoners or on one side captives on the other if Hamas decides to release that the majority of the captives I've been curious about how that changes the calculus for the war does that change the the appetite in Israel for the war the rationale for continuing the war the public support for it and on the other side does Hamas then then lose the The Leverage that they they have I mean it's very unlikely that Hamas now will uh talk about releasing the soldiers they're holding so they all the agreement now is focused on civilians by and large but uh uh they are looking for Israel to release high value prisoners on from the prisons in Israel uh would that uh lead them to lose their leverage uh obviously it there is part of that but I think now with the international cons cons consensus growing towards trying and bring this to an end uh they're likely to uh to continue well we'll see what happens in the coming days and week Sultan Barakat thank you for sharing your thoughts and joining me again thank you very much
