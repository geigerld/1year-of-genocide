well earlier my colleague soel Raman spoke to mads Gilbert a Norwegian Doctor Who's worked in hospitals in Gaza and his contact with his colleagues there he rejected israeli's accusation Israel's accusations that herass uses hospitals for military purposes I have been walking around in these hospitals all over with my camera documenting patients and the work during the crisis situations I've been filming picturing talking to people there has been no one door locked I have never been controlled with my documentation there has absolutely been not a single restriction in either of these two hospitals I know the AL Hospital from the time it was built and as you may know there is a new medical Block in the shifa hospital under International surveillance and during all these years having worked in these two hospitals I have never ever traced any sign of any military or political Command Center and if the Israelis for these last 16 years because they started these lies already in 2009 if they cannot provide any evidence or any proof how can we look at this as anything else but the fog of war the lies and the and more importantly the wishing of intimidating scaring people and getting excuses to bomb these important hospitals and and don't forget these hospitals are cornerstones of the welfare and the health care for 2.2 million people and when a a when when an army is allowed to threaten patients in a hospital and threaten to bomb it when there is absolutely no evidence and by the way international law the Geneva Convention has three rules it is proportionality use the same amount of weapon as your enemy it is precaution don't hit civilian targets and it is distinction the precaution is that if a Target is a mixed military civilian Target the civilian interest take priority over the military so regardless but turning back to your question no nor have I nor have Dr Eric or any other Norwegian healthcare workers who have been working with the Palestinian healthcare for more than 30 years we have never seen any evidence and had I seen it I would not have worked there because I live according to the Geneva Convention so um show us the show us the proof that's a Norwegian Dr Matts Gilbert who knows hospitals in Gaza very well H let's take this on we can speak now to Jeffrey Robertson who's a former United Nations war crimes judge joins me live from London and Mr Robertson you're very well acquainted through your work as a human rights barister with uh assessing the horrors of War and the legalities of War indeed how do you view what is going on in Gaza right now well there's no question of how I view it it's a question of how international law views it and the answer is very clear there is an absolute Red Line against bombing hospitals unless you can prove and the burden is on the aggressor to prove that they're being used as a milit for military purposes and uh primer facing is what lawyers say on the face of it the bombing of a hospital is uh clear International crime of course you you can't avoid that by giving warnings as the wh said the uh a hospital that has patients pregnant women and so forth there's no doubt about this hospital having uh many of those can't just evacuate without casualties and patients will be will die and will uh be severely injured as a result so what are we to do with a government Mr Netanyahu and his cabinet ministers it seems to me that they are now open to indictment for this war crime okay let before we move on to that I want to come on to that in a second Mr forgive me for interrupting you I want to come on to that in just a attack could also be indicted but the Israeli Min must realize that they face indictment not only by the IC M the prosecutor is rather busy with Mr Putin at the moment but anywhere they go in the world in years to come because many nations have got Universal jurisdiction laws as they're called and there will be a attempts to arrest and put them on trial and they will be convicted unless they can show that the hospital is a military Tong the Rockets are shot from there that it Harbors Hamas Fighters or whatever but that burden is on them and so they are vulnerable if they go ahead with bombing this hospital today or tonight okay Mr Robson I'm hoping you can hear me okay uh I just wanted to clear understand one thing to clear one thing up so if there are Hamas if there are Hamas operatives underneath the hospitals is the hospital a legitimate Target given that there are I think something like 14,000 people Sheltering there and 400 patients well that's what lawyers are like or judges are likely to call disproportionate but it is clearly an argument it's certainly an argument for going in with soldiers and securing the hospital without hurting the patients and maybe and digging underneath it to see what can be found if you've got a reasonable apprehension that there are military targets underneath but I would have thought that it's difficult to argue that you should bomb a hospital as such uh would do anything to alleviate that problem so again the burden is on the Israeli government to show that it is that the attack is proportionate to the threat what is the process of bringing people that you're alluding to just just now of bringing people to Justice and and is it ever likely to happen given the warm embrace of Israel's actions by the United States well that is the big question of course as to the enforceability of international law in my view there is a basis for the IC to take action the international criminal court uh and it would have the power to indict the leaders of Hamas who are guilty let's let's actually accept that of giving the most horrible orders to uh their soldiers so to speak to kill not just Israeli uh soldiers but citizens and uh who were wickedly Des spoiled uh on October the 7th but two wrongs don't make a right and the Israeli government must be careful not itself to commit War crime because not only could it be prosecuted at the ICC it doesn't accept the ICC regrettably so it's not it can claim not to be bound by but it does pretend to comply with international law and if it doesn't by bombing hospitals without military justification then its members the people of the war cabinet Mr Netanyahu and his ministers could be prosecuted in years to come in those countries which perit International jurisdiction and will uh undoubtedly uh Levy prosecutions against them if they visit and so that's something they have to bear in mind Jeffrey Robinson we appreciate your analysis and expertise that's Jeffrey Robinson a former United Nations War crime judge thank you
