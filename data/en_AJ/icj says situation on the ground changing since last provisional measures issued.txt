Gabriel is joining us from the United Nations in New York so Gabriel what more are we learning about what exactly these these measures entail yeah these are three new provisional measures just announced by the icj within the last hour or so we've been sifting through them it's only about a three-page document here so it doesn't take too long but the three key points are basically this uh number one it C it all deals with humanitarian Aid the first provisional measure calls on Israel uh with to take effective measures to immediately get humanitarian Aid that need those who need it everything uh they say from food water electricity fuel shelter clothing hygiene and sanitation requirements the second uh provisional measure is also calling on the Israeli military to Halt with in their words immediate effect any military action that could hinder the delivery o of this humanitarian Aid so uh and then the third provisional measures the court is asking that Israel issue a report uh uh back to the icj on how it's implementing uh these new Provisions in one month's time which would be April 28th so the first two provisional measures might seem very similar to the six provisional measures that the court laid out in late January and they are similar quite frankly what these are as the court kind of explains not in these certain terms but uh insinuates these are enhancements if you will essentially the court is saying here uh the situation is getting worse in Gaza here's two of or three of the provisional measures we want to highlight and accentuate that we we meaning the court is asking Israel uh to abide by immediately right and we'll obviously wait to see whether there's any reaction from the Israeli side to this but Gabriel um is there some to be said about the timing as to why these measures were introduced now there is and the court actually lays that out in the first part of their uh uh uh provisional measures here the bottom line is the situation on the ground in Gaza has gotten worse since the court issued those provisional measures in late January January 26th the court says uh these are modifications uh because of in their words the change in the situation on the ground in Gaza they say when we wrote or issued our January 26th provisional measures uh They said that the people of Gaza were facing a risk of famine the icj says now that famine is setting in and that is why in their words it justifies the modification in these provisional measures so the bottom line is the court looks at the situation on the ground in Gaza and says said we need need to update our provisional measures and that's exactly what they've done okay thank you Gabriel Lando thanks for that update from the UN
