We Begin this with breaking news now from Rafa the Israeli Army has warned all residents and displaced people to leave the Eastern neighborhoods of Rafa it says they must move to the AL maasi area near the coastline that's ahead of what it says will be the use of extreme force in the eastern part of the city more than 1 and a half million people have been Sheltering in Rafa after the Israeli Army forced them out of Northern and Central Gaza we're joined uh Now by hany Mahmud who's in Rafa in southern Gaza hany what's happening there on the ground right now yes we're following an intense night of extreme air strikes Relentless air strikes across the eastern and the central part of RA City uh caused the uh the murder of 20 people so far mostly women and children there military as early hours this morning issued statements along with a map for evacuation the orders are very extreme very sharp and used intimidating language describing what's going to happen at the eastern part of the city as with along with the use of extreme force and extreme military operations going to take place at the eastern part of RA City that includes all the area Eastern of Salah Road and almost close to the center uh RAF City that's at the Western uh part of Salah road that will include definitely ra Crossings and as of yesterday we we learned that K Salam Crossing is being completely shut down and the operation right now that that is included uh ra right now including in the evacuation orders will be uh closed as soon as the operation is started in the eastern part of of Raa City people are in a state of panic and shock despite that they expected that to happen but did not expect it to happen rapidly uh we we were approached by people who asking about where are the evacuation zones and we looked at the maps and what what we've seen so far it is stretches from the central area from D balah City uh all passing through kanun mainly in the central part of kanun and the western part of hunis all the way to the evacuation Zone here in western part of City these are the three major areas the uh this the uh the leaflets designated as safe areas in which they will be receiving according to the leaflet uh dropped by the Israeli military according to this LEF it says this is where all the humanitarian support will be directed uh that is something indicating as many people reacted to that that this operation is going to be long and it's un it's unclear without any time frame when it's going to uh to end uh and that's what's going on right now on the ground people have started to uh to move toward the central area and the uh the western part of of raah City uh it's important also to point out the past 3 days uh witnessed the uh quiet evacuation sort of people who uh somehow predicted that the the talks in kir about the ceasefire were not making any solid progress and the Israel milit uh uh in light of the growing threats of expanding the operation into RAF City they started to move quietly uh to areas that are not designated by the Israeli military as safe zones given the past failures of the Israeli military to assure that these evacuation zones are in fact safe well indeed given that throughout this SW and G as you say there haven't been any so-called safe areas what is the mood there now to this news I mean how are people going to [Music] cope it's quite distressing right now and we could we could see and we could tell how worried people How concerned they are there is a state of panic the people who have already lost family members that they were told to move to evacuation zones are recalling these times when they were ordered sharply to move to certain designated areas as safe Zone to get killed bombed and killed in those areas whether here in RAF City or the central area or uh in in the city of Han units there is huge level of mistrust now in the the Israeli narrative in terms of evacuation zones and uh what people are reacting this is there you can't create a safe Zone in a war zone the entire Gaza Strip is is being relentlessly bombed whether it's here and over crowded ra City all these past months and in and despite the the calls for the the ground Invasion which seen by and perceived by many people as a distraction because at the same time the Israel military was extremely bombing RAF City to a point where destruction is quite visible in all the roads across this overcrowded City there rubbles are filling the roads everywhere destroyed homes are everywhere so D hasn't been safe at all within the past 7 months and since the uh the initial weeks of of this genocidal uh War so that's where people are not buying this new Narrative of evacuation Zone because there isn't any evacuation Zone at all and the bombing included public facilities honorable facilities uh hospitals and we've seen how hospit were stormed and we they came under military siege for the past months now it's important to point out right now that part of the evacuation orders included a naar hospital at the eastern part of RA City it's part of the evacuation and the the leaf clear clearly says that the hospital should be uh evacuated okay hany for now thank you well Zan bzra is on the phone for a SN from rala in the occupied West Bank Zay a terrifying situation on the ground in Gaza there but how is this likely to feed into the ongoing ceasefire talks well all of this follows an Israeli Playbook we've seen before in this conflict and others the order for people to move came after a night of tense Israeli bombing on Rafa which followed attacks targeting the areas in and around Rafa for days so this is an escalation we've seen the same thing happening in the West Bank escalation longer than usual raids in the West Bank TM is experiencing that this morning we've seen the use of shoulder mounted anti- Rockets ant anti-tank rockets on people's homes this is an escalation we're seeing so there is all this military escalation in parallel to the talks and it makes you think it is either to try and negotiate from a position of strength or it could be LIF service to negotiations as a distraction to be able to carry out these operation and complete the objective that the Israeli government laid out at the beginning of this war which was to end hamas's role completely end hamas's influence and presence in Gaza now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been clear we have to remind people that he has been clear for for many many days and weeks now that going into Rafa will happen whether there is a deal uh with Hamas reached or not and that is something negotiators involved in these talks Aid agencies every un organization has warned would cause enormous suffering and hinder and perhaps completely negate any Prospect of a breakthrough in the hostage talks but it seems from his actions that he has made his decision z b rvi for now thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
