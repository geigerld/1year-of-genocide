well the prominent Palestinian activist ahead Tamimi was among the 30 prisoners released on Wednesday the 22-year-old rose to prominence in 2017 when she slapped an Israeli soldier who raided her Village in the occupied West Bank at the time she was sentenced to 8 months in prison Tamimi was arrested again earlier this month on suspicion of inciting violence let's get more now on this from Al jazer Zayn basravi who joins us live from rala in the occupied West Bank so uh firstly uh we finally we we've had this confirmation in the last uh 10 minutes or so that the truce is expected to be extended by at least 24 hours that will bring uh I believe some relief uh where you are uh and the hope that more Palestinians will also be released from captivity yes every time we have spoken to Palestinians here in the occupied West Bank whether it was those who have been detained whether it was their families people being released regular everyday people on the street those at the celebrations everyone is excited and they say the same thing that the release of each and every Palestinian the every single Palestinian who has freedom is a reason for celebration and hope every single extra day any Palestinian spends in Israeli captivity is a reason to continue to demand Justice in the face of the occupation all of that aside though they look at this in the broader context every single person also agrees that what they want is for the ceasefire to carry on the most important thing is to keep the two sides talking keep the Israelis and the Palestinians negotiating talking maintain the ceasefire to make sure the bombardment of Gaza does not restart the Palestinians living here in the occupied West Bank feel very connected obviously to the conflict in Gaza they want that to come to an end they want the horrors of Gaza to stop one mother over the course of the last week or so even said to us that she was looking forward to her daughter getting out she was cooking her daughter's favorite meals but said if it means that the bombardment of Gaza will stop if the war on Gaza will end that she would be willing to see her daughter remain in prison so it's no small thing for the people here that this ceasefire has carried on and they will no doubt be looking to the events later today to make sure or to hopefully to make sure that that carries on now they also look at this in a broader context yes these deten these these detainees being released is is is a positive step forward but in the time that Israel has released 210 Palestinian detainees it is detained 203 new people here in raids at checkpoints across the occupied West Bank more than 7,000 7,200 plus Palestinians remain in Israeli custody a third of them detained since the events of October 7th since the war on Gaza began in raids in the occupied West Bank so this territory this part of the occupied territories has certainly been suffering greatly since the War Began it was already suffering raids and incursions and and uh constant pressure by Israeli forces even before the war it went up in intensity After the War Began and no doubt people living across the occupied territories will be looking to uh this us shuttle diplomacy that is ongoing a visit by US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin later today there be looking to that to see what comes out of it but it has to be said there is not a great deal of public trust not just in the Americans but also in their own leadership here in ramala in the Palestinian Authority in the Palestinian political leaders who many critics at worst describe them as collaborating with Israel as as acquiescing far too much to the American policy on Israel to Israeli oppressors and it has to be remember that that lack of public trust whether it is in this process of a ceasefire of a swap deal or anything else they they they look at it in the broader context ever since the Palestinian Authority the PLO took over what we have seen is Palestinian lands continue to shrink under their watch and that is something that they have criticized their leaders for and that lack of trust will certainly be something that plays out no matter what happens in the next 24 hours or going forward in the next days and weeks okay many thanks for that zann basravi there for us in rala in the occupied West Bank
