now hundreds of students have been arrested at universities across the United States as protests grow over Israel's war on Gaza they're demanding educational institutions divest in companies they say are complicit in genocide Let's cross over to Teresa B joining us from Columbia University in New York and Theresa it does seem that there is a message now from the University president to the students well that's correct we're right Columbia University we're not allowed to go inside mostly because only ID holders are allowed to do so there's lots of security out here there's hundreds of students that remain inside in this sitting an encampment saying that they want to shed light on the war on Gaza to what is happening on Gaza they want universities to stop investments in companies that profit from the war on Gaza and those are their demands what has Happening Here in Colombia University has inspired many universities across the country currently on the edge on how to respond to the student protest that are happening across the country calling law enforcement suspending students among other things there's been negotiations ongoing between the students and the university we after two weeks uh that hundreds of protesters at least 100 protesters were detained uh and and we hear now that the president of Columbia University has issued a statement there they're saying that the University trying to resolve this issue in a peaceful manner they also want to guarantee for example freedom of speech but at the same time allow Jewish students in the university to feel at ease in this current University she also mentions in this statement that the university won't divest from Israel however what she's also saying is that they're open for new suggestions uh and to discuss other possibilities on divestment matters investment matters of Columbia University we're also being told Al jazer has been told that the students that remain inside have been told that they need to abandon the sitting by 2: p.m. local time that's about uh in a 3 hours time here it's not clear what will happen then some of them believe that they could be suspended we do not know what is going to happen but what students are saying is that they have the right to Civil Disobedience this is a long history it's a long history in US University of doing something like this back in the 1960s during the Vietnam war and that's why students here are saying that they'll remain where they are and of course Teresa you know the scenes behind you right there seem pretty calm right now but I was wondering you sometimes can get a sense of the mood of the people not just going into the university but around you as you've sort of been Milling around uh what is that sense well I've been in New York for a day I have to tell you and I've been going around on several universities across the city you go downtown for example there's students there again shedding light on the war on Gaza asking universities to stop Investments on companies that uh do not that are related to what is happening or profiting to what is happening in Gaza there's a mood with many students outside saying and asking for people to join in to join in into shedding light to what is happening currently on the Gaza Street people are walking as you can see very peacefully here as journalists are not allowed to go into the campus right now we believe that we'll be allowed to do so later on we've seen people some people here wearing a cafe as you can see just outside the university but we're also hearing that the students that are inside this University are calling for assistance again they do not know what is going to happen at 2m local time they do not know whether the police will be called in whether they'll be suspended but what is certain is that they're saying that they'll remain where they are they believe in their purpose they believe that the war on Gaza needs to end and we'll be here reporting on what happens next of course we'll check in with you as time progresses Theresa boa for us in New York Let's cross over now to shab Brans he's at George Washington University in DC and sheab the capital police very careful in the way they've been handling the student protests Where You Are it's fascinating because it's the it's the university administrators the supposed Guardians of the young minds in in the under their tutelage who are trying to get the police to clear this encampment out and it's the police who are saying no they don't want the Optics of of violently removing peaceful peaceful protesters and it is very peaceful the idea that this is a threat to anyone as bizarre it's a very well-appointed encampment now it has facilities for food and there's a library you perhaps even hear a violinist who's serenading us with a selection of chamber music but now we have this new installation behind us let's get Leela Lea one of the protesters here to explain this is an amazingly symbolic achievement here but what is what's going on here where where did all these barriers come from hi thank you so much so it began last night we had a peaceful cultural Showcase in which members of the community families children the elderly were gathered together to share stories from their culture and songs when all of a sudden the police began to violently arrest someone who was inside the camp they clim this individual had jumped the fence but it was clear this individual had been inside the camp for over 80 hours and we always say here we keep us safe so the community rallied together to protect this individual to prevent this wrongful violent arrest and to prevent any police brutality the individual was able to go free afterwards the barricades were then removed and placed in the center because these barricades have been a threat to the health and the safety of the students from day one George Washington University allowed these barricades to be erected to prevent students from being able to access running water from being able to use the bathroom and to prevent Medics from being allowed in we have women inside who were on their periods for these 4 days with no access to running water we had people inside who were sick who were injured who were disabled but the police with their barricades prevented Medics from getting through putting the lives of students from across Georgetown George Washington University American University Gat University and Howard University in danger now that the barricades have been removed individuals have been able to access running water in order to take care of their health and their safety we have had Medics being able to come in and to give students checkups to make sure they are healthy and this goes to show that we are prepared to stay for as long as possible so the administrators are they still threatening you though with um with removal suspension because as far as they are concerned this is an unsafe environment and it's making Jewish students in particular uncomfortable I can't help notice your T-shirt oh yeah I mean I think these anti-Semitism accusations are just a baseless and racist character ation of what the Palestinian Liberation movement has been fighting for myself I've been offered kosher for Passover food we've had rabbis come in and also if we want to talk about attacks against religious groups we should absolutely be having this conversation but we should be talking about the mosques and the churches inside of Gaza that have been bombed often times with individuals peacefully Sheltering inside you knowk thank you thank you so much and so yes I think perhaps Elliot maybe you can focus once again on this Remar remarkable symbol of the power of the students here in in Washington DC back to you thanks very much she Shey there for us in Washington DC Let's cross over to Phil lvll who's at MIT in Cambridge Massachusetts and Phil what's the mood like there well there's a lot of uh protesting going on and we we remember this is Boston Massachusetts there are a number of universities there are a lot of protests I mean we've had over the last week two of them have been closed down nor Eastern and Emerson College both of those we saw the police brought in 100 people at each side arrested uh and those protests closed down now we've got this one at MIT this one has been going on for more than a week we understand that students are now in active negotiations with the university bosses uh but you've also got protests at the world famous Harvard University a few miles away that one is behind locked Gates nobody is on site unless they have a Harvard University pass and uh the police chief there has said you know what I am not going to go on site and arrest people because the university wants me to do that I'm only going to get involved if there is violence or there is damage to property but the University at the Harvard University is saying to these students you may face disciplinary action including not getting your degrees and then we've got tough University where we are told that at some point today the process of ending that encampment will begin well that mean will that mean that the police are involved will it mean more negotiations we don't know but obviously we're watching that one very closely but bringing it back here to MIT I've got with me Zeno who's one of the protesters here now you've got a really interesting perspective here because you were actually arrested at Emerson College and now you're here like how what happened there absolutely yes I'm Zeno I'm a grad student uh an organizer for The Graduate students for Palestine um so what happened is Emerson is one of our sibling colleges we organize we all all of the colleges in this local area in Boston and Cambridge we work in sink and Tandem and so we launched our encampment over a week ago Sunday night with Emerson and tus and so we've been in close contact with those at Emerson and so we support each other when we need each other and Emerson gave us a call the other night I was working I was kind of overseeing a night a night shift and doing night watch about 11: at night I got a call that hey Emerson needs help they called in the state troopers so myself and about 10 other MIT students at this in campus took a couple uh uh lifts and Ubers and we went over to Emerson which is across the bridge on the Boston side now Emerson set up an encampment in an alley and there's two sides to that alley and so one side of the alley they were saying was more higher risk cuz the cops were collecting on that side of the alley so I had the MIT on the more moderate risk side basically doing a support rally where there were no cops a few counter protesters but no cops so myself and a few other the uh like uh cheer and rally leads we started taking over the mega phone and doing um you know uh free free Palestine basic our our kind of a our cheer uh choreograph and everything was good we had some folks locking arms on that side of the alley but again no cop presence and then all of a sudden all the state troopers pulled up with all of their uh Vans uh to load us up in and um we all got quiet because we had a cop liaison that cop liaison approached the lead cop the lead cop came out there and he said I don't care what your prep testing about I don't I'm not on any side I'm neutral but you have to leave because there's fire code violations uh you're disturbing the peace etc etc at that point in time our cop liaison turned around to our cheerlead at the time and said continue the cheers and he lifted up the megaphone and the cop was about 5T away from him and he said free free Palestine straight to the cop and I pissed all the cops off and they rushed us and they started slamming us to the ground all we' got to watch the language cuz we're live on uh apologies um so he they started slamming us against the wall slamming us on the ground many injuries um myself I was slammed against a brick wall I was standing on a public sidewalk um I I was slammed and we were just linked arms with the uh rest of our friends and students there he piced they were picking and choosing who to arrest they chose me slam me against the um the brick wall behind me put my hands behind my back and then lifted up my arms real high and I'm telling the guy hey I have a connective tissue disorder and he didn't he didn't care he just kept lifting up my arms slammed me on the ground and then arrested me okay thanks for giving your account really appreciate it and as you can see the police are on site they're keeping a distance but as of course we don't know how this will develop over the coming hours Phil Val for us in Cambridge at Massachusetts at MIT thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
