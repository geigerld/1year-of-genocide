my name is hanin and I was born in Gaza in alahi hospital the Baptist Hospital uh I moved to Japan when I was 7 years old and I grew up here um until about the end of high school and I just moved back uh in October in order to raise awareness and do as much as I can for Palestine and Japan I'm here to support the students at University of Tokyo in their encampment it's the first encampment in Japan um and you know one of the students was inspired by the students in Colombia and all over the states in the world now uh and decided to pitch up a tent um in solidarity um also to demand from the University to divest from their Partnerships with Israel I know to a lot of people the protests and events in Japan may not seem um radical I mean they're not very radical uh however uh in Japan those sorts of actions don't help the cause and don't help the reputation of the cause they'll only further damage uh the cause of the Palestinian cause and the and the reputation of of Palestine so in order for us to really engage with the society and the community here we have to do it in ways um that are more let's say soft but also very powerful so we've done some you know our actions where we remembered all the martyrs and GZA while we painted red tears um that really made that really touched everyone and made them feel the heaviness of of the losses uh in Gaza from uh from Israel and this genocide make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
