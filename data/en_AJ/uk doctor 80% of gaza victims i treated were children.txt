reusing medical supplies and operating without anesthetics that's the reality in much of Gaza where the injured are faced with a health system that collapsed a long time ago teams of international doctors who have been able to enter the strip are shocked by the number of children they're operating on and that includes Dr Victoria Rose she was the only plastic surgeon at the largest facility in southern Gaza nasd hospital and saw a steady stream of children with blast wounds to the face and limbs well she's just returned to the UK from Gaza and she's joining us on the aler NewsHour Dr Victoria Rose thanks very much for your time with us um as we're saying you've just returned you were working at Nasa Hospital uh in Khan yunes can you speak to what you saw there and what shocked you the most I think what shocked me the most this time was the number of children that um I saw and and in fact operated on when I'd been um at the European Gaza Hospital in March um it was it was a lot of children then but now in August I would say that 80% of everyone I treated was under the age of 16 what sorts of injuries would you see and what sort of operations would you be carrying out um all of the injuries were explosive related um and burns that there was no real other injury apart from explosion or a burn um so the sorts of things that I was um mainly treating uh were um sort of third degree burns 30 40% um I saw a lot of lower limb trauma children losing legs um losing arms we had a couple of upper arm amputees a lot of facial injuries um I had a seven-year-old that had most of nose blown off and um a big hole in his lip um a girl that had lost quite a lot of her um skin down to the bone on her on her forehead um so so what tended to happen is in the explosions the children would either get burnt or shrapnel or or um part of the building that had crumbled would be would be weaponized and held at them and then inflict a sort of soft tissue wound with or without an under dying bony injury have you ever seen anything like this no never how are the children coping in their families uh various ways I mean the whole Spectrum we had a few children that refused to speak to us or engage with us or really with any of their family um and then some some children who who sort of you know managed to uh cope with their injuries and and sort of were really conducive to treatment and and seemed to be able to get by but it was it was a real mixed bag um a lot a lot of the children are so young I don't think they understand the significance of some of the injuries that they've sustained there have been several attacks near hospitals throughout this war or even on a field Hospital in central Gaza that took place on July the 27th many children there among the Dead the doctors and the nurses and all your colleagues on the ground will have to be making some tough decisions as to who to try to save considering the lack of space the lack of anesthetics the lack of supplies and the list goes on and on I mean how how difficult were these decisions to make I think we were making sort of decisions that we wouldn't make if the children were in the UK um you know there's a lot of situations where we amputated because you know we didn't have the ability to do the reconstruction and we knew that if we didn't do the amputation the risk of infection and then death from sepsis was a possibility um so things like that were were fairly uncomfortable to do um there there was a a real sort of portive Specialties um so we didn't have um an ENT surgeon or a maxilla facial surgeon I was the only plastic surgeon in Gaza for the month uh there hadn't been a plastic surgeon in Gaza or at the NASA hospital since May when I arrived so there was quite a number of people who had sort of been waiting for somebody that could do plastic surgery um and obviously you know if you've waited a couple of months the wounds are heavily infected um a lot of the patients are malnourished so a lot of the procedures uh that I was attempted to do would either get infected or have to be delayed until the wounds were cleaner okay we'll have to leave it there Dr Victoria Rose we thank you so much for speaking to us from the UK thank you very much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
