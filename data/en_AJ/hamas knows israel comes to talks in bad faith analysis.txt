let's bring in Hassan barari he's a professor of international Affairs at Qatar University so Hassan it feels like we've seen all of this before right a ceasefire proposal linkoln comes to the region Israel and Hamas trade blame you could tell me this time is different or you could tell me it's all the same political theater to use the word that Zay used earlier and I would believe you either way what do you think I agree with you that we've seen this movie before quite often and then it never yielded to the uh desired outcome but this time I think it's a little bit different uh simply because the regional Dynamics has changed uh with assassination of Hamas leaders and the Iranian in intention to retaliate uh so here here's the the the point that President Biden uh wants to avoid a scenario where the region degenerated into a regional War where the where the United States would be involved so you're saying this time the cost of not agreeing to a ceasefire plan is a lot higher it's it's assumed so so the Americans assume that short of having ceasefire right now the the Iranian might retaliate and in this way Netanyahu would retaliate again and this is this cycle would complicate the American situation in the region okay the cost of failure is higher so the chances of success awkwardly are actually high I would say the pressure would be more Ino I mean we cannot really guarantee the well I want to talk about this pressure right because I think there's consensus that the US is really the key country that can put pressure or choose not to put pressure on Israel the but we know the US is not going to stop arms deliveries we know they're not going to suspend financial aid and we know they're going to protect Israel from potential Regional attacks So within those limits which are pretty clear now what really is the pressure that the US could put on Israel as you said it's teethless pressure you know because if is not connected to threat or a price tag um it seems to be difficult for Netanyahu to cave in unless there is something internal in in Israel that would uh um force him to do so but within those parameters is there something that can Biden say I know I want to keep delivering weapons I know I want to keep up the financial aid and I've already sent my carry a strike group to the region to protect Israel all of that is a given but within that I still want to put pressure on Israel just a hypothetical if Biden is in that mindset what can he do I think n would have little room to maneuver and and this would create different Dynamic within Israel Society within the Israeli politics that an would be you know in really um hard hard situation that he will cave in and we know that netan caves in uh whenever there's real pressure we've seen him in 19 uh 1997 1998 with why uh with Y River agreement and even this led to the dissolve of his his government uh but we know n is not the one who would stand up to the pressure if it's connected with price tech but until this moment Netanyahu relies in his allies in the United States in the Congress for instance the Republican party and he realized in them to offset the the pressure so it's a game H whenever Netanyahu feels that he going to lose in this game he he caves in I keep hearing Biden wants a ceasefire agreement for his legacy for the way he'll be remembered first of all do you agree with that premise to some extent yeah well if that's the case I mean the clock's ticking for Biden right he doesn't have that long left in office I think he could have done this before H in in um in November last year there was a chance for perpetuating the the ceasefire but he um chose not to interfere and he keps protecting Israel and giving Israel the the space to eliminate Hamas when Israel failed to do so so I think he's lame duck right now he can't really uh bang on a legacy all he needs probably is to help Harris win election so it's not about um Legacy and and I think Biden understand very well that the the the peace talks or the ceasefire proposal would be limit to the first phase uh so if he can is that is that what you believe I think they are not related and that's why Hamas is sorry what's not related the the the proposal is three phases yes you know so phase one Perman phase one is temporary cease fire for relas yeah in exchange for release of the the hostages and this would be an achievement for Biden so after that it's going to be difficult a time would not really help uh help Biden and B netan is not going to change course simply because he knows that you know he in this case he would be responding positively to the demand of the public that okay you know I got your boys back so what else you want me let me finish the job Hassan barari uh thank you very much for your thoughts thank you for joining us today thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
