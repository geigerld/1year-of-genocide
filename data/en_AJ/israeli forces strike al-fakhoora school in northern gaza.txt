this program for breaking news now the Israeli military has bombed the alphakor school in the northern Gaza Strip now this is a United Nations run School inside the jabalia refugee camp this is also the second school that was bombed since Friday well let's go straight to our correspondent there on the ground Tark abazo he's in K yunes that's in the southern part of the Gaza Strip T we're watching some pretty awful pictures in the aftermath of this strike now this is a school as we've been told in the jabalia refugee camp we know that that there have been multiple air strikes taking place in that camp over the course of the last few days tell us a little bit more about what we know happened here yes um the jabalia refugee camp has been bombarded Again by the Israeli occupation forces and this time a new United Nations shelter had been completely attacked by the Israeli Air Forces where people are taking sh filter inside this school now with the ongoing attacks that took place in the north of Gaza Strip the majority of people tend to United Nations shelters and the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital in order to be protected from the Israeli occupation fire meanwhile those schools must be protected by the principles of the international law and there are also must be uh at least be safe from the Israeli Relentless attacks that took place people were taking shelter there and meanwhile they are suffering from a diversity of uh generally hard situation including the humanitarian and even the medical condition there people are still generally till now inside this school and in this in different schools in jabalia refugee camp and this attack considered to be not the only attack that took place on schools but it had been carried out similar attacks before in schools and bakeries and hospitals at water tank which clearly a clear goal that Israel is in order to force people to flee to the south of Gaza Strip on for meanwhile the southern areas are witnessing the same level of bombardment as the north of Gaza STP Tara I firstly just want to apologize to our viewers who are joining us now some of these are pretty graphic images some of them have been blurred but these are obviously the latest pictures that we're getting from the scene of the aftermath of that air strike so I apologize if you are being disturbed by some of the images you're seeing obviously there are some bodies there and we are seeing some children also on the scene T tell us a little bit more about what's been happening at Valia because this is a school as we've been saying inside that camp and that camp has clearly been a target for the Israelis yes uh jabalia refugee camp generally in the normal days is very densely populated area some of the residents inside this refugee camp had fled to the south of Gaza Strip as the Israeli occupation forces recommended While others did not find any safe shelter so they left the houses they left the Farms they left the lands and they wanted to take shelter in United Nations Affiliated schools meanwhile they are not even protected in the United Nations schools and they have been multiply hit by the occupation forces it's also important to understand that each School in the North or even in the south of Gaza Strip is very crowded with people it seems any attack that would take place inside one of these schools will cause catastrophic loss in lives and also will cause such dramatic uh change in the situation on the north where people are taking shelter of course till now the Palestinian Ministry of Health the ambulances are trying to do the best in order to rescue uh the people who have been targeted by the Israel occupation forces wait waiting for further confirmation from the Palestinian Ministry about the final number of death tool and injured people but similarly as it's going to be much more crowded with people it's expected that the number of people who are going to be wounded in due to this attack will rise and even the Medical Teams till now are evacuating victims from the location of the targeting mhm as you say t very very very densely populated part of a very densely populated Gaza Strip now just to flag one of the other things you mentioned there this was an unra School a un run facility and people were were there seeking shelter now we've heard from unra themselves that they no longer feel that they can offer protection to people under the UN flag we were hearing this from from the aaza director Ju Just a couple of weeks ago they've also told us that they provide the coordinates to all of their shelters to to all of their schools to the Israelis so they know exactly where people are seeking shelter these are civilians who've been in a un run school as you've been seeing there have there are bodies there of of women and children do we have a sense TK and I know this is a difficult question of how many people are now left in Northern Gaza obviously tens of thousands hundreds of thousands have now fled South where there are also bombardments taking place but how many people are left up [Music] north yes uh there are still people uh at the north of the Gaza Strip are talking about thousands of people who refuse to flee the houses meanwhile the occupation is trying to attack all means of lives surrounding those people in order to force them to know or to no more have options to remain in the north of Gaza Strip thus they will be a forced to evacuate to the south of the territory as they are forced also to walk for long distance in order to reach the southern areas which is far away from the Northern areas with uh dozens of kilometers which will it really be a very dangerous and risky Journey for those in the north of the territory as they are already running low in fuel uh water and even they are facing a severe problem in terms of having access to food uh they are talking about very catastrophic consequences and conditions they are witnessing in the north as there's no any humanitarian Aid had been delivered and also people there they say that we don't have any other safe shelter to go we are in our houses we have been bombarded we went to the hospitals it also was attacked were attacked and at the same time even United Nations shelters are not yet at safe place for us so they are trying to push them to move to the South meanwhile similar attacks had been had been carried out in the south of the Gaza STP yeah t you were you were saying there that this is all part of a strategy to push people South we've also obviously just over the course of the morning seeing the forced evacuation of alifa Hospital complex gaza's largest hospital people there several thousand people being being forced to leave including Doctors medical staff and patients can you give us a sense of where the Israeli military strategy is now we've been hearing that there is this push South clearly they they feel that they're trying to take control of the north give us a sense of of where Israeli troops are right now and where that fighting is taking place yes the Israeli troops are uh firstly they they started the ground Invasion from the Eastern areas of Gaza Strip we are talking about the eastern areas of banon and the northwest of B here the coastal line of the territory as they managed to reach as refugee camp with under artillery bombardment and then they managed to access a shifa hospital uh and as they access the shifat hospital they were forced to deploy uh snipers and they are taking full control over the vicinity of a shifat hospital now they made different kinds of runs inside the buildings of a shifat hospitals where doctors are not yet able to move freely without feeling any threat between the buildings and the department of the hospital and it's was also worth mention that the doctors inside hospitals patients and even uh wound displaced people are are not yet safe as there are still be babies and people inside this hospital and even if they have afforded to be evacuated to the south of the territory they need to uh they need to walk for long distance and there's going to be a multiple uh and notable risk on the lives of those patients and there are around uh 500 patients who cannot really uh evacuate it unless they are afforded a very good uh humanitarian and even Medical Care by the Medical Teams yet till now they did not reach the south of the Gaza Strip and even if they reach the south of the Gaza Strip especially for babies there are no any uh safe place for them and as the incubators inside the nasur hospital the only Hospital in the South which can receive those premature babies is a half occupied we're talking about 12 incubators six of them were occupied so it means that there is going to be a kind of compounding in terms of the number of the uh babies who receive medical treatment in the south of Gaza STP T abaz there with the latest for us on what looks to be a devastating air strike on a school in Northern Gaza thank you Tark well if you are just joining us here on Al jazer I do apologize for the graphic images that you're watching there's some blurring there but obviously a large potentially very large death toll at the alpura school in the northern Gaza Strip which we understand the Israeli military has very recently bombed now this is a United Nations run School in the jabalia camp this is also the second school that was bombed just since Friday
