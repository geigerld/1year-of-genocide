let's bring in Heidi Joe Castro now our correspondent in Washington DC Heidi this is of course a developing situation what we've heard from the officials in the US we've had a breakthrough that's what was said on that conference call what else do we know that's right this is information coming from an unnamed top Us official and while they did say that this was a significant opening in these talks they also caution that this doesn't mean that a deal may come through the next few days however this is significant uh again saying that this is a pretty significant opening here uh more information was shed also on this talk between President Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu which lasted about half an hour uh today and in it they did discuss the recent response from Hamas to the latest Israeli uh ceasefire and hostage proposal and though there were not specific details given on how those talks or what those discussions were the readout of this talk between of the call between the two leaders said that they reviewed uh the response from Hamas and talked about just the logistics which seems to be now the biggest hurdle in how to implement uh this deal but again while this is certainly something that the US is hoping for and there seems to be more energy between Behind These talks now the use officials are still cautioning that it doesn't mean that we're expecting to see a deal in just the next few days this is still something that may take weeks if it happens at all and Heidi as you note there and mentioned that I suppose we we shouldn't expect a deal uh in in days or or even weeks but there was a note from that unnamed official that President Biden was encouraged that prime minister Netanyahu was reauthorizing his torm to re-engage in the talks what what can we glean from that absolutely is forward motion as opposed to the stagnation of those talks in Doha in the recent weeks and certainly Biden has been a driving force trying to speak with Netanyahu with Israel one of the US's strongest allies to uh accept the terms of this deal which again Biden has always emphasized originated from the Israeli government itself and Biden will have an opportunity to further try to gain worldwide support in encouraging Israel to take this deal that will be next week when he is expected to talk about the terms of this deal at the NATO Summit here in Washington and Heidi of course if we put this in the context of what we knew earlier about President Joe Biden speaking to prime minister Netanyahu on the phone what else did we hear that those two laders discussed well the readout of the call was very uh non-detailed but we know again that they talked about the ceasefire and we talked that they talked about the Hamas response which came on Wednesday a deliver to Qatari and Egyptian mediators to the latest development in those talks exactly what uh the response is we have still yet to learn all right thank you that's Heidi jastro reporting from Washington DC and we'll just recap that we are following make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
