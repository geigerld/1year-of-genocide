now a spokesperson for the Israeli government says Israel is ready to stop its war on Gaza to return captives however prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reiterated that the goals of the war remain unchanged and that he wants to see Hamas destroyed this comes after US President Joe Biden presented a three-phase ceasefire plan on Friday with the first phase entailing a limited release of captives from Gaza Israel has banned aljazera from reporting from there so we're now going to speak to Imran Khan or correspondent he's joining us from the Jordanian Capital Aman first of all Imran tell us a little bit more about what we've been hearing from Netanyahu and his government well it began as a series of leaks in a parliamentary meeting a concent meeting that was taking place where we heard that the Prime Minister was willing to talk about phase one of that phase uh three-phased ceasefire deal he was willing to commit to that then there was a video recording of the Prime Minister he says this we are working in countless ways to bring the abductees back I think about them all the time for the sake of their families and their suffering that is why we have come a long way to bring them back but in the course of this work we have preserved the goals of the war above all the elimination of Hamas we insist that we complete this and that this is part of the trend it is not something I'm adding now it's not something I'm adding because I was under pressure in the Coalition it's something we unanimously agreed upon in the war council so what this means is that the war council has agreed that they'll take a look at phase one of the ceasefire deal they'll agree to phase one now phase one is an initial six week ceasefire it involves the release of captives uh including women and the elderly from the Gaza Strip exchange of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners while also getting humanitarian Aid into the strip it also includes and this is going to be a problem uh for the Israeli military uh a full and complete uh ceasefire as well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza if they've agreed to that it means that now there's a technical process that takes place Israel has to present this to the caterie and Egyptian mediators the Egyptian mediators and Ceres have to take this to Hamas and get their response now when President Joe Biden gave his initial three-phase proposal Hamas reacted very positively uh towards that so it's now up to Hamas to see uh to look at the deal to look at the details of this deal and to see if they can agree to phase one Prim Benjamin Netanyahu May well be hoping that by putting it over to Hamas that Hamas May well have a problem with this because their position hasn't change they want a permanent ceasefire and therefore it doesn't become his fault anymore that the ceas deal didn't go through it could well be a number of other things a lot of speculation going around right now but what we do know is simply this that perhaps phase one of the ceasefire deal is something the Israelis May well be willing to put to the Qatari and Egyption mediators yes because we've got Netanyahu talking about pressure within his Coalition how fragile is his government when you've got the ultra nationalists threatening to withdraw should he accept the ceasefire deal well already the Finance Minister Beth Del smotrich is talking with his spiritual leaders remember this is a very religious person who is also a very far right uh Minister within the government so he's taking advice from his followers whether he should actually quit the government it'll only take him or um itar benav the national security minister to leave they'll probably both leave together if and it is a big if if they decide to leave but Netanyahu has always had the secret card here he knows that this position of uh Power for those fing far rightwing ministers has never actually happened uh before so they may need to stay in the government just to remain in power and have a say of things that really mean something to them so he's got that going for him as well he also knows that he can probably resist the ter uh the power challenges from Benny Gans for example the war minister from y glant the defense minister because he knows he has uh those far-right ministers who want to support him but but and it is a big it is a butt but it is a significant butt uh those farite ministers are now looking at whether they can try and get another Coalition going or whether they can use the threat of quitting uh to try and force uh Netanyahu into a corner okay Imran Khan joining us there from Aman thanks very much Imran and a reminder again that the Israeli government has banned Al jazer so we are reporting from outside of Israel make sure to subscribe our channel to get the latest news from alaz
