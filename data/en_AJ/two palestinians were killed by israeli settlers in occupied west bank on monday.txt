let's bring in muan Rani is a non-resident fellow at the center of conflict and humanitarian studies and a co-editor of Jalia an online magazine joins us now live from Montreal good to have you with us on the program do you think there's appeals from the UN or even the US state department are going to be heard by Tel Aviv or will they just fall on deaf ears I think they'll fall on their fears as they've fallen on their fears for over half a century um you know the the State Department spokesman expresses concern about these issues imagine if the Palestinian Authority was arming Hamas and Islamic Jihad I suspect we'd hear a lot more than just verbal concern uh from the state department the problem here is that this extremist settler violence is not the problem itself it's a symptom of a much larger problem which is Israel's governmental policy of territorial expansionism in the West Bank since 1967 these settlers are armed by the Israeli State they operate under the offices and with the protection of the Israeli military so to address settler violence independently of Israeli state and government policy um doesn't really make uh much sense it's it's the equivalent of addressing the symptoms while doing nothing about the cause we often hear that the only way that Palestinians in the occupied West Bank can defend themselves is by throwing stones so our viewers to this channel May wonder where are the Palestinian Authority those that are supposed to protect the Palestinians if you could just clarify what their role is in the occupied World Bank yes it's a very good question and and the answer to it is that the role of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces is not to defend Palestinians from attacks by Israelis but rather to protect Israel and its occupation from resistance by its own people the Palestinian Authority security forces are prohibited from operating in those areas outside the main cities where most of the settler violence um take place and they've also taken a political decision to actively cooperate with Israel's Army of occupation in order to um prevent Palestinian resistance to exactly these kinds of instances of settler violence that we're discussing now so the Palestinian Authority is simply not a factor in this equation except that it can be seen as yet another auxiliary of Israel's expansionist policy in the occupied West Bank so in terms of the relationship between Palestinian civilians and their own authority who they would look to to protect them and they know that they can't what are the options then because when pal Palestinians do fight back the Israeli response is very heavy-handed well yes and and and just to clarify that Palestinians in these Villages um that are again located outside the main towns and cities where Forces operate they don't look to the Palestinian Authority for protection they know they're not going to get any um from the Palestinian Authority so what they do is they defend themselves as best they can and it's also in this situation that you've had the emergence of armed militias particularly in the northern West Bank um to more actively resist not only uh the settlers but also the Israeli military which um in the larger scheme of things is a forms a much bigger problem for Palestinian rights than do the settlers we've seen over this last weekend uh the violence increase over the scenario of a settler teenager being found dead and Netanyahu describing it as a heus crime and yet unable to talk about any of the other crimes committed against the Palestinians I suppose that's something that we expect but again to the viewer it just seems that when you are occupied that you should take some responsibility for being the occupier well that's certainly the case under international law um Israel of course views itself as the victim of those that it occupies uh rather than the aggressor against them and again the fundamental problem here is that Israel has an agenda of territorial expansion leading ultimately to the formal annexation of these territories Israel's Western allies have chosen a policy of effectively active support or passive acquiescence their opposition to these Israeli policies never extends Beyond verbal admins and as long as that changes the UN can point to Israel's responsibilities to reign in um settler violence as much as it wants but within the framework of what every human rights situ organization that has looked at this has determined as a situation of apartheid um nothing will change sometimes with such a complicated story it's always good to get back to basics to help our audience understand what's going on so Moon Rani thanks so much for uh unpicking the situation for us thank you thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
