the blood still hasn't dried after Israel hit this refuge for civilians in the jabalia refugee camp unable to find safety anywhere in Gaza it's the result of intensifying operations in the area where Israel's military has once again told thousands of people to evacuate we were sitting peacefully then boom there was a boom a missile from a controlled drone or a regular drone but it did massive damage in the schoolyard there were a few people who were dismembered and cut into pieces I do not know how to explain but they were in pieces and here where they make bread the Arabic flatbread here a child was marted and a woman was injured badly and there were three or four children who were also martyred here for nearly 8 months Palestinians have repeatedly been displaced we have suffered and we have been forced to go through six or seven displacements we went to shua then to alifa and to many other places continuing Israeli attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip means thousands are being forced to flee again they dropped leaflets and called us on our mobiles asking us to leave jabalia camp in other areas and move towards the west of Gaza we didn't move on the first day because we thought they were not serious but then the bombing and shooting started continuing Israeli attacks in the north of the gazal strip mean thousands are being forced to flee again the roads lined with Palestinians clutching whatever they carry but they live with the constant fear that more Israeli attacks are never far behind as nowhere is safe in Gaza hind alaz Gaza Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
