well for more on this Jeremy kendic is president at refugees International he's also a former official in two previous US administrations working on overseas 8 he joins us from Washington DC thank you very much for being with us here on El jazer first of all what do you make of this of Israel temporarily opening the IR border crossing and allowing up to 350 extra trucks to go through do you think it's going to be anywhere near enough at this point in time for what is needed especially in the North of Gaza well it's it's a step in a positive direction but it's certainly still far short of what needs to happen I think it's really striking that after months of denying that they were obstructing Aid um that when President Biden really laid down the line with prime minister Netanyahu suddenly they found a bunch of new ways to unblock Aid um but it's not enough and as the last presenter said without a ceasefire a it will not be possible possible for Aid groups to put together the kind of anti-am operation that Gaza now requires you can't do that solely off the backs of trucks you need the space to operate safely to run malnutrition treatment centers to restore the health system to rebuild Water Systems uh and of course to distribute food at at Large Scale none of that is possible as long as the war is continuing as we mentioned when we were introducing you that you've worked in two previous US administrations specific specifically working on overseas aid can you just give us a little bit of an insight into what you think might have happened behind the scenes uh that pushed Biden finally to put more pressure on Netanyahu to allow more Aid into Gaza well I for for months of course even from the earliest days of this War President Biden has been calling on the Israeli government to adhere to International humanitarian law to protect civilians to protect Aid workers and there has been negligibly little progress on that for six months and I think a few recent events have brought this to a head and and to a point where even President Biden who has been very very reluctant to put pressure on the Israeli government uh could not could not choose any other course but to take a harder line and obviously the world Central Kitchen strike is a huge part of that it shows how broken uh the Israeli system for what's called deconfliction the the the process for protecting humanitarians from military strikes shows how broken that process has been shows how uh flawed The Rules of Engagement are by the Israeli military if they could so easily strike such an obvious humanitarian Convoy but in addition to all that of course there is a famine getting underway in Gaza and as I as I mentioned earlier there's no way to really adequately fight that as long as this work continues yeah and and that's why so many people have been calling for a ceasefire just on president Biden I mean he would be fully briefed uh about the situation on the ground like the realities of what is happening day and day out within Gaza so what do you think why do you think it took him until now until this strike on the world uh Central Kitchen Aid workers for him to have finally put pressure on Netanyahu well I I think this was something that just could not be dismissed or ignored um you know as you as you said earlier in the report and as his own statement said after the world Central Kitchen strike this is not the first time this has happened there have been strikes on humanitarian operations throughout this war there have been more than 170 staff of the uh of uh the UN um principally ana who have been killed over the course of this war but also deaths of staff from save the children uh from anera from uh Doctors Without Borders uh there was an International Rescue committee guest house that was hit staff that was hit so you know this has been a routine thing this is this is an extreme example of a pattern that has been going on throughout and that's why Aid groups have been pushing the president for months now to take a harder line with the Israeli government on that I think that the world Central Kitchen strike and it just made that it it was such a gratuitous example that he could no longer uh he could no longer maintain the support that he's been holding for the Netanyahu government okay thanks so much we really do appreciate you time and your Insight Germany kandek thank you very much thank you
