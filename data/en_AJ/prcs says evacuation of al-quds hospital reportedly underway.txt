Bel vasak is spokeswoman for the Palestine red cresant and she joins us now from rala thanks very much for being with us first of all can you tell us what is happening in Al Goods where you have a number of Staff we know that this Hospital in the last couple of days has had to stop functioning because of a lack of fuel good evening thanks for having me to days ago or 3 days ago the alot Hospital went out of service due to running out of a fuel the situation inside the hospital is dire catastrophic there is around 300 people who are from medical staff patients injured people wounded people and their families they had stock inside the hospital they are ped unable to go out of the hospital and no one even can get into the hospital yeserday uh we have failed to evacuate our teams from inside the hospital because basically under such circum stances they are even feel helpless they can't afford taking care of the patients and wounded people which are their lives into rest as well as even very basic humanitarian need are not available we're talking about food water even running water for the hygiene um and to wash so basically the situation unbearable no one can even live under such circumstances and uh just a couple an hour ago I have received the notific ation from our colleagues in Gaza um the evacuation process start hopefully uh in the coming few minutes we were here that it went successful but the last H news I heard as the 300 people along with the staff patients wounded people were able to evacuate many have to walk by foot because we don't have enough vehicles and we use the vehicles the ambulances for our wounded people and patients and now they are in the process of being checked and searched by Israeli military occupation forces hope hopefully they can pass to so they will be evacuating to South to be treated and and give Health Care Services in one of the hospitals in the South I just want to uh just ask quickly what where are these people going you say they're evacuating from Al coulds but where are they going yeah they they they are going to um one of the hospitals in the South I'm not sure which hospital they are going to be taken to but basically as you know there's no way none of the hospitals now are operating almost in Gaza so basically there's only one Hospital which has two doctors and no way it has the capacity to receive our patients so the only option is to take our patients wounded people and the staff to one of the hospitals that are still operating uh in the South this is the plan because basically Ally we are over one week Al's hospital has been completely isolated all roads have been enclosed from all areas with complete cut of communication as well as Internet so now this is the only avable solution which uh which has been done and which with the struggle because basically even yesterday Israel again occupation forces isolated the hospital and started shooting um and there was strong bombardments which risked the of our patients and our staff so hopefully they they are now will be in the South receiving Medical Services which is by the way the situation in the south is not very well because basically we also run Al Hospital uh which is also have um announced yesterday at at the evening that Al Amal Hospital the major generator also was shut down because running out of a fuel so basically all hospitals whether in the North or whether in the in the South are facing the same threat the same risk which is running out of a fuel and are in urgent need for fuel to have electricity I just want to highlight the other main hospital in the north alifa we've been hearing a lot about the dire situation there and I believe we got some of the latest pictures from inside alifa hospital that we're playing now you can see many many people lying in the corridors we know that thousand thousand of people are Sheltering in this Hospital they're in the dark because there is no power in that hospital noal we know that this is another hospital that's been surrounded by Israeli forces and it's coming under Fire it's coming under attack also that there are dozens of premature babies in this Hospital whose lives are hanging by a thread do you know any update on on the babies there or what the situation is inside alifer at the moment so basically the same picture I have draw to Al's hospital is the same for AA Hospital which has been ped isolated completely from land and from Air as well no one can get into aifa hospital no one can go out of aifa Hospital any human being is just moving in that area will be a target for Israeli tanks unfortunately people staff patients doctors nurses medical staff are trapped inside the hospital with no food no water no no power and simply nothing they barely can afford taking care of those patients and wounded people as well as every single minute put in a risk a lives of a premature baby or a patient in the ICU the situation is disaster is catastrophic this is the situation now for all hospitals in Gaza they have isolated us this was the plan from the beginning of the escalation when they started issuing the evacuation orders against the hospitals we have refused evacuation orders we have stayed along with our patients wounded people for the last second what they have done is preventing aid from getting into the hospitals isolating the hospitals attacking the hospitals surrounding the hospitals cutting off communication landlines Powers everything so now we're in a dire situation those hospitals have been left alone without being able to continue providing their life saving Services we have receiving tens of calls even in the area that is surrounding of a shifa hospital for people trapped in their homes they can't even evacuate their homes because Israeli tanks in the area and they simply Target anyone who tried to move in this area unfortunately the dire situation not only for those hospitals because if you just think about it that means people who are killed under continuous bombardments that is taking place in Gaza and the north have been left alone without getting Medical Services because basically there is no hospitals to receive them I just said it's one Hospital which is al- madani Hospital which has been bombarded at the beginning of the escalation with with two doctors and then in the north we have ala hospital and the Indonesian Hospital which is also both in a dire situation with no power so basically if you need medical services you not going to find any hospital to receive you and giving you the medical service that you need on top of that the Emergency Medical Services is dire we have only five ambulances out of 18 to serve both Gaza and the north we have receiving hundreds of calls for people tra in their homes with no food no water no power on top of that there's people who are killed trapped in their homes I I have just accidentally went to our Dispatch Center to check to check on our staff at Al's hospital because I said complete cut of communication and at that moment they got a call from a woman she was in a desperate situation crying asking for urgent help because there was five family members who are killed and trapped in their homes they even can't go out of the home to bury those people five people five other family members were injured and they are in urgent need to get medical services as well as in total they are 25 family members who need to be evacuated they wanted to go out of their homes but simply they are trapped by Israeli tanks that Target every human being that is walking and unfortunately as a humanitarian organization we feel helpless we can't do nothing we can't even R reach those people who are in desperate need for our medical services and only have been left alone because Israel tanks Target every ambulance every paramedic try to reach these areas where Israeli tanks are existed so we have called on again and again to the International Community to ensure our safe access to the wounded people and those who are in need so we can continue providing our life- saving Services no words no words in the vocabulary that could describe the desperate situation for all Palestinians whether they are live in Gaza and the North or even the South even in the South now people are struggling to have food water everything I just said even our Hospital in the house has went out of service nebal faac we do have to leave it there terrible situation that you're describing to us and you are having to hear it from those hundreds of people who are calling your organization every day thank you very much taking the time to speak to us to try and share some of anguish that people in the Gaza Strip are feeling nebal fasac thanks very much from the Palestine red crescent
