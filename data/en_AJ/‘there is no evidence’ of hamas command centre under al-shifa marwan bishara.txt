bring in Marwan bishal and now Al jazer senior political analyst talk more about this so let's talk about this Israeli video uh first we had um a couple of uh phrases that uh um struck me there from our correspondent Hamden a beating heart and hole in the ground I'm guessing you think it's the latter pretty much actually uh for I mean I think I I've developed the capacity to dismiss uh all kinds of claims by the Israelis first of all because I think um their spokespersons are liars and they have proved to be so over not just this war but previous Wars as well the Israeli military deploys soldiers and also deploys Spinners on Army of spinners the spokespersons and and other PR um staff involved in spin I mean that's their job in fact to be honest Haim I would be disappointed if they didn't because you know dogs barks and snakes bite and and Israeli Army lies I mean that's their thing the question is for what purpose at this point in time it's because they're desperate they uh the LIE has caught up with a liar and clearly um the international public opinion International media their Western allies are not convinced that they have much of a proof for what they say is the headquarters of Hamas under shifa hospitals multiple layers of floors and and 1,300 kilometers of tunnels 40 to 70 M deep that was the estimates by the Israelis and their pundits in Western capitals none of that is there of course we know that there are tunnels in Gaza everyone knows there are tunnels in Gaza so what if there are tunnels in Gaza the question is what is Israel doing now to us and to others in the international media is what we call deflection they are discredited they are involved in war crimes today as we speak about some tunnel some hole some diaper left somewhere some calendar Israel is laying Siege to the Evangelical the madani hospital in Gaza now as we speak but we are all keeping busy with their allegations remember when our colleague sh abaki was killed by the Israelis they did redirection immediately deflection they said the Palestinians kilder we know that the Palestinians killed Shireen and we spent weeks and on trying to prove and they're trying to prove the our way but we missed the point that they killed journalists that they kill innocent people civilians in Janine like they do now in Gaza they sieg the hospitals in fact this war turned out to be a war on hospitals and now they're trying to walk back the pretext and why they did it now that there is no evidence not a shred of evidence this is not even circumstantial evidence because they now they also show up videos about about Hamas apparently I mean according to them Hamas taking patients into hospitals from the main gates right I mean if Hamas was taking an injured captive hostage into the hospital they should be thanked for it for trying to save the lives of captives that is not a proof that a shifa hospital has used as his quarters that is a proof that they're trying to keep the captives Al lives in order to exchange them for more of the same children and women and so on held in Israeli prisons uh let's move on then to the the other story about the HTI um seizure of this cargo ship uh um in in the southern Red Sea apparently linked to a ship apparently linked to an Israeli businessman what what what do you make of that is this part of the what you call the distraction uh of the of The Narrative of what's happening in Gaza I mean it's probably not intentional of course but I think there is a we we spoke about deflection now we talk about redirection right this is called the redirection meaning instead of us focusing on the main story on the main tragedy on the main genocide unraveling and far our eyes in plain sight now we talk about violation of international law in the Red Sea why are we talking about international law in the Red Sea when they are laying Siege on another hospital in Gaza when people are starved in Gaza when people can get medical treatment in Gaza when people can get fuel electricity in Gaza when people are again displaced and ethnically clinged in Gaza but we are talking about some some incident that happened in the Red Sea until and unless this turns into some sort of a origional war for the time being this this kind of a ongoing exchange if you will between the United States and Iran is not benefit benefiting the people in Palestine it's certainly not of of any assistance to those under bombings Under Siege under Collective punishments in Palestine so whether it's what whatever the intentions are that's not what I'm concerned with here what I'm concerned with is there is a main story story I we call it the story a main tragedy unraveling in our eyes and while different partners and different uh and different players and different actors are sort of trying to maneuver around it in the end of the day let's all not lose sight of what is important what is a priority and that is Gaza Under Siege Gaza under bombing Gaza being starved Gaza being ethnically cleansed the Israelis love more nothing more than for us to keep discussing videos and diapers and international law and shipping laws when in fact what they are doing is flattening Gaza and killing its people aler senior political analyst Maran bash thank you
