the international court of justice is due to hold hearings over extra emergency measures sought by South Africa against Israel's attacks on Rafa during its war in Gaza that ptor is demanding an immediate halt to Israeli violence more than 1.5 million Palestinians who've been Sheltering in the southern city are now fleeing South Africa wants the court to order Israel to allow unhindered access to this strip for un officials humanitarian agencies journalists and investigators the un's top court ordered Israel in January to do everything in its power to prevent genocidal acts and allow Aid into Gaza William shabas is a professor of international law at middle sex University his work is focused on human rights and international criminal law and he joins us now live from London Mr chabas always nice to have you on the program thanks for your time can we just begin with another hearing at the icj being brought about by South Africa for additional measures have the ground realities changed in Gaza in enough in your opinion for this presentation to be made by South Africa they tried in January and it nothing much happened well yes they've gone back this will be the fourth request by South Africa for provisional measures and as you mentioned at the end of January they were successful in getting an order they again obtained an additional order late in March and they are arguing now they'll be presenting before the court this afternoon in the ha um that the circumstances have have developed and evolved now where they are essentially claiming that they're in this is the end this is the end of Gaza and with the destruction of Rafa the threatened destruction of Rafa that that this is sort of the final stage and and so they're asking for a renewed order and in particular they're focusing on a requirement of a ceasefire that the military activities stop altogether and this will be for the court to decide the court has clearly indicated the urgency of the matter the application was filed on Friday of last week and they've said a hearing for today 5 days later and this is really uh extremely unusual they haven't responded with the same kind of urgency before so it shows that the court is taking this as a very serious matter uh I just want to reiterate do you actually think that the the the the presentation of this is the end for Rafa is going to sway the Court well U you know it's it's a difficult thing to predict how a court is going to respond the court has been fairly consistent in its uh in in the way it's addressed this crisis since since January and I think it's fairly United on it uh how of course the court has a lot of freedom in terms of what they order as well I don't see them retreating for anything they've said earlier um but you know they could they could either reinforce it they could make a much stronger order um this is really in this these are the details these are the nuances it's a court that's that although it tries to get unanimity in its orders uh there are a lot have been a lot of separate opinions in recent in the more recent orders not just in this case but also in the companion case that was filed by Nicaragua against Germany and so you know the courts these are 17 15 individuals with with their own views and their own approaches so it's it's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to emerge so Mr shabas just for our International audience as well just to clarify uh South Africa has made these approaches to the icj orders have been made to some extent have they been implemented by Israel from October the 7th to today no they have not and of course this is one of the things that South Africa is seeking is some recognition by the court that Israel has failed to implement them it doesn't mean that these have been to no purpose or to have no effect because they have clearly influen the political situation and the political debate the determinations by the court in these provisional measures orders have had a huge political impact uh not only on on states that have been traditionally very critical of Israel but also on many of the states that are most friendly to it who are persuaded I think are increasingly persuaded uh of the of the of the harm that Israel is doing and of the need to stop it by the rulings of the court to date so they've been significant in my opinion we we will certainly see what the court does have to say and how the presentations are laid out around about 1300 uh GMT here on Al jazer William shabas joining us from London thank you sir make sure to Subs subbe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
