and let me also remind you Samy that people um evacuate and flee their houses without taking like even their food so people start looking from scratch for food for stock of food and this is why it's very miserable and also the situation where people are evacuating and garbage is everywhere sewage is everywhere and and and it's very hard it I think there's something going on um there's toothing around us H shall we let you you take cover I think I think yes yes hind I think we're going to let you take cover and when things settle down and you're safe we come back to you let's take you back to Gaza where we're now getting reports of a shooting outside the luxa hospital it's go to hind she's of course in in central Gaza and hind what can you tell us we saw some very dramatic pictures just a moment ago what's happening there well we still do not know what's happening but it's it's it's it's it's more of a an incident between uh people between each other and this is comes on the psychological warfare that's currently going happening in Gaza we're talking about a complete chaos there has been no policemen we're talking about nine months of War where people are shattered across the streets there has been no policeman there has been a lot of uh dangerous incidents happening other than air strikes and other than the artillery shutting and this is this was one of the main uh things that we um observed especially after every time uh policemen go out on the streets and start um um organizing stuff the Israeli forces have been targeting all of the policemen and uh and policeman cars around the STP so that's why this is one of the few incidents that is happening every a couple of days and it's it's it's very sad that it's it's happening it's adding more sorrow and more grief and more misery to the lives of Palestinian but imagine um a place without any policemen without anyone organizing people are all displaced uh scattered across the street they have been no like it it it's all due to the continuous displacement that's happening and it's all uh the reason of this war and the ongoing of this war and just to clarify did you say h that there was an incident there was a shooting incident between people between people there well actually all I saw is people covering their faces with guns um um shooting at each other I don't really know who these people are and that's why my te and I try to take cover on the side but again I told you this has been one of the few incidents but it's also very dangerous because alaka hospital is not only a hospital there are hundreds of families currently seeking Refuge taking refuge in this hospital and there are a lot of children too we're looking at uh some pictures hind as we're talking to you it seems people are are mulling around do you have any sense of whether things are back to normal or whether there is some kind of of situation that is still ongoing there of course we should yes I think I think in the couple of minutes everything's going to get back normal some people are volunteering and initiating to put this uh um to put this to an end but uh but people are horrified they do not know what's happening and also I told you that we're talking about a displacement makeshift Camp hospital where a lot of children and Palestinians are here so it's going to take a little bit of time so people will feel relaxed again and to move normally back again all right thanks so much hind will let you gather some more information about what's happening there no doubt will'll be coming back to you again make sure to subscribe to our channel to get latest news from aler
