okay let's take a closer look at what we've heard about the latest round of negotiations according to Al jazer sources Israel has told mediators it rejects stopping the war and withdrawing its forces from Gaza but Hamas is demanding a full ceasefire Hamas also wants Palestinians to be able to return to Northern Gaza but Israel says it will only allow 2,000 displaced people a day to return now at that rate it would take more than two years for all displaced Palestinians to leave Rafa Israel wants the release of Israeli captives of all categories in the first stage of the deal but Hamas has indicated it will only release women and children there are also differences over the release of Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails well we're now joined on the line by basam name a member of the Hamas political Bureau uh first of all that is what I outlined there that is what we understand Israel's response to be is that how you understand things uh right now and if so just how big a setback is this to any sort of ceasefire deal thank you very much uh a lot of information distributed in the media this night and the day before uh are misleading informations from the Israeli side and unfortunately also from the American side because in order to exercise the maximum pressure on the negotiators from from the uh side of the resistance uh to yield to the Israeli will uh we are negotiating for ending the aggression we are negotiating for a ceasefire we are negotiating to relieve the suffering of our people and to allow our people who has been forcefully under carbet bombardment left their houses to the South to return back to their houses the Israelis are looking for the negotiation as for in according to one or or on in the context of one goal hostages release it is not about ending the war it is not about withdrawal total withdrawal of the forces from the Gaza STP and it is not about allowing the Palestinians to return back to their houses our proposal which was a total comprehensive proposal handed over to the mediators and also to the Americans from the first moment they have braised it as a very positive cooperative and uh constructive sorry and uh it is within the context of Paris 1 and Paris 2 MH uh unfortunately uh despite Paris one and Paris 2 has been negotiated with the Israelis directly which means what the Israelis today uh tell what the Israelis today uh uh to what they have told the negotiators today is much worse or beyond the Paris one and to and therefore the movement has clearly told the mediators that we cannot accept negotiating any prisoner deal unless the Israelis give uh the guarantees and the commitment guaranteed by the mediators and by by the USA and un and so on and so on they are ready total withdraw and to the right to to the dis people so you say that this from what you've heard from Israel this is much worse than what was put out there when it came to the Paris talks how much of a surprise is this then because certainly from the outside at the very least it seemed like real progress was being made here it is very shocking that the mediators have unfortunately accepted to to uh to uh to convey or to hand over this Israeli ideas to the to to the to our side because based on Baris one and Barce 2 and a long talks and negotiations and contacts with the mediators and with the Americans they have promised that at least these three uh demands of a total ceas Fair uh total withdraw and the return of our displaced people to their houses there is a positive and there's an acceptance from the isi side now suddenly uh out of nothing the Israelis are rejecting therefore we believe we believe that it is not about negotiations it is not about a ceas fair it is about Benjamin Netanyahu is uh using the negotiations as a cover and to gain more time and more time to continue it his plans by complete bombardment the rest of the Gaza Strip including ra and to release the tension inside isra and also to release the international pressure during this Security Council discussion therefore it is about Netanyahu rejection of ending this aggression despite of all presses given all of that are you still going to sit down at the negotiating table and try and hash out a ceasefire here we have told the negotiators tonight that we are not ready to discuss any further uh you pieces of proposals we are in need for a total comprehensive proposal responding to all our demands and then we can be engaged in a prisoner deal uh to reach finally a total lasting cere so that by the way I have to tell you something that and your audience all the countries who have exp have presented their Readiness to participate in the rebuilding of Gaza and the relief of the humanitarian catastroph in the G they have said we cannot do it unless we see a clear clear total and comprehensive and Lasting SE Fair therefore without this it means Gaza will not be rebelled buttina will will not be able to return back to their houses okay so just to clarify at this point in time these talks these latest round of negotiations in Doha they are over as of right now first of all there there are no negotiations because it is it is they are we are we can talk about talks between the Israelis and the mediators there is no negotiations with us we are not now engaged in a negotiation process with the Israelis indirectly through the mediators what would get you back to that table to to speak with the mediators once again to to get a a total comprehensive response about uh regarding our demands of the three main points the total ceas Fair total withdrawal and and allowing all our people display from their houses to return back to their houses again how confident are you that you would be able to get those three points across the line at some point in time unfortunately it depends not you we are we are ready to continue uh our or to express our steadfastness and resistance as long as n want because we have no choice but it depends on the mediators on the super power the Americans and Europeans to exercise more pressure in on Benjamin Netanyahu in order not to endanger not only the Palestinian situation but also the whole region and to undermine any chance for long-term stability security prosperity in the region okay thank you so much we do appreciate your time and uh talking us through all of this that is Bim a member of the Hamas political Bureau okay we're joining me now uh right here is Luciano zakara he's an associate uh Professor uh at the golf study center first of all what is your response uh to heras there are you as surprised and taken back as uh Bassam name appeared to be I'm not surprised because they keep saying the same that they were demanding since the very beginning of the negotiations the the stop of the the ceas fire immediate ceas fire and the the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and the possibility of people in Gaza in Rafa to return to the northern Gaza these are the same demands they have been doing since the very beginning ER but according to to what we heard is the discussion about the uh the Seas FS not on the table on the Israeli side and unfortunately this has been the Israeli position since the very beginning as well there is no discussion about cisar cire unless all the hes are released so we are in the dead point that is difficult to break yeah I mean I would have thought that a lot of this would have been discussed before both sides came to talk with the mediators because we we've known this for some time Israel re rejects stopping the war and withdrawing uh and Hamas wants a full ceasefire I mean it seems quite strange at this point in time that they both sides knowing the either one's positions would would even sit down with mediators well I I assume that both are expecting someone to press the other side to reach to to to close the this this Gap that exist I mean we saw that at least united state has been pushing a little bit more pressuring more Israel but as far as there is no United Nations security Council resolution supported by the US asking or demanding for the immediate C far Israel will not feel the total pressure from the United States so Israel can keep pushing uh the limits I mean they said that they agree with the United States proposal regarding how many people can exchange uh for the hostages but it seems that the United States not even requesting that United States requesting not to entering into Rafa but they are not requesting them directly to stop the ceire bessam name was saying there that uh he doesn't believe Hamas does not believe at this point in time that Israel is acting in good faith that this is not really about a trying to come to any ceasefire agreement this is about extending the war on Gaza what did you make of that statement this this one of the interpretation we had we said before this could be uh just gaining time to push the limits uh for the operation the military operation in Rafa that they keep repeating they will do regardless of any uh rejection from the United States or the International Community even uh gues uh the secret the Secretary General of United Nations so maybe this is a way to gain time rather than honestly following a negotiation that will finish with something that is tangible at the same time uh we've heard the armed wing of Hamas say uh that a 34 year-old Israeli captive has died due to a lack of medicine and food what did you make of that and how much extra pressure do you think that that is going to put on Netanyahu or is he immune to that sort of pressure at this point in time I don't think he he ever cared that much about that I mean we we keep seeing that the there are weekly protests in Israel itself with the family members of people that they are hostage they are demanding Netanyahu to change their demand even to step down six months so far and he hasn't changed his mind so why someone one of the hostages dying would change his mind okay we'll have to leave it there but we uh do appreciate your time zakara thank you
