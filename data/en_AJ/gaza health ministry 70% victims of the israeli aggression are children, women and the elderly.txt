Dr ashra is the Ministry of Health spokesman in Gaza in a news conference he said the death toll is expected to rise four complete hospitals are out of service for being directly hit Al Han Al alarama and the international Opthalmology Hospital hospitals and medical facilities across Gaza strips amid the huge influx of dead bodies and injured persons due to the is massacres perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces led to the fact that all the remaining functioning facilities are operating at 150% capacities let's bring in Palestinian journalist Han abua he joins us from KH unun in the Gaza strip so hany tell us how the killings particularly of seven children from the bakri family how's it reverberating there in Gaza yes Sammy there is a lot of frustration right now among Palestinians as de is a growing concern that uh there is no safer place in Gaza and everybody starts to worry about their their family members their loved ones and their children um let me tell you Sami I walked through the corridor of the hospital and I I I had a a brief chat with some of the parents who who just are very very angry and frustrated and and directly uh and and saying that it just Israel is at war with its children Israel is not at war with whatever goal whatever they wanted to achieve whatever they they designated as as militants that they wanted to Target what's a clear from the incoming large number of casualties and and large percentage of them made of it children it just it just it makes it impossible to believe the Israeli narrative at this point but the um overall uh there is a sense of a frustration yet people are concerned they are worried there is fear everywhere that this might be your last minute walking into your house because you don't know most of the residentials home targeted across the Gaza Strip are targeted without a warning so basically we're talking about entire buildings falling on the heads of of people inside of them if you are not killed by the bombs you're likely to get killed by the heavyweight of the concrete and steel of that building hany we also heard from Ministry of Health officials that hospitals are going out of service what does that mean now for gazans who are injured in those Israeli air strikes yes yes Sammy what it what it really means is that most hospitals in Gaza they already there already five Hospital of service uh technically we're talking about entire buildings and facilities are turning into a graveyard P because they're not functioning or operating properly lack of the fuels and electricity and medical supplies just turn these large buildings into large morgs basically and just as we speak um at exactly uh at 220 as we were preparing for for this report a massive explosion Was Heard near the vicinity of the hospital where we are reporting it from the target was a residential home in Al AML neighborhood West line of Han yunas five people reported killed at the spot three of them are children under the age of five and there are more than 35 injuries brought to nther hospital the hospital is already running out of essential needs at the moment and pushing a very critical emergency schedule of 1 hour on 1 hour off just to sustain whatever lift of the fuel to keep one generator an entire hospital with um operation rooms an emergency department running on one uh power generators at the moment we are looking into a a catastrophic human crisis in Gaza hospitals very very soon and unless the borders are open and and Convoy of humanitarian AIDS are allowed into Gaza and hany the question on the minds of many people this talk about an agreement to get Aid in through Rafa you are in Rafa today any indication of when that Aid might come [Music] in just to point out this ambulance is rushing it from a bombing side what it means if the if the ambulance if the ambulance is doesn't stop at the emergency department it means it it's carrying a dead body and that number of people after the ambulance they are running after their family member who have been pronounced killed uh and this is the scene from from the hospital speaking of RAF Crossing uh we we were at the at the Crossing earlier this morning as we anticipated uh the opening of The Crossing in front of the the 20 trucks on the Egyptian side uh we were told later on by some of the The Crossing admin Personnel that they were not uh they were not told of any sort of opening today we are looking into tomorrow it might be the case but we all know that the opening the decision to open the borders is is conditional to an Israeli approval the Israeli Prime Minister so far is cataloging a list of the preconditions and one one major precondition is the is the guarantee that none of these uh humanitarian Aid reach to any Hamas member and as of as of this moment we don't have a confirmation whether the The Crossing will open tomorrow or not whether these 20 trucks will be allowed or not but in the middle of this there is an intensive literally an intensive air strikes campaign in every corner of the Gaza Strip all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Han Aba
