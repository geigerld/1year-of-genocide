Israel's war on Gaza has caused major damage to both the built and natural environments toxic chemicals and explosives rain down on the Strip sanitation and water treatment systems are destroyed how much environmental damage is the war causing this is Inside hello welcome to the program I'm Adrian finegan Palestinians continue to suffer in Israel's brutal war on Gaza tens of thousands killed and injured with the tall Rising daily one of the most intense bombing campaigns since World War II will leave not just a legacy of grief for gaza's people but one of lasting physical damage to the environment in which they live the collapse of water and sanitation systems and Israeli threats to flood the tunnels underneath Gaza could be catastrophic for freshwater supplies and reserves thousands upon thousands of Israeli and Western supplied bombs dropped on Gaza bring not just death but a toxic Legacy from explosive chemicals dust and debrief from destroyed buildings pollute the air and ground Israel's military offensive in Gaza is leaving a new layer of toxic chemicals in its soil adding to those Left Behind after the many wars that it's waged before we'll be discussing the environmental cost of the war with our guests in just a few moments but first a report from car leg military vehicles the production of weapons and equipment and Supply chains the UN says Israel dropped 42 bombs an hour on Gaza during the first few weeks of War damaging or completely destroying more than 60% of homes it's also attacked water treatment systems and polluted Water Supplies leading to sewage being dumped directly into the sea now there are reports the Israeli military is pumping sea waterer into the network of underground tunnels used by Hamas by flooding the foundation of Gaza it means adding more problems to the already existing problem the Earth is very soft by being soft it is detrimental for the civilians to have all this flood under their knees by the Israelis who are very much aware what they are doing but they really don't care human rights groups have also accused Israel of using white phosphorus the toxic substance not only causes severe burns but can remain in the soil for years causing long-term damage if you have heavy industry bombed then you have all the pollution in heavy industry that gets released into the environment in a very uncontrolled way that that can leave residual pollution for decades every aspect of life in Gaza is affected by some form of pollution and with the start of the rainy season the threat to people and the environment from disease acid rain and contaminated water is only set to worsen after 16 years under Israeli Siege Palestinians have been forced to adapt about 60% of the population used solar energy to power their homes but Israeli bombing has damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of buildings many with solar panels it will take years to clean up the military pollution and contamination of the soil water and air and the carbon emissions from its reconstruction will come at a cost to all forms of life in Gaza carg Al jazer for Inside Story well along with allegations of genocide Israel is also accused of committing ecocide of devastating proportions in CA broadly defined equaide means Mass damage or destruction to the environment to the detriment of Life committed with full knowledge of the risks the term was first used during the Vietnam War by scientists concerned at the US government's use of millions of liters of toxic herbicide agent orange which caused widespread birth deformities the chemical was used to clear forests that gave Viet Kong Fighters cover and food only a few countries Define ecocide as a crime since Russia's war in Ukraine there's been pressure in Europe to make it a war crime which could be tried at the international criminal [Music] court so let's bring in our guests for today's discussion from rala in the occupied West Bank we're joined by NADA majdalani Palestinian director of Ecco Peace Middle East the organization brings together Jordanian Palestinian and Israeli environmentalists to promote shared protection of their environmental Heritage from Rafa in southern Gaza Maan badl who heads the Gaza program coordination unit of the the Palestinian Water Authority in other words he's the engineer who oversees Water Supplies to Gaza and also in rala hadil ikm director general of the climate change section of the Palestinian authorities environment quality Authority she's just represented Palestine at cop 28 in Dubai a warm welcome to you all NADA let's begin with you can we confidently describe what Israel is doing uh in Gaza with its bombing as eosi yes thank you um thank you for for for hosting us and uh I would say yes uh what what is happening at the moment is uh is an EOS side uh definitely the environmental Outlook uh at the moment uh is ex exacerbating day by day uh the uh original condition before October 7th and before uh uh the aggressions on Gaza Strip uh have already been in a very dire situation already Gaza had suffered from uh polluted uh underground water where 97% of the uh aquifer uh was uh not suitable for human consumption uh we were speaking about uh tremendous uh problems regarding uh solid waste and and wastewater treatment due to the uh shortages of fuel um and and several other issues however uh at the moment the situation has been uh uh grave and exacerbated uh we have uh no information whatsoever about uh the situation in the south in the North in terms of the amount of destruction of infrastructure uh facilities that support water supply and sanitation uh the situation in the south is uh also uh in in a very critical situation where 1.9 million uh people are actually uh displaced uh and and confined in a very uh small uh surface area uh which means we are at the verge of an environmental catastrophe in terms of the spread of pandemic disease the accumulation of uh of uh corpses in the street also from the North and the middle areas uh that would actually also uh provide uh susception to to uh pandemic disease es um we're also looking at now we have uh the raining season has already started uh the flooding is uh as you might have seen already from uh jabalia refugee camp and some areas there are videos that are horrifying ofada I'm I'm sorry to interrup we we'll come on we we'll talk some more in in just a moment but I want to give our other guests a chance to have have their say too Maan um describe for us the impact of Israel's bombing on gaza's Water Sanitation and hygiene infrastructure where did gazans get their water before the war was it safe to drink given that Gaza has been subjected to Israeli bombing many times in the past and how was sewage dealt with in what state is the sewage infrastructure now uh thank you for this opportunity in fact Before the War uh Gaza Strip depends mainly on the ground water and limited percentage of desalinated water from the sea water desalination plants and purchased uh small quantities from the Israeli side through three connections before the war almost around 35% of the population of Gaza Strip they could use the tab water for drinking and for other uh usage but 65% of the population they receive receive salty water uh for decades for decades the Palestinian in in Gaza they over pump the groundw and this is make a sea water intrusion which Elevate the level of the uh senility in addition of four decades before the Palestinian Authority came to and controlled Gaza and the West Bank the majority of the gazans they use IC tanks at the sewage disposal Pro method and this is make a lot of pollutant mainly the nitrate to infiltrates for decades to the groundw which resulted in 97% of the aquaair in Gaza was unusable it cannot be used by human being despite all this uh facts the Palestinian Water Authority and the Palestinian Authority they did and start their uh strategic planning to rehabilitate the aquafer and from one side and to supply the portable water for the gazans the strategy and the plans uh put in uh action since 19 uh since 2015 and by the end of 20 22 we reached to the percentage that 35% of the population mainly inun part of western Gaza and now now is the uh destruction happened in the sewage Network mainly and the shortage of the fuel and the shortage of electricity leftt most of the bumping station out of use and this is make the opportunity for sewage water to flly blood in the streets and create a bad environment which could impact the public health and the environment as well okay in the last two days I'm sorry I'm sorry to interrupt you can you just very briefly if Israel carries through on its threat to flood the tunnel Network which runs under Gaza uh with with seawater what impact would that have on uh on the water infrastructure yeah now the if they will pump these huge quantities of seawater underneath the Gaza that means first of all uh there's a opportunity that this water by the ends will infiltrates to the groundw and this is will blute the ground water with more sea water and this is could damage the aquafer to a a limit that couldn't be reversible in the coming decays the second part that there's the structure of the soil in Gaza is a sandy soil and the these layers of Sandy layers they could collapse under the pressure of these huge quantities of water and this is will create a chance for the buildings and for the infrastructure underneath to be collapsed and destructed so not only they will emba the aquer and they will damage the aqua for decads but also they create opportunity to collapsing buildings streets under infrastructure under the streets in in the areas hadil Israel has for many years controlled gaza's energy suppliers uh out of necessity gazans have have had to find alternative sources of power solar energy of course being one of them what what impact has the war had on gaza's energy infrastructure um thank you for this question actually Gaza is under siege since almost 20 years ago and this secures all of the resources natureal resources energy resources uh so there's a problem already present before the war and this genocide on Gaza and imagine the situation after this genocide that all the Investments that have been done during the 10 the last 10 years were all distracted and massive destructed a lot of solar panels and solar uh initiatives and renewable energy Investments uh provided by the government or the private sector or NOS for small projects or or for for certain areas in Gaza most of them are destroyed and by and totally distracted or partially distracted by the by the Israeli um strikes on Gaza plus uh the fuels uh that that um uh operate all the the the the water Tre salination units all the region or all the the city is has been shut down and the and the lockdown and The Siege also uh prevent those amounts uh of of energy resources to uh to to oper to operation and uh um and to enable people to to have the facility from energy and the energy resources so this basically this war hinders all the environment and life aspects in Palestine and energy security food security water security all the environment uh components are hindered and endangered from these massive destructive that Gaza has has been since the 7th of October nada I I was reading a a piece at at al.com in which you were quoted as saying that the war has destroyed every aspect of gaza's environment uh certainly I mean um we're seeing a collective amount of of threats to uh to the environment and to the public health uh first of all Let's uh not forget that uh Israel is utilizing um um chemical weapons like white phosphorus uh this is the completely uh not only from a humanitarian perspective uh that is uh dangerous to to the human humans that are bombarded uh but as well this is affecting uh the uh air pollution the residues from white phosphorus bombs is now in the atmosphere with the rainy season we will expect that these residues will uh precipitate uh with the rain uh which actually unfortunately many people now are collecting to utilize for drinking this is a grave situation where people might be at the moment drinking unsafe water that they're collecting personally from the streets from even plastic sheets uh and and this is one one part that is worrying the other part that also people are drinking salty water that is untreated as hadil had mentioned uh that small scale desalination units are not operating because of the lack of fuel therefore people are drinking salty water and this is very dangerous to even people who have kidney and and liver diseases uh the uh drinking of polluted water with sewage elements and water B diseases uh is very high at the moment we're seeing a rising and rocketing numbers of children who are suffering diarrhea uh and and bloody diarrhea uh as well as there's a danger of parasitic infections as well as um uh uh uh hepatitis uh chicken pox we're seeing those uh rocketing numbers in the shelters Maan uh you spoke about the fact that that even before the war 6 5% of of people in Gaza didn't have access to to Safe Drinking Water what will it take to repair gaza's water infrastructure how long will it take who should pay for its repair and and will gaza's water supply ever be fully safe given the damage that that uh that has been inflicted upon it yeah uh first of all uh till this moment there is no assessment uh accurate assessment to the damage happened to the water facilities and the infrastructure related to the water and sanitation since uh most of the areas are not accessible so the accurate assessment didn't take uh took place till today but from the news and from the what we are seeing in the uh North and in the Gaza City and even in the Midland in the South the Palestinian Authority with the inter International donors communities and the world supported the Palestinians in the last 10 years around 750 million us do had been spent to rehabilitate and to upgrade the water and was water infrastructure and sector within the Gaza Strip now the majority of these facilities uh we have one dissemination plant in the north which is out of views it's damaged the level of the damage cannot be assisted remotely uh the infrastructure uh piping system the networks are damaged uh groundwater Wells there is so many are impacted by the uh from the war activities in the surrounding areas uh we don't have accurate information about the uh North uh West Water Tre land in the East part of jabalia we don't have information clear accurate information about the wor waterer treatment plant in the east of canun City uh but the majority of the infrastructure in the north and in Gaza had been impacted to a level of or so uh considering the uh level of the damages we think that at least we need uh months till we assess all the infrastructure and the water facilities and to account the damage happened and we believe that we needs years to fix the water facilities and the water networks and the water supply system and the was water uh I would just want to uh make a comment related to the water short shortage and its impact on the public health mainly on the shelters according to the wh standards the minimum there should be around 30 L per capita per day till this moment we didn't succeed to reach this uh quantities the majority of the people receive less than 20 liter per cap birth day and according to the UN records there's around 400,000 cases of diseases that they related to the water or the shortage of the water skin diseases there are uh hepatite a lot of uh cases that has been record in the shelters and this is make the problem of the bul the bulk public health is more seriously a threat even when the war is stopped to deal with all these cases of uh diseases and uh the possibility to be spread because of the crowded number in the shelters because of the polluted environment in the entire streets and around the shelters and even within the shelter itself okay hadil what will it take to repair the environmental damage W on on Gaza can can it ever be repaired will it ever be fully habitable again the scale of the destruction has Israel deliberately tried to make Gaza uninhabitable do you think uh Israel from the occupation says they want to occupying Palestine in general and uh during the last years trying to make palestin is unable and unhabitable for Palestinians uh and invol with spanking Gaza but considering Gaza is being West Bank and Gaza have similar but yet different conditions because both of them have water scarcity problems but look at Gaza it's much more 100 millions and during this war it's it's even uncomparable of the water scarcity water situation water limitation water pollution uh water restriction the fuel restriction all the aspects of life is being shut down because of the isation want basically the first thing the most important thing they want is just to stop life in Gaza Strip and in Palestine as well will be able We Believe and in that spirit in gazan people and Palestinian people over the days and over the the centuries we had the ability to live and rebuild and to resist and to to continue but the price is going to be so high I work in climate action and we started to plan for for the adaptation and mitigation and and our priority is adaptation because we are a country that are situated in the in the minor region which is under the negative impact of climate change when we started to make this adaptation and mitigation plans we looked at the Israeli occupation as the first hindering and the first challenge that exacerbates the Palestinians resistance against the climate action and looking at guess specifically climate action un unstable environment because of the nature environment and human-made disasters and the attacks and the genocide and the wor who attacks everything it's possible but on what cast all the plans have to be changed when planned for having a a mitigation scenario to for 2040 we had uh renewable energy to be operated in Gaza for for certain percent but now in what percent what what is the the plan that that need to be done because now we have to start from the zero we have nothing we were building nine or five years ago we were building on what was on the ground for the facilities of energy facilities of water facilities of Sanitation facilities but now looking at the on the ground what is left there what kind of facilities what kind of plans we should rep PL from the Zero from the scratch to start to build a city the whole city is under damaged with all the the components um early uh in in the before the war we started to work on early warning systems and having station with station and forecasting to uh to to to predict the the the and enable the agricultural sector people and all the people to know about the the W forecasting but now what infrastructure we are going to talk about early warning system while even the basic internet line or anything is missing there so the environment is in danger the climate action is being is hitting Palestine is hitting Gaza but but the price to be multipli after this war this attack hadan I'm sorry to interrupt you time is is is fast running out I just want to put one more question to Nada uh n we talked about or you talked about the the the the impact that Israel's bombing has had on air quality in Gaza the use of white phosphorus uh the dust from collapsed buildings some of which would have contained asbestos um what about unexploded ordinance though how much of a threat does that pose to Public Health and rebuilding efforts and and with so many buildings destroyed by Israel's bombing where does all the toxic rubble go when the K the time actually comes to rebuild um this is a very good question uh we don't know and uh when the time comes to rebuild uh we would like also to understand uh what are the conditions of the Reconstruction in Gaza and how they will be and also how much the Israeli government uh and the the political setup and the security setup for rebuilding uh will enable for the rebuilding uh um uh first of all uh with the lack of space uh in in Gaza uh already uh there was uh difficulty to deal with the solid waste and to deal with with domastic solid waste um and there were several plans even uh before to look into uh um basically waste to energy projects and how feasible they are uh because already there was a shortage in space because the Gaza is one of the most condensed and populated uh areas on Earth uh so finding uh space to deal with all this construction material and waste is uh is really questionable uh what I'm thinking is that there's been uh as as hadil mentioned uh we have we are a nation that is uh Keen to build and it's it's Keen to to find and to be Innovative to find Solutions there's been several startups in the past right uh to recycle uh basically the damage and construction material to utilize it to B again n we're out of time many thanks indeed to all of you NADA M Al B and hadil ikm uh and thank you for watching you can see the program again at any time by visiting our website at al.com for further discussion join
