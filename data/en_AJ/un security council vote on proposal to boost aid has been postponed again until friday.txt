Moen Rabani is the co-editor of the online magazine jeda and an Arab Israeli conflict analyst he joins us live now from Montreal thanks very much for being with us so let me ask you first of all about uh what's happening at the UN right now and this kind of passing of the language and and and wrangling over just what's going to be included in the in the text of this deal is it really going to make any difference in the end well I I think the dilemma here is that any resolution that could make a meaningful difference um in terms of the situation on the ground in the Gaza Strip is certain to be vetoed by the United States and any resolution that the United States feels it is able to support is going to be essentially meaningless um for the besieged population in the Gaza Strip I mean let's be clear it was only um the SW week that the United States voted against a general assembly resolution affirming the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination um in addition to what your correspondent was reporting there are additional reports that the US insisted on seeing references um to a demand for all parties not not just Israel all parties to respect International humanitarian law to have that removed from the draft resolution as well so in effect the the US is voting for the continuation of The Siege um for the continuation of the mass killings in the Gaza Strip and most importantly the idea of humanitarian assistance without a ceasefire is absolutely meaningless and illusory I mean who in their right mind believes that humanitarian assistance can be delivered throughout the Gaza Strip to all those in need um while the Gaza Strip is experiencing the most intensive bombing campaign in the entire history of the Middle East and when you see um all of the pictures that are coming out of Gaza and what we've been reporting there of uh the the the constant bombardment and the desperate humanitarian situation and that is jux opposed with what's happening in New York and you know we see well we don't see it because it's behind closed doors but people sitting around the tables uh arguing over this word and that word what do you make of all of that what do you make of that contrast well again um uh you have a situation in New York where um a superpower with veto uh powers in the Security Council is doing its absolute best to ensure that the situation on the ground in Gaza remains unchanged and if it changes it will only change for the worst and I think it's important to point out here that one reason um that the US would like to see references to international law removed from the draft resolution is because under international law and let's remember the Security Council is effectively the custodian of the of of international law to a large extent under international law there can be no conditionality to the provision of humanitarian Aid um to a civilian population and more importantly or as importantly under international law and occupying power has a positive obligation to provide humanitarian assistance to the population it occupies so as your question implied there is a complete disconnect between the discussions in New York and the reality in the Gaza Strip and and and as a final point I think it it's worth considering that one reason that the US is SE seeking to make this an absolutely meaningless word salad of a resolution is that perhaps they're trying to provoke the Russians or perhaps the Chinese into casting a vote against this resolution because it does nothing and then you know they can play the innocent Angel uh and blame others uh for the continuation of their policies good to get your perspective on this m Rabani thanks very much for being with us thank you you
