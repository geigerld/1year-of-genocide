the White House has described reports of mass graves in Gaza as deeply disturbing European union and the United Nations have joined international calls for an independent probe into the situation on Wednesday another 51 bodies were found in the grounds of a hospital in Han Yunis more than 300 have been discovered since Saturday hospitals have protection under international law that have come under heavy Israeli bombardment since Israel's war on Gaza began in October US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan says Washington wants answers those reports were deeply disturbing we have been in touch at multiple levels with the Israeli government we want answers we want to understand exactly what happened you've seen some public commentary from the IDF on that but we want to know the specifics of what the circumstances of this were and we want to see this thoroughly and transparently investigated so that the whole world can have a comprehensive answer and we the United States can as well I can't speak beyond that because of course we're in the early days of fully understanding what happened we are gravely concerned by the by the reported discovery of M graves in KH Yunis and in alifa hospital this is something that uh forces us to call for an independent investigation of all the suspicions and all the circumstances uh because indeed uh it uh it creates the the impression that there might have been violations of international human rights committee that's why it's important to have independent investigation and to ensure the accountability Let's cross now to Heidi Joe Castro who joins us from Washington DC Heidi some strong words there but what can we make of what was said Carrie yeah the condemnation and the concern expressed by the United States has been growing since word of these Mass Graves was first reported and today we just heard Jake Sullivan the US National Security advisor saying that the US wants answers now what we didn't hear from him though was a call for an independent investigation and that's what has deferred the US response to this thus far from that of the EU and that of the UN High Commissioner now we did hear from the US Deputy ambassador to to the UN who told Al jazer earlier in the day that the US was not ready to call for an independent investigation but rather would be talking to other countries referencing Israel there as well well as looking at photographs of these atrocities these potential atrocities uh and so there's still quite a gap between how the US has responded to this though the rhetoric is ramping up and that of other world leaders and Heidi will these words be matched with action though because these Graves have been known about for some time right the US is really leaning on Israel completing an investigation withholding judgment and those are the commonly the reactions we've heard from the White House whenever Israel is accused of a war crime here and so there's really no president to fall back on that the US has really said that a line has been crossed or that Israel would face any repercussions other than uh the the sanctions on the settlers who have been attacking Palestinians in the West Bank but when it comes to Gaza when it comes to Israel's war on Gaza really the actions have been the other way around with president Joe Biden just today signing into law yet another US military aid package to Israel how you Joe Castro for us in Washington DC thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
