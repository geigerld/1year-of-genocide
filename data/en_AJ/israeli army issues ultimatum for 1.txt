we're going to begin with the latest threat Israel has issued to the people of Gaza amid the destruction fear and bloodshed caused by the military's Relentless bombardment Israel has now warned 1.1 million Palestinians to move South for their own safety this is Northern Gaza home to the jabala refugee camp it's the largest in the strip and 116,000 people live there the shatti refugee camp is one of gaza's most crowded it's also in the north along with large number of un facilities and hospitals including gaza's largest the alifa hospital Israel wants all these people including un workers to move to the south of Wadi Gaza un Aid workers say the relocation of so many people is impossible it's not clear how they could make that journey through rubble and constant Israeli bombardment to the South un run schools in the South are already full of thousands of displaced Palestinians taking shelter Israel's threatened to further increase bombardment of the northern Gaza Strip but the armed group has responded by calling on Palestinians to stay in their homes Israeli air strikes have killed more than 1500 Palestinians since Saturday when Hamas launched its military operation Israel has dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since the war with Hamas began and more keep falling every hour more than 423,000 Palestinians that's nearly 20% of gaza's population have now been forced from their homes Johnny on the phone from K yunus in Gaza is our correspondent yumna El uh this is where the Israelis are suggesting that those 1.1 million people moved to from Gaza City you've made that Journey talk us through what that was like you yes Nick I've made that Journey on uh having to that Journey thinking about my kids and thinking about my family and what would happen to them if we did stay the journey was a devastating Journey we had to go through we had to wait for hours uh for other cars that were able to get toan units from Gaza to tell us what where the roots and the streets that they W they they drove into that were safe for us to drive into uh so that we can walk away from the rubble and the bombardment and and and we see so many people even on their foot uh uh with backpacks uh carrying backpacks with their children going going towards the South it's a very long way drive from G City towards the South but people are this desperate nick uh to to to run for their lives to do whatever they can to in order to at least try to save their kids from what is coming the unknown what uh Israel is saying that it will carry on the Gaza Strip after uh 2:00 pm. local time which is um um which is right now this is 2 pm local time it gave uh like 24 hours since 2: am in the morning until 2 p.m this afternoon for people to evacuate for 1.1 million people to evacuate from Gaza City and the north towards the South yna Israel is saying that people need to do this for their own safety but are you getting any indications that they would be any safer if they moved further south what is security like there well how is it for their safety when Israel knows for sure because it knows exactly every single Corner in the Gaza Strip that there is no space for these people the capacity the entire capacity of the government of kanun wouldn't take this people it's it's asking them to do something that is impossible Israel that it's impossible for this amount of population to add to the already population that is found in hanun and in ra to get to to to carry all this people and yet it is still asking them to do so H nevertheless it's also asking the hospitals and doors and the UN schools to evacuate those displaced how will these people get to to to the South there no cars uh working there's no Transportation people who managed to get to Kan unit they drove in their personal cards so it's it's basically asking people to do something that Israel for itself knows it's impossible and yet the bombardment is still going on in in in this in the south in governance kanun and Raa so basically we just we just feel now that we ran away from bombardment to another place of bombardment but we we're yet to experience what Israel is uh is planning to do in the upcoming hours to Gaza City to the northern Gaza yumna we saw just a about an hour or so ago we had pictures that were being fed to us of what appeared to be leaflets that were being dropped we think over Gaza City but we're not entirely sure about the the the location do you have any more information about that do you have any idea what if these were leaflets what they were saying yes these leaflets are always uh dropped by the Israeli military uh every time they want to EV uate a certain uh a certain place so these let's say for the people of the north Gaza and Northern Gaza and Gaza City to evacuate to uh the southern uh part of Gaza Strip which is after W Gaza which starts from uh hanun and Rafa so it's basically telling the population for sure to evacuate while the population is left desperately asking how do we evacuate and where do we evacuate yumna thank you very much indeed that's yumna say talking to us from conun in southern Gaza
