we begin with this Grim milestone in Gaza the death told from Israel's month-long War has now pass 25,000 and the number of dead and injured is Rising by the hour Palestinians have been transporting the injured to hospital on pickup trucks for lack of ambulances gaza's Health Ministry says at least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the last 2 24 hours in the South Palestinian Fighters have been confronting the Israeli military near NASA Hospital in Han Yunis Israeli attacks there have killed at least 14 Palestinians since Saturday also the UN Secretary General has criticized Israel's prime minister for his rejection of a Palestinian State he was speaking at a meeting of the g77 group of nations in the capital of Uganda Cala the repeated refusal yesterday to accept the two-state solutions for Israeli and Palestinians is totally unacceptable as I told the summit of the non-allied movement the denial of the right to statewood for the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to Global Peace and security exacerbate polarization and then balen extremists everywhere aljaz dorsa Jabari is at that Summit in Cala dorsa you are with Mr gueris the United Nations Secretary General yes uh I am now joined here live by the Secretary General thank you for speaking to aler I want to start with these two Summits that are that have been going on here in Uganda what has been your reaction to the response that these nations have given to the ongoing war in Gaza and the strong words that have come from these countries in response to the Israeli bombardments of Gaza I think that these Summits represent the strong commotion of the global South in relation to the L to the levels of death and destruction we are witnessing in gas I have condemned the attacks the terror attacks of amas uh but I have to say that uh the level of Civilian casualties that we are witnessing in Gaza today is unprecedented in relation to any other conflict since I am Secretary General and so what the Hamas did cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people what is the solution if your calls for dialogue with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are not being heard what is the next step to move forward to try and bring an end to this conflict I think that there are two aspects one we have been asking for an immediate humanitarian SE fire to alleviate the dramatic suffering of the people in Gaza to allow for Arian distribution to facilitate the release of the hostages that should be unconditional and immediate but uh that is not the solution solution in my opinion is the acceptance by everybody of the right of the Palestinian people to State and the acceptance of a two-state solution and of course um I consider regrettable the fact that the Palestinian prime minister has refused that possibility this is unacceptable uh without a two-state solution without these we will have a conflict that never ends it will boost extremism all over the world it will polarize situations all over the world and it is something that in my opinion is totally unacceptable how do you think African countries can help with this conflict how effective uh could they be in trying and putting pressure on Regional power in the middle EAS I think the voice of Africa is is important but obviously uh only the parties uh can solve the problem the voice of Africa the voice of all those that claim for the need of humanitarian fire that claim for the two-state solution are very important but it's essential that that becomes a reality uh what role do you think the UN can play other than a diplomatic one uh to try and bring an end to this conflict and the other uh actors involved now because it's clearly spreading from uh Yemen to Lebanon to Syria uh what are your concerns and what are you prepared to do to try and prevent it from spreading no we are very active uh diplomatically uh particularly worried with the possibility of an explosion in the West Bank particularly worried uh with the uh the risk risk of escalation of the conflict in the border between Lebanon and Israel um we do not want to see another Gaza in Lebanon it is clear uh so deescalation is essential uh and at the same time we need to guarantee Freedom na navigation in the Red Sea and need to avoid uh what we are seeing multiplying incidents in Syria in Iraq so it is clear that this conflict is spreading and that this is very dangerous and the price will be paid by all of us how are do you think the United States can help because they're a very big part of this and the houthis have now said that their fair game in their Red Sea because of their uh support of Israel how do you think the United States can be persuaded at least the Biden Administration to step back a little bit from their full-light support of Israel I think it's very important I have I recognize that United United States have been very active in pushing for more effective humanitarian Aid and uh stressing the need of a two-state solution and I think it's time uh uh for uh Israel to listen uh to the United States and to make these two objectives that the American Administration has been stressing to make them a reality you and Secretary General Antonio gues thank you so much for speaking to us on Al jazer um as we get underway with the g77 summit here in kalala there is a sense that the Palestinian conflict is at the Forefront uh as well as other uh economic issues here uh but the UN Secretary General making it very clear that until there is peace in the Middle East the entire world is not safe yeah that's dorsa Jabari reporting there from uh Cala in Uganda thank you very much for bringing us that interview dorsa
