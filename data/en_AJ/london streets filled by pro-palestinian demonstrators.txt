well there have been Pro Palestinian solidarity protests right across the world rallies right now are being held in London uh let's cross to there and speak to Rory chalins who's at those protests and and Rory judge by what I can see there lots of Palestinian Flags behind you a lot of people too absolutely yeah I know it's been a river of people passing by me for many many minutes now uh a huge huge Gathering uh they were expecting perhaps 10 to 20,000 people in central London for this demonstration well I'm no expert judge of crowds but I would say that perhaps they've got that many uh there certainly uh many many thousands at least I'll step by and you can see the sort of the flavor of things at the moment uh it's been organized by uh various Palestinian solidarity groups leftwing organizations there are Jewish organizations here as well I've been speaking to to some of those uh what are they after well you you can see by some of the the signs here that they want an end to the bombing they want an end to what they call uh Israeli aparti they want a free Palestine they want Justice uh and they're showing their solidarity as you said Nick there are many other similar protests taking place uh across the UK and also across Europe and other parts of the world as well many many thousands of people coming out to show their support for the Palestinian course today Roy the past week's events have raised all manner of tensions right across the world it would seem uh especially in the UK okay yes yeah and there are I think fears of tensions in the UK as well the the police are out in force today to try and make sure that there's no unrest of any type really so braan the UK Home Secretary uh I think in a bid to try and reassure the Jewish population in the UK uh that there shouldn't be any support for Hamas visible at least uh in or demonstrations like this has asked the police to try and make a call on whether things like even the waving of the Palestinian flag might constitute a racially aggravated offense well the police seem to have made that call I think they've said as much and you can see behind me there are numerous Palestinian Flags the police aren't making any arrests for that sort of thing at the moment uh Rory we're just talking to the former International Secretary of State for International Development uh CLA Shaw and she was just talking about the UK government other governments around the world just following the US lead being very strident in supporting the Israelis without giving any context to the situation as if the whole events just started last Saturday that is the picture that you could describe as far as UK government is concerned well the UK government is a sta Ally of Israel has been for for many many years and that is not changing um but of course it is trying trying to uh you know sort of take take as balanced a view as it sees fit within its own position on geopolitics and with it within its own position towards the population of this country clearly there are large uh Muslim parts of the UK population clearly there are Jewish parts of of the UK population as well but I think for many people here they think that the British government is well and truly on the wrong side that they are giving far too much support for Israel uh they should be much much more critical of Israeli uh Israeli policy in Gaza in the West Bank are layers bro UK are layers thank you very much UK are layers as you can see that's I think expressing my that's expressing my point there that many people who the British government is taking the wrong side uh in the struggle of the Palestinians and the Israeli States all right Rory thanks to that emotions uh very high about this whole thanks very much
