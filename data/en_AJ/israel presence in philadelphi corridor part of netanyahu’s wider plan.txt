joined Now by Hassan barari professor of international uh Affairs at Qatar University thanks very much for being with us here than for having me just I just want to get your reaction first of all to Anthony blinken's statement that 90% of this deal has already been agreed what do you make of the last 10% that it's obviously very difficult we heard a little bit there about the Philadelphia Corridor as one of the main issues how difficult is it going to be to get the the last 10% done well thas as they say same all same all I mean I've been uh listening to Blink for like couple of months talking about Bridging the Gap and a few differences here and there that he could Aron out but you know we ended up with netanyahu's firm position in in two press conferences when he made it perfectly clear that Israel would never withdraw from this Corridor and he even call it the gateway to Iran I mean he is trying to give it a meaning or a security uh kind of protects in order to uh justify a presence of the Israeli military there h n I think has a a broader game a bigger game even a deeper one than what Lincoln is thinking of uh so I think it's not about now the detail the 90% that he's talking about it's about the fact that the Palestinians are being under occupation and Israel should withdraw now here the bottom line for the Palestinian is the Philadelphia Corridor and netan is just telling them don't even dream of that and this is you know this is where it counts do you think it's fair to say uh that for nyaho to accept any uh deal that would essentially mean the collapse of his coalition government and therefore that could be the end of his political career you know this is the U the conventional wisdom in in Israel and all you know all around the world that you know if Netanyahu uh agrees to a deal then rightwing uh like SM B would walk out of his government and then it's going to fall apart and we had the Precedence of that when Netanyahu signed the wover memorandum in 1998 and then he lost the L power so this is one thing but this is something else you know he has an option he has some alternative he can even uh fire them and bring the Leed anded was telling him clearly that he would agree for ceasefire and give the government what they call the safety network uh and and and and this is very important for him but also there's something more important I think the when while Nan has an option alternative the rightwing members don't have one because if they leave they're going to lose and polls are showing that they're not even going to make it next election so I think netan can can play it smartly but netan is manipulating the situation to prolong the war to perpetuate it and perpetuate the misery of the Palestinians hoping that he would get off the hawk when it comes to the judicial uh aspect of of his political Survivor a lot has been made about the pressure that Netanyahu is under both domestically and internationally but at this point in time it doesn't really seem like it's anywhere near enough to actually Force his hand and and cut a ceasefire deal does it what do you think that is well there's one thing here that you know for a ceasefire to materialize I think we need to see more American pressure and and just recently uh I I hear some leakage from American officials saying that you know if if Netanyahu H won't accept their um Virgin of a deal they will come up with a unilateral one with Hamas because there are some Four soldiers or four sorry four Americans captive and in in Gaza and they want to uh exchange them have like a swap with some Palestinian prisoners in in the United States uh so Biden is committed to his own people as well but here we see that netan is even jeopardizing American life for his own political game I think this implicit Threat by the American Administration if it followed up by action I think this would probably change the calculus of Netanyahu okay we'll have to leave it there but thank you so much for for your insight into all of this fascinating as always H barari there thank you
