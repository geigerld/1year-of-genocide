the US president has signed into law an executive order that will shut off Asylum requests and deny entry to migrants on its Southern border with Mexico once a daily threshold of 2500 illegal Crossings is met and he spoke after signing the order just a few minutes ago my fir very first day as president I introduced a comprehensive immigration reform plan to fix to fix our broken system secure our border provide a pathway for Citizens for dreamers and a lot more and I'm still fighting to get that done but we must face the simple truth to protect America as a land that welcomes immigrants we must first secure the border and secure it now and joining us live now from Washington DC is White House National Security Communications adviser John Kirby welcome to Al jazer John Kirby uh I'm going to ask you about the US president's Crackdown on the southern Border in just a second but I want to start off with Gaza uh the last couple of days the American Administration the Biden Administration has said a deal was presented by Israel but the Israeli government seems like it doesn't accept everything in its own proposal and now we've just heard Hamas say it's on the Israelis to say whether they accept their own terms and and two top American envoys we understand are headed back to the region are the two sides really moving closer to each other or is this just a lot of effort so the administration can be seen to be doing something I can't speak for what uh either the Israelis are saying publicly or Hamas is saying publicly what I can tell you uh for certain is that the proposal that the president laid out on Friday is an accurate description of The Proposal itself it is an Israeli proposal arrived at after uh intense diplomatic conversations with us here in the United States of course and our team uh but it was an Israeli proposal and the very next day uh the Israeli foreign minister acknowledged that publicly that it was their proposal uh and uh and it and it was as they described sir I'm very sorry to interrupt you there I have to push back a little bit about that because of course prime minister Benjamin nahu has said it's not a complete reflection of what they have agreed to it's not accurate so you know there's been push back from from the Israelis basically so who's telling the truth let me let me just interrupt let just interrupt you let me just interrupt you and say that I'm comfortable that this is in fact an accurate depiction of The Proposal the Israeli proposal the president laid it out in Stark detail uh he didn't lay out every single detail but all the big components of it and he did so accurately and it is an Israeli proposal and now it's up to Hamas to accept this proposal so that we can get the hostages out and so that the innocent people of Gaza who have no part in this War uh can get the food water medicine shelter that they deserve but the Israeli government is rejecting ing its own proposal The Proposal that's been laid out by President Biden I I I don't I've never seen anything that says they're rejecting it I've seen some public comments by some officials uh that uh that are disputing some components of it but I've not seen some rejection of it it is an Israeli proposal they've acknowledged that now it's been widely reported that one reason so little food currently at this moment is entering the Gaza Strip is because Israel of course as you know occupies the Rafa Crossing which has led egy the Egyptian side to stop Aid convoys because you know the occupation basically contradicts the agreements the peace paact between Israel and Egypt is this something that the administration is trying to change of course as a matter of fact the president talked to president uh CCE last week um and president CeCe as a result of that conversation agreed to open up uh Rafa Crossing on the Egyptian ins side and now we have emissaries uh in Cairo this week and next uh who will be hashing out the details of that uh with our Egyptian counterparts right but will you be pushing the Israeli uh government to uh remove its forces from the Philadelphia Corridor the Israelis are operating they say and I won't speak for their operations but they say they're operating in the Philadelphia cordor uh to put pressure on Hamas inside Rafa this is in keeping with uh the description of operations as they laid them out for us uh they have also agreed back to your real question about Rafa and the crossing they certainly have agreed uh to uh permit uh food water medicine humanitarian assistance to flow across uh the Rafa Crossing but right now it's closed on the Egyptian side and that's what we're working with our Egyptian counterparts on right but the occupation obviously contradicts the the agreement that Israel has with the Egypt and the Egyptians are very unhappy with that uh let's turn our attention now um to you know there is been an in intensification of Israeli attacks across Gaza uh we've seen nearly 40 people killed today alone including some who were in a school that was being used as an emergency shelter now this sort of thing is is almost ordinary it happens every day even President Biden says that people have quote every reason to conclude that Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging this war for political reasons if that is true shouldn't the US the Biden Administration press press harder for Israel to agree to its own ceasefire deal as I said the president laid this out publicly on Friday um and it was right after it was delivered to Hamas um and it was a very clear articulation an Israeli articulation of how this war can come to an end I can't speak or Justify what Israeli officials are saying publicly what I can tell you is in our conversations with the Israelis they acknowledge this is their proposal they want to see Hamas accept it and they want to move forward uh they want to get their hostages home where they belong um and uh they also want to see uh that we can move forward to a sustainable end to this to the hostilities right but it seems like they only agree to the first phase and they don't want to move to the other phases but um let's focus now on some developments but wait but now wait wait just second wait wait just a second because you you you raised a really good point that I want to just ring out with you it is a phased approach um and phase one has got to start so that they can start to negotiate what phase two looks like it's not that the Israelis haven't said they're committed to phase two they're committed to a phased approach but what the deal says is if you can get phase one implemented then the two sides can start to talk about what phase two looks like and when it can start and and while they are negotiating phase two that ceasefire will stay in effect on the six weeks but here's the problem John Kirby Hamas doesn't trust that Israel will follow through Hamas doesn't think that uh they want a durable right so what the President also said is that uh that the United States will guarantee that we will work to ensure Israel meets its commitments and the deal also says that Egypt and qter will work to ensure that Hamas meets its commitments as well all that's baked into the proposal right now um we understand that uh prime minister Benjamin nahu was scheduled to come to the US and to address uh Congress uh that seems to be a little bit up in the air what more can you tell us about that I honestly can't tell you anything about that that's going to be a question for uh uh members of Congress up on Capitol Hill that this is uh this is their invitation um I I don't know what the status is of uh of the acceptance of it and the date and all that that's really a question for members of Congress right is it a good idea well that's going to be up for prime minister nanyo to determent if he wants to come and and what he wants to say and for members of Congress to speak to they obviously believed and it was a bipartisan invitation uh they believed that it was uh appropriate to to hear out uh the Prime Minister and again that that's really going to be for those two sides to work out gotcha all right so um as promised want to ask you uh uh about immigration uh the president just moments ago signing executive order to curtail Asylum requests and uh curb migration why why is this so important and and you know what do you make of critics saying you know he's basically rehashing a trump policy as the president said in his remarks on day one of the administration he put forward a comprehensive immigration reform plan uh that Congress did zero on for the entire time he's been president in the meantime there has been record levels of migration here in this hemisphere alone and it's not just in this hemisphere it's all around the world but certainly in this hemisphere alone we've seen more people on the Move since World War II and we are working very hard with our partners in the region including and principally with Mexico to do what we can to help stem the reasons for that migration to try to get at the root causes for that and yet people are still coming even though they're in less fewer fewer numbers right now uh and so the president explored opportunities that he could take as president using executive Authority uh to to try to help alleviate some of that pressure but what really needs to happen if you really want to solve the problem it's going to have to require legislation because it has to come with resources and it has to come with legal authorities and that is what Congress will not move on but it's pretty Draconian and a very significant shift thank you so very much um John Kirby you're talking to us from Washington thank you you're
