now hamas's political leader isma Han has made a televised speech in which he said the group had offered the Israeli government a way out of the war he also called on the International Community to stop supporting Israel in its war on Gaza the movement has provided a comprehensive perspective starting by ending the aggression opening the border the prisoner swap deal and ending with the Revival of the political and diplomatic movement towards the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital with a right of self-determination however Netanyahu and his gang are misleading his own people and providing false promises which cannot and will not be achieved we remind the countries and states supporting the Zionist regime legitimizing the pogrom perpetrated by them against our people chiefly the United States of America we remind them that they must back down on these obsolete imperialistic policies and refrain from providing military aid to this fascist regime we call on them to stop preventing the international will aiming at ending the hostilities and opening the border crossing this is what we witnessed in the UN General Assembly to them we say you are standing on the wrong side of history and the present the region and Beyond cannot enjoy peace and stability as long as our established rights of the Palestinians are not restored the rights of Freedom Independence and the return of refugees well let's disc discuss this and all the latest developments now with Abdul Hamid Sam who's a professor of political science and Middle East studies at waters's University he is here in Doha in the studio with us thank you very much for joining us once again uh let's start with what um uh isma Han hamas's political leaders said they're calling on the International Community to condemn Israel that seems to be falling on deaf years because in just 24 hours Israel has bombed the same refugee camp killing hundreds of people why is there no no stronger condemnation of isra when it this is unprecedented in fact to see a country obliterating Civ civil civilians day in and day out killing thousands of Palestinian civilians children uh human right activist uh rescue operation people un staff and yet they did not condemn this is unbelievable however I think the Western countries led by the United States they see Israel as their proxy uh military base in the Middle East they they have to keep it safe because it's an it's a longterm investment for 70 years they've been supporting Israel they think if this base is shaken or weakened then the Western Hony led by the US will be falling down after what happened in Ukraine so they will be most likely not dictate their terms in Ukraine and this will happen again so they are supporting blindly there's certainly been a double standard when it comes to the treatment of Ukraine and and what's happening in Gaza we've seen it we've heard it from uh European leaders like Ura vand and from the US as well but right now what is also happening in these big capitals around the world is that there seems to be a shift in public opinion we're seeing more pro Israel more Pro Palestine protest in support of people in Gaza in support of Palestinians is that not going to resonate with the leadership in these Western uh government the long term it well I mean normally you know they take note of it I mean I saw the anti-war movement during the Iraq war with millions of people in the street but it it takes time I mean because the two the two uh uh main powerful uh uh engines are working against the Palestine the governments and the media the media is also de dehumanizing the Palestinians and you don't find really good uh balance uh coverage of the war in the western media so that is another problem the Palestinian are facing right and the dou standard as you just said is so obvious when it comes to Ukraine and Palestine this is an occupation so the occupier has the right to fight for to keep the occupation yet the occupied has no right to defend themselves and no right to Def to fight occupation this is unprecedented I mean all countries in the world whove been subject to foreign domination and occupation they were glorified when they fight their occupier except the Palestinian they call them terrorist this is unprecedented ABD Hamid I wanted to ask you about this latest move by Jordan a significant one as we heard from our correspondent uh Jordan recalling its ambassador from Israel um how is this going to make a difference you think if any on the ground in Gaza in the occupied West Bank and what about those Arab countri countries which normalize relations with Israel the UAE uh for example will they follow suit I hope so I hope this is the first step I think Arab countries were embarrassed by them by what happened in Latin America and those countries like Colombia and Chile and Bolivia and Bolivia Bolivia even cut off its relation all together they were embarrassed and this Movement by Jord is very important I mean I still believe it came too late it should have been after bombarding the hospital the Baptist hospital for example or early on because Jordan and Palestine are almost one unit one people so they are mostly affected by this war and if anything happens in Gaza the Israeli will turn their guns toward the west bank and it could lead to massive expulsion of Palestinian into Jordan so Jordan is the most important um part of this equation in uh rejecting this Israeli scheme I hope it will be followed by other countries like Egypt for example why Egypt doesn't call the ambassad why Morocco doesn't close the office there the representative office why I I don't believe that United Arab Emirates would do anything of course but it also will encourage other countries maybe in Asia in more Latin American but that is an very important and significant Step at the right time yeah so the could come from there thank you very much ABD Hamid for talking to us of course we will be speaking to you throughout the evening here on Al jazer
