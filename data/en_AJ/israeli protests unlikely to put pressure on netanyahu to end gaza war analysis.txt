let's bring in Ari Goldberg he's an Israeli political commentator and he's joining us live from Tel Aviv welcome to the aler NewsHour Mr Goldberg there are more protests planned in Tel Aviv this evening calling for the release of Israeli captives in Gaza calling for a deal between the Israeli government and Hamas in order to secure that release we have seen some of the biggest protests in Israel's history recently can you help us understand as we look ahead to those protests why nanyu isn't SU able to this public pressure because this public pressure is still perceived as partisan as motivated by domestic Israeli political considerations and Nel feels quite comfortable uh being perceived as the leader of the anti-protest side even if he is attacked and criticized by hundreds of thousands of Israelis retaking to the street uh the General broad Israeli consensus which says that the war in excuse me the war in Gaza the go stated goal of the destruction of Hamas that these are still legitimate n Builds on a broad support from all Israelis for that which is why he as of as of now Remains unfaced by these demonstrations which really are probably the largest Israel has ever seen so Mr goldber would it be fair to say that even if there are hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets calling for the release of captives as long as the broader Israeli public supports the war you cannot have both you cannot have the release of captives as long as the war goes on uh not only fair to say that that that is you know the truth uh I think a lot of Israelis understand that uh I think the size of the demonstrations and the extent of the anger has to do with this unresolved paradox because for long months the Israeli public lived with the understanding this is what it was told by its government that the two stated goals of the quote unquote war in Gaza that is the return of the hostages and the destruction of Hamas are both commensurate and complimentary I think the recent death of the six hostages uh in a tunnel in RAF just minutes before idea forces reached them made it clear to many Israelis that these goals are contradictory that as long because the war goes on the hostages will not be returned the demonstrations are a way for Israelis to articulate a desire for the war to end but it's very important to say again and again and again that a clear uh uh request a clear demand from the broad public who's demonstrating that the that the war must end is uh something we have yet to hear uh in fact uh a prominent group of demonstrators called the high-tech protest that is funded by uh senior high-tech leaders in Israel just came up with a new slogan last week the slogan is we'll bring them back and go back that is we'll bring the hostages back and go back to fight that is the situation as far as Israeli public opinion goes okay uh Mr Goldberg today our lead story on Al jazer has been the death the funeral of the American Turkish activists and we've heard from we've seen the international criticism and condemnation of her killing we've heard from the most senior American officials saying that there needs to be changes that the Israeli Security Forces need to change how they operate do you think that this killing will lead to any changes unfortunately I don't I think the only thing that will lead to changes will be very intense pressure from Israel's allies particularly in Washington I don't believe Israel has it within it the political capacity and even the political will to change the way military forces act I'll I'll add that actions in the West Bank are uh if if the war in Gaza is somehow contested military actions in the West Bank are seen as a necessary part of Israel's uh war on terror uh and there's a very very broad overt consensus that supports them so I fail to see uh any anybody in Israel at the moment who's capable or even Desiring of such Mr Goldberg it's always great to get your thoughts um on Israel that is Ari Goldberg joining us live from Tel Aviv thank you for having me make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
