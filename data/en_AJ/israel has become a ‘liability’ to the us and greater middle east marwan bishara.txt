bring in our senior political analyst now Maan bashara and M we've got the UN today remembering the terrible loss of life in Gaza 1001 of their employees even as it remains polarized and paralyzed at the top of the organization and it can't stop any of these deaths no as Secretary General gutterz said they don't have the power and don't have the money but the only thing they do have is the voice and they are now more more than before voicing U their uh displeasure if not their condemnation of what is going on and clearly the this manifestation as it were of the flag is a scream it's more than a voice it's it's really a scream of help as well as uh as a you know a condemnation of the killing of the uh of their own staff you know but but the question that that keeps coming to mind uh the last five weeks is why is it that that this little naughty State Israel can be in such grave violation of un resolutions un Security Solutions can be in grave uh violation of international law can uh attack the UN Secretary General personally for making a speech saying none of this could happen in a vacuum as if the the response is this could happen in a vacuum you know so and then the killing of the UN staff and so on so forth and and then making all these aggressive um apprehensive attacks on the UN and the and it and its staff it begs the question in the end shouldn't be censured shouldn't be frozen or something shouldn't the UN take certain measures about a country that is an affront not only to its Soul and Spirit but it's also an enemy of its own staff I wonder well an extension of that is why does the US support it wholeheartedly of course the US has uh the politics and the policy and the strategy the politics of course now it's a it's a it's a scandal around the world how lobbies in Washington tend to influence politics and especially foreign policy and the Israel Lobby which should be distinguished from a Jewish Lobby the Israel Lobby in Washington which is a combination of Evangelical Christians the military industrial complex as well as various radical Zionist organizations in America all of them really have huge influence on decision making especially in Congress but also on the White House and then there is the idea that uh you know Biden and others have sold to the American public that Israel is some kind of an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean that without Israel if it didn't exist we would have created Israel because it serves our interest interest you know this might have been correct sometime between 1970 and 1984 maybe you know arguably but certainly the past 30 or 40 years Israel has been a burden not an asset to the United States which just the last five weeks you know what have shown us that how much of a liability it has become the entire mid greater mid least 57 Arab and Muslim majority countries are standing against Israel and asking the United states to stop being so hypocritical and to use double standard in his foreign policy and the majority of public opinion including in the United States and in the asking for a ceasefire so really the the Biden Administration knows that Israel is a liability but continues to support it because President Biden himself is has been blinded by his so-called I'm a Zionist although I'm a Christian and boxing himself behind Netanyahu and just a quick notice note about that by the way way he was a vice president for8 years under Barack Obama and Barack Obama spent his eight years trying to decouple the mindset between the mind the United States and Israel because the United States is a superpower it's not supposed to act like a little Rog State and Biden was part and parcel of those eight years uh of Barack uh Biden Administration but now Biden is back again coupling the mindsets and repeating and supporting everything that Israel says which is really is quite paradoxical and quite damaging to America standing in the Middle East and Beyond
