further north in Gaza there's been a major attack in Gaza City Witnesses capture the moment of impact of an Israeli air strike in a residential area the health Ministry says at least 48 people have been killed across Gaza in the past day and that takes the total number of Palestinians killed to more than 34,000 including 145,000 children T abum is joining us now from RA in the south of the Gaza Strip um tell us about the latest air strikes across the Gaza Strip in the past few hours and their aftermath yes the latest Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip have been directed towards the N part where the Israeli artillery alongside with the figh Jets have been bounding the eastern part of jabalia refugee camp as they are attacking agricultural lands in these areas alongside that the military has has been attacking theah neighborhood alongside with the sh area that had been widely hit with artillery Shields where a number of residential houses being completely destroyed in that particular part of Gaza but the reality is that more attacks also have been carried out in the middle areas in the past couple of hours where seven Palestinians have been reported killed in anarat a refugee camp all of the victims are from the same family Amed in the far south of the territory here in Rafa within the past 24 hours is at least 19 Palestinians have been reported killed including 14 children but we have been also hearing from Israeli media reports alongside with the military spokesperson of the army that the Israeli military chief of staff had passed plans uh for further military operations in the southern territories alongside that their military troops on the ground have been operating in order to prepare the field for more potential operations that could be carried out within the coming weeks and that's really matches what the Israeli military has been doing in the past couple of days in arfa has they have been intensifying the military attacks on residential areas alongside that they have been also giving orders for a number of uh residents to flee from certain parts of the anarat refugee camp as a part of their ongoing operations on the ground but clearly we have been seeing International humanitarian organizations have been sitting up makeshift T tents in the city of Kan in a large in large numbers could be a sign also for evacuating Palestinians from the far south here in Rafa but yet the Israeli military has been not taking that step practically on the ground but more signs looming on the horizon regarding this a step which will definitely will bring a catastrophic and unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe across the territory okay T thank you we'll check in with you a little later thank you for that reporting from RA in Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
