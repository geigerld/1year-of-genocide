while President Biden's National Security adviser is expected to travel to Israel on Thursday Jake Sullivan has been in Saudi Arabia ahead of that visit though it doesn't have to be that you go from that to literally nothing in terms of putting pressure on going after Hamas targets Hamas leadership or continuing to have tools in your uh toolbox to try to secure the release of hostages it just means that you'd move to a different phase from the kind of high-intensity operation that we see today well let's discuss this with Ramy Hy he's a distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut he joins us now from Boston Ramy as we've been reporting Jake Sullivan is set to meet with Netanyahu I stand on Thursday after what we've heard over the last couple of days from Biden what tone do you think those discussions might take this time well the United States and Israel have been able to remarkably put themselves in a corner almost by by themselves um as evil people in the eyes of most of the world if you look at the polling evidence the demonstrations the vote at the UN any measure that you take almost the entire world with the exception of one or two uh smaller countries and the United States uh are um are critical of what Israel is doing heavily critical um and uh this is something that is U very troubling for for the United States because it has political implications it has diplomatic implications economic uh implications and the United States is not very good at diplomacy it's very good at killing it's very good at creating arms that kill a lot of people and selling them uh and letting its allies kill as much as they want but it's not very good at diplomacy and sorting out these kind of issues and there's massive evidence now uh that people ordinary people around the Middle East are extremely uh disappointed with the us only about 1% uh of people who were pulled in uh in Palestine for instance last week um suggested that they were satisfied with the US where something like 80 uh 90% were were critical of the US and you've got governments around the Arab region who are looking to balance their previously very strong relations with the us to have more balanced relations with other powers Regional powers and intern powers like Iraq like Iran turkey China Russia Etc let me jump in there because I'm curious about what you just mentioned you're talking about and describing this increasing isolation for the US now Sullivan began this visit to the region with the Saudi Crown Prince Right how are relations between the US and Arab nations in the region these days well they're changing uh the most of the the problem in the Arab world for the US is that the governments rely heavy on the US most of them not all of them rely on it for money uh guns diplomatic support political support just for the very survival the regimes the governments the populations of the Middle East of of the whole Middle East including turkey and Iran and the Arab countries uh are extremely critical of the United States and have been for for many years heavily because of its policy on palestin and also because of its policy of supporting dictators around uh the region and its own Direct military uh intervention and and the United States doesn't quite know how to deal with this and you've got new things now for instance the Yemen situation with the houis attacking ships in the Red Sea this is extraordinary um and they might you know slow down or stop shipping um and this is a vital artery for global Shipping it will hurt economic interest of everybody uh and you've got the uh the problem of U the post most fighting situation in the region nobody knows what's going to happen there's a zillion speculation especially here in the United States uh there's whole industry of talking about what's going to happen after the fighting stops but it's all speculation um and the United States and Israel have been able to dominate the uh diplomatic field now with their military Pro um and completely befuddle the whole world in terms of what can happen diplomatically and everything that the US Israel says they want to do is very much opposed by Palestinians uh yes we've been hearing that Ramy before I I let you go I do want to ask you about what we've been hearing from Biden recently he's been talking again about saudi's normalization with Israel and I'm been wondering because this is the beginning of Sullivan's trip is this potentially some strategy an attempt at some kind of carot and stick policy with Netanyahu well they will definitely the US will definitely keep pushing for normalization U and the Abraham Accords uh but these are pretty meaningless when you get a massive popular uh opposition and resentment to the US because of and Israel because of these uh uh these polls and you're getting evidence from uh around the region that people are getting more militant uh and they're supporting Hamas more nobody wants Warfare but nobody wants subjugation occupation colonization settlement uh as they've been getting from the US and from Israel for decades and DEC so there's a really big danger for the US now uh in political and economic and and and and Military fields and the Israel not achieve their military objectives um and the Hamas is holding out so they're really going out to try to put out some fires and try to regain control of some kind of diplomatic process which they hope they can manage and it has to include a serious move to a Palestinian State and ending the Israeli occupation if those things don't start happening there will just be continuation of what we've had for the last 40 years and we've seen that we've seen has been born Hamas has been Bor now you've got the htis with their power and you just get more and more of these militant uh radical Arab groups that are extremely proficient at pushing back against settler Colonial policies Imperial policies Israel and the us we'll continue watching that visit very closely of Jake Sullivan to the region certainly Ramy Hy a distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of bay thank you for joining us again on Al jaer Ramy you better
