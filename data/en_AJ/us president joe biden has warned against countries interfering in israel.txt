what US President Joe Biden has vowed to support Israel and has warned against countries interfering let me say this is clearly as I can this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek Advantage the world is watching I've also been in contact with the King of Jordan spoken with members of Congress directing my National Security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts military to Military and to intelligence di Diplomat to Diplomat to make sure Israel has what it needs Dosa Jabari joins us live now from Teran capital of Iran and D Joe Biden they're warning other parties not to get involved how has that gone down in Iran and indeed how have events generally gone down well there's been a a sense of victory for Iranian officials as a result of what took place on Saturday we we have just heard from the chief of staff of the Armed Forces Muhammad bagari he's the second in command in Iran after the supreme leader of the country's entire uh military infrastructure he issued a statement congratulating the Palestinian Fighters and he also said that he hope soon they will be able to take control of Alexa mosque as well H he said that this is a Monumental occasion and it shows that really Israel is not um as strong as many believe it to be he also went on to say that the will of the oppressed people will be victorious this is a sentiment that we've heard over the past 24 hours from a number of officials in Iran as a result of the events that transpired uh in Palestine and Israel now uh we also saw a number of tweets that went out on the Supreme Leader social media accounts um one of them was a minute and a one minute video that they put together of the events and the scenes that that unfolded uh in um Gaza and Southern Israel in which the supreme leader is heard narrating the footage and saying that really U congratulating and commemorating this historic event in terms of a Victorious one for the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Fighters and he said that he went on to encourage them to continue their fight against their oppressor that is the Zionist regime as he refers to Israel um the sense here is that this is certainly going to be an important Mo um event for not only the Palestinian uh fractions but also for Iran and their support of those uh movements within Palestine uh for the Iranian system and the establishment since 1979 Israel has been certainly Public Enemy Number One at every unveiling of a new uh rocket or missile and the officials here make a point of uh highlighting how long it would take for that missile to reach Tel Aviv uh so I think this certainly uh going to be seen as an important event the Iranians have been very careful though not to get involved specifically in terms of logistics or financial support officially anyways for the time being we'll have to wait and see what happens on the ground and how the officials here will react as a result of that and of course hezb as we've been discussing it launched those mortar rounds on the Sheba Farms everyone very well aware of the fragility of the situation certainly and I think uh over the past few years uh we've seen the strong support Iran has had for Hezbollah they're considered to be brothers as we've seen footage rare footage after the assassination of Kim solmani during the war with Israel between hezb and Israel we saw kasim solmani recounting how he um helped assist the Hezbollah commanders during those days um and this was a documentary that aired after he was assassinated so it gives you an idea of how close Iran's military establishment is and of course the Revolutionary guard and the GS Force to Hezbollah and of course whenever uh as rare as it may be whenever Hassan Nella the leader of Hezbollah visits uh Iran he makes sure to see the supreme leader all these signs telling how close the two are to one another I think it's going to be very very um important to see what happens in uh Lebanon between um the that area that is now um seeing some activities between Hezbollah Fighters and Israel uh Iranians certainly will be monitoring that very closely it will also have ramifications for Iran there people the general public is certainly concerned about the events that have unfolded as and in terms of what it would mean for their own safety down the line Israel has over and over again said is one of their main uh security concerns and threats uh to the uh establishment in Israel to the whole country uh so I think what happens in the coming hours and days will certainly be very important for all sides and daa thank you for that da Jabari and Teran back with you later daughter thank you
