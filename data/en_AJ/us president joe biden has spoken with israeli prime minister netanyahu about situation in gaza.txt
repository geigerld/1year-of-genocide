the White House says President Joe Biden spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone and Netanyahu has again reiterated that Israel will not Institute a ceasefire well there will be no uh ceasefire General ceasefire in Gaza without the release of our hostages as far as tactical little pauses an hour here and hour there we've had them before I suppose uh we'll check the circumstances in order to enable uh Goods humanitarian Goods to come in or our hostages uh individual hostages to leave but I don't think there's going to be a general ceasefire we're going to speak to Saka she's joining us from occupied East Jerusalem Sarah what more do we know about this conversation yeah well prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been saying this for a while that there wouldn't be a full ceasefire at any point throughout this war um and this was the conversation that he had also with the US President Joe Biden over overnight in a phone call that was made where the White House said they discussed um this uh potential uh pause tactical pause they've called it where it would only be for a small amount of time a small window that would not only allow people from the north that we've been seeing move to the South but also to allow more humanitarian Aid in the US has said many times that it supports Israel not having a full ceasefire but it's pushing for these temporary pauses to allow more humanitarian Aid in for example however the caveat here is is that Israel even in that interview um had said with this interview was with ABC uh news in Australia where he did say that maybe an hour here or an hour there but the the condition is is that there would be full release of all of those being held captive so it sounds like from what he's saying is that the only time they would consider this is that the captives would all be freed and it would only be during that period of freeing them that there would be a pause Israel has maintained that their concern is that and this is the same with the US that if there was a longer ceasefire let's say a day or two that this would give Hamas time to regroup and get together and Implement a plan to fight uh the Israeli forces they already say they have a strong momentum as they move further into uh gaza's City and that they want to continue to maintain that Sak kot talking to us from occupied East Jerusalem s thank you very much we're going to talk to Rob Reynolds now he's in Washington DC we're going to get the US angle on this um Rob in that conversation that uh that interview rather um I understand that uh Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that Israel may take on the control of Gaza quote indefinitely uh that seems to be going against what the US and Joe Biden has been saying pretty much from day one they were suggesting that Israel should not be involved with it just talk us through what's going on there well the the two sides are are definitely not on the two countries are definitely not on the same page here Rob with uh Netanyahu implying some kind of uh uh indefinite takeover of the security of Gaza uh you know and and a a different or heightened form of occupation of Gaza with the White House at the same time uh emphasizing that it's important that that the Palestinian people in Gaza not uh be forced out or or forcibly displaced from uh from that territory uh in the call uh earlier today between the president and prime minister Netanyahu uh Biden did mention the idea of this tactical pause as as Sarah was mentioning um later on as uh as Netanyahu spoke to uh uh American Media he said that it's possible that there could be short uh pauses an hour here an hour there he he said in in his words but uh definitely ruled out any kind of a ceasefire so uh while the president has not come down on the side of a ceasefire he is receiving a lot of pressure from the left wi of his party uh and from uh other nations uh allies uh to to come out more forcefully uh to uh ask or demand from Netanyahu that some sort of ceasefire be put in place but you see here in this instance even though the United States uh is the the main donor of of weapons and money to Israel with $3.8 billion dollars per year of of Grant Aid uh and a huge package of Aid moving through the Congress now uh and the weapons being supplied uh that the president just doesn't have as much leverage as one might think he would have over prime minister of Netanyahu and the Israeli government and in terms of Leverage Let's Talk About Us Secretary of State Anthony blinkin of course he's been on a diplomatic tour of the gulf regions talking to leaders of Arab countries but hasn't really returned with anything tangible as far as I can see well I guess it depends upon what you you envision as what his goal were what what secretary blinken's goals were um I think the primary goal there was to send a message to Iran that the United States and the uh uh Arab nations in the region uh will not countenance a widening of the War uh opening up of of new fronts in the war so it was really a warning to Iran coupled of course with the uh addition of a US nuclear submarine being brought into the area which was a pointed sort of military uh uh signal to Iran as well so if by uh coming home with nothing you mean he didn't get any uh U uh tangible results from his meetings for example in Turkey uh about uh uh new commitments or anything of like like that that that is true but Bel below the surface as blinkin himself said just because nothing is visible doesn't mean that something isn't happening or that some progress isn't being made Rob thanks very much Rob renold's talking to us from Washington DC
