anonio gz is speaking we want to carry that live and recent reported attacks from Southern Lebanon I appeal to all parties and those who have an influence over those parties to avoid any further escalation and spill over I call for the immediate release of all Israeli hostages held in Gaza civilians must be protected at all times International humanitarian law must be respect Ed and upheld about 220,000 Palestinians are now sheltered in 92 unra facilities across Gaza un premises and all hospitals schools and Clinics must never be targeted un staff are working around the clock to support the people of Gaza and I deeply regret that some of my colleagues have already paid the ultimate price crucial life-saving supplies including fuel food and water must be allowed into Gaza we need rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access now I want to thank Egypt for its constructive engagement to facilitate humanitarian access through the Rafa Crossing and to make the Alish airport available for critical assistance there is no time to lose every moment counts thank you should Israel stop bombing Gaza okay all right I thought there was perhaps going to be another speaker but that's not the case uh the UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez just gave a a very very short address the headlines and I I I missed the first line or two but the headlines um Antonio garez was calling for the immediate release of hostages um he was also confirming that several un staff members have been killed this in the Gaza Strip we were saying that earlier this hour and that uh supplies humanitarian supplies must be allowed into Gaza now let's turn to shihab ratansi shab you're live at the United Nations for us I think you heard the same thing that I did I missed the very very top of it so correct me if I missed something important I probably did um he was also saying Egypt should make their Al arish that's in the Sinai next to Israel their L arish airports available anything else that stood out to you shihab well in fact just as you were talking to H about the escalation on the border with Lebanon that's actually what the Secretary General was speaking about he said he was in contact with leaders around in the region and he had several priorities the first of which was avoiding what he called spillover and he said that he'd heard the reports about what was happening at the border with Lebanon and he called on all parties to uh to work against escalation so it was precisely what you were talking about this news of paragliders apparently now being used and then as you said he called for the immediate release of Israeli hostages he says civilians should never be targeted international law should be upheld un locations not targeted and and this is interesting actually he said that supplies of food and water should be entered should be allowed into Gaza now and then he thanked Egypt now that's different because on M day when we heard from the UN Secretary General he he mely said that he was distressed by news of the of the siege and he came under a great deal of criticism actually certainly from the Press Corp by his usage of the word distress as opposed to condemn or or or any kind of any exhortation on Israel not to inflict a Siege on Gaza given that it is in such flagrant violation of international law of of the laws of collective punishment of proportionality I mean you know if you can't condemn that if you can't tell Israel not to do that then what can you do at the United Nations which is supposed to be upholding International humanitarian law the Geneva conventions un Security Council resolutions and so on so at the very least then here this time he did call on Israel to allow food and water into to Gaza but he he said so without any using any words that he's used in the past about Palestinian actions condemnation and so on he simply said that that that the the Border must be or the frontier must be opened he said that un locations should never been targeted as you've been reporting we already know 18 un locations have already been targeted and these are shelters these are the schools that we keep hearing about where you know tens of thousands of people are Sheltering having been displaced as often is the case Israel is apparently targeting those and several have been hit uh we we know that already we also know that nine un staff have been killed actually just in the last hour in addition we had an update from the international Federation of the Red Cross and red crescent who said that 10 red oh no five red crescent members had been killed because the ambulances that they were traveling in were targeted by the Israelis in addition uh we understand that the headquarters of the red crescent in Gaza has been bombed by the Israelis shab I wonder if you can pull back the curtain a little bit on on this speech um I found out only a short while ago that we were expecting a statement by Gutierrez um often we get a little bit more notice for these things and frankly I'm surprised at how short the speech was I assume that perhaps the UN Secretary General had prepared a a broader statement laying out a position about the uh the uh Gaza Israel war that that's not the case so my question is um do you know why we found out at such short notice do you know what triggered the speech and is there anything else you know about the you about gutierrez's broader position on this that you can bring to us well we we did hear we did get noticed with a couple of hours actually but he was working on the speech till the very last moment he was notably about 15 15 minutes late but uh but but we had heard you know this morning that that he would be making a statement it was short by his standards it also you know was was low on the usual calls for you know of condemnation or or of anything like that this was you know very simp this is simply about opening what what would seem obvious from a un Secretary General which is you cannot collectively punish an entire population of civilians and restrict food and water which you know would seem primery the obvious thing for the Secretary General who's supposed to be upholding International humanitarian law to say but actually even then I have to say I was a bit surprised that he he went as far as he did for the last day or two it's actually been members of other un agencies who've been calling for a total ceasefire the UN Secretary General on Monday notably did not call for a total ceasefire he only called on Hamas to cease its military activities but he said that the Israelis could continue theirs as long as it was within International humanitarian law now we're seeing the spokesperson for the UN Secretary General speaking I'm sure he'll be asked a number of these questions now there all right shab shab rany thank you very much for your reporting from un headquarters there
