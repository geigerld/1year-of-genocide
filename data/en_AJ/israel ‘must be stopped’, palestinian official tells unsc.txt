Secretary General of the Israeli intern National wrongful act and called on the security Council to denounce this unjustified criminal and terrorist act decisively and to take appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of such crimes and aggressions regrettably the security Council has failed in this in its duty to maintain International Peace and security and a draft press statement proposed

atrocities this regime must not be allowed to evade responsibilities for its violation and consequences that follow Mr President distinguished member of the council for nearly 10 months certain countries particularly the United States have shielded Israel from any responsibilities for the massacre in Gaza and malicious activities in the region these countries have not only denied the inherent right of Palestinian resistance group to self-defense against Israeli atrocities but have also shamelessly Justified the Israeli Massacre and genocide against defenseless Palestinian people under the pretext of self-defense for Israel the US and its allies have made cynical attempt to justify and cover up the atrocities committed by the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine through arbitrary and misleading interpretation of the concept of selfdefense regretably the United States has once again and choosen to turn a blind eye to reality and Overlook the root causes of the current situation the Palestinian resistance group like Hamas and other resistance group in the region are not terrorists they are legitimate group under international law and were established to fight against occupation and aggression Mr President the secretary the security Council must unequivocally condemn isra for its horrible terrorist act as a most serious violation of international law and the charter of the United Nation as well as a grave breach of Iran's sovereignty and National Security this condemnation should be a strong and clear and reflect the international community's rejection of such violation of sovereignty and territorial Integrity furthermore the security Council should take immediate a step to hold Israel accountable for this act of agation this include considering the imposition of sanction and other measures that are necessary to prevent further violation and to signal that the Israeli malevolent activities will not be tolerated by the International Community the council must also demand that the Israeli immediately cease all aggressive actions against the pal Palestinian territories and other nations in the region this demand should be accompanied by the call for ending the occupation of the palestin territories the territory of Lan and the Syrian occupied Golan in accordance with the international law and the principles of the United Nations and finally the Islamic Republic of Iran Reserve its inherent right to self-defense in accordance with international law to respond decisively to this terrorist and criminal act

that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved through respect for these principles I thank you I thank the Islamic Republic of Iran for your statement and I now give the floor to the representative of the state of pales Observer state of Palestine Mr President I thank you for your Swift response to Algeria and China's requests to convene this emergency meeting to address the further grave developments regarding the Palestine question and the broader situation in the Middle East we recognize that this meeting takes place on the last day of the presidency of the Russian Federation and renew appreciation for your skilled leadership of the council in these critical times we also thank under Secretary General De Carlo for her briefing Mr President it has been nearly 300 days since Israel launched its genocidal war on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip a war that has Gravely breached all tenants of international humanitarian and human rights law a war that has flagrantly violated the UN Charter including the Cardinal principle regarding the sovereignty and territorial Integrity of States a war that threatens International Peace and security yet Israel is being permitted to wage this war in broad daylight with no restraints and no consequences it is doing so willfully and wanly in spite of this security council's resolutions in spite of the icj provisional measures orders in spite of the global demands for a ceasefire and still the council is failing its duty to impose a ceas fire and bring a halt to this depravity Every Day brings more horror loss and suffering for our people as Israeli occupying forces Massacre Palestinian civilians assassinate officials kill humanitarian workers medical personnel and journalists abduct civilians and torture and rape them in Israeli jails bomb and Destroy Palestinian homes and infrastructure and attack un premises including unrest schools Sheltering millions of forcibly displaced civilians who are being deliberately starved and denied access to Medical Care and the most basic needs for human subsistence and dignity by an occupier mercilessly chasing and hunting them down repeatedly displacing them as they desperately search for safety in a place where no one and nowhere is safe it is not only a catastrophic humanitarian crisis it is an existential crisis and today yet another Palestinian official has been assassinated by Israel as pronounced by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas the Palestinian leadership condemns in the strongest terms the assassination of former Palestinian prime minister and head of the political Bureau of Hamas isma Hanya in tahan today a national day of mour has been declared in Palestine and we solemnly acknowledge the expressions of condolence and the global condemnations of this act of Terror moreover we unequivocally condemn the criminal breach of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran as we condemn the repeated breaches by Israel of the sovereignty and territorial Integrity of Lebanon the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen and this includes yesterday's Brazen attack on beay we call call again with utmost urgency on the security Council the general assembly and all law-abiding peace loving Nations to act forth with to bring a halt to these horrific criminal Israeli aggressions against the Palestinian people and on our region we demand accountability for this assassination as we have continually demanded accountability for the want and murder and injury of over 130,000 Palestinian children women and men across these past 300 Days of Horror and hell in Gaza and call for accountability for all of Israel's criminal policies and practices in our territory across the decades likewise we reiterate our calls for accountability for all of Israel's breaches of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states in the region including the state of Palestine the UN Charter must be upheld not solely in words but also in Deeds the failure to hold Israel accountable has permitted and enabled these crimes and further emboldened Israeli government officials military commanders and settler extremists to escalate their reign of terror against defenseless Palestinian civilians all across the territory of the State of Palestine in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank including East Jerusalem as well as across the region Mr President violence and Terror are clearly Israel's Main and only currency not international law not diplomacy not mediation not respect for human life there is no red line for Israel no law it will not breach no Norm it will not trample no act too depraved or barbaric for its occupying Army and settler militias and no child woman or man off limits even babies considered legitimate targets the Israeli Prime Minister and his Coalition of government extremists and Military commanders believe there will never be a cost for their crimes they believe they can literally get away with murder get away with genocide against the Palestinian people they believe it because it has been possible until now no resolution no icj order no ceasefire calls have been respected no demand for protection of civilians and humanitarian access has been heeded and still no consequences whatsoever for Israel this has gone on even as the Palestinian people have tragically live streamed the genocide for all the world to see believing that somehow the world would act to save the over 2 million human lives endangered in Gaza every plea for help including in this Council has been made in the belief that the world would act in respect of the rule of law our shared moral obligations and our Collective Humanity yet this gruesome aggression continues surpassing 40,000 Palestinians killed the majority women and children over 91,000 injured in attacks by Israeli occupying forces nearly the entirety of gaza's population uprooted and the decimation of the Gaza Strip and Trauma of the entire population at the same time in the West Bank including East Jerusalem Israeli occupying forces and settler terrorists continue their violent raids killing at least 569 Palestinians including children and Israel's illegal Colonial settlement campaign not only continues as we speak but is intensifying as it feverishly pursues its vowed annexationist aims seeking to Forever obstruct the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and Independence and to destroy the two-state solution Mr President members of the council until when AB any form of accountability any serious mobilization and sanctions including a halt to Arms transfers to pressure an end to these crimes Israel is proving every single day that it will continue to act as a rogue State the assassination today and all the crimes preceding it and that have followed it in the ensuing hour hours prove this beyond the shadow of a doubt Israel openly declares its intentions to carry on defying the council and the International Community as a whole brazenly carrying on with its scorched Earth killing and destruction spree in Gaza vowing to further entrench its Colonial annexationist occupation and its racist discriminatory hateful policies against the Palestinian people and recklessly escalating tensions it is blatantly attempting to destabilize the entire ire region and provoke an allout war in the Middle East with dangerous repercussions not only for the region but far beyond the International Community must confront this reality and act to stop these crimes and aggressions there is no right that Israel can claim to justify these war crimes and crimes against humanity the right to peace and security is the right of all states in the region and in every region of the world it is not an exclusive right of Israel moreover it is a fact that Israel is an illegal occupant in the state of Palestine and possesses no rights whatsoever in our territory and over our people this was unequivocally determined by the icj in the seminal advisory opinion it rendered just days ago on the 19th of July this ruling must be respected and enforced Israel has no sovereignty rights and no right to self-defense in a territory in which it is illegally present in grave breach of every rule of international law this illegal occupation in all of its manifestations must come to an end and the Palestinian people must be free Mr President Israel has been the oppressor Tormentor and murderer of Palestinians for decades and it is the long-standing destabilizer of our region it must be stopped the obligations of the security Council and general assembly the obligations of all States including the high Contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention are to act forth with to bring an end to this unlawful abhorent situation the lives of millions of civilians are at stake in Gaza and the rest of occupied Palestine and
