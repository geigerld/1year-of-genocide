Adam Shapiro is an analyst who was director of Israel Palestine advocacy at dawn human rights and foreign policy Think Tank he joins us now from Washington DC Adam US President Joe Biden said that the US was looking into reports and trying to determine what happened in Gaza How concerned is the White House about all this and will this attack on Palestinians who were waiting for Aid put pressure on the Biden Administration to do more to push Israel into entering a ceasefire well to the first part of your question uh I'm sure there is concern in the White House about what the reports are coming out and and what has clearly been you know a tragic incident that was entirely um avoidable uh there is absolutely no reason that Israeli soldiers should be opening fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking uh to get food and and other humanitarian Aid um that said uh in terms of your second part of your question about a ceasefire uh I honestly I don't think that this Administration has any interest in moving uh things forward towards achieving a lasting permanent ceasefire and certainly one that would make a meaningful difference in the lives of Palestinians in Gaza I think uh the Biden Administration is very much on a timetable of um what the American elections are driving which is unfortunately November um and it's only at that point uh after the outcome of the elections here are determined that we might see decisive Movement by the Biden Administration I say that with just the one caveat basically that you know something really and this sounds trivial to say it at this point given how many people have been killed in Gaza but something catastrophically bad happening in Gaza might shift things in a way but 112 dead in one incident in Gaza as people in Gaza know that's a day in Gaza that's a normal day in Gaza at this point and unfortunately that's not shifting things for the Biden Administration Adam there's a huge amount of concern about the levels of hunger in Gaza un officials have warned that at least one quarter of the population there is one step away from famine without urgent action will mounting International outrage over this incident compel Israel into allowing more Aid into Gaza I I don't think so and I think we have to Now understand the true nature of what going on what we're what we are hearing is that there's more talk perhaps even from the United States of using these uh aerial uh airdrops of Aid which pose uh challenges and problems in and of themselves and are completely insufficient for the need um on the ground what we're hearing from a Aid organizations themselves is that they also after this incident are very concerned and have been very concerned about the security of their trucks and their truck drivers going in um the situation is chaotic as the images definitely shown and is totally understandable given the starvation that people are facing and the complete lack of assistance that they're receiving what is needed is unequivocally a permanent clear uh lasting ceasefire with Israeli troops leaving entirely Gaza so that Palestinians and some form of Palestinian Authority can return to maintain order in the area and a proper Aid operation and beginning of a reconstruction operation can begin and Adam if I could just go back to something you mentioned a moment ago which is that there are these reports that the US is weighing airdropping Aid into Gaza other countries are also airdropping Aid into Gaza Jordan did so in the past couple of days how effective is this as a means to get humanitarian Aid to a population that is suffering through this humanitarian catastrophe no this is this is not even a Band-Aid on the problem at this point uh the the planes can't carry that much material it's it would be far more effective to allow uh trucks uh in uh at numbers that are are necessary uh not you know the kind of trickle that's being allowed in at this point um and people are afraid certainly when they're going out to try to collect that Aid even in the the zones that have been declared safe uh as we saw from this incident uh there's no such thing as safe in Gaza as long as Israeli troops are there and as long as Israel continues to bombard from the out outside of Gaza uh what is absolutely needed this has always been a political issue and it needs to have a political solution with a ceasefire implemented and ensured and guaranteed basically by the United States all right Adam Shapiro great to get your perspective thanks so much for joining us here on Al jazer thank you
