well this is how the vaccination campaign is expected to unfold in the coming days it started in central Gaza at 6:00 a.m. local time on Sunday it's expected to run for 9 hours in demarcated areas more than 2,100 health workers and trained volunteers are operating at hundreds of locations 300 mobile teams are also assisting with the roll out after Central Gaza the campaign moves to the south of the strip before concluding in the north a second round of vaccinations is scheduled to take place in 4 weeks time let's bring in Saleem o who's a UNICEF spokesperson for the Middle East in North Africa he joins us now from Aman so that's the plan for this vaccination campaign but are you confident it can it can succeed in these current conditions well it it all depends on the commitment and implementation on the ground we already UNICEF wh on and partners on the ground are already rolling out and we're very happy to see that uh the vaccinations have commenced but the continuation and the coverage is really uh linked and dependent on on the implementation and the respect of this commitment uh and as as you as you said the commitment is limited to those areas and it's it's a localized humanitarian pause for the vaccination uh but we we hope that this is sufficient to cover the over 600,000 children that need to be vaccinated and to reach the over 90% of uh coverage to be able to stop polio um where it is now and if you can't reach that uh that goal well that's that's going to be a catastrophic uh uh event a real Health catastrophe because polio we all know polio is a highly contagious disease it's uh the outcome is really uh uh uh uh Grim it's either paralysis or death even um and it really in in these contexts in in Gaza crowded as it is uh with all the lack of the basic health systems and hygiene uh supplies and water and uh all the such it's going to it's going to prove to be to be catastrophic and that's why it's imperative to to have it now and there's no other option other than vaccinations polio can't be treated but can be prevented and that's where we need to put all the effort uh uh now and that's what we're trying to do and that's why we really need uh this to work and this uh uh um pose commitment to to take place of course whether it works depends on on whether or not it's safe enough for people to bring their children to these vaccination and centers that is surely difficult if not impossible for many families if they're being you know pounded from the sky well surely that's why that's why we're really looking at the to to to allow people to move to to those centers we have 11 main centers across the uh the strip and of course mobile teams to go and vaccinate uh children uh all around but that all again it it all depends on uh these poses and the Safety and Security not only of our teams but of course of Children and Families coming in to to to receive the vaccine how much more effective would this campaign be in the event of a general ceasefire in Gaza that would allow people to get around safely and access the um access what you're offering well that that would be the dream really uh we've been calling for a ceasefire for humanitarian uh uh reasons for so long and it doesn't get any more humanitarian than a polio uh uh uh um cases coming up in Gaza in this in this situation so really a ceas fire would make everyone's life just much easier uh it will guarantee a full coverage which we had before uh uh the war started uh and we'll just stop it uh uh right where it is without any fear of spread and and the fear is not only in Gaza now the fear is is regional polio doesn't know borders so we really need to stop this we we hoped for a ceasefire it didn't happen and this is what and we we asked for a 7 Days uh uh uh pause but this is what we have now and we think uh with this if it holds we can reach out the children and and have a good coverage but yeah but we'll see what today's bring and uh hopefully we will be able to do our jobs of course polio is a is a health catastrophe for Gaza but there is a major Public Health crisis in the strip right now because of uh the the unhygienic conditions that people are living in overcrowding polluted water sewage what else are you worried about well exactly what you said um I've been um I was in Gaza just recently and you couldn't visit a family or talk to a person without a relative a member of the family that is either sick uh uh with uh uh whe whether it's diarrhea respiratory system this dises rashes you can't see a group of children without at least one or two of them uh with rashes it's it's really dire uh the the health response is really bad going into hospitals you can see children really uh uh just flooding the the hallways and being treated there or waiting for treatment that is really not in the hospitals so so that's a real a real concern of course security and safety in general continues to be a big concern and unfortunately with each attack we see uh children among the casualties this needs to stop of course the focus now is on polio and diseases but but the war continues and children continue to die because of of that and now even because of preventable preventable causes okay thank you very much Saleem o for explaining uh the situation there for is thank you for joining us from UNICEF make sure
