and there's been a breakthrough in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a deal to allow a limited supply of medicine and other Aid into Gaza the agreement was brokered by qat and France it will see humanitarian Aid delivered to Palestinians in desperate need in exchange for medication for Israeli captives being held in Gaza let's go to our correspondent Stephanie DEA now she's joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem Stephanie Cut's foreign Ministry says that Aid will be delivered to civilians in the most affected and vulnerable areas do we know what that entails but it's very difficult very dangerous to move around the Gaza Strip at the moment most of the aid that has been getting in and again we need to stress that this is very very limited and a very difficult process to get that in uh is distributed from MFA remember you have almost 2 million people internally displaced uh in the area of Rafa this is the southern part of the Gaza Strip close to the border with Egypt now significantly the aid for the Palestinians is part of a wider deal that has been in the negotiations for weeks now which is to get medicine particularly prescribed medicine to the Israeli captives France also very much involved in this its foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that 45 captives would be receiving medicine for various chronic illnesses uh and that medicine should be lasting around three months now there's been a lot of back and forth on this deal the Israeli Prime Minister's office announced it a couple of days ago uh but there's been a lot of logistical issues to iron out why because this medication is to go to specific hostages and Hamas has voiced concerns that their concerned that perhaps it could be traced for Israel to find out where they are so a very difficult logistical operation also the first time that there is agreement between Israel and Hamas on something since the ceasefire collapse in the early early of December so we're expecting that medication which France flew to Qatar to leave Kar today head to Egypt and then be brought into Gaza to be distributed Stephanie thank you very much for that that is Stephanie deer with what we know so far about that deal live and occupied East Jerusalem
