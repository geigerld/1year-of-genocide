well let's bring in Bill McCarron he's the Press Freedom Advocate at the national Press Club he joins us now from Washington DC bill it feels like that was a pretty quick turnaround by the Israelis not something you see often do you have a sense of what the White House might have said to make this happen uh yes well there was reporting that the White House was uh upset about this and had had conversations asking for a reversal um and I don't know that the the people weren't quoted for the story they were just unnamed sources but I do believe there was communication and there was pressure and um this this felt uh chaotic on the part of Israel the policy such as it is is new and I I don't think they're all on the same page about how it's supposed to be implemented but we were bitterly disappointed uh to to see that they had um gone this far with the Associated Press and the reasons were um you know not up to the to the problem so we were glad there was a quick reversal but just just as the AP says we are concerned about what this means well the AP is also an American institution of sorts can you perhaps give a viewers a sense of where the Associated Press sits within the the psyche of the United States because of all the agencies to crack down on and a number of them have live feeds of Gaza it seems strange that Israel chose this one yes um the AP is in every Newsroom in the United States of any size uh much of what's made up of a newspaper or um a broadcast is material that on some level uh is produced by the Associated Press uh and on the TV side the AP is very big world around so it makes video products out of the United States that are used and and and other places like Israel that are used uh by global news organizations around the world um a AP is one of the leaders uh in our field they are a Cooperative so that means their board is made up of uh 30 News organizations they are the largest for the most part news organizations in the country uh it is it is messing with something that's a significant institution and tradition when you are messing with the Associated Press so we were very well the AP is also saying that Israel accused it of providing a feed to us to Al jazer but it is an agency that's what it does we also get feeds from a number of agencies does this have implications for them uh well I don't know about that I you know I'd hope that a lesson was learned today about how to exercise this this policy it's one thing to create a policy but that's another to see how it's implemented and um you know we saw how it was implemented with alir Al jazer just recently in Israel and um you know that was also surprising to us and we spoke out against it I I think it's possible that we might have some fits and starts here you know as this is going on but um I I I did read in the stories that it uh and I heard from others that it seemed that the feed being provided to Al jazer was a major uh a major part of this um uh however yes as you as you point out AP is an agency they do serve their customers they have contracts and this is an important feed for them to be able to uh provide not just to Al jazer but to lots of other news organizations of course Bill we did see some domestic push back on on the choice to to seize ap's equipment today and I'm wondering whether you sense that there might be a bit of push back more broadly from the Israeli media if if Israeli media organizations are feeling like they might be under threat I really think you've uh hit on an important point there I do think that the pressure uh on the Israeli media maybe pressure is not the right word but the responsibility to cover what's happening in Gaza more fully now than ever uh as there is is more and more uh limit put on what others can produce uh is G it's extremely important now that the Israeli media stand up and cover this in an aggressive and a complete way and I know they are concerned as well I think they are concerned about their own uh freedom to publish uh yet I do think uh part of this is for um internal consumption in a way that uh they want to make sure that um what Israeli citizens are seeing reading hearing uh reports to what they to their strategy and I think this is where the Israeli press must be independent and and I I would be looking forward to seeing what they write in editorials and other kind of Publications about uh just what happened today it will be interesting indeed we'll be keeping an eye on that bill McCarron a press Freedom Advocate at the national Press Club speaking to us from Washington DC thank you so much for your time with us again on Al jazer Bill thank you for having me make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
