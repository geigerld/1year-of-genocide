already under Relentless Israeli bombardment for months Palestinians in Northern Gaza are also going hungry the UN food agency has halted Aid deliveries saying civil order has collapsed so how can Israel be stopped from using starvation as a weapon of War this is Inside [Music] Story hello and welcome to the program I'm Muhammad jamj the world food program is suspending Aid deliveries to Northern Gaza because it's too dangerous the UN agency says the decision wasn't taken lightly and it knows more people risk dying of hunger but it's adamant conditions need to improve and the safety of its trucks and staff have to be guaranteed the move leaves hundreds of thousands of Palestinians facing possible famine just how bad is the situation in the north of the strip and is Israel's offensive a war of starvation this is what we'll be discussing today but first this report from Dimitri medvedenko at the beginning of its war on Gaza Israel cut off supplies of everything Palestinians needed to survive closing its two border crossings and bombing Rafa The Crossing linking Egypt to the strip we are imposing a Complete Siege on Gaza there will be no electricity no food no water no fuel everything will be closed we are fighting against human animals and we are acting accordingly before October the 7th 500 trucks would enter Gaza daily most of the population depended on humanitarian assistance after a week of Relentless bombing the Israeli Army issued an evacuation order for Northern Gaza 1.1 million people had 24 hours to move to the south of the strip for their own safety it said many left but others didn't in the months that followed even those so-called safe zones came under attack and some families made the difficult decision to return home or to what was left of it it was weeks into its assault before Israel allowed the first trucks back in and Far Below pre-war numbers the UN has repeatedly accused Israel of blocking almost all a deliveries to the north this year it says only 10 of more than 60 planned convoys have reached Northern Gaza this is a rare day when one made it through desperate for anything to eat people rush in why does a kilogram of rice cost $19 there's no flour we're eating animal feed to stop ourselves from feeling hungry people who used to have money at the beginning of the war no longer have any how can people eat or drink this is a war of starvation in January the international court of justice ordered Israel to take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance in Gaza but Palestinians in the north say nothing has changed hunger disease displacement and non-stop Israeli attacks Demitri medeno Al jazer for Inside Story so what's the significance of the wfp's decision and it's a good question for our guest today joining us from occupied East Jerusalem is Shan Alo Communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Palestine in ramala in the occupied West Bank is nebal farak spokesperson for the Palestinian red crescent society which has delivered essential services to Palestinians since 1969 and from London we're joined by Sarah Pantano the chief executive of OD di a respected humanitarian policy Think Tank a warm welcome to you all and thanks so much for joining us today on Inside Story n let me start with you today more than a million people used to live in the north of the Gaza Strip now the area is mostly destroyed for those who chose to stay or for those who chose to return just how difficult has life become for them how desperate is the situation and how dire is the suffering AR is extremely dire we're talking about almost 700,000 Palestinians who are now in Gaza City and the north those people are completely denied access to humanitarian Aid We're talking about um wfp seing seizing operation and distributing Aid in Gaza City but we all know that since the beginning of the war in Gaza Israel has imposed PGE on Gaza City and the North and this area is nearly completely cut off a humanitarian Aid that's why the situation there is catastrophic people are literally starving most people they struggle even to have one meal most essential supplies um are not available at the market and even uh items which are available are extremely high we're talking about 10 20 times higher prices than normal just having a one egg is almost $2 I have here closely from from our colleagues in jabalia north of Gaza and they have been telling me how they struggle every day in order to find food for their families Shaina uh you heard nebal there talk about how the situation is catastrophic now the wfp previously warned of famine like conditions affecting 2.3 million people in Gaza they said that its teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation in the north just recently now how bad from what you're hearing is the situation and how fearful are you and your teams of how much worse it could get you know we're hearing similar reports about the cost of food just simply being astronomical if it even can be found we have some colleagues who also remain in Northern Gaza and Gaza City uh and they have run out of flow they've run out of corn they're running out of animal fodder they don't have any cooking oil really they are struggling to survive we've uh seen that the wfp reported that uh around 16% of children under the age of two are suffering from acute malnutrition in Northern Gaza this is only going to to rise as as Aid convoys cannot access Gaza because it simply isn't safe these are unbelievable conditions for humanitarians to be trying to work in and imagine if it's this difficult for humanitarians how difficult it is also for the civilian population that's struggling to survive yeah and Shaina you were talking there about logistics and I wanted to follow up with you about that because there are so many Aid agencies who have complained about the cumbersome Israeli procedures that slow these Aid trucks from getting into Gaza that slow the flow of aid from getting into Gaza I want to ask you about specifically how difficult it is getting the aid in not just that but also once the aid is actually in and it's not a huge that's getting in but once it actually is in how difficult it is for those Aid agencies to actually pick up the aid and then distribute the aid well first of all Israel has implemented these extremely cumbersome screening processes which delay Aid it's been difficult to track Aid when it's coming in be able to anticipate it we've also seen recently that Israel has been targeting uh Aid convoys uh or the police officers rather who are accompanying Aid convoys which has led to the police no longer being willing to provide that service meaning that that convoys are being uh mobbed by by desperate Palestinians struggling to get anything so uh when when trucks are are managing to get into Gaza having them travel from Rafa all the way in the South up to Northern Gaza it's very very difficult for for convoys to be able to make that journey and arrive to their destination with the aid that with the the the complete package of of Aid because so much of it is being uh looted along the way or or being forced to be distributed to people who are in desperate need and struggling themselves we desperately need in addition to the massive scaling up of Aid the reduction of these cumbersome screening processes we need additional access points including from the north from Aras from the carne Crossing we need additional ways to be getting Aid in so that it reaches people uh more efficiently and can reach those throughout all of Gaza all of whom are in desperate need but particularly those in Northern Gaza Sarah so the world food program is now saying that it's halting food deliveries to Northern Gaza because conditions are too dangerous obviously this is of huge significance when it comes to the impact it will have on people in Northern Gaza getting that hugely needed Aid I mean the wfp is essentially the backbone for food delivery in Gaza so if they are pausing their distribution what does this mean going forward and can we expect to see other Aid agencies essentially taking the same decision in the near term yeah that is a very real you know danger that all humanitarian supplies of Northern Gaza will stop and this is in the context of a situation that as my colleagues were just describing is is desperate you know we are seeing you know suffering that is unspeakable throughout Gaza particularly in the north where people have really been left without you know um support um I have very dear friends and colleagues who are you know responding in these emergencies people that worked in some of the worst crises around the world from Sudan to Yemen and they're telling me that what they're seeing now and what they are witnessing is something they've never witnessed in the very long careers as humanitarian um actors on around the world just to add a few figures to what my colleagues have already said wfp talks about you know potential faming but we know half a million gazin are already in family like situation um and that you know means that a lot of kids are staring because a lot of the population of Gaza is made of young people is made of children we are seeing you know blockages of convoys repeatedly I mean the UN said that um from the 1 of January to the middle of February 51% of plant a deliveries to Northern Gaza were denied access by Israeli authorities and you know in the month of January only 10 10 of the 61 you know humanitarian Aid missions that they had asked for were allowed by Israel north of w Gaza and I think that is really important to you know stress because Israel as a Waring party has an obligation to facilitate humanitarian assistance you know to allign humanitarian assistant into Gaza actually they have an obligation as an occupying power to supply civilians in Gaza with Goods um and they are you know failing this obligation to ensure critical continuity of cenal services and and you know sort of protect civilians so actually when they they can't um s of uphold this obligation they must they absolutely Mass you know according to international law allow unimpeded flow of humanitarian Goods H and what we're seeing instead is just a trickling of you know the old track here and there for 2.3 million people nbal Sarah was talking there about the risk of famine that is now being detected in Gaza also talking about the responsibility that an occupying Force has when it comes to the delivery of Aid now I want to ask you about the fact that the Palestinian red crescent has been warning that a number of people have died as a result of Israel's deliberate starvation and famine in Gaza so I want to ask you is what we are seeing right now War by starvation and are Israel's actions in Gaza causing a famine almost quarter of population in Gaza are literally starving and the rest of the population are uh all of them uh suffer from uh insecure uh s insecure access to food food insecurity is something that every single Palestinian in Gaza now suffer from old people are suffer to have food water and even medicine and um I also stress out the importance of Israel as an occupying power have a responsibility to fulfill the needs of civilians in God although and despite this Israel is using the humanitarian Aid as a weapon against Palestinians as a collective punishment to let the entire population starve and we have been seen uh people are literally starving uh I'll tell you uh regarding uh our experience and our medical post which we have established in jabalia north of Gaza according to our volunteers there they are telling us the medical post is receiving many cases for children who suffer from severe malnutrition and those uh children um are literally starving because they don't have access to food many of them as well uh start getting infectuous diseases hepatitis A according to the figures at least 700,000 Palestinians in Gaza Strip uh Co uh in contagious diseases such as respiratory diseases skin diseases and other diseases the situation is extremely dangerous and Palestinians if they don't lose their lives directly because of the bombardments they will because of starvation and infectuous diseases the level of starvation particularly in Gaza City and the north has reached a very dangerous stage Sarah I want to come back to you about a point you were making about the obligation under International humanitarian law when it comes to occupying forces when it comes to the delivery of Aid you know in January the international court of justice ordered Israel to take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance in Gaza but the Palestinians in the North in Gaza say nothing has changed that things have only gotten worse Aid agencies say the same the framework for international humanitarian law it's being challenged in ways now that it has not been challenged before isn't that correct it is sadly really correct and and very dangerous because you know what we have seen over the past few months since the attack by Hamas on the 7th of of October um is a flatting of international militarian law at a level unseen before I mean obviously Hamas attack was unconscionable but you know reciprocal crimes against humanity cannot be accept as a proxy you know the laws of war exist to preserve Humanity in the midst of fighting you know they're there really to give us a moral compass to to to limit the suffering of civilians and and you know the parties are required to exercise restraint and abide by you know the Geneva conventions and just you know to explain what this means um it is that the parties need to exercise a distinction between civilians and Military targets they need to use doe precaution um to prevent harm to civilians they need to make sure that the damage to civilians is proportionate compared to any you know anticipated military Advantage gained I would argue that Israel is failing all of these test and you know it's failed them so far is continued to fail them as people saying the icj interim ruling hasn't really you know changed anything now even if Israel is acting in self-defense you know even if Hamas you know continues to hold hostages and commit criminal actions this cannot be used to justify what is really the collective punishment of 2 3 million Palestinians in Gaza you know the majority of bumer children as I've already said you know it can be justified it can be used to justify forcible transfer of Civilian population bombardment of Civilian localities All You know the failure of of of providing humanitarian relief all things that are you know a violation materal laws and and I would also add that the failure um of other states of third party states to prevent these violations is basically complicity we seeing Western democracy they are violating themselves some of the most fundamental commits to international law and human rights law sha I saw you reacting to a lot of what Sarah was saying there and it looked to me like you wanted to jump in so I'm going to let you go ahead no I mean Sarah's absolutely right that that we're seeing starvation being used as a weapon of war and that Israel has completely um completely uh ignored uh evaded denied its respons responsibility towards the occupied population it was Israel remember who who uh within the first day or two of this war declared that they would cut off all electricity water uh and fuel supplies and and it's and we saw that the the international court of justice reaffirmed Israel's role and responsibility as the occupying power to provide for the basic necessities of of the of the protected population in this case the Palestinians in Gaza I think what we're concerned about as we see um starvation levels grow particularly in Northern Gaza is that this is just another uh coercive measure that Israel is taking to to depopulate Northern Gaza to forcibly transfer in violation of international humanitarian law the the population there and and force them really out uh to to south of Wadi Gaza to the middle area to hunis to Rafa or perhaps even out to to Egypt as we've seen uh as as this looming ground offensive uh or ground operation in in Rafa um continues to be to be uh previewed and so it's it's essential that we continue to first and foremost demand a ceasefire which will of course allow for for conditions that are better for and and appropriate for humanitarians to be responding but we also need the International Community to put pressure on Israel to fulfill these obligations under international law and if they are not willing to provide the basic needs uh for survival of the protected population they at the very least need to facilitate uh third parties humanitarian agencies the UN in in in fulfilling those obligations on their behalf nbal um I know we touched on this a little bit earlier in the show but we need to remember that the world food program had only just resumed a delivery to Northern Gaza after a 3-week suspension that had taken place now they're stopping yet again um they say it's just simply too dangerous this really underscores how dangerous things are for civilians in the north too right exactly civilians uh since the beginning of the war have been denied access to humanitarian Aid I um absolutely understand how uh a humanitarian agencies struggle to get the aid into Gaza especially after uh many attempts uh were faced by refusal from Israeli authorities to allow the entry of a humanitarian Aid and even the number of humanitarian Aid trucks that are allowed to go uh into Gaza City and the north we're talking about just a few number of a trucks that's why we have seen people very desperate trying to jump into the trucks and take anything they can take because people only want to survive the the L and the stage of dangerous of how people are literally Starving in Gaza City and the north it can't be imagined we have said that repeatedly people started even to Grand animals uh being in order to have a flower uh to make a bread the situation there is dire and we also continue to confirm that the situation generally speaking regarding the humanitarian Aid Israel is the the one who is obstructing the entry of a humanitarian Aid into Gaza Strip before the war on Gaza Gaza was receiving around 500 a trucks daily today even when both Crossings RAF and kerm Abu Salam are open a maximum of 178 trucks are getting in that mean we are far away from the number of a trucks that should be allowed to be in so we can fulfill the needs of people the a trucks that are allowing to get in doesn't even scratch the surface we're talking about a fifth month of war in Gaza there is many needs that is related to the emergency situation we are in which means we need to have relief items in order to be provided for almost a 90% of the population who became idps this wasn't a need before the world this is something that is in New and it's related to the emergency situation and instead of increasing the aid truck we're getting less Aid trucks at least if we take this into consideration in addition to the increasing needs of hospitals since they are dealing with more injuries and they need more supplies more medicines we need to have double or triple trucks in order to fill the needs of people on top of that have access to all areas in G City and not just to leave Gaza City and the north completely denied access of a humanitarian Aid and Sarah also just to contextualize a bit more you're talking about the fact that before October 7th there were around 500 trucks of Aid per day that would enter Gaza and even then most of the population was dependent upon humanitarian assistance so the fact that Aid has massively decreased since then only showcases how much worse the situation is getting right just a few weeks ago is the suspension of funding to ARA which was you know know the lifeline for so many Palestinians in in Gaza and that practically has no you know no money to continue to support Palestinians so we can just you know imagine how this is um aggravating a situation that was already really you know deeply um desperate for for so many people on the ground um Shaina if I could ask you um the fact of the matter is we're talking about how as you said more International pressure needs to be applied and order to get more Aid into Gaza but let me ask you this even if there were more crossings that were opened does that immediately make the situation better or are there still a lot of obstacles to overcome well of course the situation needs more than just the opening of Crossings we need and and the scaling up of Aid uh the amount of Devastation and destruction throughout all of Gaza is going to take years to to rebuild let alone of course of course the the psychological trauma that will I'm sure last for Generations after all that the people of Gaza have experienced over the last four and a half months uh but but it is a first step in terms of allowing for the entry of more Goods the other thing on top of of just having more entry points that would make it easier to access uh all um more areas of Gaza is that we need um restrictions to be lifted in terms of what can enter Gaza there have been reports of of relief items um being denied entry including things as simple as tent poles or um toolkits to help uh that are included in shelter kits to help seal off um homes so we need those restrictions to be lifted as well to allow not only for a greater influx of goods but a greater variety of goods that are entering that can help and support the relief effort that also includes Machinery one of the major issues right now that's also hampering the the delivery of Aid is the lack of even things as simple as forklifts to be able to offload Aid into warehouses and be able to to um take inventory and figure out how to distribute it uh things like fuel to be able to to get to to different areas of Gaza and be able to to distribute Aid um restoration of telecommunications all of these things are needed for to be a robust I'm sorry to interrupt we just don't have a whole lot of time left uh nbal I want to ask you one last question we have just about 2 minutes left from your perspective right now as dire as the situation is what needs to happen right away in order for the situation to improve we continue to call on a ceasefire we can't as a humanitarian agencies operate under such horrific conditions this world need to be end and we need protection for civilians since we're talking about 70% of the victims are children and women we don't want people just to die to die with full stomach first we need them to be protected and second we need h a safe unembedded humanitarian Aid access into Gaza through old borders and the new points and we need also to be able to distribute it in all areas in Gaza and not still and to break the siege that is impos since the beginning of the war on Gaza on the area of Gaza City and the north Gaza City and the North 700,000 people theirs are civilians and they do have a right to have access to food and water and we need this access to be guaranteed we need also a safe access for us as a humanitarians not to be targeted while we are implementing our life- saving missions trying to elevate the suffering of people in Gaza all right well we have run out of time so we're going to have to leave the conversation there thanks so much to all of our guests Shane Alo nbal farak and Sarah Pantano and thank you
