going to speak now to Tian Hassan who's in New York she's Executive Director of Human Rights Watch thank you very much indeed for being with us I understand that this report has produced a lot of interest and you've been doing uh several press conferences uh as a result of that I'd like to ask you uh about your assessment of the situation in Gaza compared to the uh other 99 uh countries that you have been monitoring over the last year um well Human Rights Watch doesn't do a ranking um of human suffering but what we can say is that the situation in Gaza is dire through our research since the beginning of the conflict Human Rights Watch has documented um war crimes being committed including um uh the crime of starvation as a weapon of War um also Collective punishment through the Restriction to F to basic food water fuel um and life-saving humanitarian assistance which has been imposed by uh the isra blockade so you know the situation in Gava is desperate and it requires uh a immediate response from the international community and what we've seen today I think with the international court of justice uh hearing South Africa's application uh that uh they are arguing that uh Israel has uh violated its obligations under the genocide convention is an important signal for the people of Gaza and to the world that there must be accountability for war crimes that are being committed in Gaza but throughout this conflict all parties to the conflict must abide by International humanitarian law and they must be uh held to account when that is violated um how confident can you be that those on both sides of this conflict will ultimately be held accountable as you say you know the question of accountability uh is a is a difficult one but I don't think it's an option for us to think that it's not achievable when we are dealing with human suffering and we are dealing with uh violations of international law at this scale where thousands of people have been killed including thousands of children we are seeing you know the violations of international law the tenants of international law like the targeting of humanitarian workers uh the killing of journalists um the targeting or and the destruction of hospitals and medical facilities it is important for our common Humanity uh that we ensure that these do not go that there is accountability and that these crimes are not we do not look away um you know there have also been crimes that were committed inside Israel and they also demand accountability but this is not the only conflict in the world where we see the world looking away and not bringing the full forced rigor that is required to bring Justice and accountability and to stop civilian suffering the situation in Sudan for example in the DAR for region has fallen off the agenda we see thousands of people who have been displaced women who have been victims of sexual violence and the targeting of the maset ethnic group um and you know that that has received no International attention and requires the same level of commitment to ensure accountability that we saw in contexts like Ukraine where we saw the International Community throw all of the tools in the human rights and accountability toolkit at the situation we saw investigations we've seen ICC referrals we've seen um domestic uh in investigations by countries who um were prepared to put resources in to investigate and prosecute uh war crimes in Ukraine and if anything Ukraine shows us what is possible when the world stands up and takes violations of international humanitarian law seriously and we should expect nothing less from the other conflicts in the world from Myanmar to Ethiopia to Sudan to Gaza we and Al jaer regularly cover uh reports that are released by Human Rights Watch and other Aid organizations around the world so many of them are filled with Tales of of of tragedies and harrowing stories of per of personal suffering what do you think it takes to refocus attention onto the these crises around the world Gaza is the one at the moment but you mentioned Sudan of course what does it take to re-engage governments and people as individuals to get more involved and take action on situations like this well the the key is that we need to end two really damaging practices that Human Rights Watch documented as growing Trends in 2023 um and that is double standards when we see the International Community mobilized for some situations and not for others um because this sends a message um that some lives are worth more than others and that erodes trust in the international institutions which we rely on like the UN Security Council like the courts uh like the general assembly that we rely on to deliver human rights and ensure accountability so then enter double standards and for states to stop being able to cherry-pick um and being selective about where they ensure that International humanitarian law and international law are implemented um because you have to remember human rights are not a nice to have these rights emerged out of the darkest times in humanity they were agreed upon by countries all over the world and they are law they are and when countries step outside of those laws or they violate those laws they need to be held accountable it doesn't matter who they they are what region they're in um or who their world leaders are or who their world leaders are friends with accountability is for everyone and the second practice that we need to see is that we have seen an alarming rise in States beginning to to engage in what we call transactional diplomacy where they turn a blind eye to human rights abusers in exchange for meeting some sort of short-term domestic need which could be around uh natural resources security um or migration and increasingly we've seen everything from the catastrophic EU um the EU migration deals with countries like Tunis and Libya where the EU has just turned a blind eye to the serious abuses uh that are happening in those countries and against um uh refugees and migrants in those countries in exchange for keeping migrants and refugees out of the European block this simply just enable sends a message that these governments AR accountable um and it emboldens them to go even further and as a result we saw countries for example uh like Rwanda who have taken their repression uh across borders where they're pursuing uh where there's been no accountability for abuses at home and now they're beginning to hunt down uh journalists human rights Defenders uh and political dissidents abroad from Sydney to Paris so what it's going to take is clear um in and consistent uh and committed action from all states um in all contexts TI Hassan is Executive Director of Human Rights Watch we appreciate you being with us thank you very much indeed
