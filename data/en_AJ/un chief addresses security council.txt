all right we have to take you now to the security Council let's listen into what the Secretary General is saying have devastating consequences we anticipate that it would result in a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for Mass displacement into Egypt I fear the consequences could be devastating for the security of the entire region we have already seen the spillover in the occupied West Bank Lebanon Syria Iraq and Yemen there is clearly my view a serious risk of aggravating existing threats to the maintenance of International Peace and security the risk of collapse of the humanitarian system is fundamentally linked with a complete lack of Safety and Security for our staff in Gaza and with the nature and intensity of military operations which are severely limiting access to people in desperate need the threat to the Safety and Security of United Nations staff in Gaza is unprecedented more than 130 of my colleagues have already been killed many with their families this is the largest single loss of life in the history of our organization some of our staff take their children children to work so they know they will live or die together colleagues have shared artbreaking messages from staff members pleading for help the end Secretary General of the Department of Safety and Security has advised me that all possible means of mitigating the risk to stuff within Gaza short of evacuation are closed off because of the way this conflict has evolved I cannot emphasize strongly enough that the UN is totally committed to stay and deliver for the people of Gaza and I pay tribute to the heroic humanitarian Aid workers who remain committed to their work despite the enormous dangers to their health and their lives but the situation is simply becoming untenable the council called in resolution 272 and I quote for the scaling up of the provision of such supplies to meet humanitarian needs of the civilian population especially children end quote I deeply regret to inform the council that under current conditions on the ground the Fulfillment of this mandate has become impossible the conditions for the effective delivery of humanitarian Aid no longer exist the crossing point at Rafa was not designed for hundreds of trucks and is a major bottleneck but even if sufficient supplies were permitted into Gaza intense bombardment and hostilities Israeli restrictions on movement fuel shortages and interrupted Communications make it impossible for un agencies and their Partners to reach most of the people in need between 3 and 5 December the two days preceding my letter the UN could only distribute Aid in one of Gaza five governorates Rafa elsewhere excess was impossible people are desperate fearful and angry and in some cases they have expressed their anger towards our own staff Mr president all this takes place amid a spiraling humanitarian nightmare first there is no effective protection of civilians more than 177,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed since the start of Israel's military operations this includes more than 4,000 women and 7,000 children tens of thousands are reported to have been injured and many are missing presumably and at the rubble and all these numbers are increasing by the day attacks from Air Land and Sea are intense continuous and widespread so far they have reportedly hit 339 education facilities 26 hospitals 56 Healthcare facilities 88 mosques and three churches over 60% of gaza's housing has reportedly been destroyed or damaged some 300,000 houses and apartments some 85% of the population have been forced from their homes the people of Gaza are being told to move like human pinballs ricochetting between ever smaller sers of the sace without any of the basics for survival but nowhere in Gaza is safe at least 88 un shelters have been hit killing over 270 people and injuring over 900 conditions in shelters are overcrowded and unsanitary people nurse open wounds hundreds of people stand in line for hours to use one shower or toilets families who have lost everything sleep on bare concrete floors wearing clothes they have not changed for two months tens of thousands of Palestinian Ians arrived in Rafa in recent days overwhelming shelters there many displaced families including children older people pregnant women and people with disabilities are sleeping in streets and public spaces across the city Mr President second gazans are running out of food according to the world food program there is a serious risk of starvation famine in Northern Gaza 19 7% of households are not eating enough in the South the figure among displaced people 83% all of the people of the north and more than one third of displaced people in the South are simply starving wfp's Zone food stocks are running out in the North Nine out of 10 people have spend at least one full day and night without food the last functioning floor meal in Gaza was destroyed on 15 November wfp has provided food and cash assistance to hundreds of thousands of people across Gaza since the Crisis began and is ready to scale up its operations however that would require effective access to all people in need and at least 40 trucks of Food Supplies every day many times the current level Mr President third Gaza L system is collapsing while needs are escalating at least 286 else workers have been killed hospitals have suffered heavy bombardment just 14 out of 36 are still functioning of these three are providing basic first head while the others are delivering partial Services the European Gaza Hospital one of the two main hospitals in southern Gaza has 370 beds it is is currently housing 1,000 patients and an estimated 70,000 people seeking shelter there are critical shortages of drugs blood prodcts and medical supplies fuel to run the hospitals is severely ration many patients are being treated on the floor and without anesthetics as patients with life-threatening injuries continue to arrive WS are overflowing and and stuff are overwhelmed at the same time the unsanitary conditions in shelters and severe shortages of food and water are leading to increases in respiratory infections scabies JIS and diarrhea everything I just described represents an unprecedented situation that led to my unprecedented decision to invoke article 99 urging the members of the security Council to press to avert the humanitarian catastrophe and the appealing for a humanitarian ceasefire to be declared Mr President we are all aware that Israel began its military operations in response to the brutal Terror attacks Unleashed by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on 7 October I unreservedly condemn those attacks and I'm appalled by the reports of sexual violence there is no possible justification for deliberately killing some 100,000 some 1,200 people including 30 stre children injuring thousands more and taking hundreds of hostages some 130 hostages are still held captive and I call for their immediate and unconditional release as well as their Humane treatment and visits from the International Community of the Red Cross until they are feed at the same time the brutality perpetrated by amas can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people and while indiscriminate rocket Fire by amas into Israel and the use of civilians as human Shields are in contention with the laws of war such conduct does not absolve Israel on its own violations International humanitarian law includes the duty to protect civilians and to comply with the principles of Distinction proportion ity precaution the laws of war also demand that civilians essential needs must be met including by facilitating the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian relief International humanitarian law cannot be applied selectively it is binding on all parties equally at all times and the obligation to observe it does not depend on reciprocity Mr President the people of Gaza are looking into the abyss the International Community must do everything possible to end their ordeal I urge the council to spare no effort to push for an immediate humanitarian cire for the protection of civilians and for the Urgent delivery of life-saving AIDS while we deal with the current crisis we cannot lose sight of the only viable possibility for a peaceful future a two-state solution on the basis of United Nations resolution ions and international law with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace security this is vital for Israelis Palestinians and for the International Peace and security the eyes of the world and the eyes of History are watching it's time to act and I thank
