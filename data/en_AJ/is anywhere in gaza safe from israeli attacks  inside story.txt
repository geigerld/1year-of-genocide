alzer's Gaza bureau chief Mourns his wife daughter son and Grandson killed in an Israeli attack the majority of the war's victims are women and children with journalists among the dead too is anywhere in the Gaza Strip safe this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm Bernard Smith while ddu is one of the best known journalists in the Gaza Strip just as his colleague Shireen abakay was in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces shot and killed Shireen while she was on assignment in Janine last year W's wife daughter son and Grandson were killed in an air strike on a refuge camp in central Gaza on Wednesday a place they had left their home for a place they believed to be safe despite the tragedy W has pledged to keep reporting on Israel's war on Gaza no doubt it will not stop me from doing my duties no matter what the price we are paying the voice of Al jazer my voice will continue to tell the truth in a few minutes I will go live on air shame on the Israeli occupation forces more women and children have been killed in this war than men or even combatants hospitals schools refugee camps and apartment blocks have been raised to the ground in Relentless Israeli attacks journalists have been victims too in less than 3 weeks 24 media workers have been killed 20 of them Palestinians according to the committee for the protection of journalists in the face of such violence is anywhere in Gaza safe for anyone we'll be discussing this with our guests in a moment but first let's talk to a journalist and close colleague of w ddu Al jazer producer safwat alut has covered Gaza for the past 12 years and I've been been lucky enough to work with him over that time and he joined us from Dar Al Bala in central Gaza safwat thanks for joining as I know it's a very very difficult time for you at the moment just tell us first of all about whale and his family well you know um you have been to Gaza several times and you know how the relationship between alaz teams while is not only a colleague while is a big brother and he's close to everybody in uh in terms of jazer Team you know he's at the reference and he is the advisor for everyone since he's uh the most experienced journalist in in Gaza if not in Palestine uh and in Al jazer team in Gaza so uh you know um we have been sharing while lots of Social and personal um let's say ceremonies including birthdays including the marriage of his son last year so we are a family together with with the and the other colleagues you know I know W for we worked together in alaz for 12 years but I know him for more than 23 years or 22 to be more accurate so I know I know him when he used to work for local daily as uh as a reporter and then he moved to Al Arabia Satellite Channel and then finally uh for our luck he joined Al jazer uh he's the bravest journalist by the way I have ever met and I have uh ever worked with uh despite all these conditions hard conditions and and working under the fire he decided to stay in Gaza uh and keep reporting walk and talk live from the rubble from the destruction and I met him three days ago and I told him while why you are staying here he said where else can we go simply so he he thought that he secured his family moving them or displacing them to Al refug refugee camp but unfortunately as he said no place is safe all right you're a journalist and you're a family man how have you been able to manage both those aspects of your life the family is the most import of course well that's the the real and the M most major and challenge that I have been facing as a father and have I was forced with my to get displaced or to displac with my family uh you know we have to meet the minimum need at least uh for the family uh we spend long time looking carrying bottles of water and lining up at some wells just to find some water for our children this is number one number two the food you know the essential food which is the bread we line up at the bakery to bring food and it's not even safe you know some people they were killed while lining up at the water water wells or at the bakeries so we have been reporting that even our ourselves so this is the first challenge the second thing is the fear you know the the family looks or the children they look at the father as the main source of power and support and they could read the fear and the weakness in their father they understand it so this is psychologically is very uh dangerous and for the long term when the family loses the faith in the main source of power which is the father so I asked my daughter a few days ago how do you feel that she said if you are okay we are okay this G this even add more challenges to the challenges that we are facing in in our work and in our in our with our families all right safat safad Al kute thank you for talking to us from Gaza please please look after yourself and your family your you and all your colleagues in Gaza in are in all our thoughts um please please try take care as best you can safwat thank you very much trying our best thank you thank you my dear thank you very [Music] much let's bring in our guests in New York is Jody Ginsburg president of the committee to protect protect journalists a nonprofit organization that promotes media freedom and defends the rights of journalists in rala in the occupied West Bank is Mustafa barouti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and in the Honduran Capital tus sigala is Irene Khan un special rapur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression a warm welcome to you all um first of all Mustafa bouti in rala can you just tell us about how important Wales reporting is in the arabic speaking World well while as a very very close and warm colleague who who has been doing wonderful work in terms of Journalism covering what was happening in Gaza all these years uh he has covered so many wars that happened so many aggressions that happened on Gaza I personally knew him very well and uh I happened to be in Gaza during the 2014 War uh during which time uh we met many times also he did wonderful professional job and I think there were two icons of Al jazer work in the occupied territories D in Gaza and Shireen abak ramala and unfortunately both of them had this terrible tragedy Shak was killed by an Israeli sniper and the most recent International commission reported very clearly that she was assassinated for no reason uh by an Israeli sniper and now D is losing his family his his his wife his son his daughter it's a terrible tragedy but also it indicates what journalists have to live through in Palestine let me add that up until this moment 22 journalists in Gaza have been killed during this terrible attack of Israel yes during the last 20 days 22 journalist and let me also remind you that during the last 10 years in add in addition to these 22 journalists 52 other journalists including sharen Abu were also killed by the Israeli Army in West Bank and Gaza yes okay Mustafa thank you very much jod there is perhaps no more dangerous in the world to operate as a journalist than Gaza at at the moment what are the challenges you understand that they're facing above the ordinary challenges they would face from reporting from Gaza during previous conflicts well as you heard this is the deadliest Conflict for journalists reporting on this region ever in the 30 years that um cpj has documenting this and in fact it looks like it's the worst period for journalists covering conflict anywhere ever in those 30 years it's extremely challenging uh to cover Gaza at the moment there is nowhere to go there's very there's nowhere to hide um and so and yet we are reliant on those journalists inside Gaza to tell us what's happening um everyone who is a journalist has effectively become a war reporter and that's been the case for many G and journalists for for many years uh they coping with challenges including lack of electricity obviously the dangers of um repeated air strikes and so on um and all of that while they are immersed and living among friends and family as as well was Irene um what do you understand of the Well from your perspective the importance of course of freedom of expression and opinion what do you understand of the of the challenges of journalists trying to do that in Gaza well first of all as you said freedom of expression is extremely important at all particularly in times of conflict how else would we get news but in this conflict it is indiscriminate disproportionate attacks against all civilians journalists are civilians under International humanitarian law they have no protection the civilians who are in Gaza have no protection from indiscriminate disproportionate attacks so what good is your jacket with press written on it going to do what good are your helmets going to do that's what's been proven on the ground there there are no rules that are being followed uh by by Israel in this uh conflict no rules applicable to civilians are being respected that is an immense tragedy for the people on the ground but I think for international humanitarian law the entire system of the rule of law is under pressure here and journalists on the front line are the ones who are showing with their courage and resilience how much uh blatant disregard of international humanitarian law is taking place in Gaza right now Mustafa we're trying to look a bit at how how journalists are able to report from Gaza and also the occupied West Bank do you see a way that the do you see a way the Palestinians are reported about is a differently as to the way Israelis are reported about of course there is a very huge difference and especially during this terrible War uh is Israeli perspective is presented repeatedly and so many times and uh even when it's blunt lies about what has happening like that whole misleading and black media information about decapitating children or raping women which which many journalists had to apologize about reporting like CNN reporters and Los Angeles Times as well but these lies keep repeating and uh unfortunately what I see in many International media Outlets is that they do not only report what's what what Israelis are saying they do not report what Palestinians are saying but on top of that if you are rarely interviewed I mean like they would have 10 interviews with with with with Israelis and maybe one occasional interview with a Palestinian then the the strange thing is that the the broadcaster or the the one who is running the interview will be not only bringing in Israeli point of view but also repeating the same propaganda while he's interviewing a Palestinian and that by itself shows you how how how discute is the situation how unfair and how improper it is and the problem also is that when they report about Israeli situation it's reporting about human beings a person who a child or family who has been affected but then its numbers only on the Palestinian side and that's why the state the case of maybe brings maybe some light on the fact that these 7,000 Palestinians killed and more than 3,000 children killed are human beings they're not just numbers they're the people who lived and worked their fathers mothers children sisters and brothers and and that's exactly what is missing in the most of the international media Outlets it's really really a lot of discrimination a lot of unacceptable discrimination and and more than that the lies keep coming out from Israel and they keep repeating them especially one last point is that they they tend to blame the victim blaming the victim they blame us for being bombarded they're blaming us for being killed this is so unacceptable Jody um you journalists operating in Gaza and also in the occupied West Bank as well where Mustafa is at the moment do you what are your it might seem like an obvious question I guess but what are your main concerns for journalists reporting there is also now very dangerous for them in the West Bank as well with increased settler activity it's incredibly difficult to be safe reporting on this area not only do we have obviously um the military launches potentially ground Invasion but in increasingly journalists are at risk when they're going out to report from potentially um people who want to uh take revenge on journalists almost for reporting what's happening we've seen cases of journalists even in Israel being hauled out of their cars um being harassed being threatened um we've seen targeting of military um sorry of media installations to prevent uh which would obviously prevent the media from reporting and getting the news out so it's not just um the military risks that journalists face it's also the threats and harassment from perhaps ordinary individuals from the police and others um for doing their jobs Irene I wanted to ask you about the the challenges of uh battling uh fake information fake news if you like there's been a lot of uh concerns that major social media groups like meta that manage Facebook and Instagram have been heavily censoring Palestinian content in Arabic compared to how they deal with content in Hebrew there is this need for Freedom of Information how do you balance those two needs well uh first of all there is no full and free access to all journalists uh to Gaza or to the West Bank that in itself I think is one way in which news is being sensored there are only some sources uh that can can work there uh all journalist don't have access uh secondly I have received a lot of reports uh that uh social media platforms are taking down posts in the case of meta there was already a a a judgment uh or or a decision by its own oversight board about its disproportionate removal of Palestinian posts meta claims that it has sought to uh now improve its uh content uh uh policies content moderation policies but of course complaints still coming in and it's very hard to judge what is actually happening because all these social media platforms as you know have very opaque uh ways of managing uh content what we also know is that states uh a number of European States for example have tried to stop protest Pro Palestinian protests have tried to remove for example Palestinian uh Flags uh when when demonstrators are using it that type of censorship is of course not permissible under international law on the ground I can just only just imagine how terrible it must be for journalists who are still reporting uh for someone like while uh the tragedy that he has faced very rarely has there been such a demand on the courage and resilience of journalists on the ground but full and free access to all media should be a fundamental uh requirement in a situation like this because that's the way from diverse sources that readers would be able to make out what is propaganda and what is fact at the moment that is not being allowed by Israel there is the blockade not just in civilians not just in humanitarian aid but also on media access Jody yes you want to come in on that I wanted to come in on that to Echo that point because of the quantity of myth and disinformation we are seeing that's why it's so vital that we have a plurality of media covering this conflict it's why we're particularly concerned at the committee to protect journalists by threats to for example censor Al jazer um it is really important in this moment in time where people are finding it very difficult to know what to believe that you have a plurality of media able to report what is happening even in the face of unimaginable threats and pressure and Jody I wanted to ask you as well about journalists operating in Israel some Israeli journalists have not been able to question the actions of their country because of the atmosphere that in Israel you are either for us or against us at the moment what are you hearing about that we're hearing similar concerns that people have been threatened for asking questions that's the job of journalist and journalism is to hold power to account to ask difficult questions um It's Perfectly possible to do that and remain patriotic remain um a a a citizen of your country um and you should not be threatened or prevented from doing so um either by the government or officials or by the mob Mustafa can I ask you you you've done well you've done so many interviews with foreign media many don't speak to you until there's conflict in the Palestinian territories what are the sort of biggest challenges you face and the ignorance you sometimes come across with journalist who rarely speak to you well as you said we never looked at and never interviewed unless something is happening to Israelis I mean uh before this whole War started for eight months we've lost in West Bank 248 Palestinians including 40 children one of them was only two and a half years old we had settlers burning houses settlers burning cars attacking communities no none of these foreign journalists were here or even try to to to report about that very few if I but that's one example once an Israeli is hurt or once something happens to Israel then everybody is here that is the reality unfortunately but I want to add something about silencing others silencing the journalist silencing the people uh before this attack started we we know that there was an act of intellectual Terror being practiced by different Zionist organizations and Zionist lobbies in different countries of the world the best example of that is Germany whoever tries to say something I mean is immediately attacked by this Lobby forcing people to resign from their jobs threatening them Etc but it's now gone much worse I think the basic approach of any journalist who works professionally who doesn't belong to either side is to be balanced in their approach and uh we've just heard in the process of which hunting that is taking place against this not anybody but the Secretary General of the United Nations gues who just D to say that there is this didn't happen to a vacuum and there is occupation America United States admits there is occupation and the United States admits there are settlers but because he said that now they're witch hunting him and the foreign minister of Israel in the United Nations had the guts to say that from now on there is no place for balanced positions he's saying and that's only fascists would say that either you are on our side completely or you are on you are our enemy in addition to that let me mention very quickly a few things first of all journalists are not allowed into Gaza now no those who are there are there but journalist are in Jerusalem they would not let them go to Gaza except if they are behind the Israeli Army and if they are filled with what the Israeli Army is steing them second they are now arresting our journalist in the West Bank people who have been even people who have been interviewed uh just commentators they are arrested because they are expressing their views and then I think I think Mr D was very correct when he when he thought that the killing of his family was an act of Revenge because of what he has been doing honestly to report what's happening in Gaza okay um Irene polarized media environment is not unique to Israel of course but this level of conflict intensifies it doesn't it of course it certainly does and that is why I want to reemphasize the importance of Human Rights human rights are Universal the obligations of states to uphold human rights is also Universal there is a right to Media Freedom independent free plural diverse media and that is being denied that is being run rough shot uh by uh the Israeli authorities and and others at the moment uh some allies of Israel which I think is a very very dangerous uh precedent that has been created here and has been over the years I agree that uh attention uh to the Palestinian problem um that there's not sufficient attention Ukraine wiped out all other conflicts and now of course there's a lot of attention to the Middle East and I hope that this is not going to be a transient thing uh it has to be solved there's there are deeper root causes of this conflict that continue and the victims of that are the civilians in Gaza the the people living in the West Bank this problem has to be solved otherwise I think the International Community is only creating more problems uh for the future and Jody can I ask you about that as well the challenges of reporting in such a in such a polarized media environment it's something unfortunately we're seeing internationally it's particularly acute um in this conflict it's an environment in which people are highly personalized they highly personalized attacks so in addition to all of the physical attacks that people receive there's highly personalized attacks for those covering the conflict say from outside Gaza and the West Bank um and it's really important and I and I want to emphasize this that the job of a journalist is to go out and Report the facts what they see outside we always talk about you know our job is not to to take two views about whether it's raining it's to go outside and tell you whether it's raining or not and that's really important it's really important that we recognize that the job of journalists is to report the facts and that people should not be targeted either physically online harassed or or receive any other mistreatment for doing their jobs and Mustafa very quickly the last the last question to you but how challenging is doing Palestinian diplomacy at the moment how difficult is it to get the Palestinian voice heard it's not difficult but it's not impossible and nothing will restrain us we will keep doing whatever we can we'll keep trying to penetrate the the the this black forest of misleading information and fabrications to bring the True Light to the people to bring the truth to the people and I always say to my colleagues you need only to do one tenth of what the Israelis do because the truth is on our side and I think we should not save any moment without trying to do that because this is what could protect the lives of people who are being killed now around the clock when five when every five minutes a Palestinian is killed and every 10 minutes a Palestinian child loses his life or folks we're out of time but thank you very much for your contributions thanks to Our Guest jod Ginsburg
