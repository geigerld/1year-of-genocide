so US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says the toll of Israel's war on civilians in Gaza is far too high but he added it is vital Israel achieve its objective that October the 7th can never happen again blinkin was speaking to journalists in Tel Aviv after meeting with Israeli leaders to discuss the future of Gaza he said many Middle Eastern nations are ready to invest in gaza's future but only with a pathway to a Palestinian State many countries in the region um are really prepared to to invest in a number of ways to invest when the conflict in Gaza is over um in its reconstruction in its uh in its security supporting uh Palestinians in their in their governance but uh it is essential to them that there also be a clear pathway to uh the realization of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state now let's bring in alaz senior political analyst Marwan Bashar once again joining me on set now so Marwan first of all your impressions of what you heard there from the US Secretary State well look I mean since Muhammad uh repeated a lot of what uh the secretary has said or summarize some of his points let me just move directly to the critique of what we've heard thus far I think we've heard from three blink just now we've heard from Israel's defense lawyer we've heard from The Diplomatic spinner and we've heard from the Imperial Envoy the Imperial Emissary the defense lawyer was more of the same that we've heard three months and this is ging this is the go this is so disappointing so disappointing for the American Top Diplomat after 3 months of genocide to be repeating Israel's lies is so sad and disappointing when he said yet again when we already know that this is proving to be wrong that Hamas the militants have been firing from hospitals and schools we've heard about this the hospitals being the headquarters and we've then investigated and American Media investigated International Organization investigated all these claims that have to be mostly wrong the ones that were investigating and yet again he is there to repeat more of the same lies defending Israel when when he's asked about genocide he said meritless okay why did he read the 78 page document what is meritless in the 78 uh South African document and you cannot you cannot argue against it by saying other people are Geno Siders or genoci you know I don't know the huis for example okay if the H are genocidal what does it have to do with the Merit of the case that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza anyway so he played the defense lawyer the spinner was a bit more tricky he was asked since he just did a trip to the region he was asked about his conversations with the Arab leaders and with the Israeli and what he heard he heard he said he heard from the Arab leaders that they are interested in two- State solution and they are interested to get involved in the Reconstruction of Gaza if it's part of a serious diplomatic effort to resolve the Palestinian issue he actually said what the Arabs are thinking he then asked what does nah think about that your vision of what two State solution he said I'm in no position to speak for him what what what you just spoke for the Arab leaders all six or seven of them including the Turk leader so when it comes to the Netanyahu he ducked it he he spinned it he spun it and why did he spin it he spun it because naan disagrees Nao doesn't want the two stat solution does n does not want the Palestinian Authority he does not want to leave Gaza he does not want to leave the West Bank he want to stay occupying power and continue to settle illegally and there are many examples to the towards that but the more most important point because these are you know we've had fun with those points is America lies for Israel this has been going the case now for three months I think the most important point and this is the one we're going to be talking about for weeks months years to come it's where the Imperial talks about the integrated Regional approach that's the main message from this trip the integrated Regional approach what does that mean it simply means that he talked to all the Arab and Muslim majority leaders including turkey and the likes that he wants to bring the five six main Middle Eastern countries especially Saudi Arabia he wants Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel secretary blinkin wants to reward Israel for its genocide by having Saudi Arabia normalized relations with Israel all right in return for the promise of a Palestinian State we're going to have to leave it there for now much more on this to come Marwan thanks very much
