British prime minister Rishi sunak has met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman in the Saudi Capital Riad this is his second stop on his Middle East Tour which included a visit to Israel sunak is pushing for humanitarian Aid to be delivered into Gaza as soon as possible we also recognize that the Palestinian people are victims of Hamas too and that is why I welcome your decision yesterday that you took to sure that routs into Gaza will be opened for humanitarian Aid to enter I'm glad that you made that decision we will support it we're increasing our Aid to the region and we will look to get more support to people as quickly Al Mohamad jamj is in occupied East Jerusalem Muhammad you've been walking us through the ins and outs of this visit between sunak and uh net who now sunak is in Saudi Arabia what does he hope to achieve on this tour first and foremost sirel M prime minister sunak would like to attempt to deescalate this conflict it's one of the things that was high on his agenda in Israel it's one of the things that he's been trying behind the scenes to get some kind of guarantee from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he's not gotten any public guarantees from Netanyahu about that but he's now gone on to Saudi Arabia he is going to go we are told to Qatar and also to Turkey in addition to Rishi sunak you also have UK foreign secretary James cleverly who will be accompanying sunak on this Whirlwind Regional tour sunak wants there to be a humanitarian Corridor he wants to apply the kind of pressure that he can to use the kind of levers that he has to try to get Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree not to strike the Gaza Strip while a humanitarian Corridor is open now as far as we know it's tomorrow it's going to be the earliest that these 20 a trucks can actually get into the Gaza Strip but as you were saying just a few moments ago 20 trucks for a population of over 2 million that's just a drop in the bucket sunak would like to see more Aid getting through on a more regular basis he also wants to make sure that British citizens that are trapped inside of Gaza can utilize the of crossing and get out of Gaza and into Egypt but first and foremost even though he has continued to express solidarity with Israel he wants more humanitarian Aid going in and that's the biggest thing he's trying to accomplish right now with this Whirlwind Regional diplomacy sirel I'm Muhammad jamun reporting live from occupied East Jerusalem thank you very much for all of that and setting up the conversation we need to have with Marwan bishara uh you're back with us Marwan look on the Diplomatic front we've seen a lot of movement over the last I'd say 36 hours we saw Joe Biden in Israel we saw Rishi sunak the British prime minister in Israel now Rishi sunak in Saudi Arabia and on the other side we're seeing the King of Jordan in Egypt um I'm just wondering what are you watching what what you know for you is a Salient point that you think has material impact on the situation in Gaza going forward look I think U President Biden has paved the way for what is and is not possible today in accordance uh to to Washington's calculus and I think everyone is just trying to paint his own Corner along the way but the way has been paved by the American president the British prime minister um it saddens me to say uh is simply walking in his footsteps no more no less of course you know it's a it's tomato tomato so he's doing it with an English accent with a British accent that's all that's all it is it's more of the same Biden except with an English accent with a bit of more English um junqua you know in the sense that they would add a bit more language about humanitarian this and that but in the end of the day the parameters have been defined by Joe Biden uh prime minister sunak has no leverage whatsoever with Israel and apparently clearly nowadays with the Palestinians zero average zero leverage so all he can do is simply stress uh what President Biden did except the way he does it it somehow comes out to be a counterfeit or a fake uh a fake message because Biden delivered the original one right and now what we have is a bit of a counterfeit you European leaders trying to follow in the footstep of the American president instead of charting their own way Europe is a 500 million people continent Europe has the biggest Market in the world even bigger than China and the United States Europe is an economic power and a strategic power UK and the EU should have been able to come together within their foreign policy outfits and be able to chart a new way in Israel Palestine but they don't we have the German Chancellor doing his own song and dance and then we have the British prime Min prime minister and I think we're going to have the French President coming soon they are divided and they are weak they're not speaking in one voice even when the the the president of the European European commission came she faced criticism from Paris because she went really all the way she became more Zionist than Netanyahu so really Europe and Britain is not playing the role that should have been assigned to them that they should have assigned sign to themselves they're following in the footsteps of the United States and I think at the end of the day they are not making much difference Marwan you made me laugh with the tomato tomato line I'm not against a brief moment of levity in this war so so thanks for that but more seriously um what about diplomacy among the Arab Nations because the question of the Arab support for Palestinians what they're actually willing to do for Palestinians is one that has been enduring and that goes right back to the beginning the Israeli Palestinian conflict so what do you make of that you know the fact that um the Jordanian Egyptian and the Palestinian leaders have basically cancelled uh the summit with Biden that was in and by itself a kind of a huge step forward for them right they even shocked the Arab public opinion I don't know if you remember but one hour before they did that I was speaking on aler here and I was saying you know if they really had the guts that's what they need to do they need to walk out they need to threaten to boycott because if they do you know they could at least maybe try to impose a ceasefire well anyway they did they did not get a ceasefire but certainly it was a progress for them but since then they have condemned uh Israel's bombardment and its bombing of the hospital that's also you know important because these countries have normalized relations with Israel Egypt and Jordan a long time ago way before the Abraham Accords but even countries that have uh normalized relations and they were supposed to normalized relations they are also condemning Israel so we have a bit of a you know change of tone change of policy because of the heat because of the pressure of the Arab public opinion we've we've seen the streets and the squares of the Arab world erupt in protest against Israel and uh and America support so I think we have now the beginning of an Arab diplomacy to try and somehow deal with the crisis without being overly embarrassed without being totally irrelevant without facing more pressure from the Arab state but when you when you focus on the details if you heard for example president Cece's uh press conference yesterday and the way he talked about um we don't want the Palestinians to come to siai that's a good thing but he said something about you know take them to the neg desert in the South Israel and then take them back to Gaza you know I mean the you expect the Egyptian president to say we cannot take them in Egypt they should go back to to Southern Israel right because they are mostly refugees from Southern Israel so in detail it's a bit problematic but in the overall there is progress in The Stance of Arab leaders Vis the Palestinian questions as if they have awakened okay that's really interesting uh thank you for that we'll have to keep watching that space then Maran bishara joining us from London in this hour thank you very much Marwan
