basm Nim he's a member of hamas's political Bureau thank you for joining the program what is the situation at alifa hospital as you understand it according to the Israeli military they say they dozens of Hamas militants have been killed there and taken for others have been taken for questioning is this true thank you very much uh the situation in shifa hospital is very very serious very very dangerous uh we are used to hear this Israeli propaganda uh by the presence of Hamas Fighters or militant people inside the hospital uh I can reassure everyone and confirm that no militant people inside the hospital are present uh they have executed in the field hundreds of our people including innocent civilians some of our Fighters killed around the hospital while they are facing the new Invasion to the hospital I think the the most important Point here is not is not about how many they have killed only but that they are repeatedly invading or storming uh Health Facilities destroying the hospitals destroying the shelters of thousands of Palestinians during the holy month of Ramadan hundreds of them were kidnapped including elderly uh miners uh most of the medical stuff has been taking hostages by the Israeli interrogated some of them executed in the field well the Israelis say the reason that they are uh attacking alifa is because they believe that they Hamas operatives within the hospital so you are denying the fact that they are that they are no Hamas operatives inside the hospital or the hospital compound yes I deny this because yesterday they have talked about uh AB who was killed inside the hospital he is the chief commander of the police civil police who was all the time coordinating with the UN bodies Ona wfpa how to organize the income of the of the humanitarian aid from the south to the north and this is well known everywhere and we are talking about a civil police they have announced that they have killed an a commander of Hamas if you consider an a doctor or a nurse or a police because he is working in the government led by Hamas he is uh this is an execuse to execute him or to kill him this is another story but we are talking about people who are members of the government doctors nurses medical staff police staff who are taking care of the shelters who are organizing the humanitarian aid but some of our Fighters killed outside the hospital again while they were trying to resist the occupation or the invasion of the hospital again okay so so just to be clear these reports that we have been getting about ongoing Fierce fighting that is taking place between Hammer Fighters and the Israeli Army you're saying that is outside the hospital sure I have seen the video distributed by Alan Brigade this evening I know the area very well I was the minister of health and I was a doctor in hospital this is at least 150 to 200 M outside the hospital yes I can expect that there is a resistance but this is the natural response of our people to defend our hospitals our innocent people our shelters but no military presence inside the hospitals and I think Al jazer have months ago reported about the plans of the Israelis to invade H the shifa hospital and after weeks of search and destruction inside the hospital they were not able to to show any proof of a military existence in the hospital and Mr name can I ask when you look at the level of Destruction in Gaza the number of Palestinians that have been killed the number of children that have died or are starving at what point does Hamas go okay enough is enough we will find a way to end the war and end the suffering of gaza's people two things first of all I think uh the international uh justice court of justice have clearly defined what's happening there it is a genocide this is not the V this is not the the fault or the mistake or the crime of the victims that they have resisted they that they are looking for freedom and dignity this is a clear uh the responsibility of the occupying power which is Israel that they are clearly violating all international law that they are rejecting the international will of the UN of the icg on the other hand yes we have proposed in the last few days a very rational uh proposal to reach a ceasefire to end this aggression against our people which was braised by the mediators including also by the Americans what was the respon from the Israeli side they have uh until now they we haven't received an official response but all the signals we have received from the technical uh team in Doha today is very very disappointed it is clearly signaling that Netanyahu is using the negotiations as to G to gain more time to implement his plans to uh continue the aggressions the crimes against the hospitals and maybe to uh invade ra during or after Ramadan okay I appreciate your time basm Nim a member of hamas's political Bureau speaking to us there please
