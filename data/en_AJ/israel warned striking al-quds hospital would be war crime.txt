well since the War Began on October the 7th Israel's bombing campaign across Gaza has killed 805 Palestinians that's according to the health Ministry 114 people have been killed in the occupied West Bank in nearly three weeks and two Palestinian prisoners died in Israeli custody Israel says that was due to natural causes the Israeli government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's attack three weeks ago Let's uh bring in Kenneth rth now he is the former Executive Director of Human Rights Watch and a visiting professor at Princeton University joins us from New York welcome to the program so put simply how would you describe what's happening across Gaza at the moment well I think we very likely have war crimes being committed um we obviously had war crimes to start this all off with Hamas slaughtering Israeli civilians and abducting them and firing weapons indiscriminately into civilian populated areas but we know that under International humanitarian law war crimes by one side do not justify war crimes by the other each side has an independent obligation to respect the laws of war and we see Israel violating them I think most recently if we look at what's happening with A's hospital um even if there is some Hamas facility underneath and we don't even know that you know Israel made a a similar allegation regarding alifa which must n but when you have 14,000 people in the hospital many in critical situations where they can't be moved um an evacuation order doesn't suffice and it's wrong to suggest that you know whatever military Advantage comes from hitting the supposed Hamas facility underneath would justify the wholly disproportionate harm to civilians so that's an example of violating the rule against um disproportionate attacks that that harmed the civilian population you know we similarly are seeing indiscriminate attacks entire neighborhoods being flattened and you know Kem Khan was just in Egypt um on the the Gaza border he's the international criminal court prosecutor um what's interesting he's been pretty much aall until now but suddenly he's revived and he says blocking Aid in essence is a war crime he didn't put it in explicitly those terms but he essentially is saying I've got an active investigation it violates humanitarian not to allow Aid to the civilian population and he's basically threatening Israel with war crimes charges as he reiterated that homas is actions were war on so um there has been some movement now in terms of um finally the international criminal court make clear that there might be some accountability for this complete flouting of international humanitarian law by both sides as you alluded to there how important is it to note that the rules of law here are uh non-reciprocal meaning they apply irrespective of what each side may have done well that's essential because I mean if you just think about in any War their passions on both sides you know day one typically one side is accusing the other of war crimes now you know in this case we know war crimes did launch this this latest exchange on October 7th what Hamas did was you know blatant war crimes but that's not the end of the matter you know if if um if that were enough to then justify Israeli war crimes you would have no laws of war no humanitarian law and virtually any conflict so these are non-reciprocal obligations they are absolute obl obligations on each party so it's not enough for Israel to say oh we have a right to to defend ourselves you know we have a right to respond to Hamas sure but that does not mean a right to ignore International humanitarian law and you know Biden to his credit said that today after his conversation with Netanyahu um he didn't go so far as to say and you're violating those laws but you know you could read between the lines that clearly is happening but it was good to see Biden conditioning his you know traditional statement Israel has a right to respond a right to defend itself with an absolute requirement that that defense be in compliance with humanitarian law which of course it is not given what you say then how important is it to document uh events for the future however difficult that might be uh during a conflict situation it's essential to do that but you know there are always incidents that stand out I mean the blocking of humanitarian Aid is is n a complicated thing to document everybody can see that you know going back in time the settlements in the West Bank are violations of of the laws of war they violate article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which say that an occupying power cannot transfer its population to occupi territory so that's a simple War crime if you look at the bombing I mean I was struck the other day when I learned that um Israel had bombed the Islamic University of Gaza ostensibly because it was training Hamas intelligence operators you know by that logic you know my University Princeton could be bombed because some of the students go on to work at the CIA I mean that's crazy that's not what the laws of war require so I think that while you know clearly we want to document as much as we can it sometimes is difficult in the exchanges of War to look at every single case but certain ones stand out where there just is no justification and those are situations where the international criminal court prosecutor clearly should be concentrating his attention and moving as expeditiously as possible to issue war crimes charges because once that happens once people realize that there are criminal consequences to this conduct it's more likely to stop Kenneth Roth thank you very much indeed for your insights here on Al jaaz today thank you for having me
