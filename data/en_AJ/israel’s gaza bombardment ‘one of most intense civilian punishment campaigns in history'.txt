okay now Robert Pate is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and he's the director of the Chicago project on security and threats and he's joining us live now from Chicago Robert Pape thank you very much for being with us uh on Al jazer you have written you've studied extensively on the issue of coercive bombing uh what is it and do you believe that it applies in what we're seeing happening in Gaza at the moment uh yes um I've studied every strategic Bond campaign since World War I um and we and I've studied them not just in terms of how bombs go on targets but in terms of the relative intensity of Civilian punishment and what I can tell you is that Israel's uh bombing campaign is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history already today uh after two months uh nearly 19,000 civilians have been killed in Gaza that's about 1% of the two million people who live in Gaza by that standard 1% that already puts this uh bombing campaign in the top one top 25% of all bombing campaigns in history in terms of Civilian damage uh and so what we are seeing today is not just simply a um absolute humanitarian catastrophe occurring we are seeing one of the most intense civilian bombing campaigns in history and the coercive element I mean I I saw something you wrote earlier in the week about the history of attempts to get people to switch sides by bombing them both uh in Britain uh the Britain's the the British uh Royal Air Force doing it to the Germans unsuccessful in in both instances are you saying that there is an attempt to do that here as well that the Israeli want people to give up support for Hamas well we don't actually have the inside documents on exactly what the thinking of the Israeli leaders are at the moment uh however what we do know is throughout history when we have seen these levels of intense civilian bombing campaigns leaders have routinely thought that this would lead to a shattering of the civilian morale in favor of the enemy or it would lead to a u Rising that would topple the enemy government uh and this has never panned out in history uh but it doesn't stop the attacker from holding out hope that this um these intense civilian bombing campaigns will reach a point where you break the back of Civilian support for the enemy and what we're seeing here just in the again the last several months is actually the opposite of that hope uh we are seeing the normal coercive failure of CI intense civilian bombing because that civilian bombing is not leading to a loss of support for Hamas inside of the Palestinian people uh but we now know that support for Hamas has tripled from 25% of Palestinians before um uh October 7th to now today 75% of Palestinians support Hamas and this is unfortunately increasing support for the terrorist group not diminishing it and basically is a counterproductive outcome of this massive effort against civilians and where does such a campaign stand in terms of the laws of War uh I mean is coercive bombing something that as you say we saw in World War II and in other conflicts does it in any way uh align with with any laws of war well the attackers always claim whether it was AER Americans or the British bombing German cities in World War II or the Israelis today that they have uh rules like they drop leaflets to try to warn the civilians to uh to run away but in fact after the conflicts history does not remember these as highly selective what it remembers these bombing campaigns as is indiscriminate and in this particular case uh what Israel is doing is arguing that so long as they can find any reason whatsoever or the existence of a Hamas fighter a Hamas leader then that in their mind seems to justify virtually infinite amounts of damage on the uh Palestinian population because they're dropping bombs that might try to kill one Hamas fighter that pancake entire buildings or entire neighborhoods uh killing hundreds in the process of trying to attack one fighter well this is something that um uh the American Air Forces and even the Israeli Air Forces up until now uh they have been very very very loathed to do because this is the very definition of disproportionate uh indiscriminate bombing which is why President Biden himself is calling this indiscriminate bombing indeed Robert P from Chicago thank you very much for joining us now
