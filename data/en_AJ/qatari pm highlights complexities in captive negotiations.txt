bata's prime minister says there have been false reports on negotiations to release Israeli captives in Gaza the comments were made following talks with France's foreign minister our correspondent Muhammad Val is following that meeting in Doha and uh what more can you tell us about these false reports around hostage negotiations right uh but there was a question about this put to the uh spokesman of the foreign Ministry and he uh did not elaborate he did not give the details or mention any instances of these reports but he said that that's not important the type of reports or leaks that have been uh spread around is not important but what is important is that any leak any leak about these negotiations regarding the release of the hostages or so-called hostages others called them prisoners is harmful to that cause and should only delay the results that are uh being looked for but around this uh this question and the discussion about it it's very clear that the two ministers in this press conference were talking two different languages the the foreign minister uh French foreign minister insisted on that Mantra of condemnation she started with a strong condemnation of what happened on October 7 and talked about the the need for immediate and total release of the uh of the of the hostages she talked about also the need to to make every think possible to prevent an escalation or a widening or a spreading of the conflict in the region so those are apparently the most important points that she insisted on we know that the negotiations uh understandably were talking about something else something else has been negotiated in terms of what the Israelis want and what the the other side want Hamas wants and so on but that's not that hasn't been explained in this press what has been talked about is these generalities but on the katari side we see a different language different priorities the katari foreign minister insisted on immediate ceasefire lasting ceasefire and also the opening of the Rafa Crossing and the channeling of humanitarian Aid not only uh on a limited scale but a permanent in a permanent manner so that those civilians in Gaza could be could be helped so I mean there there is certainly this role of Qatar and uh regarding the regarding the negotiations over the hostages and so on and that apparently that is the subject and the the the the the the the the goal of these discussions here between the French and the kataris but the generalities are what have been talked about in the press the need for those points to be discussed and they are being discussed and the two sides seem to be in agreement that civilians should be spared should not be killed the French foreign minister talked about that but she she did not condemn the killing of 10,000 civilians in Gaza didn't talk about indiscriminate killing by the Israeli side she was very soft on the Israeli side and very strong on Hamas okay thank you so much for that that's Muhammad Val for us in Doha
