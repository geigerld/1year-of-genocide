hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question after months of death and destruction in Gaza how much room will there be for diplomacy between Palestinians and Israelis let's get to the bottom line in terms of the killing of innocent civilians Israel's war on Gaza has shocked the world and outpaced most if not all conflict zones in the 21st century worse than some of the deadliest moments of the US war in Iraq and the US battle against Isis in raqa Syria now most of the 2.3 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been displaced food is in limited Supply and most hospitals have been destroyed Israel says it's responding to the attack of Hamas on Israel in October that killed hundreds of Israeli soldiers and civilians and trying to make sure that Hamas can't wage an attack like that ever again but is it strategy which has the backing of its Patron superpower the United States really working and what happens when the fighting ends and the Palestinians and Israelis have to find a way to live together as neighbors all over again today we're talking with David from former speech writer and assistant to President George W bush currently a writer at the Atlantic magazine and most recently the author of trump apocalypse restoring American democracy David thank you so much for joining us today look this is a painful and horrible subject which we have all the eyeballs in the world are watching October 7th you know precipitated a response from Israel that brought the Israeli left and right together in response to BAS basically eradicate uh Hamas and I was caught by your a tweet thread that you tweeted out that began to look at beyond the whr what do we do when the conflict ends and there is the day after tell us what you think are the important features of the day after we need to think about I start with this as in this matter as a strong supporter of Israel and a strong uh support of the US Israeli relationship um like many American Jews I have family on the front lines and one of my relatives the second cousin is is in captivity as you and I speak um he is being he is a prisoner of of Hamas and probably has been exposed to considerable abuse um so we all have a lot of heart in this story but we also need our heads because every war must end major combat operations in Gaza will end um I expect and I hope that they will end with um tremendous damage to the command structure of Hamas but that will as you say leave behind millions of people and mountains of rubble um how do those people survive how do they eat what what happens next and how do you come up with some kind of security regimen um to make sure that uh peace is restored and that people can go about their lives so um there have been a number of ideas floated and that's where you and I began our conversation could Israel reoccupy Gaza that seems utterly unworkable will an international force of some kind arrive in Gaza I don't think you're going to find many Europeans willing to do that because of the risk of being exposed to terrorist attack uh from whatever remains of of Hamas or other kinds of uh successor groups um could uh a confederation of Arab governments uh do it well you know better than I how little cooperation there is between Arab governments how much disagreement could the United Nations step in well they have utterly discredited themselves they have acted as fronts for Hamas um through their Refugee organizations there's uh there's only one security keeper you can imagine having legitimacy and success and that is some kind of revived Palestinian Authority the world has to find a way revived and improve Palestinian Authority to re-enter Gaza and assume the responsibilities of governance there now the Palestine Authority was set up as a temporary transitional authority to move towards a two-state solution it came as a result of the Oslo Accords there are others like Salam fad whom I've interviewed recently who think the PA has lost its legitimacy lost it role because of the failure to deliver and thus you need to even go back to the precursor to that the PLO and find a new way to get legitimacy so I find your suggestion really interesting because are you saying that you can restore the Palestinian Authority and detach it from a two-state horizon um I think sometimes I I worry in the Middle East a lot about solutionism that um you have a a vision of a solution and uh you uh then judge yourself by how whether you're moving toward that solution when you have an immediate problem I I I'm looking at the present not the future um and just to our audience you you're worried about housing Water Systems you know the even most basic necessities which you lay out in pretty graphic detail in your tweets about really the horrors ahead yes there and after previous rounds of violence between Israel and Hamas um there uh 2014 being the most recent big one um there have there has been a lot of International Investment to rebuild Gaza I think um people and especially Friends of the Palestinians need to be aware that International Aid is not likely to be forthcoming in the way it was before because it went into tunnels it went into tunnels so explain to a German taxpayer explain to an American taxpayer explain to explain even to people in the Persian Gulf right how how do you justify writing checks for hundreds of millions of dollars given the history of past abuse so there will be emergency aid humanitarian aid but it will be much more modest um and so there are solutions that are going to have to come from Gaza um there also are going to have to be and I I understand you've talked to John Bolton about this there's going to have to be some kind of way that people in the Gaza Strip can exit uh to go find work uh in play and send remittances home and one of the roles that Persian Gulf governments can have is that they can offer um work permits to people willing to to try their hands so they can earn a living because the aid is not going to flow the way it used to do do you see an end of work permits for Palestinians in Israel because a lot of the transfer payments and the economic activity ity of both the West Bank and Gaza was tied to the Israeli economy and it really begs a question will Israel play a role in rebuilding Gaza um we H look someday this has to be an economic unit someday it has to be possible to get on a train in Cairo and get off the train in Damascus with a stop in Jerusalem in between and all I this this area is too small for so for so many borders and so much antagonism um but I don't think I don't think anytime soon there's going to be a lot of movement from Gaza into Israel um that trust has been forfeited um people because even though the number of people who did the violence is finite they do seem to have had a lot of information from people who were trusted so the trust will be hard to restore um maybe you can you can imagine some gsin if they check out finding work permits in the West Bank but don't look for that border between Gaza and Israel to be reopened anytime soon so they're going to have to find work somewhere else because the aid isn't going to flow the way it used to do where can they go um they're going to be tremendous labor shortages in um in the Gulf States um some will be able to go to E Egypt and as I said this we're talking here about remittances we're not talking about necessarily relocating whole families many of the receiving governments will be reluctant uh but if you say look here here's a group of 100 um working age men who are looking for a 24mon work permit so they can earn a living and send money home to their families I hope the region and they speak your language I hope the region will be open open to all of that but what the place is going to look like it's not people are not going to are not going to have homes to go back to or many people will not have homes to go back to and the water systems are damaged and the electricity grids are broken um and it will take a long time to restore them and the resources for that will be coming from inside Gaza not So Much from the outside world anymore as you look at things now and I've I've interviewed a lot of friends of Israel on this show um a lot of military experts generals General Petraeus others who've said Hamas what's not understood is Hamas is not a body of individual ual and people it's an ideology and the notion that it can be eradicated through this activity is mistaken we even had the defense secretary Lou Austin saying Israel risks strategic defeat in the course that is going now so my question to you and I know it's it's complicated is Israel doing the wrong thing at this moment to achieve its objectives of undermining Hamas and creating a different picture I'm not a military expert of any kind I have no idea what I would also say is it's maybe the wrong question because there are things that societies are going to do that are inevitable um when Hamas launched the October 7th attack attacks in such an atrocious way it did so knowing that no Democratic Society could fail to respond in a correspondingly large way um it was inevitable that Israel would respond in this way it was intended there was and and it just isn't that's how democracies react when people commit such heinous atrocities against so many of their citizens especially targeting women and children in the way that Hamas did um what will happen though when the major combat operations come to an end as they soon will politics in Israel will begin to resume um and there will what will that look like you think uh well that will look like is people demands in the street for accountability for net uh to depart uh you know questions about the security establishment um the uh so there will be a reckoning there will be a reckoning and there there are going to be all kinds of other interesting shifts some people are going to be one of the major things that happen inside Israel uh during this conflict was um a surge of support uh for the state from Palestinian Israelis uh Arab Israelis um you saw these polls it showed an an interest a rise in identification with the state now some will say that was driven by fear more than loyalty um but there has certainly been no reaction within Israel of any kind of security threats from uh Palestinian Arabs who have Israeli passports I I know a lot of Israeli Israelis Jews and Arabs who say what did they get from that where were the demonstrations of appreciation for loyalty to the state that's going to be a major divide meanwhile there were all kinds of settlers who in Israel's Jewish settlers in the West Bank who in Israel's hour of need intensified conflict with their Arab neighbors as if to open up yet one more front at exactly the time when that front was least needed so there will be disputes there I me a lot of people are very very worried about the West Bank right now um as an as a as an escalation about settler provocations there um you and I both in been in recent meetings where I think some government officials feel confidence that that is going to somehow be controlled and and reeled in by the Israeli government but do you have that confidence because that's one area where I worry what are the blind spots we're not seeing right now and if that conflation were to hit the West Bank you know what what that that would be really um disturbing escalation of this I don't see this a prediction you said what does politics look like so one of the issues in politics will be what happens to net Yahoo one of the issues in politics will be who is to blame for this security and intelligence failure and another issue in politics will be those who say we owe something to the Israeli Arabs and those who say no we owe protection to the settlers and those two groups within Israeli Society will argue intensely and um uh there I think there's going to be a reckoning as well with the um role of the of the ultra religious um there has been an effort to pull the ultra religious in into the military Israel security needs after this war will be greater because Israel will have to watch not only uh the north where it always watches not only Gaza it will have to have an eye to other kinds of regional threats the idea that there's this large group of people who exempt themselves from the normal responsibilities of citizenship because of their Ultra religiosity that's going to be questioned so you're going to have a lot of politics in inside Israel I have no idea how it will work itself out um but the idea that there is an Israel I mean Israel has been United in its reaction against Hamas but there these other questions and there will be important debates and one of the things the people watch this program one of the things that um they need to bear in mind is their own agency in all of this the signals that Israel gets from its neighbors um the signals that Israel gets from the region Israel gets from the region will be will also have important effect um if we can move toward resumption of normalization with Persian Gulf countries especially Saudi Arabia that opens more space for a less fearful Israel to behave in ways that empower the most generous elements in Israeli Society if Israelis feel feel more fearful you empower the least generous elements in Israeli Society you don't call for a two-state solution in that case which some some are saying may be dead some are saying is the only option but as you think about what you just said about taking pressure off Israel decreasing the toxicity of the moment looking at a Saudi normalization would do you see an opportunity there um again I want to warn against solutionism I just think you need to take one one step at a time um and I think all of those hopes that were felt so intensely in the 1990s they are so much farther away than they were but there are things that you can do today um and I would emphasize as I did in that tweet um dignity for Arab citizens of Israel um respect equality um and having a vision of at least there has to be someday economic integr from The River To The Sea economic integration um you know and beyond the river to the Sea economic integration um as for the Saudis I the Biden Administration may be kidding itself on the speed at which this is happening because the Saudis I think have indicated they want to play in American politics they want to help Republicans they want to help Donald Trump they want to hurt Joe Biden I find it hard to imagine that they would hand such a major diplomatic Victory to President Biden in 2024 perhaps if President Biden wins re-election and they have to deal with him in 2025 it will happen then I would uh October 7th no October 7th I would not have expected a breakthrough in the coming year um but the Saudis want it for their own purposes the whole region has to be demilitarized has to be normalized and so long as there's animosity toward Israel this will never be a normal region of the world and the economic prospects the Saudis imagine the Saudi leadership imagines they Envision a Economic Development social normalization within an author Arian political context well it's hard to do that it's hard to maintain the authoritarian politics and the normal economy at a time of intense competition with with this with with your neighbors in order to make that formula work and it's a tough formula uh you need peace how would Donald Trump have managed this differently you believe than than Joe Biden Joe Biden is suffering in the polls in part because of antipathy among young Democrats about um how he's dealing with Israel Palestine right now now and what they see as being Joe Biden is being more pro-israel than they're comfortable with would it be ironic that that Joe Biden loses the election because of that loss of support to Donald Trump over this crisis um Donald uh I don't believe that that really will happen um and I think that when you look more closely at those polls you see Biden also confronts people to his right Democrats to his right um who say he has not done enough um and uh the people who are most angry at Biden about is about his support for Israel are those who are the least likely to vote you know one of the questions that they ask these young people is did you vote in 20120 and among those who said no they did not vote in 2020 they are much more likely to be on the prop Palestinian side than among those who did so if you're a professional politician say if you don't vote I'm I I'm interested in your opinion as a fellow citizen but you don't matter you don't matter uh the people who vote they matter uh how would Donald Trump have handled this it's unpredictable I mean you know Trump resp responds to very personal economic incentives um the Saudis have enriched his family and since he left office they've enriched his family even more so I think his first call would be to them he is very interested in some of the most reactionary elements in Israeli Society he would have listened to them um but because no one should ever feel secure about any possible response it is very possible that Donald Trump would have done something radically Unthinkable um and with with Biden I've spoken to diplomats from the region and they have said they missed Trump because with Trump if you paid the right people uh you could have a highway to the very innermost Circle and then the president could you could Prevail on him if you got him in the right mood he might whereas with the Biden people there's always all this process there's this bureaucracy um they're very concerned with being consistent it's very difficult to work with them but you know what predictability is good and and Biden has that Biden is Biden is the most predictable politician probably in the United States if not the world well let me ask you about um one of the things that's beginning to Bo is some states and maybe this is a you know copout with some of the hardcore Necessities you're talking about the day after in Gaza some states are talking about recognizing uh Palestinian statehood you've got Obama officials beginning to write New York Times Obed saying hey we need to recognize Palestine as a state does that help get us anywhere no it's just just I mean think of yourself living on a street in Gaza you've lost whatever home you had um there's there's no potable water you're drinking water that's maybe going to make your kids sick um you know there's uh there's electricity unevenly fluctuating you're terrorized by these gunmen who uh they bombs going off and the idea that somebody you've never met gets to drive to the UN in a big car with a flag on the hood H how you need water you need drinking water and you need it right now you need the power to be on you need the bombs to stop going off you need the gunmen to be sent away and then you need to have some hope that the working age men in your family can earn some kind of living and get some kind of money to put a roof back over your head there are ruminations that Iran may have a breakout year next year that it may uh in fact became a fully-fledged 10th major nuclear power in the world violating nonproliferation agreements Etc but it will be there it will be out there as you look back at that and you know part of the issue here is to what degree are we looking at a proxy conflict between different parts of the Middle East the the Iranians versus us and the Saudis and and and maybe it is a a mistake to look at in that way but it does talk about what comes next in the region and how it could get much much worse and more complex particularly for us interests well when President Obama negotiated the agreement with Iran I criticized it because I said the benefits to Iran are at the front of the deal and the burdens to Iran are on the back of the deal who negotiated this when President Trump then said I want to cancel the deal I said you can't cancel the deal because the benefits to Iran are already paid that the problem with the deal is the thing that also makes it dangerous to C cancel the benefits are front-loaded the obligations are backloaded so once the deal has been unfortunately signed you don't want to blow it up because that's then you blow up your hope of getting your part of the deal which is all in the back end but they did blow it up and then here here we are um uh I I I think that the IR that if the Iranians take these actions not understanding the potential for violence in 2024 um that uh you you're having you have an Israel that has lost many inhibitions because of the October 7th attack um you have American resources that have been redirected into the region because of the October 7th attack you have a new solidarity between the United States and Israel for all the talk you see in the papers about criticism um my memory stretches back to 73 and even as a boy to The Six Day War never never has the United States given Israel as much security permission as it's given now this war is soon going to be in at the three-month Mark of intense military action intense violence that didn't H in 1982 when Israel went into Lebanon after the PLO they did not get three months of per per in 1973 Israel did not get 3 months of permission Israel has 3 months of permission and not only from the United States but from Great Britain and the European Union as well Israel has never been allowed this much scope to act and if I were the Iranians I would take that scope extremely seriously and just finally David I'm I'm interested in you know where this all goes and I and I want to respect the fact that you you're you know post to solutionism and and Grand plans but what you've laid out for the Palestinian Authority the responsibilities and the burden it's going to have to govern in really a horrible postmodern situation with millions of people um is there a way to think about this again to get the Palestinians to be supportive of what you're suggesting that this may One Day lead to an end to the occupation um I look for Hope to the Irish model um so the way peace arrived in Northern Ireland was there was this intense conflict with all kinds of cultural and historic loyalties and the Good Friday Accords created a dynamic whereby if you were a Protestant British citizen living in Northern Ireland you could have a British passport and if you were a Catholic uh British citizen living in Northern Ireland you could have an Irish passport if you wanted to think of yourself as British you could if you wanted to think of yourself as Irish you could and then the border between northern and southern Ireland as long as went away as long as Britain remained in the European Union and you had this moment where the identity you carry in your head and on your papers could be blurred into the identity that existed in legal reality so I I Look to that I mean when I imagine what could the Middle East look like I mean it I would look to a world in which the Jews were citizens of Israel and they might live next door to somebody who's a citizen of Palestine and maybe they voted for different mayors in different lists U but there was one economic in uh unit that traded freely with other elements in the region that the way the solution to this problem is to make the borders matter less and to make individual identities and individual loyalties less connected to legal and Sovereign structures um putting National boundaries into the Middle East has not brought peace since the end of the Ottoman Empire so uh obviously the Ottomans aren't coming back but that kind of borderless space that existed while the Ottomans were there that is what the Middle East is going to have to be if it's going to live in any kind of piece well writer and commentator David from I really appreciate you joining us today thank you so much thank you Steve always a pleasure to talk so what's the bottom line the outrage created by the war on Gaza is going to last for Generations in the Middle East and all around the world at the same time the Gaza Strip is going to have to be rebuilt sooner or later after all this death and destruction wrought by Israel has it invalidated itself from governing Gaza and the Palestinians us officials say the Palestinian Authority is quote the only show in town as impotent as it may appear now so will anyone really suddenly help create a reborn cleaned up Palestinian Authority with greater resources power and support from all parties particularly the us but also Israel and the Arab neighborhood and has anyone bothered to ask the Palestinian people what they'd like to have it still looks like there are zero Alternatives out there and that's exactly why the International Community needs to focus on what can be done rather than what can't and that's the bottom line [Music]
