we'll turn back to the United States now the situation there and there's growing pressure against the Biden Administration to hold Israel accountable we'll now speak to Lise de who's a human rights lawyer she's joining us uh from New York Lise de good to have you with us in Al jazer thanks for your time so Ezra is saying you're an attorney and you recently said that you and others have filed a quote notice and demand with us members of Congress that they will be prosecuted in criminal court for the US's role in war on Gaza I wonder if you can just elaborate on that a little bit and tell us what this notice in deband actually means certainly first of all I think it's important that people understand that genocide constitutes the highest crime punishable under the Geneva conventions and under the Rome statute and it is not Just for participating in a genocide but for aiding abetting and inciting genocide and the Geneva Convention also maintains that governments who adopt the convention on genocide are to legislate against it and what we've been seeing in the US is clearly now as we're hearing reports of us boots on the ground inside and even before whether it was diplomatic cover political and financial cover and support as well as incitement quite frankly um all of these are punishable under the Rome statute and countries all over the world have in fact adopted by way of universal jurisdiction um these laws into their home uh their home country's laws their National laws and so the prosecution uh whether it's criminal or civil um or otherwise uh is available uh to people who do want to bring them outside of the us. and not just in the IC this demand actually was inspired by a colleague of mine ra J Who noted that that this we drafted it in advance of the vote on the military aid package um to Israel and it was our hope that it would have some sort of impact in advance of that clearly that was not the case um nonetheless we do believe that these efforts now moving forward for Palestine and for other situations um should be a powerful notice um of what lies ahead for people who continue to breach the uh Geneva conventions and the Rome statutes I mean what impact do you do you think this will actually have lamise de because up until now what we see uh coming out of the US is only six out of the 535 members of uh the uh American Congress have actually endorsed the ceasefire and we also see that uh the silencing that's going on of the only Palestinian congresswoman Rashid who's in Congress so it really sounds like it's a tough road ahead to change um minds and attitudes in the US isn't it yeah I I think you're absolutely right I think nonetheless what we saw almost immediately was a shift in discourse that people were being more cognizant especially after journalists had raised um the notice and demand letter during the state department press briefings do we think that it will change you as policy and their their sense that they are completely immune no not in the immediate future not at this very moment um I do want to just add that neither public nor private uh officials and persons are immune under the J conventions and the Rome statute for aiding abetting and inciting genocide by the way so while it will take some time we are certain it will take some time to actually see results um we do expect to see results if not in the US so certainly we don't expect to see results in the US but outside of the US I think that's number one I think number two it is making people think just a little bit U more than they would and and feel a sense of accountability and number three I think it's a powerful political and legal messaging Palestinians have been begging the international order and the UN for 75 years to implement Law and Order and I think the notion that people are aware that we can begin taking some modum of accountability and Law and Order into our own hands has really mobilized what is a mushrooming force in support of this work from investigators forensics um to plaintiffs to jurisdictions to jurists and lawyers truly all over the world who are preparing for this work we are very hopeful about the outcomes yeah I mean do you do you um do you think that there will be accountability and justice for the Palestinians because as you've said they've gone to International bodies and institutions and these places are are put they're supposed to sort of prevent atrocities from taking place and they're supposed to prevent war crimes and genocide but but they have failed to do so when it comes to the Palestinians yeah I our hopes do not lie in in the international institutions themselves but in third state jurisdictions and other courts where Law and Order is more uh effectively and meaningfully implemented at least as regards these issues we do expect to see some progress and we're not just basing it on universal jurisdiction and international humanitarian law that is one body of Law and one aspect that we are pursuing but rather we are also looking at dual Nationals at transactions at Financial assets at Transmissions media transmissions and otherwise that are happening across the world passing state lines and therefore likely subject to various regulatory governmental administrative laws which are being violated um at this moment and which might be subject to some type of legal action by the third state governments so actually we are hopeful we have been assessing this um we don't think it's a lost cause at this point certainly the international forums from the ICC and if somebody were to bring before the icj and the UN have not only failed the Palestinian people but I would go further and say that they have explicitly betrayed them um especially given the US's veto power at the at the UN Security Council we are hopeful that we have many friendly governments um across the world who are willing to take that next step and bring some justice some accountability and therefore disincentivize this from further not just inside Palestine but for other people in the future all right we thank you so much l de for joining us from New York thank you
