show you the latest pictures uh from looking into Gaza at this point in time as we've seen for the last several months huge plumes of smoke Rising above the strip but they have been particularly intense in the last 24 hours or so as we mentioned at least 240 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza and that is since Monday and uh the latest uh deadly strikes targeted the Palestinian red cresant building where thousands of people were shot touring well for a greater idea of exactly what it is like within Gaza we're going to go to sha Casey who is an emergency medical team's coordinator at the World Health Organization he has been at elifa and El AXA hospitals in Gaza in recent days thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us uh Sean we know you must be incredibly busy first of all in terms of hospitals can you just give us a bit of an update a situation update on what the conditions are like in those hospitals that you have seen certainly and thanks for having me the situation in the hospitals is quite dire at the moment uh gaza's hospitals are functioning at about 20% of their pre-war capacity um and at the same time they're terribly overwhelmed with PA so many hospitals have closed completely many health workers have been displaced uh and as was just described hospitals like Naser European Gaza hospital and alifa the few hospitals that are still partially functioning or minimally functioning uh are seeing huge numbers of casualties come in almost around the clock so uh at Naser medical complex which your your colleague was reporting on even prior to the hostilities in the last few days they were having a constant flow of trauma cases coming in all day around the clock and there's there was already a huge number of idps on site and many of the staff have had to flee unfortunately so um they're operating at lower capacity with higher numbers of patients and and seeing serious injuries um blast injuries gunshot wounds uh that require a lot of attention and a lot of stuff and of course people uh pulled from from the rubble uh as well after air strikes we've mentioned uh the Israeli bomb bombing has really stepped up in the last few days I mean even since the United Nations security Council passed that resolution I mean have you seen any difference uh since that was past or have things simply gotten worse over the last 4 hours or so it's been a horrible situation for 80 days or so now and we've seen uh continuing hostilities in the last couple of days last night there was a lot of fire north of Rafa where I am uh as your colleague was mentioning in the hunus area um and we saw yesterday I was at alaa hospital in the middle area where the night before they had received a huge number of of injuries 100 plus injuries and and and many deceased brought to the hospital from strikes the night before so we're seeing uh significant numbers in the hospitals and and it's it's really important to reiterate the the UN Security Council resolution called for humanitarian Pathways we have international humanitarian law which requires protection of Health Facilities protection of civilians and it's really critical that we see that realized because we're seeing many civilians uh losing their lives we're seeing hospitals um lose functionality we're seeing health workers displaced and unable to care for the many many patients that they're that are put before them in this really horrible situation just on a personal uh note how are you able to move around and in relative safety if we could call it that because I understand that you've been to the north of Gaza in the last few days as well how are you able to to get from from One hospital to another it's not simple um I've been to daa City three times in the in the last uh two weeks and uh yesterday to the middle area um doing so requires coordination with both parties to this conflict um a lot of logistical rangs looking at routs that are open and possible uh there's a lot of Destruction especially the in in the Northern areas as you as you enter Gaza City it's almost unrecognizable my colleagues who are from Gaza City say they they can't tell what streets are on sometimes uh because there's so much destruction and there's Rubble all over the there's bound wires some of our trucks have been have been caught up in in cables that are down uh there are huge crowds uh many many people are displaced even behind me uh in the in the courtyard outside of this building there are thousands of people displaced so moving around is extremely challenging the roads are pack of people here in Raa they're they're covered in rubble in in many parts of the Gaza Strip some roads are in and there are areas of active fighting so it takes a lot of planning a lot of coordination and a lot of effort frankly I mean we simply have to deal with punctured tires and rerouting along the way just to be able to reach the northern part of the G strip Sean thank you so much for your time we really really do appreciate it uh that's Sean Casey uh with the World Health Organization in Gaza thank you thank you
