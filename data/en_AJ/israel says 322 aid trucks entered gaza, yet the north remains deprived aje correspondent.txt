earlier I spoke to our correspondent T abazo he is in Rafa in southern Gaza around 322 humanitarian TRS have been allowed to get into the Gaza Strip from both K Abu Salam and ding border here in Rafa these uh humanitarian convoys are loaded with water sugar flour and all kinds of basic necessities that Palestinians are in a very desperate need for but it's worth mentioning also that these humanitarian trucks are also are combined by trucks that are guided and delivered to the commercial sector and to the private sector here in the southern part of the Gaza Strip but none of these humanitarian convoys had been given the access to reach to the Norther part of Gaza Strip despite the Israeli uh military decision to reopen again the areas of crossing and to to guarantee further flow of humanitarian supplies to people in the north but yet only three humanitarian trucks get into the northern part of Gaza one has been uh loaded with fuel to others with medical supplies being transferred to hospitals in the northern part of the territory but generally in times the Brie war between 400 up to 500 the humanitarian trucks the Gaza Strip was generally cons work was generally consuming on daily basis which means that the amount that being delivered to the Gaza Strip is still yet uncom incomparable to the Ence needs of populations here specifically those who are trapped in the northern part of Gaza and facing High rates of malnutrition and with different signs of famine looming on the horizon and T today we've heard many a significant number of Israeli troops have pulled out of Southern uh Gaza particularly in kanun uh many people now returning homes back home to their homes and canas to see what's been left behind uh what are you hearing from them about what is there yes we have been hearing from them that the only found destruction that is in every single corner of the city of kanun they have been talking about they can barely find one building that could not be hit by Israeli military uh strike or even artillary bombardment they are talking about a great deal of Destruction and Bane being left behind the Israeli withdrawal from the city of kanun as a result of direct battles between Hamas Fighters and the Israeli military the complete destruction of educational facilities civil infrastructure and even medical sector that become completely out of service specifically for the second largest hospital in the city of kanun but again right now Palestinians see that the Israeli withdrawal from the city right now and being station stationing at the eastern part of the city is a kind of initial step being taken by the Israeli Army in order to prepare for potential military incursion for Rafa as the Israeli defense minister AF Galant has stated that the withdrawal of the Israeli Army is for further preparation for a potential military incursion uh in Raa and that's absolutely linked to the negotiations right now being ongoing in K regarding to to reach a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel so clearly we have been hiding to difficult days if there's going to be any sense of collapse of security and also for negotiations between both parts on the ground we might witness further attacks on rafah that had been widely attacked in the past few hour okay I'm now joined for Washington DC by Shan Carroll he's president and CEO of fera which is the American NE East Refugee Aid organization thank you for your time how do you explain the sudden boost to the number of Aid trucks that have entered Southern Gaza today well look all of us working in anira in in Gaza anira and many other International NOS the UN agencies have been asking for more Aid uh since the beginning if you remember Gaza was completely shut off at the beginning of this war for for two weeks and then the the 20 trucks a day that President Biden got the Israelis to agree to took a few days to get going took a long time to to really get going and as we see today this is a welcome development that over 300 trucks have gone in and it's only the second time in 84 days that more than 250 trucks have gone in so this is a welcome development there still needs to be a lot more do you think we would be talking about these three 300 plus trucks entering uh Rafa today if uh we havn't seen a number of Western Aid workers die in that Convoy we saw last week no sadly no we wouldn't be um this uh this tragedy this uh has allowed more pressure to be put on um and what we really would all hope to see is that Israel and all of its authorities the IDF the government its population as well would see and express the uh the acknowledgment that humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza serves everyone's interest A A A desperate population in Gaza does not serve the interest of Israeli security and the security of its people and in terms of the number of trucks so 322 trucks we know that uh prior to October 7th uh 500 trucks uh used to enter the strip to to feed people and and generally to provide support uh so how far do you think this is going to go towards meeting the needs of people in southern Gaza well thank let me talk for a minute about the numbers and then talk about what the the really important issue is so on the numbers again this is a welcome development 322 trucks but since the beginning of this war with this number today that brings us to just over 100 trucks uh a day about 108 trucks a day on average over 184 days and I'll note that uh the is early authorities have disputed the UN Logistics cluster log but I'll note that 322 trucks today takes the total number just over 20,000 20,000 And1 truck since the beginning and I would imagine that on the 6month anniversary uh it is a nice thing to say we have now reached 20,000 trucks so I suspect they know exactly the numbers that are in that log uh and and are are are using that as their metric but that's 108 trucks a day if they bring in 322 trucks a day for the next six months that will take us to a little bit over 200 trucks a day still less than half is what is needed so to make up ground to meet the extreme uh uh gaps in food and other Essentials for for living we need to see more than 500 trucks a day so very welcome development but it really needs to be doubled now the real issue is who going to deliver all this Aid uh unra is is blocked the Israelis won't communicate with unra and won't allow the agency to deliver Aid into the north World Central Kitchen anira and at least two other International NOS have paused uh our work until we get more assurances that humanitarian Aid workers are welcome it's understood that we play a vital role and that we are protected and allowed access uh protected access and safety for our workers so that we can effectively deliver the aid right as you say the issue has always been distribution uh and my understanding is these trucks are not even going to be heading north they're exclusively for the South uh but the north is where we're seeing some of the most acute suffering that's right we have to get more Aid into the north the opening the the the promise the announced opening of the eras Crossing in the north is also a welcome development but also understand that will take some time it was damaged at the beginning of the war it wasn't used recently in past years for goods um so we shouldn't get distracted by thinking that the opening of the AES Crossing is going to be a big benefit it's every little bit helps we have to work on every front there could be more Crossings open the Carney Crossing in in the on the Eastern Edge could be open we just all have to work together to get more Aid because again suffering desperate dying famin stricken Palestinians in Gaza does not serve the interest of of of anyone and and the numbers of people dying from starvation are going to climb dramatically uh probably regardless it's too late to save too many but if we could get more food in and and and the Israeli Administration has said that food and water and medical supplies and shelter are allowed in without prior approval that was also a welcome development but we need to make sure that they're keeping their word on that and and that all of the partners along the supply chain know that so that no one says well no we can't move this forward because it's not approved we can say No in fact the Israeli authorities have approved uh generally with free approval no no approval needed for food water medical supplies and Tents so uh Kat the administration of the occupation has said there's no limit to the amount of Aid that can go in we need to take them at their word we need to work with them uh and and push and cajo and and make sure that everyone is doing everything they can to double and triple the amount of Aid that's going in on a daily basis and then as I say make sure we have the capacity we have the capacity we need to make sure we have the security and the Assurance of of cooperation and not hindrance and I I can say that we don't have that yet we are still extremely nervous uh about operating in Gaza we're not satisfied with the findings of the investigation on the world Central Kitchen uh killings uh if indeed it was it was an accident it was a mistake we and and World Central Kitchen and everyone would like to to see the evidence we'd like to hear the tapes it's hard to believe the description uh that Israel has given for why that occur occurred but if that is the case then reassure Us by uh by providing the evidence and we also inira lost to colleague Musa shawa Logistics coordinator uh just a month ago and we don't have any explanation on on his death we'd like to believe that he wasn't targeted because there's absolutely no reason that he would be targeted and it's a crime against uh Humanity a crime a war crime to to Target uh International Aid workers any Aid workers he's a Palestinian any any humanitarian Aid worker uh and it's uh it's very disconcerting it's very um stomach churning to hear recently to read of an Israeli artificial intelligence program for targeting uh called Daddy's Home home and the idea is that they attract a Target until he's home and then uh kill him and Musa had arrived home in his family home from a day of delivering Aid with anira still had his anira sweatshirt on and he was killed as he sat down to have coffee with his family as was his six-year-old son I I just can't this is the this is the Stark reality that needs to be addressed if we are going to uh provide life sustaining Essentials to lessen the desperation uh in uh in the Gaza STP Sean I appreciate you talking to us Shan Carol president and CEO of fera the American neare East Refugee Aid organization thank you very much for having me
