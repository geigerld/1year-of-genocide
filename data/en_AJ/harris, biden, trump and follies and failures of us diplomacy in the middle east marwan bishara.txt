speak now to Maran bishara Al jaz's senior political analyst he's joining us from Paris via Skype Maran prime minister Netanyahu he met with Biden a bit earlier and now this is his second meeting of the day and we've seen Biden in the past be to some extent frustrated with Netanyahu and a lack of agreement is that the sort of tone that Harris will take at this stage also considering that uh she was one of the first to call for a ceasefire yes we don't expect uh Harris to stray far from the position and the policy of the Biden administration at this point in time she's definitely going to pre be preoccupied with her own campaign the next three months and it is not wise for her to be uh contradicting uh her president and the present president of the United States on an issue that so-called controversial in the United States and might um you know cause her problem she's GNA have to walk a tight Trope there's absolutely no doubt about that because she on the one hand she wants to stay loyal to Biden and to his policy and she is careful with the Israel Lobby on the other hand she had uh shown intention leaning towards uh sort of bridging to the pr Progressive the progressive arm of the democratic party I think that is important that's why it's a tight Trope on the one hand she expressed some sort of an emotional attachment to those who were protesting at the uh American universities for examples she did talk about the humanitarian situation in Gaza more than the others she apparently according to one report in the New York Times appealed to the White House to talk more emphasize more the Palestinian suffering and so on so forth so apparently there's a bit of a Nuance but that Nuance remains limited and I'm not sure it's going to be effective in the next uh six months perhaps if we have a president Harris come January 2025 maybe there will be a bit of a difference uh from where Biden because she is in fact not like Biden Biden is a an ideologically liberal interventionist he called himself as Zionist he has been unconditionally supporting un unraveling genocide in Palestine and the various war crimes carried by Netanyahu he expressed frustration with Netanyahu but never really acted on it she's also nothing like Trump she's not a sort of an extreme right uh nationalist populist of the type that Trump has proven to be the past six years so she's of a different type and and hopefully her sensibilities also as a woman I should add uh as as someone who supports Union social justice and various other equality issues in the United States would extend to foreign policy as well now if I could just another one last uh comment on her because that's really important where she stood and and how she stood in her book The truths we hold she doesn't express any uh belief or position on foreign policy of any you know importance when she became Senator however she did play you know the the the Israel Lobby Playbook she did parrot the Israel Lobby line she even undermined President Obama on the question of the illegality of the Israeli settlements so she's proved to be pragmatic and she kind of goes with the wind and it depends on how much pressure from the Israel lobby but yet I would say for the time being that she might prove to be slightly better than Biden and far better than Trump on issues such as Israel Palestine Maran returning to Netanyahu specifically and he's told hostage families uh families who are demanding that hostages be returned that Israel will submit um he said an updated ceasefire proposal to Hamas within 2 days what do you make of that I think Netanyahu has not stopped being the pathological liar he is I don't believe a single word uttered out of his mouth he's really like you know a proven liar everyone that dealt with him including his most close allies today today right like uh like minister of Treasury in Israel today one of the most radical ministers SMR called him the liar of all liars so the man lies right we expect him to lie until proven otherwise now he's definitely going to have to pay the card with the hostage families and he's definitely going to tell the captives families that uh you know he's trying to do his best this and that and other thing now having said that the war has definitely run its course including in Raa and clearly as Biden has warned since March there needs to be another way of dealing with the situation in Gaza because this cannot continue open-ended so I think the thing the the the issue of the so-called three-phase ceasefire has matured it is time for it to happen it's not happening because once again the Biden Administration is not putting enough pressure it's not using its leverage with Israel your earlier guest Aon David Miller who was part and parcel of the American Diplomat he said and I'm quoting there's two kinds of diplomacy in the Middle East one is slow and the other slower but why is that it's because America is not serious it's not an honest broker because it is Israel's uh lawyer as Aon D Miller once said in his book it's because each and every Envoy of each and every Administration for the past 30 years since Clinton began that peace process called the AO process every single Envoy every single person in charge of that file of the diplomacy from uh Elliot Abrahams to Dennis Ross to Aron Miller himself to Martin endic who just passed by the way to the likes of blinkin and so on so there are all zionists so each and every Administration gave the dossier of negotiation between pales zist to are pronounced Zionist some of them are moderate zionists some of them are radical zionists but they are all zionists and that's why it's not just slow and slower American diplomacy least it is a dis honest American Diplomat in the M least that moved from disastrous to totally catastrophic that's why 30 years on there is now peace after 30 years 40 Years of peace process and that's why I don't believe the Biden Administration when they say they believe in a two-state solution because after 10 months of genocide after 10 months of the total Destruction they cannot even get Israel to agree to a five week ceasefire how the hell are they going to get Israel to agree to a two-state solution Maran thanks very much for your time and and putting forward that very important question and the realities around
