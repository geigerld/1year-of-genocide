it's going to take you now to Geneva where the UN Human Rights Council is about to be briefed on the un's first in-depth investigation into events in Gaza the occupied West Bank and Israel since October the 7th this is Navi P speaking let's listen in uh in remembrance of all the victims who lost their lives and the survivors who have suffered injuries in both Israel and Palestine uh so let me greet your excellencies with a good morning and and to begin by saying that in the eight months since the 7th of October tens of thousands of children women and men have been killed and injured Palestinians Israelis and citizens of other states thousands of Palestinians have been detained and are being held in communicado and 120 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza the enormity of this tragedy overwhelms us and we are deeply disturbed by the immense human suffering we come to this Council today to present our report the mission of this Council as you know is to promote and protect human rights and that remains more important now than ever before on the 7th October attack in Israel a and Israel's subsequent military operation in Gaza have not occurred in a vacuum they were preceded by Decades of violence and retribution dispossession unlawful occupation and denial of the Palestinians right to self-determination now since 7th October our commission has carried out two parallel investigations first into attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian groups in Israel on 7th and 8th October and second into Israeli military operations and attacks in Gaza between 7th October and 31st December the findings of these investigations are summarized in the report presented to you today uh but they are detailed in two conference room papers so as you are aware uh the report we delivering is limited by uh word numbers to 10,700 and this is violations of such a vast scale and ongoing that we devis this method of putting in all the details in the two conference papers so I do encourage you to read this short report in conjunction with those two long conference papers these reports however do not even begin to describe all the crimes and all the atrocities of the last eight months and focus on some and so we are going to be focused on some of the most egregious events and incidents we will be reporting on additional findings and a followup after 31st December to the general assembly as mandated by you in October international law has strict and clear regulations on the conduct of War and the conduct of self-defense a fundamental principle of international law which underscored our findings is that unlawful action by one party to an armed conflict does not justify unlawful action by another party Israel has a right to protect its citizens from Violence by Palestinian armed groups but in doing so it must comply with international law Hamas and the Palestinian armed group must also comply with international law in relation to Israel's military operations and attacks in Gaza from 7th October we conclude that Israeli authorities are responsible for war crimes crimes against human ity and violations of humanitarian and human rights law including extermination intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects murder or willful killing using starvation as a method of War forcible transfer gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys sexual and gender-based violence amounting to torture and cruel or inhuman treatment Israel's total Siege of the Gaza Strip has weaponized the provision of life sustaining Necessities for strategic and political gains including through cutting off supplies of water food electricity Fuel and other essential supplies including humanitarian assistance it constitutes Collective punishment disproportionately impacting pregnant women and persons with disabilities and is causing grave harm to children including starvation related deaths we found that the immense numbers of Civilian casualties in Gaza and widespread destruction of Civilian objects and infrastructure were the inevitable result of an intentional strategy to cause maximum damage disregarding the legal obligations of Distinction proportionality and adequate precautions Israel also forcibly transferred almost the entire population into small enclosures that are unsafe and uninhabitable the deliberate use of heavy weapons with large destructive capacity in densely populated areas constitutes an intentional and direct attack on the civilian population although Israeli officials have repeatedly stated that their operations in Gaza are intended to destroy Hamas and to release hostages yet neither of these aims has been largely achieved at the expense of thousands of lives we found that Israeli forces committed sexual and gender-based violence with the intent to humiliate and further subordinate the Palestinian Community Palestinian women were targeted and subjected to sexual violence and harassment online and in person men and boys experienced specific persecutory Acts including sexual and gender-based violence amounting to torture and inhuman and cruel treatment the commission concluded that specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence constitute part of Israeli Security Forces operating procedures excellencies the situation in the Gaza Strip has overshadowed that in the West Bank where Palestinian fatalities recorded since 7th October have exceeded did any other recorded period this is linked to increasingly militarized Israeli operations a trend which we highlighted in our report to the general assembly last year as well as a surge in violent settler attacks on Palestinian communities often assisted or condoned by Israeli forces the blatant disregard for international law across the entire occupied Palestinian territory has disproportionately impacted Palestinian children in Gaza Israeli security forces have killed and maimed tens of thousands of children and thousands more likely remain under the rubble Israeli attacks have also severely impacted infrastructure essential for the well-being of children including hospitals schools and basic services excellencies in relation to the attack of 7th October 2023 in Israel the commission found that Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups are responsible for the war crimes of intentionally directing attacks against civilians of murder or willful killing to torture inhuman or cruel treatment destroying or seizing the property of an adversary and outrages upon personal dignity and taking hostages members of Hamas members of Palestinian armed groups and some Palestinian civilians deliberately killed injured tortured took hostages including children and committed sexual and gender-based violence against civilians and members of the Israeli Security Forces some of whom were hored in combat children were killed injured and physically and emotionally mistreated and instrumentalized by attackers for propaganda purposes the commission identified patterns indicative of sexual violence and concluded that these were not isolated but perpetrated in in similar ways in several locations by Palestinian perpetrators primarily against Israeli women I must note that the exploitation of sexual violence in Conflict by all parties for political propaganda risks diverting attention from the experience and from the needs of the survivors as well as further fueling longstanding hostility Excellency the security Council passed a resolution last week calling for an immediate full and complete ceasefire the commission reiterates that call and calls for a complete secession of hostilities we call for the immediate and for the full end of the siege for the release of all detainees including all of the Israeli hostages and for Palestinian armed groups to stop the indiscriminate firing of rockets into Israel the commission reminds all parties that they must adhere fully to International humanitarian law and international human rights law in protecting civilians and civilian objects the attacks against un agencies and humanitarian actors must stop this commission will continue its investigations into all crimes under international law with the aim of achieving Justice and accountability the commission requested Israel to ensure the commission's immediate access to the Gaza Strip in order to investigate and preserve evidence and we asked for this in compliance with the order issued by the international court of justice on the 24th May specifically ordering access to this commission Israel has has ignored the request that we have submitted to them the commission welcomes and is cooperating with accountability processes in the international court of justice and in the in the international criminal court it calls on all states to support those processes in every possible way the commission welcomes a listing of all parties to conflict in the 2020 2023 secretary General's report on children and armed conflict for committing grave child rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel we call on the listed parties to immediately end all the grave violations against children and in cooperation with the UN adopt time bound commitment to end and prevent grave violations against children in conclusion our world World faces the biggest threat of impunity for violations of international law unless perpetrators are held to account and Justice is delivered for all victims the protection and promotion of Human Rights remains a Paramount obligation of all member states thank you Mr President I thank you Miss Mrs Navi P chairwoman of the SOI on occupied Palestinian territories is J Alm and
