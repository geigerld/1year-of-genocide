Al jazer senior political analyst Marwan bishara is live with us here Marwan let's break down what's happened and putting it into context on November the 16th 2023 34 un experts referred to what they called crimes committed today partly due to continued impunity does the provisional icj rule bring an end to this era of impunity that the experts are talking about well theoretically speaking yes uh in principle yes uh whether Israel will uh will abide by it remains to be seen it doesn't seem to me that the Israeli leaders in particular but also the Israeli Elite in general the political Elite and the military brass will be taking a lot of this on board for the simple reason they called it heg schme didn't they the benir benav did I tell you something I think a lot of these Israeli leaders when they were uttering these things and we were like we were you know rolling our eyes what the hell are they doing they're giving us IM ammunition that they're actually complicit in in genocide but they're used to this kind of rhetoric that's what that's how they speak in Israel there's a certain degree of racism and dehumanization and populism among the political Elite but also in the society after 56 years of occupation they didn't even notice that they're being so racist about it all right since we're talking about rhetoric let's listen in to what the court said in announcing the adoption of these provisional measures on 9 October 2023 Mr yav Galant defense minister of Israel announced that he had ordered a Complete Siege of Gaza City and there then that there would be no electricity no food no fuel and that everything was closed on 12 October 2023 Mr Isaac Herzog president of Israel stated referring to Gaza I quote we are working operating militarily according to rules of international law unequivocally it is an entire nation out there that is responsible it is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved it is absolutely not true the court notes that the military operation being conducted by Israel following the attack of 7 October 2023 has resulted in a large number of deaths and injuries as well as massive destruction of homes the forcible displacement of the vast majority of the population and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure in the Court's view the aforementioned facts and circumstances are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible this is the case with respect to the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide now Maran listening to what was said there of course this is not the final finding on whether or not genocide occurred but the president of the Court went through what's happening to civilians what Israeli officials have been saying and basically said that South Africa's case genocide case is plausible right oh yeah I mean this is a landmark ruling uh simply because of the the arguments that was stated for 36 minutes which is almost identical to the South African arguments which is also almost identical to what the Palestinians have been saying for over four months basically that Israel is not only genocidal in intent it's genocidal in practice and the Palestinian people are in danger of continued genocide but the what what the what the what the president of the Court said that they have been going through and that they will be going through in the future of more of the same unless Israel takes a number of steps that it must take that's why this is a very important uh ruling Israel today is on trial officially for genocide now what you've just said though when you listen to what very significant Western world leaders have been saying you do feel there is a very obvious gap between where the icj is and where some of the world powers are let's listen into what John Kirby had to say on January the 4th we find this submission meritless counterproductive and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever did we just basically hear the president of the world Court refute that statement that it's counter meritless and completely without any basis in fact that's not the impression you get from the icj if you remember back back then we said what Kirby himself was saying was meritless lacking in diplomacy and lacking in base it was baseless what he was saying what Kirby was saying and as you said the the court of the land the world's Court have proved everything Kirby have been saying not just these three words everything Kirby has been saying in justifying Israel's genocide the past three months were wrong and that's why I think this type of delusion because American Biden Administration has proven to be delusional when it comes to what Israel has been doing and its attempt at shielding Israel diplomatically has also proven to be counterproductive now now that the world Court have came out with its ruling the United States and other Western backers of Israel's genocide must cease and desist must this is what some international human rights groups have been calling for like Human Rights Watch in a statement of November the 6th of been warning that and it went actually mentioned the US the UK Canada and Germany might be end up being complicit in abuses right now we're we're seeing this movement toward that in the icj um it it contrasts also does it not Maran with the rhetoric we heard from Western leaders during the Ukraine war let's turn back a year ago and listen into what some of those leaders were saying Russian forces also open fire on 10 civilians uh who were waiting in line for bread these incidents join a long list of attacks on civilian not military locations across Ukraine including apartment buildings public squares and last week a maternity hospital in marap pole uh I doubt that any of us who saw those images will ever forget them yesterday President Biden said that in his opinion war crimes have been committed in Ukraine personally I agree yesterday we saw again Russia's targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure and this is marking a new chapter in an already very cruel War the international order is very clear these are war crimes targeted attacks on civilian infrastructure with a clear aim to cut off men women children of water electricity and heating with the winter coming these are acts of pure Terror it's amazing that the some of the the same language was used in those statements talking about targeting civilian infrastructure water electricity being cut from me women and children were some of the same references that the president of the icj explained in why they've come to their position and yet it took South Africa Marwan how significant is that not a major Western power that talks about human rights it took a non-western power to bring this case and notice these referen to the icj well directly to your question I think today in the world we live in it's South Africa that's the champion of international human rights and humanitarian law not the self- declared Western powers that are uh the the champions of of the humanitarian in our world but back I mean you know back then we laughed and I'm still laughing now I mean you can't make this stuff up you cannot make this stuff up the hypocrisy the hypocrisy the hypocrisy of Western leaders especially vanan I mean and the Biden Administration there's two things here and we need to differentiate between them there's the hypocrisy and there's the double standard the hypocrisy is because the Europeans and especially the EU in general and the US has been saying that they and their values are Universal values and everything about their position on the question of Gaza proves to be utterly hyp hypocritical and the second is the double standard they say something about the Ukraine because Russia is an enemy they say something else about Gaza because Israel is an ally that's the definition of double standard so it is laughable laughable how the EU leaders and the US leaders have taken the position both hypocritical and double standard when it comes the question of Gaza and now it caught up with them because the world court has proven them to be hypocritical all right thanks so much Maran bashara for coming in
