thousands of hungry Palestinians in Gaza have been breaking into distribution centers to get food and other basic supplies the un's Palestinian refugee agency says this is a worrying sign that civil order is now breaking down aid supplies to Gaza have been extremely limited since Israel began bombarding the territory three weeks ago only several Aid trucks have been allowed in a day during the past week compared to hundreds before the war started we need fresh water we need food we're starving this is totally unfair our children can't sleep from hunger and thirst we need to provide food and water for them we have no flour no Aid no water not even toilets our houses were destroyed no one cares about us we appeal to the people of the world all International powers are against us we needed Aid and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need well aler Han mmore joins me now from kanun inside the Gaza Strip honey the Looting of these warehouses just shows how desperate people are how widespread is the Looting yes well as a civil order is uh beginning to collapse across the Gaza Strip and and because people don't have any official body just to refer to uh in terms of getting their uh basic supplies and and basic necessities of day-to-day life uh thousand of people uh just yesterday broke into United Nations uh Warehouse in Gaza City and in Dar valah city as well uh people uh basically uh took uh wheat flour basic items uh uh hygiene uh materials and and other basic necessities needed for their day-to-day life people un unfortunately uh as a result of the ongoing bombardment and and intensive air strikes are going hungry and and I'm quing here at United Nations official who said for the first time in Gaza Strip people are going hungry and this is an indication for for a catastrophe uh in the in the coming days as people find it difficult uh to get their basic supplies from from markets from shops and uh the lines in front of bakeries to get pack of bread the the que and line to get gallon of water so the whole situations in in Collective is HED toward a a a a very very uh terrible humanitarian crisis uh and food crisis particularly in the coming days honey you said there that many people don't even know who to speak to to try to work out where to get relief suppliers from I mean that must have been made so much more difficult with a Communications blackout I know it must be a relief for for so many that that Communications have been partially restored do we know how they were restored are they expected to stay that way well keeping Gaza Off the Grid in the past 48 Hours was uh just sent waves of concerns and fears among power Palestinians who did not know was what was going to happen but we we know that feeling that something atrocious was going was happening in the Northern and the the northern part of gazp and Gaza City but again when it comes to daytoday needs basic needs without communication people could not uh locate where is uh an where is an open an open Bakery in for example the city of kanun that we can get bread from or where we can get water that that absence of communication for the past 48 Hours it created a sense of that people are left alone and nobody cared about them about their needs about their concern on top of that uh the uh when communication network was disabled people could not get hold of their uh relatives and loved ones in the northern part of Gaza and Gaza and Gaza City as well now speaking of how it was sword we know that the the the the cables and the cell towers were completely destroyed and the infrastructure was completely destroyed so what the uh palel the telecommunication grouping G official uh official company uh it says that they worked on Alternatives a pretty much a basic alternative just to get people online again and get people in touch as of as of this time the signal is still weak it keeps the connecting I won't say it's it's reliable we'll see what's going to happen in the next coming hours we'll continue monitoring very closely indeed Al's honey mood there speaking to us from kanun inside the Gaza Strip thank you so much honey
