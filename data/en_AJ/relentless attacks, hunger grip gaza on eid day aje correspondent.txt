let's go live now to Central Gaza and speak to alzer's hany mmud in De alala so Hy Israeli air strikes have been intensify what's the latest you can tell us on the ground there well good morning and ID Mubarak to all the colleagues and the Israeli military continue to pound across the central area and the southern part of the strip mainly Raa City and retaliation to what appear to be the biggest loss for the Israeli military as uh Hamas and its military uh fighting groups on the ground ambushed an armed vehicle and leading to the death of uh eight soldiers as the Israeli military is stated uh in retaliation to that Israeli military aggressively attacked a major parts of the western area of Rafa City including the Saudi neighborhood the Japanese Garden sulan area where there are hundreds of of families are trapped in that area destroying majority of the residential homes and the public facilities and around the vicinity of a an honorable school that's an evacuation Center where people were panicking literally at a very state state of panic and quite fearful of the indiscriminate attacks by uh the Israeli military in the Central Area mainly the eastern part of Bal City where as of a midnight and early hours of this morning we could clearly hear the constant nonstop artillery chilling of areas in which the Israeli military stated these were identifi the infrastructure used by Palestinians fighting a group at the eastern part of Gaza of the Gaza Strip Eastern of D City without giving further information of the nature of these attacks that are done that these are based on internal precise intelligence information but what these attacks did they they kept pushing people into further internal inforce displacement for hundreds of more of displaced families whose uh sense of security and safety is is being shattered at a very major level right now whether here or in the northern uh part of the strip in which not only right now people are struggling to deal with the uh the uh the unpredictable bombs and they deliberate attacks on their homes whether in the eastern part of of Gaza City or further to the northern part of the strip but also the spread of enforc dehydration and starvation particularly we're talking about on the first day uh of where literally we're we're we're looking at hundreds of thousand of of Palestinian displaced families and many of them are in morning and on this particular day many of the uh many of the Traditions such as buying a new like simple things like buying a new clothes or making Eed treat are out of Out Of Reach for most people and in addition to a major tradition for Muslims here which is the offering the or the sacrifice of an animal is made Impossible by The Soaring of prices and by the ongoing blockade uh on the The Crossings one important element and it's causing quite of a tragedy to people here is the uh the prent of almost 3,000 people who were supposed to go and perform Haj are unable to do this because of the ongoing blockade uh on the crossings ra Crossing is the only exit point for gazans to the outside world and it has been almost 40 days uh we're looking at complete en closure of this particular exit Point people are unable uh to exit and perform uh Haj at this at this year so this is is mixed of feelings people were hoping hopeful for a potential seiz fire other than the fact we heard this morning and isra statement about a tactical pause of the fighting in ra to allow more humanitarian trucks into the southern part of the strip but from past experience tactical pauses are nothing shorter of a a stop of shedding blood which means it's a break from killing people until further notice that's that's causing major panic and concern because it's almost unpredictable what is going to happen at what level uh the aggression is going to be H mm thanks very much indeed for that update make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
