have been wounded our correspondent yum Al say joins us now on the phone from northern Gaza yumna we're seeing pictures of the devastated area in and around uh the Indonesian Hospital in central Gaza what more are you hearing locally on the ground well Sahel it's been over 24 hours continuously that the bombardments across the Gaza trip have been Relentless uh from the air from the sea and from the land all we can hear and see in the skies of Gaza is the sound of war jets missiles and smoke billowing from the sky we can still hear the sound of tanks that uh keep on shelling every now and then of course the massive massacre in jabalia a refugee camp today was the largest uh from these bombings that have taken place in the Gaza Strip today in the northern part uh over 20 homes were uh bombarded in that uh in that bombardment uh and also a mosque uh the Indonesian uh uh director of the Indonesian Hospital says that until this moment over 400 casualties have uh been received in the hospital between killed and injured he said that until now 100 people have been uh completely have been U um killed and taken their their foot just there outside of course we're not talking about morgs anymore because they're completely filled up but the situation at the Indonesian Hospital which has run out of fuel days ago is catastrophic the patients and the injured are all on the ground of the hospital they're on the floors of the hospital there are no beds to take them that a huge number of uh casualties and and injured brought to the hospital of course the hospital suffers also from the lack of medications uh medical staff and and all medical resources and with such difficult circumstances in such Massacre with great numbers of casualties coming to the hospital it's impossible for these team to to operate and to save the injured that are brought to the hospital every now and then but this is not the only Massacre soale that has happened today in the Gaza Strip just half an hour ago almost half an hour ago another Massacre inat refugee camp that's in the central part of the G where a residential Tower was completely bombarded over 20 people have been pronounced killed they were taken to uh ala martyr hospital and dozens of other injured are still being brought from under the rubble in these instance as we see y Ela thanks very much for the update there from you let's uh go back to safat aluda correspondent tuing Gaza safat we're seeing pictures of the devastated area in the middle of Jaa Camp uh there the dead and injured certainly been taken to the adjacent Indonesian hospital as many as what 400 injured over 100 dead as far as the Director of the hospital is saying what more are you hearing yes have still STI with the figure that the Ministry of Health is providing and uh the statement of the minister of interior who believe that there are still more people under the rubel we could see uh pictures for trying to uh pick up as much as they could from the rubble to serve to to save uh the people who are still there uh I I by the way I am from jabalia refug and I was born and grown up there I know what does it mean to to bombard a residential area with six mile according to the ministry VOR big mile each weighs 1,000 kilogram of exclusive at a very densely populated area as as I mentioned ja Refuge Camp is one of the most deely populated areas in the world and there it's 1 kilomet square for a house for 120,000 refugees living there these houses as I said these houses are very simpal houses and six Rockets are are enough to raise or to destroy an entire residential uh area as we saw in the pictures coming from that place still the the thean hospital uh is still trying to to deal with the the huge number of the injuries that have been arriving to to the hospital until now just saf you say you know this area very well you're raised in jabalia uh refugee camp Camp just explain to us about this area that is adjacent to the hospital we are expecting the Israelis to say this was a legitimate Target please describe to us exactly the types of buildings that are here and the types of people that live here the people who live in jabalia and other seven uh refugee camps all over the grip are refugees who were expelled from their original Village and cities uh 1948 which what they call it the N now even when they the Israelis asked them by the way to leave they said okay to get this place they said this will be another n and many of them they decid to stay anyway back to uh the refugees who are living there um in Gaza most twoth third of the population are refugees by the way distributed in eight refugee camps and even some of them m to to the Gaza City and other cities anyhow still most of the houses or homes in in theug Camp all of them not only jabali are still simple houses and with simple roofs with the what they call it so six TR are enough to destroy as big and huge and vast uh area or big area in that place so uh living there I I still remember the The Narrow Street the the the adjacent houses each one each next to other to another the people living there also they live big families in one small house or some of them they manag to build the second floor but still you can find 20 people living in one or two floor uh building in the refugee camp and this is the case of all the refugee camp all over the g s Del kute thanks very much for filling in the picture for us here uh as we see those images from jabia refugee camp where a short time ago the Israelis uh launched missiles straight into this very densely uh residential area um
