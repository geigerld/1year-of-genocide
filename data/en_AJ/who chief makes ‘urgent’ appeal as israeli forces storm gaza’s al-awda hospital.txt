the World Health Organization has made an urgent appeal to Israeli forces over the storming of the Ala Hospital in Gaza The Who Chief says 140 medical staff patients and their civilian companions were inside that hospital when it was raided by Israeli Soldiers the hospital is located in the jabalia refugee camp Tedros gabrius is calling for the protection of patients and health workers inside the hospital and safe passage for their evacuation Al jazer spoke with one of the doctors as he made the journey away from the hospital we were at the hospital as usual we never left at all we never even thought of quitting on our patients and the injured people 4 days ago we were taken by surprise when the Israeli military besieged the hospital they would not allow anyone inside we stayed to care for the lives of our patient we had 14 patients who we continued to give Medical Care to then today at 3:00 the Israeli Army forced nearly all of us from the hospital the patients remained inside with four medical staff and two paramedics to care for them all of us have been ordered to leave the hospital and keep walking towards West Gaza we are walking till we reach a safe area and to find shelter we want to reach a safe place and to shelter the medical staff who remained at Al ala hospital since October 7th until now they never left and now their homes are destroyed and they have nowhere to go we have sent several appeals to the wh to the Red Cross and to our partners with Doctors Without Borders to intervene to protect the patients they all promised to intervene and to talk to the occupation forces to prevent targeting the hospital the patients and not to Target the medical staff but I haven't seen anything done from here from this street I appeal to all International organizations and all medical related officials especially the wh calling upon them to intervene to protect what remains of the hospital the patients in the hospital and the medical staff who refus to leave and continue to care for those patients we'll bring in who's joining us from in central Gaza to tell us what exactly is happening at hospital t as well as the state of other hospitals across the strip at this [Music] moment well during basically hospitals in the medical sector are completely uh one of the basic tenants of netanyahu's military plan that aiming to completely uh kill and destroy the medical sector and to make it completely out of service um the ongoing on precedented Military offensive on the territory as we've been hearing from medics in the north of this strip in particular in Al AA hospital they have been forced by the Israeli military to flee from the hospital and to no longer remain providing medical services for injured people as a part of the ongoing military campaign on jabalia refugee camp now Al ala hospital is so close from the camp but it's responsible for providing medical treatment for wounded resulted from the ongoing uh brutalization of civilians and ongoing attacks on that very densely populated area dozens of medics in fact have been uh fled fleeing the hospital but there are still a number of doctors and medical workers inside the hospital refused to flee until the occupation forces bring them ambulances in order to flee the wounded people who are unable to walk on foot as other medic and wed people managed to do previously and they are in a very desperate need for a medical assistance and an ambulance that can help them to get from the place that they right now turn to be a military base for the Israeli Army and similarly is Kamal Udan Hospital which is only far away from that Hospital's one kilometer it means that there is a full medical Siege being imposed on those hospitals and the north of the strip as there are dozens of injuries and even victims are still lined on the ground in the streets of jabalia refugee camp without getting any kind of rescue operations either by The Rescuers and emergency workers or by the medics who are grappling to reach to that locations due to the Israeli ongoing bombardment and the existence of the military troops there yeah t it so uh bring us up to speed with what's happening uh when it comes to uh the attacks across the Gaza Strip as well as the fighting that's on the ground well it is quite hard to say that one area is not coming under the Israeli fires the entire strip has been completely subjected to the Israeli aerial and land bombardment and in particular we see that there is a gradual expansion of the fighting now to reach to the central areas of Rafa this is what the defense minister U Al Galant has been stating before that they are so determined to expand the military operations and confrontations now in Raa according to eyewitnesses are taking place in yna refugee camp which is one of the central neighborhoods of Rafa District but at the same time we have been hearing from locals that the Israeli military qu copter drones have set fire to fishermen pots on the coastal uh shore of rafah District that is very adjacent to borders with Egypt and this is a part of the ongoing systematic military campaign in the city as more residential buildings were targeted were at least six Palestinians have been reported killed in the far south city of Rafa but similarly in other parts of this trip more than 35 Palestinians have been killed so far in Gaza City where mosque's residential buildings evacuation centers were targeted as more military attacks have been carried out by the Israeli maneuvering troops and even within the past couple of hours the Israeli Army has announced officially a new invasion of B hanu town by one of the military brigades as now the numbers of military division that working inside the Gaza Strip had reached to 10 it means that the Israeli military is resuming the fighting in the vast majority of Gaza Strip areas okay thank you so much T reporting from in central Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get
