revolutionary guard has also released a statement saying early this morning that's Wednesday morning Ismael hania's residence in tran was struck resulting in the marthom of him and one of his bodyguards it goes on to say the cause is under investigation and will be announced soon uh let's bring in abas asani he's a senior research fellow at the center for Middle East strategic studies he joins us via Skype from the Iranian Capital um abas you're our first guest from Iran so it's really good to get you now I mean how significant from where you're sitting is this assassination of Ismail hania and and and how is this being viewed in Iran where you are given the political changes a new president uh well you know the uh significance relates to the official who has been assassinated the quality of the assassination and the I mean the place he was assassinated in the capital city and the context also is important because he was assassinated on the I mean just after the uh inauguration ceremony of Iranian president and meeting senior Iranian officials um you know this you at the moment that we speak and escalation seems inevitable uh on the same that new Iranian president was speaking of dialogue and engagement with the West I think this is happening and this could can somehow as somewhere predicting could complicate the engagement process between Iran and the west and natano doesn't want this to happen uh also you know we might be saying goodby for now to the ceasefire because you know this can escalate into a regional war and uh so Israeli Prime Minister is trying to do everything in order to uh prolong his political life he wants to somehow continue the war and I think these are not just only meant to impact the processes in Teran or in the region but also in Washington as well he wants to somehow impact the political campaign in the United States maybe uh somehow undermining the Democrats and giving more chance to Donald Trump and and how serious abas now is that threat of escalation given that as you say um you know it happened on Iranian Soul we know Iran isn't afraid to hit back at Israel so how is Iran likely to respond then militarily uh well it's a bit early to uh talk about the quality and the type of the response but I think uh a retaliation will be inevitable and Iran has no choice but to respond to this action uh I think I think they will U study and investigate that in what methods and how they can respond to this as you know previously when Iran's Embassy was targeted in Damascus Iran uh responded directly to Israel uh but it does not necessarily need to be the same way but I think Iran will need to respond because this is happening in the capital city and I think we will need some time to study that what options are available and how Iran can respond in order to uh you know to revive the deterrence but for sure Teran has been insisting that it does not want a origional war but it seems that the uh Israel wants to push different parties into this war because they want to lengthen this process and uh the point is that at a time that the uh us government is on its you know final months in the office you know its restraining impact and influence on Israel is also uh decreasing and this somehow increases the chance of an unpredictable scenario in the situation however a a an allout War a an expand you know a war which could include all the region is not something that Iran wants but this is a scenario that Israel is pushing different parties including Iran to the side but I think we have to be watching that what options are available that Iran can respond through uh a original War you know is more likely than ever we need to fasten our seat belts but we have to wait and see that you know how this type of you know response could be because yesterday we had an attack on Beirut uh later in at night or early morning hours you know this assassination happen and I think this cycle of you know actions and reactions might continue in the days to come and it's important that uh what role other players like in the United States will be playing in this regard uh in order to contain the situation abas let me get a let me ask you uh another question here do you think this will be seen uh as a failure by Iran Security Services I mean they knew Hano was a Target Israel made no secret that it wanted to take out hamas's leadership um that actually happened they killed him on Iranian soil did Iran Security Services fail uh somewhere along the line here given that he was assassinated uh for sure what happened in R was a bad thing for the Iranian security apparatus and uh the point that tan might be feeling that Israel wants to undermine it deterrence and that's why Iran will uh somehow feel that it has to respond to this uh and uh I think at the time that uh Israel was somehow losing FL in international support or you know uh had some you know was in a difficult situation in order to prolong the War uh Israel wants to change the rules of the game and it wants to somehow uh change the uh deterence balance against tan so from from this perspective this is not a good news for the security apparatus in tan uh and you know its positions or strategies when it comes to the regional you know uh developments that's why I think a retaliation or response might be inevitable from Uranian side but I'm not quite sure about the quality yet I think it is yet to be determined uh but this was also from a security perspective very significant for Iran yeah possibly a failure um let me get a final thought from you then abas before you go I mean how is Iran viewing any hope for a ceasefire and Gaza because it's Gaza uh that's triggering all the other Regional conflicts uh within the region you know every time that there were efforts or negotiations for a ceasefire in the region you know uh on the final hours or days of those negotiations there was a pretext from the Israeli side that they wouldn't accept the I mean the ceasefire it was you know clear enough that nanahu didn't want a ceasefire and by these actions and efforts in order to escalate into a regional war or at least uh you know in a to a broader conflict in the region uh and you know which could have tensions that could uh make this war longer it seems that Israelis do not want you know this ceasefire and from Iranian perspective Netanyahu and Israel has been a major obstacle for achieving the ceasefire and you know by what happened yesterday and I me last night in tan it seems you know more clear and uh that Israel does not want a ceasefire and uh we have to be seeing maybe this conflict going on in the uh weeks or months to come this is not something thatan but this is the thing that practically Israel tryes to uh you know make Happ it all right abas asani there're live for us in the Iranian Capital uh with the reaction and Analysis there from Iran thank you very much indeed
