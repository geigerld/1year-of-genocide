the United Nations top court has just ruled against ordering Germany to Hal armed sales to Israel the case was filed by Nicaragua and accused Germany of failing to prevent genocide in Gaza by continuing to sell arms to Israel it's the latest case involving Israel before the international court of justice South Africa approached the court in December accusing Israel of committing genocide viations convention by 15 votes to one find that this circumstances as they now present themselves to the court are not such as to requir exercise of its power under article 41 of the statute to indicate provisional measures let's go live to Al jazer it's villm Marx who's at the H Forest so villm tell us more about what the court said today to explain their decision not to issue provisional measures well Folly there were two specific spe ific issues one was very much factual let's start with that they accepted the statements made by the German legal team that since October the 7th not only has there been a massive reduction in the value of their military related transfers to Israel but the vast vast majority around 98% of the value of all those transfers was for non-lethal material they acknowledged there had been 300 anti-tank missiles sold from Germany into Israel they said that therefore there was not a huge amount of indication that German support for the Israeli military was helping that Israeli military operate inside Gaza secondarily they pointed out that given the claim from Nicaragua was that Germany was in violation of the genocide convention the court has previously itself not yet ruled that Israel is violating that convention and therefore there was no legal standing right now for them to issue these so-called provisional measures against Germany because Germany itself is not seen to be supporting a state that is itself in violation of the convention that was essentially the two key acceptances and part of that ruling from the court today and what has Nicaragua said uh following this ruling what is going to be their next step now so their agent Ambassador has come out here to speak just a few minutes ago in front of the court it's important to note that Germany had sought for this case to essentially be dismissed at this point that would normally only happen the court said were there questions around jurisdiction there are no such questions around jurisdiction so they said that the case would continue and Carlos Jose aguelo Gomez the agent Ambassador for Nicaragua spoke to us just a few moments ago to the pre press pack gathered out here saying the case will continue despite the icj ruling against the emergency request the ruling doesn't mean he said that Germany did not violate International rules and of course this could go on Folly for many many years hence forth vill thank you very much vill marks live there at the ha let's get reaction now from Berlin and speak to aleser Dominic kanaine what's the reaction of the German government uh following this ruling Dominic well fully theam the foreign office has rather quickly reacted putting out a statement on social media it's in German but I'll paraphrase it's saying nobody is above the law that informs the way we carry out our policies we welcome today's judgment by the international Court Germany is not party to the conflict in the Middle East on the contrary we are working day and night for a two State solution we are a provider a provider of large amounts of humanitary humanitarian help to the Palestinians we are working as far as possible to make sure that help gets to people in Gaza and the final part of it they say this is the foreign Ministry German foreign Ministry says we also see however in their words the terror of the 7th of October is what calls the spiral of suffering that has been triggered against which Israel must defend itself and we note that there are still more than 100 hostages in the hands of Hamas who in their words they say are being used as or misused as human Shields that reaction from the German foreign Ministry in the course of the last 20 minutes or so and it shows that the government here is happy that part of the case has gone in their favor but clearly they wanted as Willam was saying the case to be thrown out and that has not happened so as it were two cheers metaphorically from the German government in so far as this judgment is concerned thank you Dominic for that Dominic Kane with the reaction there from from Berlin let's explore all this further now with motaz alferi who heads the human rights program at the Doha Institute for graduate studies thank you once again for being with us so as we heard there yes uh the court said no legal standing to issue provisional measures against Germany but it is not the end of the case as we've heard what happens next yes this is not the end of the case this is just a decision regarding the provisional measures requested by Nicaragua as they stand right now MH but it send a message also to Germany that in the future because after reading the the text in the future if Germany decide to provide weapons that are directly used in the violation Nicaragua can Again by the way request a new me yes it happened in South Africa versus Israel you remember in the case there was provisional measures in January then another provisional measures in uh in in in Marsh so the point here the in the conclusion of the the decision of today the court said directly the court consider it particularly important to remind all state of their International obligation relating to the transfer of arms to parties of an armed conflict so it reminds that Germany is under obligation not to provide arms that could be used in violation okay now what about the implications then for other countries that provide support Military Support to Israel but also the what means for countries who might not just Nicaragua but as we saw South Africa or others who might want to bring a case against Israel's supporters to uh uh the international court of justice because the issue here was that there wasn't sufficient evidence to UE these provisional measures right in the future should provide sufficient and substantial evidence that there is ongoing cooperation and Military export that is used in violation of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in provisional measure you don't talk about the past you are talking about something ongoing and there is emminent risk that the threat will continue today the court did not find that and it was convinced of what Germany uh presented because Germany also argued that it has system to Monitor and it is that Germany is ComEd also or Bound by EU law and in arm export so any case should provide evidence that there are ongoing uh uh export and these export are used directly in the violation of Geneva Convention or the convention on genocide okay so it's a lesson for other countries that might want to bring a case yeah but also just to conclude I think what's happening now is that Gaza launched a long term legal mobilization it is not the end of the story we can also witness domestic litigation in Germany in Canada inside countries that provide because people can also file cases in domestic court okay very interesting this was a legal Victory perhaps for Germany but not not a political one I don't to consider it yeah political legal Victory because there are no provisional measures yeah but I don't consider it that Victory because also in the conclusion of the Tex of the decision today the court remind Germany of its obligation and remind International Community and state parties of the Geneva Convention on International material law of their obligation not to provide weapons that are used in violation of the Geneva Convention so this lay the ground for future litigation it it is possible of course do you expect that there could be other cases you mentioned the local cases that's a possibility but at the international court of justice do you expect that other countries could yes other countries of course can take the step we need to remember that Nicaragua and Colombia intervened in support of South Africa and it's a case against Israel so right now the icg already handled three cases related to Palestinian related to palestin in general one The Advisory opinion that it provide open the request of the general assembly to discuss the legal consequences of the incubation the second one uh South Africa versus Israel and the third one Nicaragua and Germany because the court will decide on the merits so there still other uh uh phases for this case it has not ended it will take some time thank you very much maras
