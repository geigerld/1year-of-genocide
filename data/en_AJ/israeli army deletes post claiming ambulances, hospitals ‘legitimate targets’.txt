a short while ago the Israeli Army defended its Relentless attacks on hospitals and ambulances the post was quickly deleted from the platform X formerly known as Twitter let's take a look at what it said because this is not the first time Israel has tried to justify its bombardment of Health Care Facilities now the post says ambulances are used to transport patients in need of medical care and hospitals are places where patients receive treatment right but the Israeli Army says Hamas uses ambulances to trans sport its operatives and weapons disguising them as civilians it goes on to state that hospitals are in fact terrorist infrastructure and not used for medical purposes it points out this is against international law and it says turns hospitals and ambulances into legitimate military targets now this is a claim the Israeli Army has made before that Hamas is using hospitals as cover for its command centers well for more on this let's speak to to Diana Buu a Palestinian lawyer and former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization she joins us now from H thank you very much for being on El jazer first of all what is your reaction uh to this tweet that was sent out by the Israeli military especially when it comes to the line hospitals and ambulances are legitimate military targets look the Israeli Army has been dying to try to make things that are otherwise illegal to try to turn them into IL legal and we all know that it is illegal to hit hospitals it is illegal to hit ambulances it is illegal to deny care to the sick and to the wounded and Israel persists because it can and I think it's very important for us to put this in its proper context these same allegations were made in 2008 and 2009 again in 2012 again in 2014 they have never been proven and what we do know is that Palestinian doctors International doctors doctors from International organizations everybody has come out and said that this is actually not being used for any uh for any military purposes and therefore it is illegal therefore the onus is on Israel to prove that it's legal but even if it tries to do that we have to bear in mind what Israel is doing it's trying to commit genocide against Palestinians and this is why it must be stopped now I mean how compelling is this as potentially evidence in any future investigation or trial you know they have no they have no uh evidence they have no intelligence whatsoever in fact there have been demands by Palestinians for for an independent investigation to come in and look through the hospitals but of course this has always been rejected by Israel because they want to continue to dangle these fake allegations in order to make legal what is otherwise illegal and this is what Israel has has always been trying to do you don't need to have a degree in international law to understand that hitting a hospital is illegal but what Israel is trying to do is sell the world that what it's doing is right and we all know that it is Criminal I mean like you say they are trying to sell this narrative to the world at this stage do you think it is working and that many of the western Nations that are allied with Israel are buying it I don't think they're buying it but I don't think they're doing anything to stop it either when you see that for the past two days we have not received uh an accurate toll of people who been killed by by Israel in the Gaza Strip because the Ministry of Health is not able to operate and when you see the the level of damage that Israel is inflicting and when you hear the genocidal statements that Israeli leaders are saying it should demand from the world that it put pressure on Israel to stop but instead why they may not be believing Israeli lies they're still allowing Israel to persist with carrying out these attacks and they're quite brutal just in regards to the allegations that are mounting every day against Israel you know saying crimes against humanity genocide violations of international humanitarian law I mean how does or should that process around investigating and Prosecuting those allegations how is that likely to proceed if at all look there are already organ ganizations that are working and collecting evidence regarding Israeli war crimes they've been doing this not only since the first day of the attack but for years before because this is unfortunately not the first attack and there is a mountain of evidence from statements of Israeli leaders including the Prime Minister and the president himself um there is a mountain of evidence in terms of the more than 1,000 family massacres that have been perpetrated there's a mountain of evidence in terms of the attacks on hospitals the real question is whether a court is actually going to listen to this and I certainly hope they do so if they don't it tears Decades of international law to pieces and shows the world that what is really important is might rather than law and we must not go down this path of allowing might to be right thank you so much Diana we really do appreciate it Diana Buu Palestinian lawyer and former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization thanks so much
