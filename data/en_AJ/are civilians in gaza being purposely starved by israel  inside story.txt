hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are living under the NeverEnding threat of famine because of the shortage of humanitarian Aid is the starvation of civilians being used by Israel as a weapon of War this is Inside [Music] Story hello welcome to the program I am Hashim the United Nations is warning that hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are on the brink of Salvation acute levels of hunger are facing around 2 million Palestinians after many of them lost their homes and livelihoods desperate people unable to feed themselves or their children are living in family like conditions some resorting to eating animal feed and weeds to survive is a strangling of food medicine and other humanitarian supplies being used as a weapon of War by the Israeli government will be discussing all this and more with our guests shortly but first malabi MPI reports on the widespread suffering with no end inight surrounded by the ruins of what used to be their homes omj is among the estimated 300,000 Palestinians who stayed in the isolated area of Northern Gaza people have not been receiving deliveries of food because International a trucks are being denied access to the areas in need some residents in jabalia say they have faced prolonged periods without food or access to water to survive they've resorted to picking weeds to cook for their children and turning animal feed into flower as you can see our conditions are difficult everything is closed here and there is danger all around us when collecting the weeds but we have no other choice but to ensure that the children receive Food in any way possible so they don't have to endure hunger we come to this m to grind Bley and corn and everything that can be ground even animal feed we are forced to eat everything because of hunger we ask the Arab countries and all other countries of the world to secure the entry of Aid to our people who have no help as you can see this is animal foda an estimated 580,000 Palestinians in Gaza are facing catastrophic levels of hunger the world food program is warning that there's acute shortages in Northern Gaza unless we get significant volumes on a regular basis to people in the most food insecure areas of Gaza that we would have famine conditions in place by May or June of this year we are not getting significant amounts of Aid in we are not doing it every day as we need to do since the St start of Israel's war convoys of humanitarian Aid have been delayed denied permits and sometimes attacked Israeli soldiers screen everything and seize items deemed useful to Hamas more recently a group of Israeli protesters demanding the release of captives set up bobbed wire at the Karam Shalom border crossing to stop trucks entering Gaza I cannot understand why a country at war is bringing humanitarian Aid into its over Enemy Lines um and fueling the war every truck that goes in is another day of War for both sides Israel's bombardment of Southern Gaza is forcing more than 2 million displaced people to head back North in search of shelter pressuring many into making a choice of potentially dying from Hunger in the North or being killed by Israeli bombing in the South Mal Al jaer for Inside Story Han Mahmud sent us this report from Rafa where man Palestinians are struggling to secure food since the beginning of this genocidal war on Gaza living conditions have become increasingly difficult for people here overcrowded RAF where there is a real struggle for food and water and almost a famine taking place in the northern part of Gaza this is the daily normal defin by displacement Terror and hunger where the vast majority of this place families forced out of their homes from the north and more recently from the central area and the City of KH Unis are now hungry with little Financial capabilities as depletion of basic necessities and Food Supplies an ongoing blockade on humanitarian Aid causing prices to double and triple for some good the unusual scene of people queuing in line in line for a ball of soup uh it just become uh or has become the uh major feature of people living in rafah City since the beginning of the war Han Mahmud for The Insider story Al jazer in southern Gaza let's bring in our guests in our studio in London Omar ABD Manan is pediatric neurologist who who founded the doctor's help group called health workers of Palestine from Rafa in Gaza Fidel alaj is a food security and livelihood coordinator at Oxfam also in London to Nel arova his senior crisis response advisor at Amnesty International welcome to the program let me start with f you are in RAF where people are struggling on a daily basis to secure food for themselves for their loved ones for their children give us a sense of what is happening particularly in the Central and northern part of Gaza where many say that's where we have the biggest humanitarian crisis actually um as you said it's not only about RAF it's uh all across Gaza STP uh you have the whole population of over 2 million people at imminent risk of femine uh the numbers say that more than 300 70 uh thousand of these people are at the huge risk uh immediate risk of starvation with exhaustive uh where they have exhausted their coping mechanisms also so they are about to die from hunger uh this is how it looks like in Gaza now more specifically in the North and the center parts of Gaza with a huge U no access of food Aid or any food items uh to that to those parts people are suffering they are looking for essential goods for any kind of food commodities with no luck to find them at all uh here in ra the the situation is worsening as well uh with the cut of the entering of the a trucks and with the scarcity of the food um Commodities to start with before all of this even started Donatella what what is the biggest obstacle to the steady flow of Aid into Gaza is it logistical is it the long security screening of the material or is it simply a politically motivated thing it is beyond doubt that um there is a lack of political will um obviously from the Israeli authorities they are the occupying power and they are the ones who control access to the Gaza Strip and they are the ones that have been restricting the entry of both humanitarian Aid and Commercial imports not just from the 7th of October but um for the past 16 years um that is in itself a breach of international humanitarian law um Israel has not been complying with its obligation just to be very very clear uh if there is a need for humanitarian Aid in Gaza is because Israel as the occupying power has not been fulfilling its obligation um it's not the duty of The Intern National Community to provide food water Medical Care education all that the population under occupation needs that is the duty and the obligation of the occupying power not only Israel has not been doing that but it has constantly restricted the entry of humanitarian Aid of imports of medicines of of absolutely everything that this civilian population requires um for you you know the essential needs of daily life now since the 7th of October that level of restriction has increased exponentially and in addition the wholesale destruction including the deliberate destructions of Road uh want on destruction not required by military necessity uh that kind of Destruction is also creating logistical problem because especially now that people are escaping uh Rafa and moving towards the middle area of Gaza hoping to find safety even though you know that's obviously not uh not going you know that that's not possible at the moment but that means that people are going to an area where there is nothing and where getting the aid from the southern border of Gaza to theera is going to be even more difficult because of the state of the roads as a result of the Israeli military operation okay okay Omar you must be in touch with the Medics on the ground how are children coping with this horrible situation unfolding in Gaza thank you Hashim I think the reality is uh no one is coping with the situation in Gaza because as we have seen time and time again the Israeli occupation forces determined to bomb and Target hospitals and Healthcare facil ities what that means is the acute starvation that many of these children are being exposed to and let us not forget there are cases of marasmus and quashi cor coming into hospitals in Gazza which is the uh immediate effect of acute malnutrition things that we saw in somal land or Somalia in the '90s but we are now seeing in Gazza in 2024 on top of that you have targeting Healthcare facilities which means these same children that are starving and are you know at risk of uh long-term negative Health seally are not able to gain access to care to renutrition to the right um you know treatment for that and you know only yesterday I was talking to colleagues within the NASA medical hos Hospital complex and we saw children being shot at killed by snipers inside the hospitals from Israeli drones and quad drops with machine guns on them so you know the reality is it's all well and good talking about malnutrition and lack of aid but the real root cause is currently that there is an ongoing bombing bombardment uh continue attacks on hospitals destroying and decimating any sort of healthc care facility that could actually salvage some of these children and this is 100% man-made this is created by the Israeli state by the Israeli occupation forces and it's been compounded by the Egyptians not allowing Aid in as well and closing up the borders at Rafa we have to remember that this is multi-prong there are numerous agents at play here and whilst the Israelis are the perpetrators they are being egged on by the UK the US and some of the Arab countries unfortunately Fida if you were to give us a list of the top priorities for the people of Gaza in terms of humanitarian Aid what would be the main material that you would like to see coming to Gaza now um actually it's um it's a lots it's a backage of priorities let's say because after all of this time of um stopping all kinds of Aid to enter Then the priorities are accumulating if you want but the first and foremost priority is food people need to eat people need to drink people need to eat something beyond the canned food that's trickling in through the aid trucks people need fresh vegetables fresh fruits um eggs poultry things that that um have a nutritional um nutritional value to it not just to uh save their hunger so the the quality of the food to enter Gaza is an essential um and of course the priority is of more and more and more quantities of food to enter Gaza because the need is huge and the need is unmet and for people on the verge of a starvation of a famine so it's very essential how much food enters not only what food that does enter uh plus there is a need for clean drinking water for medication if you want because of the nutritional um um problems caused by the lack of food we Face uh so many diseases so many Health uh complications that need treatment as well they will not be treated by food entry alone so this and combined with the fuel U the cooking gas um equipment to be used also to cook the food because when you look in the ground um you don't find anything like there is no setup or there's a very we are reduced to a very primitive setup of making food actually so it's not enough to get um the materials or the ingredients to make a meal it's important to provide everything that you need to make an actual meal and put it uh in front of a family or starving kid Donella human rights groups have been accusing Israel of using starvation as a method of War what can be done now in terms of international humanitarian law to stop this practice from continuing for the upcoming days and weeks um I mean the legal tools are there um Israel's obligations are absolutely clear what is required this political will at the level of the International Community First of all for for those countries and and United States is obviously the key one but there are others too uh that are providing weapons to Israel um that allow the continuous bombardment of civilians and civilian infrastructures the weapons that are fueling the conflict so you know those weapon Imports should be stopped at once because there is ample evidence that they're being used in a manner that contrin International humanitarian law secondly again the those that are that have the influence on uh on the Israeli authorities need to put pressure to force Israel to comply with with its obligation to allow both humanitarian Aid and uh Imports into Gaza to stop targeting food production um um places such as uh uh Fields where uh food is being grown factories where food is being processed uh uh bakeries all the civilian infrastructure that has been a target from day one from the 7th of October but also from long before uh the population of Gaza was already in a in a very very dire humanitarian situation before the 7th of October and so the rate at which the situation has deteriorated is all the greater and there is only uh one thing you know there is only really one side that can change this equation and that is for Israel to be forced to comply with its obligation uh by its International allies that are providing it with um economic military and political support because clearly the Israeli authorities have shown that they are not um complying with international law and that they are violating international law on a daily BAS basis Omar you touched on the children malnutrition we're talking about more than a million people are stuck or stranded in the southern part of the of Raa living in uh tents with the risk of more disease spreading do you have any concerns that if there's no intervention in the upcoming days the situation could just further degenerate and become and spin out of control absolutely like I said we are seeing already the acute effects of U malnutrition of children having to eat animal feed in the north and middle of Gaza um this is you know these are deplorable conditions but they have been uh you know created by the Israeli States now the other thing to note and this is a really important Point people do not die from starvation instantly people when they are starved and stressed at long periods of time especially children under the age of two um they end up having essentially immuno compromise their immune system is compromised they are at much greater risk RK of dying from dial illnesses like chora which for sure is spreading in Gaza even if we cannot test for it uh they die from hepatitis they die from pneumonia chest infections there simple illnesses that should be preventable and should not lead to death become lethal in these conditions so the excess mortality rates which I suspect will number in the hundreds of thousands when the dust settles if the dust settles then I think this is where my great my gravest concern as a pediatrician is and also it's important to know any child who under the age of two goes through this period of acute malnutrition whether it's as a fetus or as a child they are essentially Limited in terms of their long-term Health outcomes these children will have lasting final impacts on their cardiovascular health on their risk of cancer on their risk of you know their ability to grow this is a Lost Generation of wounded children with no surviving family and children that have been stunted that have been malnutritioned that have been cognitively uh destroyed essentially by the Israeli War Machine FID uh Aid agencies are basically saying that there's been no trucks into Gaza for for about a week and that even during the uh the deal between Hamas and Israel 95 trucks were allowed when in normal times particularly before the war you 500 commercial and a trucks were allowed into the strip to deal with the needs of the people give us a sense of what are the local and international Aid agencies doing now when basically they have nothing to offer to the hundreds of thousands of people who are so desperate and anxious about what happens tomorrow actually um what we're trying to do as humanitarian workers is um is limited uh because all of our um uh Aid is coming from outside of Gaza uh what we're trying to do is to get basically uh the most important thing for us is to try to get uh what we have in the Egyptian side into Gaza to be able to organize distributions to people to be able to serve the people that we work with and that that as you said are desperate for support and for help uh what we're trying to do collectively is um try to coordinate whatever um small means we have from previous uh Aid entries into Gaza and uh to be able to reach as much as possible but I can frankly tell you it's nowhere nowhere near enough um we need an essential um root uh solution if you want for all of this uh there is a huge need uh for immediate release of the aid stuck into the Egyptian border and before that most important more important than that there is a huge need to seize fire to stop all of that so that we can reach people that we are unable to reach whether they are in the north of Gaza on the Gaza City or in the Border areas um there is a need also to be able to mobilize the local market or the local production of food because that also is a resource that that's completely cut since day one in the war Farmers aren't able to reach their lands aren't able to cultivate is no enough water there is no enough fuel to um to operate the bombs and the equipment they need for the agriculture so all of the local food production is almost um reduced to zero so there is a need to support that and of course we are trying to raise our voices we are trying to collectively tell the stories of The Starving people it's not um a completely humanitarian story it's a humanitarian result of of a bigger um War that's raging against people of Gaza people are being killed by so many means one of which is the survation of people it's been using it's it's been used as a weon of War since the start and it only continues so Dona the Israeli government has a unit the Kat which Le ases with the United Nations when when it comes to the um Aid and they say that basically they're not blocking aid but they're making sure that the aid is not going to end up being in the hands of Hamas and that they also would like to ensure that the Dual usage material does not enter into Gaza and can you believe it power generators crutches field Hospital kits are considered dual usage material is this against the law um the prevention of entry into the occupied territory by the occupying power of the means for essential requirements for the civilian population uh that is a breach of international humanitarian law uh it's a war crime as I said it's not uh only since the 7th of October that these restrictions have been imposed they have been imposed continuously for the past 16 years they have generally been increased at times when the violence and the confrontation as as uh has increased but those uh restrictions um unwarranted have been in place for 16 years and that's why Gaza was already in a coma situation when the 7th of October um situation changed with increased restrictions um so Kat knows perfectly well um what it should and and should not be doing um the requests have been ongoing um the the details about the terrible consequences for the civilian populations um are extremely uh clear so water um medicines food uh cannot be considered something that is that you know that can be with withheld from the civilian population um Israel has the possibility to check everything that goes into Gaza um it it is what it has been doing the fact that is just not allowing what is required is completely unacceptable I have many other issues to discuss with you so I appreciate if you can give me some short answers the health system has been completely decimated when United Nations and international agencies are saying we need urgent action to deal with the health system what do they mean by that what they should be meaning is that there needs to be a ceasefire an immediate and permanent ceasefire now to allow hospitals and hospitals be rebuilt supplies to go back in medical personnel to come in and help the exhausted Medics who are being targeted 400 of which have been whom have been killed and 100 are still in illegal detention and have been tortured when they've been uh detained uh as as you must be aware so what they mean is that we need supplies we need an end to the violence is preventing supplies froming it in and I think building on Don point it is crucial that to understand that the US and the UK are literally sending those arms that are bombing the hospitals so they are complicit in this genocide these are war crimes and that complicity will come back to haunt them Donatella with the future of Ona uncertain what kind of impact if it shuts doors in the future what kind of impact would that have on the humanitarian Aid operations in Gaza well any withdrawal of services um Health U humanitarian Aid education to what is actually the majority of the population in the Gaza Street would have absolutely disastrous consequences again I go back to the point that ultimately um Israel as the occupying power is legally required to provide all of the services Israel has not been doing so um the International Community mostly through un but also through International Aid organization has been doing that uh preventing um preventing that from from uh continuing to happen would have absolutely disastrous consequences um on the on the population adults and children especially because as the point was made already uh children are being impacted uh massively their their future is being being destroyed the equivalent of um 10 children a day uh have lost the limb about 1,000 children have lost limb since the beginning of the U of of this crisis so you can imagine you know what thank you what the requirements are unfortunately we'll have to leave it therea Omar ABD man and fidal really appreciate your time and insight thank you and thank you too for watching you can see the program
