Israel's prime minister insists the war on Gaza will continue despite growing anger over the Israeli Army's killing of three captives their families are demanding the government do more to ensure those held by Hamas are released so can a deal be agreed to free them and secure a new truce this is inside store [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm fully batibo Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again declared the military campaign in Gaza will not stop until Hamas is defeated but with more than a 100 Israelis being held by the group in the strip he's facing growing public anger and pressure to do more to secure their release to make matters worse Israel's Army says it mistakenly killed three Israeli captives as they were holding a white flag during a military offensive that's led to thousands of Israelis protesting in Tel Aviv the head of Israel's intelligence agency meanwhile mad has now met senior cies in Europe in another attempt to secure a prisoner swap so Canen Netanyahu agree a deal after failing to secure the release of all the captives and how is he dealing with their family's anger we'll discuss all this in just a moment but this report by Victoria gonb this was the message to the Israeli government from relatives of captives held by Hamas many at the protest in Tel Aviv are increasingly angry and frustrated at the government's strategy every day that passes is a danger to their lives I was there my daughter was there do not abandon the hostages we must act now a deal is required today bring them home now the killing of three captives by Israeli soldiers has shocked the country Israel's military says the men emerged from a building in Northern Gaza with one waving a white flag but two soldiers opened fire killing two instantly the third returned to the building and cried out for help in Hebrew but was also shot dead when he reemerged an Israeli military official says the actions were against our Rules of Engagement prime minister Benjamin yahu said the killing of the captives broke his heart we will learn and apply the lessons with all deep sorrow I want to make it clear the military pressure is necessary both for the return of the abductees and for achieving victory over our enemy more than 100 Israelis were released last month as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that was mediated by katar Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli jails as part of the deal the relatives of the captiv say the government must work towards another ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners wake up and uh go back to the Israeli moral code and make sure that these all the kidnapps are returned as soon as possible and that that should be the highest agenda and it should be done with negotiations relatives here welcome reports of a meeting between the head of Israel's intelligence agency mosad and katar's prime minister in Europe on Friday they say the government must do whatever it takes to bring all the captives back alive Victoria gonb for Inside Story let's now bring in our guests from Tel Aviv is Alan liel former director general of Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who's been part of a diplomatic team advising the captives families from London y meckelberg associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at chattam house and here in Doha is Sultan Barakat professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University gentlemen thank you all for joining us uh Alan leel in Tel Aviv let me start with you you're part of the Diplomatic team advising the families of the captives we heard prime minister Netanyahu say that he is uh heartbroken by uh the killing of these three captives which he called a akake but at the same time he said that Israel's uh war will continue in Gaza until its objectives are achieved what has been the reaction first of all of the families the contact between the Prime Minister and the cabinet and the families are going on all the time that quite tense everybody wants to release the hostages and the matter is most mostly priorities and timetable H the family is obviously put the release or exchange of hostages as the number one priority and the Prime Minister and cabinet put the removal of Hamas as the number one priority also the timetable is a big issue because there is a a fear a worry here in the cabinet that if we will do another stage of exchanging hostages and prisoners and it will take time H it will or enable the Hamas to get organized or to be the end of the war and they don't want to end the war so these are the dilemas here dilemas Alan but what do the families make of how the Israeli government is handling the situation uh you know they've expressed their grievances of course in meetings with the prime minister is the government showing any signs of empathy of compassion towards these families yeah definitely but the government believes at least claims all the time that the military pressure the military attacks of the Israeli Defense Forces are helping the release of the hostages the families say that otherwise the families say no they're endangering the hostages and so far the result last week was a tragic result of more bodies and no hostage released Although our forces are moving forward so the families expect a ceasefire diplomatic efforts serious talks under the mechanism that was already already established Qatar Egypt the United States and the SIDS and the government is in probably no Hur okay we'll come back to the talks in just a moment because indeed there is uh discussion of the talks resuming but under what terms it's unclear yet but y let me come to you and ask you about your thoughts uh as to what's happening inside Israel right now Israelis are stunned there's anger as we've seen in Tel Aviv after the killing of these three captives by the Israeli milit AR how much more pressure does this put on prime minister Netanyahu more than 70 days into this war and is the country as United and as uh fully behind this campaign in Gaza as it was in the early stages of the war thank you I try to unpack you know the questions the important question you asked me I think first of all it refers you know the empathy of course goes from all all quarters towards the families of the the hostages and the hostages themselves but as Alone says it's a matter of priority and it's become more and more apparent that continuing the war not having a ceire will and put under dangers severe dangers the the the hostages I whether it's the the bombardment or as we see what the the tragic mistake that took place on on on Friday so I think we need to separate now instead to put the hostages as number one priority and the war is as a secondary to it otherwise I'm I'm fearful for the fail of of the of of the of the hostages now we have to remember that right now the Israel government is a discredited one definitely the Prime Minister he was discredited you know even before the war let's bear in mind the demonstration the protest against him for embarking on on a on a Judicial so-called reform more Rec than than than reforms so at least half of the population probably more didn't so his his his policies as as as not legitimate and I think what happened past 7 October the see both not a legitimate and but also an incompetent prime minister while he's is is running a war that also discrediting Israel a b so I think at at at this point part of the problem is netan still in power and I think the voices to replace him are getting more cers than ever so he is under pressure Sultan Barakat your thoughts the Israelis admitting that their soldiers broke Rules of Engagement uh when they killed these three captives and the account of how the captives died has raised questions about the conduct of of uh the Israeli Army within Israel but of course the Palestinians will will tell you that this has already happened on several occasions when Palestinians who have been trying to flee were uh killed by the Israeli Army what would will you do you think think first of all will be the Fallout from from this incident for the Netanyahu government right well I think the incident first shown that as you rightly pointed out Israel does not take hostages Israel is not interested in taking prisoners from uh amongst Hamas they're interested in killing them off and this is the agenda of Netanyahu the other uh clear uh uh lesson I think is that the release of hostages is not netanyahu's priority either right from the very beginning had he had the intention of releasing the hostages the whole strategy would have been very very different uh what the what the position he finds himself in at the moment I think as a result of having engaged in the short pause end of November he has weakened his hand in a number of ways first of all he has now allowed U humanit assistance into Gaza and he could not turn off that t with the withdrawal from the talks that he did at the end of November until today the humanitarian system is going it's not going in the amount that everybody is is wishing for but it has been continued there are more than 40 United Nation International staff that has that have entered Gaza and are potentially increased liability for Netanyahu and in fact few days ago his own cabinet has approved under pressure from the United States to open uh K uh the crossing of Abu yeah and that in itself is is really has weakened his negotiation position uh situation in butan he he believes in the Israeli War cabinet believes that it was the ground operation and the pressure on Hamas that led to the first deal to return the captives and that's why they want to press on with their offensive because they believe it allows maximum pressure and leverage to strike further exchange deals what what do you think about that and and do you think that there can be a new deal uh with you know the the katar's reportedly meeting with the mosad chief in in Norway can there be a new deal and if there can be under what conditions well I don't agree with with his understanding that uh that violence is L Hamas to negotiate Hamas from day one their objective was to release their own prisoners from Israeli jails and they came out and said uh this is why we've captured these people we're willing to exchange and uh they've also offered from the very beginning to release uh the civilians and in particular the international uh passport holders uh to Greater extent they have met those objectives in terms of uh you know unon their word when the pose was was introduced uh but at the moment I think nahu again I think is in a very difficult position he's either uh he can continue killing more civilians and now he's edged on 20,000 Palestinians which is really turning the world slowly against him or he can seek another opportunity for negotiation I suspect one of the reasons why they are moving the talks to Oso or starting the engagement in Oso it's to help him climb down on his previous position he's now able to say that you know couldn't really do it again in DHA because DHA is the home for Hamas uh we are having we are forcing them to move elsewhere also from a Palestinian perspective now that they move into this second potentially second phase of negotiations they will be asking for much higher value Prisoners the ones that Netanyahu released earlier were mostly women and and young men and children who were really released on the same humanitarian basis because they were released in exchange for women and children held by Hamas let bring yeah I'll come back to the next phase but I think I'll bring in Alan to just uh respond to what you've just said there uh Alan Sultan says Netanyahu is under pressure will he seek another uh possibility to negotiate another deal you think to to secure the release of more captives oh obviously everybody's under pressure situation is horrible I would say um but regarding the hostages release as far as we know here the mechanism was not broken a Qatar is still interested many of us were not sure that Qatar will stay in the mechanism and without Qatar it cannot work because there is no a strong a tie direct tie to to Hamas and I think as as far as we know the mechanism is working now the sides have to be serious about it come with offers with offers the demand of Kamas as we know it is that they're ready to negotiate if the deal will be the final Act of the war if the deal of exchange of all for all all prisoners versus all hostages will end the war and on the Israeli side I think netan is backed here by the public that Israel cannot end the war at this stage so I think diplomacy can Bridge such a gap and we should sit and seriously discuss all the options and what worries me is that last time they were talking about almost every day we got more details on the mechanism on the method and now we hear nothing so I don't think they're seriously discussing the issue yet okay you'll see your thoughts about what uh Allan said there uh what what are netanyahu's options right now is their interest in securing a new deal and under what terms as far as the Israelis are concerned I think we saw that actually in the the first phase of it when there was a pose an exchange of of ostes for for prisoners actually the mechanisms work very well on the whole so I think we should go back that and we heard time and again from the the katar interlocutors that they are willing to continue this negotiating and bring the sides closer to together obviously it broke down the the negotiation broke down two weeks ago sadly so and and and the war was resumed but I think this point is to continue and and I think it's it's it's very important it's the more difficult negotiation because of the kind of hostages and and prisoners that are going to be released or discussed negotiated in in in in this in this negotiation what's called high valued prisoners but it's doable and all for all is still a possibility the only problem with it yes is there is a prime minister in Israel we were not so sure whether his personal motives are overtaking the the interest of the country and in this case of the hostages and the second thing is that the window for this to happen is closing as the war continues and in a smaller and smaller space I think the window of opportunity to to release the tiges and to reach a deal is closing very quickly uh Sultan your thoughts about what Yosi said there he said the all for all deal is still a possibility under what conditions would the Palestinian armed groups now agree to to uh another exchange of of prisoners for captives yes I think as as Now we move into exchange of soldiers because this is the majority of what remains with Hamas Are Soldiers be it women or men and as you know the last time the talks broken down because Israel wanted to pass or tried to pass some of the women hostages as just Fe civilian females and Hamas saw them as soldiers and that uh led to the breakdown of the talks now as they move into this critical phase they will be looking for their own high value prisoners to be released from Israeli prisons but for those there is there is a need for Guarantee of their safety and the fact that they will not be rounded up again Israel since they started the talks have rounded up thousands of Palestinians uh just since the 7th of October but those political leaders that are likely be on the list for Hamas uh there is a need for a third country to come in and try and work either relocation of some kind of guarantee for them because they need to get them out of reach of Israel now that's one of the reasons I suspect Norway is may may become involved in this given its very strong relationship with the US and the fact that globally it has been working very very closely with the US for a number of years Alan uh Sultan mentioned the us there and Netanyahu we heard in his news conference uh say that not even International pressure would prevent Israel from achieving its goals it he says and we have the US defense secretary back in the region uh in in these next few days after what appears to be a shift in tone from the Biden Administration do you think the Americans can still play a critical role here look I think we should separate here between the day after the war and the hostages regarding the day after the war the Israeli position is very different from the American Netanyahu says I will stay there until I have in fact I'm not quoting exactly a friendly leadership of Gaza and I don't think the Americans expect us to stay h one day after the war in any of the territory of Gaza this is a very big difference but when we come to the hostages the Americans can put a lot of pressure they have a leverage on the on the SS especially on Israel to create a a window of two weeks without even speaking if the war will continue afterwards and I don't think enough pressure is a applied on Israel regarding the hostages and if it is applied it is such in a such polite way that the Middle Eastern sides do not see it as any threat yeah Yos see uh do you agree with that I mean can the Americans put a a lot more pressure on Israel than they're currently doing when it comes to the hostage uh the the captives crisis and um what will you know what will they be saying to the Israelis right now even if Netanyahu says that he will not bow to International pressure yeah first I think yes the the United States has all the power to influence Israel and and probably more so than for a very long time United States supported Israel from day one of of of of this war from the from from the the very first day of the attack by Hamas on 7 October sent a aircraft carriers group to to the region supported with with amunition politically Vos in in in the security Council ceasefire resolution so all of this put it in a in a unique position to influence influence Israel however there is a huge dissonance between what the United States says and how it acts it says there is a need for it's a need for there is a there is a need to reduce the casualties more I but at the same time the way it acts is actually almost encourag Isel to continue and I think when this dissonance will will change and close then we can start thinking about a the end of the war and B the day after how Gaza is going to be governed yeah but but some us officials at the same time have expressed concern Yosi that some of netanyahu's positions on the war are rooted in a bid to prolong the conflict uh to prolong his political survival I should say and and he seems to suggest that he's going to go at this alone uh even if you know the US doesn't want him to but can he well no because he needs the support we see it even you know conducting war and bear in mind it's not only one front right now there is on a lower level there is a front in the north there is a front in in the west bank and to a certain extent also for you know what happens with with the hes I think this is that's where Israel needs the United States it doesn't mean that Israel should do everything that Washington ask is to do but at the same time it's almost inconceivable that that netan again to a large extent to his own personal interest to prolong the to prolong the war and in also to stay as a result in power would ignore completely the country that provides support political economic diplomatic Al through this period and obviously before and Israel will need the United States in in rebuilding Gaza in governance in ensuring security so I'm not so sure this is advisable for Israel to ignore the United States but I think the Biden Administration needs to step up its game sultan your thoughts can the US still play a critical role here of course I think the US is holds the key for for the whole situation at the moment I think with Christmas approaching very fast we're now less than 10 days maybe a week to Christmas be very difficult for the Biden Administration to justify the level of violence Netanyahu is conducting in in the Gaza Street also be very difficult for the families of the hostages to go through uh the Christmas period again having not been reunited internationally the perception of all this is is must be very very troubling and it must be part of the pressure on Netanyahu if you go back to the November the release happened on on Thanksgiving Day when it when the US was celebrating and that was really designed to give Biden a break uh so Netanyahu is very aware of what and how the US is finding itself more and more isolated internationally because of the way they vetoed in the security Council then they found themselves among a minority of 10 at the general assembly against the whole of the world not calling for an immediate ceasefire and he he he we all aware that he's trying to extend the war status he's interested and this is why he declared the war in the first place this is the first time since 1973 he practically hijacked the public op the public vote in Israel no one except for his manyi War cabinet can now take decisions on how he moves uh within uh within this conflict so it is in his interest to try and extend it as much as possible but it's not in the interest of the Israeli public it's not in the interest of the hostages or their uh families and the sooner I think he comes back back to the table to negotiate the release the better and think the pressure internationally is really mounting very very quickly Alan let me give you the the final word what what uh do you think might happen in the next few days are you hopeful are the families hopeful that they could be another deal to secure the release of more captives and a truce in Gaza ER the mood among the families is pessimistic I must say I personally hope that what happened to us with killing three of the hostages after they surrendered and showed us surrendering is a an unbelievable shock to the public I hope this tragedy will trigger a change in the priorities of the cabinet and I hope that H by the end of this week we'll have serious negotiations for the next phase of release and exchange thank you very much gentlemen for a very interesting conversation Alan leel Y meckelberg and Sultan Barakat
