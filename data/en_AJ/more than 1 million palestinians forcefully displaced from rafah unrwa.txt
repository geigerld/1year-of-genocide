so we begin in Gaza where more than 1 million people have been forced to leave Rafa in the South that's according to the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees Ana many of the displaced have had to move several times during nearly eight months of War Israel has been expanding its offensive in the southern city which it designated a safe Zone more than 3,500 children are at risk of dying of starvation that's according according to gaza's government it says they're suffering from malnutrition as critical humanitarian Aid and medical supplies for Gaza have been halted since Israel took control of the Rafa Crossing last month hospitals in Gaza are overwhelmed with patients in critical conditions Israeli strikes are continuing across the strip at least 28 Palestinians have been killed on Monday let's bring in our correspondent in darl Bala in central Gaza hany mmud hany you're standing there in front of a hospital tell us about the condition for doctors and for patients many of whom have been displaced several times yes Laura well by the hours we're looking at a Qui dire situations keep evolving to much more complexity inside this hospital we happen to be reporting from the courtyard of the only operational health facility in the Central Area been uh providing H uh services for not only the local residents but for all the displaced families from the past 8 months coming all the way from the northern uh part of the strip Gaza City and more recently uh influx of more displaced families from ra City and khun given the ongoing intense bombing campaign that keep uh pushing people into further internal enforce displacement adding more pressure on this particular Health Facilities doctors here inside the hospital we're talking about exhausted medical staff been working for the past 8 months stop they they suffer from the acute shortage of medical supplies for the most part we're seeing injuries and patients inside the hospital literally on the floor of the hospital because it simply ran out of space it it doesn't have the capacity to accommodate this large number of injuries and on top of that the the the patients and other cases a transfer from other hospitals just adding more pressure on everybody inside the hospital it's also important to uh point out that the the courtyard of the hospital turn into a displacement uh camp for evacuees from different parts of the strip literally wherever you walk here you would see T that set up by evacuees and displaced families inside the courtyard of the hospital posing more difficulties and challenges for paramedics civil defense the crew medical staff everything is quite uh facing a challenge uh to get a better picture of what's going on inside the hospital we're joined by uh Tia go chardo she is the director of the development from miglia uh Tia thank you so much for joining us uh what is the situation in hospitals in uh the situation in hospitals today is beyond catastrophic um what we've been witnessing since October is a complete systematic destruction of hospitals by the Israeli military starting in the north working their way all the way down to the South uh as you said Hy there are uh few operational facilities we've got one semi functioning Hospital behind us uh patients aren't able to access the health care that they need and doctors aren't able to provide the resources that they require in order to provide Healthcare Services Tia can you share with us your uh personal experience and how your work here has been going sure so uh Gia has been in Gaza providing uh support through medical delegations since February uh we've been bringing in international healthcare workers to assist in the hospital specifically we were helping in uh Rafa in t sutan Primary Healthcare Clinic and Emira hospital and I now have some emergency nurses here at aloa hospital and each delegation will be bringing in medical supplies with them uh medicine and equipment that were desperately needed but we're never enough uh I understand this is not your first time in Gaza you were here back in March and you're back again uh within the past couple weeks can you describe the scale of deterioration in inside the hospital the healthcare system in general sure yeah the situation has gone from bad in March to worse now uh so I was in Rafa when the evacuation orders were issued before the Israeli Army made its incursion into that area and what we saw was initially um at least uh hospital and healthc Care spaces that were being used by many many people we had a large influx of people into Rafa so these spaces were seeing about 1,200 patients a day once those evacuation orders were issued and about 900,000 Palestinians moved out of Rafa into the mo masasi area and up north those hospitals emptied out as well that didn't mean they didn't need the services they desperately needed the services but they were too afraid to go into the hospitals to seek those Services because everyone saw what happened in the North and nobody wants a repeat of that here in the South uh and so we had a lot of patients who were requiring healthare who weren't accessing it because they were afraid or they were on the move and couldn't access it because they were now displaced once again right we're talking about a population that has to move three four five times desperately in search of a better uh safer space that we all know simply doesn't exist yeah in light of what we're seeing now there's no lit up in the attacks no slowdowns meant by the Israeli military what are the major medical needs right now we just saw a few minutes ago injuries keep coming to the hospital what are needed right now in like major medical needs in Gaza yeah literally everything I cannot overstate what is needed every single item is required in these hospitals I mean we're looking at people who have chronic cases for example people who are suffering from cancer who cannot access their medications we have people who have kidney failure who cannot access the resources that they need in order to to sustain their life and then combine that with the high amount of trauma cases that we're seeing in these hospitals and they don't have the gauze they don't have the splints they don't have the tnes to treat these patients but I think it's also important to note that personally I don't think that what the hospital needs are more of things what they actually need is a cessation of things they need to stop to things they need to stop to this war right as soon as this war ends and we can open up the borders then the solutions begin to flood and then we can get the aid then we can get the humanitarian workers then we can help give a break to these exhausted and traumatized healthcare workers Dia thank you so much thank you so as we heard from the director of development from Gia the situations are Beyond catastrophic it's a perhaps better describe as a crisis above emergence inside health facilities and we see it every day inside the corridors of this Hospital right here in D balah City where people are on the floor of the hospital or in overcrowded rooms uh and with the inability to intervene and provide a proper Health uh services and intervention it's becoming very very difficult to sustain the operations of these hospitals hanim Mahmud in central Gaza there for us thanks very
