it looks like the end for gaza's already baged Zoo now reduced to Rubble this once housed around 100 species we announced the two appeals at least for the community International Community and the Red Cross and the UN but unfortunately the Israeli forces didn't allow us to reach the place uh and in one case uh when two brave men of our staff tried to reach the the zoo they have been targeted targeted directly and one of them was injured only able to reach the zoo when the ceasefire began many animals died of dehydration and starvation While others died in the air strikes few were left alive 90% of the animals died here this is a dead baboon here starved to death and this B Pony here uh almost starving uh the zoo is uh mainly entertaining and uh for educational purposes and entertainment for school children this lion here hasn't eaten in more than 3 weeks it's almost starving we found around the ground of the zoo is littered with shells the hyenas are dead the wolves are dead there is only one wall it's clearly terrified petrified it hasn't stopped going to th all the animals around it are dead these are three Palestinian foxes they are also dead they're very rare types of foxes even if the ceasefire is extended the Damage Done to cultural places like this zoo and the loss of rare species is permanent imin Kimber Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
