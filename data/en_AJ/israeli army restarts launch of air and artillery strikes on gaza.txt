and thank you so much DSA Jabari live for us uh we just had to cut that short because we're seeing the night sky be lit up by air strikes in the Gaza Strip this conflict is now almost hitting two days and we had expect expected such a flare up that is a live picture of the Gaza Strip as we head into the second day of this conflict on Saturday morning Hamas launched a wave of Rocket attacks and Fighters stormed into Israel it was the deadliest day in 50 years we've just had word that more than 700 Israelis have been killed in this conflict in the past 48 hours and 370 Palestinians fighting between the two sides continues hundreds of civilians that is quite an incredible scene there that we are seeing bright fire lighting up the sky of Gaza let's just see if there's any sound that we can hear on on that feed okay we don't have any sound on that audio um we have heard that the Israeli government has declared allout war and and those are pictures that we're seeing of a declaration of war civilians 2.3 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip and as we're watching those pictures unfold I want to bring in alzer's senior political analyst marwin bashara who joins us live from Paris we've mentioned that the knesset has declared all out War but you would argue Marwan that the war has been going on for decades well the conflict certainly has been going on for decades and clearly uh the 55e occupation is by definition a system of violence uh it's a very violent system perhaps it's slow violence uh the kind of violence that the camera for the international media cannot catch on a moment to moment and day-to-day basis because it's not exactly dramatic it doesn't make for good TV but clearly an occupation that goes on for 50 years plus that continues to repress people in their daily lives is uh you know quite violent in comparison to this it's of course very different this is very dramatic the images the people uh killed captured injured and so on so forth right and so of course when it bleeds it leads and I think one of the uh one of the um goals objectives of provocations of that nature where they do lead to bloodiness of that it's usually people or organizations who are totally in in invisible to make themselves visible one of the uh one of the objectives of uh in an asymmetrical conflict is for the weaker party to make itself known to make itself present to make itself uh to impose itself if you will on the political agenda in the region and Beyond Maan we knew that Israel was going to increase its level of attacks it had urged the evacuation of people near the Gaza Strip we're seeing strikes from the air on our screen at the moment The Dark Knight sky has been lit up by these recent air strikes more than a dozen I would estimate over the past hour what else could we see in terms of a military response from Israel is it likely that we could see it invading from the ground I we must emphasize once and again and it's probably going to be with us for the next few days we might as well start this is not not a conventional war and if you uh and the rest of our viewers around the world are watching what are we watching exactly it's night and the Israelis are bombarding and that's the end of that this is this this phase of this war as it were right is Israel is bombarding basically an open prison called Gaza now of course Hamas which is basically de facto in control there have carried the attack yesterday and does shoot Rockets towards Israel but it is the kind of asymmetrical Warfare in the in the sense that Hamas is not an army Gaza is not a state and we don't have something that is symmetrical between two equal parties we have a we have a very Advanced very powerful country a nuclear power country Israel on the other hand we have a gorilla movement a Liberation movement of sort that basically uh exists in this um you know open prison this refugee camp called the Gaza Strip so hamash did interrupt you there only because we're seeing quite incredible scenes coming from Gaza who do stand by that was marwin bashara our political editor for Al jazer let's bring in Tarak Abu AUM who is actually live on the scene in Gaza Tara can you explain what you're hearing witnessing seeing right now the uh Israeli occupation forces are targeting different areas in the northwest of the Gaza Strip now the occupation forces are adopting and applying the principal and the strategy of the fire belt in which the Israeli occupation uses it to generally facilitate the process of its ground Invasion by destroying every single area close to the borders specifically in the areas that are considered to be Eastern and close to the adjacent also settlement uh in retaliation to the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip the Palestinian resistance started launching bages of rockets towards the Israeli uh cities uh as we can clearly right now see in the Gaza Strip the sky of the Gaza Strip is witnessing various kinds of clashes exchanging fires between both parts now the the the process and the level of tension is accelerating and spiking rapidly without any gradual uh let's say de-escalating for the current uh situation now as we can see as we can clearly hear right now the sound of the Israeli uh fire uh jets that are uh hovering inside over the the uh the sky of the Gaza Strip and are launching different kinds of air strikes now different areas as a can right now here that have been targeted extensively by the occupation air raides now and if you can concentrate it on the scene in every single place in the Gaza Strip you'll find out there is a fire hole that has been uh generally uh made by the Israeli occupation Air Forces do you have any concept of what the targets are at this stage can you see which buildings have been hit actually the uh the targets considered to be uh residential houses that are closed to the Eastern borders of the Gaza Strip in which uh the majority of its dwellers have been evacuated uh after receiving notifications from the Israeli Army to evacuate these places now usually this approach has been applied by the Army in order to ease the process of the ground Inc crusing into the Gaza Strip after this comes generally after the uh press release that had been uh stated by the uh Israeli uh ministers and the Israeli Chief ministers who said that now it's the time for war inside the Gaza Strip so I think clearly and uh everyone uh can see that the uh level of escalation now is getting much more higher and the coming hours might be really hard for Palestinians we always knew that it was going to be a tense evening that people in Gaza were going to have to prepare for a tense night ahead what if anything can they do to protect themselves from an onslaught such as this now uh uh all of the uh let's say 70% of the gazans are now uh let's say secured in the houses they just don't have any safe shelter except the owner of school which now had been uh fully uh filled with the uh displaced uh Palestinians who evacuated the houses uh earlier uh this day and uh the majority of them they have uh now no hope except like they want to live uh in their houses peacefully being away from the Israeli strikes but Main in fact now the Israeli strikes are everywhere inside the Gaza Strip every single Corner in the Gaza TP night now witness different kinds of strikes which really uh give the uh great and general impression that the situation will witness massive deter within coming days T um I just want to give a recap to our audience who's just joining us what we know at this stage is that the number of Israelis killed has increased to 700 since Hamas launched its biggest attack on Israel on Sunday hundreds of civilians and soldiers have been shot and killed as Fighters stormed in uh there are towns and cities in Israel which have been infiltrated by Hamas uh and the Palestinian group has breached the Gaza barrier at several entry points what we're seeing now is Israel targeting Gaza and I want you just to paint a picture of what's happened in the past hour or so how many strikes have you heard and seen and what do you think that the the targets are uh generally uh the numbers of a strike had been intensified during the early beginning of this day like it passed more than hundreds of strikes that had been targeted on uh civilians inside the Gaza Strip uh some kinds of let's say the the quality and the kinds of targets were uh were varied from uh residential Towers uh commercial Banks uh shops and even civil infrastructure besides targeting some uh military uh sites that belong to the uh Palestinian militant groups and it's important to mention that uh 90% of the uh political and military leaders of the militant groups houses have been targeted by the early by the occupation Air Forces since the the beginning of this conflict it seems that the situation uh is really spiking despite the fact that uh Regional mediators are trying to convince both parts to self-control and to deescalate the wave of tension I'm just hearing uh on your microphone there Turk that there's just been another explosion if we can just take a wide shot I want to see if we can how close that is to you all right uh I will now ask the the cameraman to to take for a wide shot for the Gaza trip right now actually you can just move it to the to that place uh or to the to this side to see the level of explosions that really took place uh due to the uh to the corner of the to the Ang we're just going to go to a quick break before we go to our next program you're watching El jazer and our rolling coverage of the conflict between Israel and Gaza do stay with us
