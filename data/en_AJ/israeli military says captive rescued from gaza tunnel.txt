the Israeli Army says this video shows the moment G faran aladi was rescued calling it a complex rescue operation however other reports suggest that he was alone with no captives or no captives which seems to contradict the military statement and suggests he had been released or escaped prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to call it a success welcome home Farhan aladi I commend the IDF and the ISA for another successful rescue operation we're working relentlessly to return all of our hostages we're doing this in two main ways negotiations and rescue operations the two of these together require our military presence on the ground and constant military pressure on Hamas we will continue to act until we return all of them home the hostages Family Forum the umbrella organization that represents the families of Israeli captives was critical saying Netanyahu simply isn't doing enough to get a ceasefire and to bring the captives home Kai's family a bedin a community long discriminated against by Israeli authorities according to local human rights groups that have long criticized Israel's destruction of bedin villages and homes today though a feeling of relief that he's back safe and wishes that the 108 remaining captives would also be home soon this party and this happiness will be for all the hostages we hope that it will come for them today before tomorrow that there will be a deal already and all the hostages will be released and all the happiness that we feel is felt by all the families and parents of the hostages according to the Israeli Army 33 of the remaining captives are dead with ceasefire talks bogged down and Israel insisting on changing the structure of a de an immediate ceasefire seems unlikely so whilst this release is being celebrated for captive family the only serious option ahead is a truce similar to the one last November which led to 105 captives being exchanged for Palestinian prisoners Imran khaner make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
