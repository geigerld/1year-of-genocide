let's bring in al jazeera's senior political analyst now marwan bashara who joins us by skype from paris marwan thanks so much for being on the program as we've been hearing there's this almost feeling of anticipation that things could escalate quickly why haven't we seen hamas get involved yet and will it well actually this depends on what happens the next day or two what we've heard earlier today from the israeli head of intelligence about the need for israel to wrap it up as aware because there's a sense that if the israel the israeli air force continues to bombard gaza that hamas will have to get involved and in that case then we are talking about a wider war but if as it's claimed the israeli forces have accomplished as it were their mission by killing more palestinian leaders and terrorizing the gaza strip and they will wrap it up or start winding it down then we could see an end to it in few days uh with israel probably taking credit for that in terms of uh allowing the egyptians to also take some credit for mediating a so-called ceasefire so this is a very sensitive moment now it could lead to wider war or it could lead to wrapping it up it's basically up to the israelis at this point in time as the head of the intelligence said for them to wrap it up yes speaking of the israelis where do you think they sit with all of this have they effectively made the point that they wanted to make well you know this is part of a continuous aggression against gaza and every time it comes under different pretext or justification this time it is going after al-jihad or as the israelis birth the iranians supported islamic jihad in gaza in a preemptive operation to deter them from carrying terrorist attack this is the israeli pretext that's the israeli warding as it were of course it is part of a long pattern and that pattern goes on not just a decade or two it goes on over five decades for some of us who as you were emily uh covering the war in ukraine it's been going on for five plus months under similar pretext uh terror uh preemption invasion punishment and of course resistance to foreign occupation and so on and so forth it's been going on for five plus months and it angered the entire world and and basically the west the enlightened democracies are up in arms about what's going on in ukraine five plus months but in gaza this has been going on for 50 plus years 50 plus years of more of the same israel using the same pretext justification about combating terror about protecting its population while at the same time occupying aggressing terrorizing an entire people so in terms of this particular operation they say they go they went after some leaders of our assets of the islamic jihad they terrorized gaza and the process gaza that has over 50 percent under the age of 16 50 percent of the population and we're talking about a population that is an absolute majority of refugees and their descendants terrorizing once again there's a certain sadism to it all so if israel thinks that its sadistic mission is over with the killing of so many and the terrorizing of countless people well yes you could say it is this time around all right well we certainly be watching this space we appreciate your insights as always marwan bashar al jazeera senior political analyst thank you
