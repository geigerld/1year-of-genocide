well there has meanwhile been no letup in Israel's bombing campaign and the humanitarian crisis is growing by the minute in central Gaza Israeli air strikes have again targeted a market in the nerat refugee camp dozens have reportedly been killed and injured it was the only Market left that people relied on to buy their supplies in the north power has now been restored to the Indonesian hospital as you can see it went dark after running out of fuel but the ministry has warned that a total collapse of the health system is imminent and more Palestinians have been killed in overnight air strikes that targeted the jabalia and alhatti refugee camps the health Ministry says many of the casualties there were women and children since this War Began on October the 7th nearly 5,800 Palestinians have now been killed in Gaza according to the health Ministry in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces have killed 96 Palestinians over the past two weeks and in Israel the government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's military operation well we have two of our correspondents currently in the Gaza Strip Han abuba is there for us in the South standing by in KH yunas but first let's speak to yumna alide she's in Gaza City outside the alifa hospital yumna we know that alifa hospital is the largest in Gaza the bombardments have been continuing how is everyone holding up there well Nastasia as you can see here in AA Hospital this area behind me now is being prepared to be the emergency department in the hospital after the hospital has announced that the emergency department is completely uh full Inc capacity and there is no space neither in the reception nor in the emergency department empty to receive injuries so now they are Sheltering this uh this yard or the premises of the the hospital in front of me the empty space of this uh hospital and uh they're Sheltering it and they're preparing it with patient beds in a few hours now it's going to be filled with patient beds where they can receive those injuries coming right from the uh or or escorted by the ambulances to the hospital while the hospital from the inside continues to suffer with a lack of fuel the ICU units and the incubators uh for carrying uh premature children are under direct uh life-threatening danger uh as the fuel is completely running out of the hospitals the hospital has also been trying to run few of the Departments it has on solar uh panels and solar energy but that uh the the consuming or the power needed to run those departments is huge and the solar panels that are available are too little this is how the situation continues to develop in the uh in time inside the hospital you know we know that no fuel has come in on any of the 54 Aid trucks that have made it into this strip but do you know if if any of the other suppliers have made it to alifa we were told by the Red Cross that they have taken all the medical uh supplies and AIDS that were uh medications sorry to be specific about what was sent what was sent was medications in that humanitarian Convoy to uh the Ministry of Health and that the Ministry of Health will be the one Distributing it to the hospitals but also the Red Cross has told us that the hospitals of the north and Gaza City are in D need to a lot of medications and medical resources and uh uh other Machinery medical uh devices and Equipment here uh where they have completely run off or run out of of supply and that the supply that they already had was completely used and even given to other hospitals so even if the medications had been distributed to uh hospitals like a shifa if that is what the Ministry of Health has been saying that it's going to distribute it to all hospitals of the strip it's still saying that these medications are the least to be provided or as they say coating them are just a drop in an ocean of the need of these hospitals in the Gaza Strip and the needs are so huge Y El there for us outside alifa Hospital in Gaza City thank you than you so much yumna well let now let's now speak to Han abua he joins us from KH yunes now that's in the the south of the Gaza Strip honey the bombardment has been continuing through the night in both Southern and Central Gaza Strip can you describe what you've been seeing also just in the last few hours yes well the mass bombardment and air strikes continue to create more tragedies among Palestinians in the southern part of the Gaza Strip the part that was was designated as a safe area for Palestinian to evacuate to to only people finding themselves under massive bombardment and heavy artillery Shilling well the scene from the hospital where I'm reporting from Naser hospital is the second largest public health facility in the city of KH Unis is no different than the scenes of FIFA complex um with the two strikes in the past an past hour or so the hospital is overwhelmed with large number of casualties so the first air strike targeted a residential home next to uh the uh Palestinian red Crossing Society five people pronounced it right at the spot but there are more people under the rebels and with keeping that in mind the number of people who are killed is expected to rise and just 20 minutes after that strike in the back street of the red Cresent the Palestine pres Society another residential home was targeted without a warning the house as we were told by our source was full of people evacuees in addition to the owner of the building who hosted the people who ran from the northern part and Gaza to the city of KH yunes uh we did walk a little bit in the the hospital course door and it's only little space for you your footstep it's not the the the situations are overwhelming and we we we think the hospital is on a brink of a catastrophe very very soon you speak there about being on the brink of a catastrophy we know that the the aid needs are huge now we were talking about the 54 trucks that have made it into the Gaza Strip that was explicitly intended for the south is anyone receiving that in conun well so far we the the plan or the mechanism of how these are going to be delivered are unknown and there seems to be secrecy on the process of how these AIDS are going to be delivered that could be in abiding by whatever preconditions the Israeli government uh put forward to the United Nation as the official body managing uh the process of human Arian aid but we we know uh in in in a short while ago we knew about uh that the the Red Cross will be the official body responsible for Medical Aid to reach hospitals it is only the hope of so many people that this will reach a cha hospital because we know that all Aid are have limited uh geographical parameter they're all intended to the South H abua there with that report from us for us from kanun thank you Hy
