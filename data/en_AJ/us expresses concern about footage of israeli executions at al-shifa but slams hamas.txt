and we are taking you live to the US state department now where they're holding a press conference let's listen in protected sites uh but it is concerning that after Israel had conducted an operation earlier in this campaign to clear alifa that alifa again was apparently infiltrated by Hamas Fighters and so two things about that one look obviously we um uh it would be great if Hamas would stop hiding behind civilians and stop uh hiding inside civilian infrastructure including hospitals but two it points out what we have been saying all along which is the need for Israel to have a sustainable long-term strategy when it comes to Gaza uh that it's not enough to just clear certain neighborhoods or hospitals or any other uh Geographic areas or buildings of of Hamas they need to have a long-term sustainable strategy that is not just a security strategy but also a political strategy if they really want to uh secure the future of Israel against the terrorist threat that has so to date emanated from Gaza right so you don't have any any comment on what you've seen from the aftermath of the two we operation against the hospital not beyond what I just and then when you should say and this will be it for me um when you say um Israel needs a sustainable long-term strategy for Gaza have you seen one yet from them uh we have not yet seen one no and that's what we have been in conversation with him about but presumably the meeting today is just about Rafa right it's just about it's just about Rafa and the and the point I mean a sustainable long-term strategy means something Beyond a military strategy it means a political path as well so political path to two states that that is that is our preferred that is our preferred policy but you a political path of but have you but have you seen one from the Israelis that is even that is even short of at this point we have not known though all right thank you just follow on elifa um Israel has given some numbers 200 militants uh have been killed 900 suspected militants detained of whom some 500 have been identified as Somas does the United States have any assessment that these numbers are correct we don't have an independent assessment no do you have an assessment M on how many civilians around that operation have been killed we do not okay um moving on to this strike this suspected Israeli strike in Damascus do you have anything to say on this I don't obviously just happened in the the hour or two before I came out here we are in conversations with Partners in the region Gathering more uh information but uh at this point don't have a confirmation either of the Target or the responsible party do you know if the United States was given a heads up by Israel about this again we are gathering information I don't have anything about the strike right now I don't have anything beyond that to offer okay do you have any concerns that this might sort of escalate tensions which are already high so and way endanger the hostage talk anyway so I don't want to before we have gathered information about what exactly this was I don't want to speak to it uh specifically but of course we are always uh concerned about um uh about anything that would be escalatory or um cause an increase in conflict in the region has been one of the goals of this Administration since October 7th to keep the conflict from spreading recognizing that Israel has the right to defend itself from adversaries that are sworn to its destruction um but with respect to the hostage talks there's no reason why this incident should have any impact on on the hostage talks uh we have long believed it is uh in the interest uh of everyone to see these hostage talks succeed because you would not just see um uh a relief to the civilian population in Gaza that desperately needs it uh it would enable the increase in humanitarian assistance into Gaza and of course it would get the hostages out so no I I don't know I don't believe it should have any impact on this can you say how those talks are going I don't have any new assessment to to offer today okay two final things this is about last uh this is from last week about these um authorizations of uh these bombs to to Israel they have been approved a long time ago by Congress but looks like state department has decided to uh do the transfers last week the week before um why was that decision taken like recently let me I think it would be helpful to step back and put this in a little context um and the context is that we the United States has a decades long commitment to Israel's security uh Israel is surrounded by entities that are sworn to its destruction not just Hamas but Iran uh and proxy groups that Iran sponsors Hezbollah among them who have repeatedly talked about their desire for the destruction of Israel We Believe Israel has every right to defend itself against those opponents um and we to that end have a longstanding security relationship with them where we provide them more than $3 billion annually in security assistance now the way that that works um and I know you preface this in in in your question but just for for the benefit of everyone else the way that that works is we provide them with $3.3 billion a year in uh security assistance they don't always draw all of that down in any given year but they uh come to the United States request certain defense articles um we make assessments about whether those are appropriate or not we notify them to Congress in the regular course of business and oftentimes what happens let's say uh just as an example this is a fictional example let's say they requested a 100 planes um we make a decision we notify Congress that doesn't mean that they take a 100 planes tomorrow once that notification has been given and once the approval has been given they draw those down over time and sometimes it takes years to fulfill those requests and so those are those are the types of things that I see you wanted to to go bear bear with me I know I I know this is long and then you'll have the opportunity for followup um those are the types of things that often take years to fulfill and they were happening before October 7th and they have continued after October 7th so what these about these are about uh in many cases are about self-defense but also deterrence and replenishment and so we make these in the regular course of business and what I can tell you about them is that we follow these same procedures uh with respect to everyone that we do for every other country in the world which is that we notify Congress and in fact since October 7th we have gone above and beyond to notify Congress about uh these transfers there is a statutory thresold where we are required to to um notify them of transfers we have been regularly briefing the Committees to let to to make them aware of every transfer that that we are making so I'm going to have to combine my questions now that you've taken up so much time to answer I understand I would apologized but You' believe I'm just joking first take your time I understand the fulfilling can take years but are you basically saying that the authorization of the transfer coming in these recent weeks was a coincidence uh so I I'm not saying it's a coincidence that Israel has been engaged in a military conflict and of course when you are engaged in a military conflict you deplete your military stocks so there was a request for for the additional fulfill for the Fulfillment of particular we as is always the case I'm not getting into the timings of of exact requests from here just I'll be quick it's a but this is a process that we keep Congress fully apprised of our relevant committees um but but when you see these types of requests and when they get publicly reported you have to remember that Israel is in an armed conflict and is is um expending a great deal of Defense material and some of that needs to be replenished for Israel's long-term security right and my final thing on this is like secretary and a lot of senior officials from this Administration basically said far too many Palestinians have been killed but when you go and make the and we know that the administration's policy hasn't changed it is not conditioning weapons to Israel but when you go and make such an authorization of the transfer in recent weeks even if the actual weapons transfer has been approved years ago don't you think that is going to damage the weight of your word the your credibility and basically your sincerity and saying that part to many pal so I do not agree with that at all we have been very clear that we want to see Israel do everything it can to minimize civilian casualties we have uh made clear that they need to do every that they need to operate at all times in full compliance with International humanitarian law at the same time we are committed to Israel's right to self-defense and this is a long-term commitment the United States has has made that it made before October 7th and that continues uh uh in it continues since October 7th so it obviously the fight in Gaza is connected to Israel's long-term Security in very substantial ways I got into some of that with with response to Matt's question um but Israel still faces uh on in addition to the security challenge posed with in Gaza it still faces an Iran that is hostile to Israel it still faces Hezbollah on its northern border that is hostile to Israel and says it is committed to the destruction of Israel and so we are going to continue to support Israel's ability to defend itself against those sworn enemies that want to see it it end as a modern state or a state at all just to follow of a 200000 pound bomb is is self-defense in your opinion it is a it is a um uh so they need to have the ability to defend themselves against a very well-armed adversary like I said Iran Hezbollah which has thousands and thousands of Fighters and quite sophisticated uh material and quite sophisticated weapony as we've seen them deploy excuse me against Israel in the last few days so yes they do need the the the modern military equipment to defend themselves against in Gaza before beginning in Gaza and we have made clear to them that when that whatever um whatever weapon they use in Gaza be it a bomb be it a tank round be at anything that we expect them to use those weapons in full compliance with International humanitarian law and we have set an we have had very Frank conversations with them about the fact that there far too many civilians have died through their operations and that they need to do better in taking into account uh the need to minimize civilian harm and we'll continue to do that just on that point um okay took the requests were done years ago what have you but this time around you're suspiciously very careful not to publicize it um usually you do the notifications to Congress you do a you know statement but have this time I understand you didn't need to do it because I just say we did notify Congress weze it so it is not usually you do on on arm sales and all that you you you publicize it so that's not true with respect to most arm sales around the world I know people have gotten used to our um uh the tempo of arm sales with respect to Ukraine but that is very a very different situation than our arm sales to Israel or any other country with which we have a security relationship because we stood it up from nowhere right before an active War where most of our security relationships we don't publicize uh our ongoing sales what we do is we notify Congress about those sales and we have done that with respect to these sales to to Israel um as we do with respect to sales anywhere in the world okay just the last question on back on Damas uh I understand it's it's a bit early but obviously you don't deny there was a strike by Israel on the Consulate in the Annex in in the the embassy of Iran in Damas so we've seen the strike but again I want to uh I want to let the consultations that we have ongoing with Partners in the region take place uh before we can before I comment any further but it's definitely escalatory that's not what I said either I said no I'm saying that uh sure saying that I thought it was a question I'm asking for your reaction so J kind of kind of that's that's good her kind of did speak to this um I'm not going to comment with respect to this particular strike um because again we just need to know more information about it before we do and that includes drawing any conclusions from it as a general principle of course we were worried about escalation we were do worried about anything that would cause the conflict to to expand or widen in any way I have one on Havana couple let me come back let me come back to you so the room doesn't go into an uproar s definitely thank you Matt now you said that Hamas returned to aifa hospital there's some 800 Fighters and so on all these things now is that you are you are citing the Israel narrative or you have your own independent we don't have our own independent assessment but you have seen Israel produce the names the names photographs of known Hamas fighters who it has killed or how many I mean you know they showed names and Hamas fighter sh hospital I have I have seen the information they have publicly released I just I know you get let me just I'm not I'm not interrupting I'm trying to understand so we have seen them release I I I don't think uh there's anyone who has caused to dispute that yes they have uh there were there were uh Hamas Fighters hiding in alifa hospital again not for the first time okay so you are certain that the reason that Israel went into H into AA Hospital one more time is because Hamas Fighters were there and not you know hundreds of civilians that have taken Refuge there so I think it is a uh certainly a fair inclusion given what has been their goal since the outset of this campaign to take the fight to Hamas uh that is exactly what they were doing you believe that Israel has achieved that goal now by eliminating Hamas are we likely to see them go back to ASA hospital again so that is I answer that question somewhat in response to Matt I think there is a concern that you saw Hamas back inside hospitals I don't know why I don't hear more people calling on Hamas to stop going into hospitals you shouldn't have to clear Hamas from a hospital once let alone twice um but yes we do have the the the concern that uh Hamas has been able to reestablish itself in a hospital um that Israel had already cleared and that points to an ongoing challenge for Israel in the way it conducts its operations right yeah just bear with me a couple more uh questions you know so but why do you think in your opinion what value is there strategically for Israel to burn all the building destroy all the equipment destroy every last tray machine and everything in the hospital and not keep it you know if their fight is with the fighters why must you destroy as they left they were you know there was no fighting when they left just to to burn the buildings and burn the things and destroy everything so let me just say why is that so why is that okay let me just say this gets into where uh I'm often asked to comment on on to questions where there are conflicting accounts right and Israel has said that is not what they did and we don't have ground Truth uh on on that question Israel has said what they tried to do is protect patients and not operate in places when there are patients to Evac evacuate people from the hospital and only operate in a way um that would impact the Hamas Fighters that were there obviously it's an incredibly difficult situation there shouldn't be terrorists in a hospital at all and so it's incredibly difficult to operate there and and uh achieve a legitimate counterterrorism goal in a way that minimizes harm to the to patients which goes back to my first point which is Hamas shouldn't be in a hospital at all okay well Hamas shouldn't be as far as you know Israel and the United States is concerned should not be there period but I would think s everyone could conclude I I would think including you I would think everyone could conclude that Hamas should not be inside I don't think I don't think I hope anyway that that's not a controversial opinion well okay but that's that's a different issue altogether now not really not really no it's kind of the core of what we're talking about okay uh let me ask you something you you you talked about the 2,000 found bombs uh and so on you think that it is really wise to send it at this time you know when this far in this battle you know or this war it has only been used in Gaza I mean I know you say that Israel is surrounded by uh you know people that wish it will and so on but in fact it's surrounded by Egypt with very good relations with Israel surrounded by Jordan with good relations with Israel surrounded by Syria that is obviously involed in its own Civil War and can't even defend it itself against attacks as we have seen today so quite the contrary is Israel is surrounding Hamas and it's using these weapons to do that and in fact I mean you know the F35 to the best of my knowledge I could be wrong has only been used in combat against the people of Gaza so how could you justify sending all these weapons when you have the most helpless people probably on Earth you know destroyed moving from one place to another and so on and you send these weapons to sort of just the job or continue the job I don't know what logic is there in sending those weapons so the logic is exactly what I outlined a moment ago despite the fact that Israel has a relation has diplomatic relations with Egypt uh and Jordan it does not change the fact that Hezbollah is parked on its northern border and is sworn to the destruction of Israel it does not change the fact uh that Iran uh uh no not exactly not right on its border but well within Striking Distance is committed to the destruction of Israel and continues to fund proxies so yes Israel faces incredibly s serious threats not just from Hamas although Hamas is clearly one as we saw on October 7th but from other adversaries uh that it needs uh our assistance uh to continue to defend itself against Lastly lastly please just one one last one if I may are you aware of a report made or a conversation that Israeli officers made to an interview with har where they say that Israel established some sort of legionary you know killed zone line and so on are you aware of that and they actually kill whoever walks or moves about in that area I I read that article and I noted that in it the IDF says that that that of course is not what they have established there are of course areas of significant combat where uh any civilian could wander in and be the the um unfortunately be killed either by fire from Israel or by fire from Hamas if you walk into an active conflict Zone that's a possibility but I I have noted that the ID have said they have of course established kill zones it would be incredibly inappropriate for anything like that to be established and we've not seen evidence at this point that they have go ahead I'll come to next uh there there's reporting that Israel submitted a plan to the UN that would essentially dismantle unra uh transferring staff and funds to world food and some other organizations have you seen that plan do you support it uh I have not seen that plan I can't speak to whether somebody inside the United States government has we continue to support the work that unra does uh both in Gaza and and uh uh in the broader region we think that they play a critical role in delivering humanitarian assistance to people who who need it now the United States cannot fund unra by Statute now given the recent action by Congress so we are exploring ways that we can direct the humanitarian assistance we are committed to providing the Palestinian people through other organizations uh and we look forward to identifying ways to do that in continuing to support humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians um but that does not mean that that um we do not also support his work we want to see it continue uh mat today the canes passed the law 7 to10 voting to pave the way for the closure of all Al jazer offices inside Israel I just wondering if you have a comment so we support the independent Free Press anywhere in the world and we think the work that the independent Free Press does is important everywhere in the world and much of what we know about what happened in Gaza is because of reporters who are there doing their jobs including reporters from Al jazer um I'll say just with with respect to Al jaer obviously we you know I think it's well known that we've not always agreed with all of alzer's coverage but it's a media organization that we engage with I've done interviews with Al jazer other people from the Department have done uh interviews with Al jazer so um what we will continue to make clear is that we support the work that the Free Press does our assessment with that uh passage of this law and previous incidents went to our crew in Gaza that uh this like enhanced our suspicion from the beginning that our crews were actually Target not by mistake or by do you does this trle you that a media organization becomes the target of of the of the Israel and become part of the Targets in this war so with respect to targeting I mean targeting in a sense not not through a law passed by the Kessa but I think with respect to potential military targeting uh Israel has said very clearly that that's not what they have done uh obviously that would be incredibly inappropriate um you've heard the secretary speak to this that it is tragic how many journalists have lost their life uh in this war um because as I just spoke to a minute ago they go they put their own at risk in bringing us information about what's happening inside Gaza and it's important that we continue to get that information and so we support the work that journalists do in Gossip we support the work that they do around the world Tom go ahead just to go back to the meeting between us and Israeli officials why is this happening virtually uh I will leave it to the White House which is the primary White House took the lead in organizing this meeting so I'll leave it to them but I mean there's an important diplomatic element because we know I mean Benjamin netan who said in press conference yesterday that he pulled the delegation traveling to send a message because of the UN Security Council vote so it will worry people that on such an important issue and it's not a long flight from Tel Aviv that this meeting is not happening we have been listening there to the US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller who's holding a news conference addressing uh many issues but all to do with Israel's war on Gaza including its Siege the aftermath of its Siege on Al shifer hospital and importantly the latest attack on the Iranian Embassy building um on the Iranian Embassy compound rather in the Syrian Capital Damascus listening into all of this is our White House correspondent kimbery halit she's live for us in Washington DC good to see you Kimberly and uh Matthew Miller saying that they don't have their own information they don't have confirmation he said of the Target or the responsibility but they're working with Partners in the region to find out more that's right Not only was this a focus of questions at the state department briefing that has as we see still is ongoing but also the White House briefing that has just wrapped up with the press secretary Karan jeanpierre uh this is something that was developing as that White House briefing was uh ongoing and as a result the press secretary was unable to comment but did say that the US President Joe Biden was aware he had been briefed about the missile attack on the Iranian consulate compound and that the team was looking into it and this is something that has been confirmed by Matthew Miller the spokesperson for the US state department so uh from the standpoint of the Biden Administration they are keenly aware of what has taken place and are keenly aware of the r R ifications of this attack what you have heard there from Matthew Miller is of course when they talk about ramifications they are concerned about a broader escalation this is something that the Biden Administration has been concerned about Israel's war on Gaza for some time uh we've seen this with regard to spillage into Lebanon when there have been concerns about Israel looking for Hamas Fighters into Lebanon and is certainly going to be concerns about uh any sort of uh Iranian proxies and sort of Israel's uh waging its war on Iranian proxies Beyond and in the broader Middle East and so this is something that the Biden Administration is certainly looking into and its concern with regard to the fact that we know with this missile attack there have been three senior irgc generals that have been killed uh the concern now of course when we've seen these kind of attacks that there is always retaliation and what that might look like could it be retaliation on US forces could it be retaliation on forces in US forces in Syria in Iraq uh that is the big question for the United States right now and also will this look like uh an intensification of missiles fired towards Israel by uh Iran and its proxies those are the big concerns for the United States so uh the United States again uh as the story is developing looking at how this will play out in terms of how this could broaden something that has been a major concern for the Biden Administration since the uh Israel's war on Gaza began in mid October kimbery thank you very much for that that's our White House correspondent kimbery hit live in Washington DC
