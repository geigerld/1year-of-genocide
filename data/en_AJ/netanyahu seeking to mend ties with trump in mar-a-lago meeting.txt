okay let's discuss this with Hassan barar who's a professor of international Affairs at Qatar University joining us from Aman welcome back to Al jazer so there's been some Furious reaction out of Israel to Harris's comments accusing her of showing gaps between the positions of the US and Israel when it comes to the war on Gaza but is there any reason to believe that policy towards Israel under a Harris presidency will change well this is thank you Darren I think this remains to be seen we know that this rhetoric is very important and this it's no beating around the bush Harris made it perfectly clear that netanyahu's speech at the Congress would fool no one it's the responsibility of Israel to a um breach a ceas fa and secondly which is more important even is that there's a day after which is um which is self-determination for the Palestinian two-state solution so she has not really taken back by the the the speech of netan which was full of lies and deception and she she as if she understand the needs of Israel for security and and what Israel wants which is expansion and denying the Palestinian right to self-determination so she she is insinuating that under her leadership uh in her Administration if uh she got elected uh she would follow a different approach and I think this is very important it it carries a lot of Courage on the part of Harris look and and looking ahead uh Netanyahu uh we expect him to be meeting with Donald Trump what's he banking on here is he banking on Trump's return to power to bolster his own political fortunes yes you're right I think one of his objectives is to M fences with Trump after the relationship was troubled a little bit uh because of netanyahu's statements supporting Biden at one point I think he understand that Trump doesn't care about the Palestinians and all he cares about is to have a transaction transactional foreign policy where he can continue with the Abraham Accord so Netanyahu probably think think that you know all of his lies and deception would resonate resonate well with with Trump uh so he's trying to Bank in that he's trying to uh uh kind of uh reignite the bonds or the Lost bonds between both of them uh in anticipation of Trump's winning elections in November but here's the thing I mean the the big question of course is whether Netanyahu himself will still be in power later year if Trump wins the election with all the domestic pressures on him of course there's the looming ICC arrest warrant and we were just showing the demonstrations also uh in the US against him so uh I mean he's he's a lot of people would describe him as being internationally isolated he is isolated internationally and even internally uh given the uh the mounting pressure from the Grassroots from demonstrations in Tel Aviv and different uh C is in the occupied territories I mean in isra in in Palestine 1948 uh we've seen this pressure and even uh his opponent the opposition leader a Leed was saying that Nyah was better off staying at Israel than taking this uh trip to the states where which he achieved nothing uh this is the first time that we see the Israeli leaders giving a speech at the Congress in a divided congress with with a huge boycott and this is a statement that criticizing Israel and having differen Isel is no longer a taboo in the United States so this adds to his own isolation even not internationally I think more important in in America now a few people would come in public and support Israel because the the criminal war is no longer Justified and probably it's outlived this usefulness for many of the the American uh observers all right thank you so much Hassan barar thanks for joining us from Amman make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
