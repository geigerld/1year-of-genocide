to Gaza now where multiple Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours have killed at least 27 people Israeli forces are also attacking the city of Han Yunis for a second day in a row they've targeted a house in an area just outside the city at least nine people were killed there on Wednesday Israel bombed areas in the southwest that it had designated as humanitarian safe zones at least 18 Palestinians were killed in the attacks on al- masasi many of the victims were buried alive after Israeli strikes hit tents housing displaced people Han Mahmud is in kanun inside the Gaza Strip so Hy it's day 307 of this war tell us more about what's happening on the ground well s you know it's becoming quite evident right now that every passing day is a horrific day for for Palestinians whether it's the impact of the direct intense bombing campaign across the STP or the uh the aftermath of these attacks as people uh often thrown into uncertainty unknown of the uh of a further uh enforced displacement across the strip with the sense of of shattered safety everywhere they go they're being targeted they're being forced to to to flee elsewhere and right now there's uh no uh safe place across the G we've been seeing this and been saying talking about this for the past months that there isn't a single safy place across the G including the humanitarian designated safe Zone that have been repeatedly targeted the past 24 hours have been quite violent and bloody in the central area and the the southern part of of the strip mainly the city of KH Yunis Eastern part and central part uh of the city 27 people reported killed a majority we're talking about women and children the same exact patterns of casual that we see in every single day 18 of the 27 only in kanun city just an indication of the surging the attacks across kanun City and five of them five of those 18 inside a tents that's a family a mother and her and her uh children were inside this stent when it was targeted they were pulled from uh the uh the the area that caused the the fire everywhere they were incinerated and burned the life and removed to and transferred to Nar Hospital there also further civilian casualties from Western attack Western an attack on Western part of the city of hanun and elsewhere to the southern eastern part of City bringing the total number into to 27 people at Naser hospital and Al AA hospital at the earlier evening hour of yesterday at wck driver that's an employee who was driving his car after completing his mission in the southern eastern part of Dar bah City was killed in an attack that happened to a house that he was passing near nearby was transferred to Ala Hospital unfortunately the attacks are happening without any prior warning of whatsoever and that we were seeing more civilians like the usual uh uh events in the past more civilians are being killed and being uh targeted uh because of the unpredict Fallen bombs across the strip honey you're also reporting this morning that the Israeli Army Israeli Army is systematically demolishing residential areas and buildings inside Rafa City tell us more about that well the Israeli military continues to uh demol systematically demolish more of the homes and the the aftermath of this that people are in theab in intense like these this is part of al- maasi evacuation Zone where the majority of displaced families coming from all parts of the Gaza Strip right now are crammed in this small part of of Al maasi evacuation Zone in Western hanun City very close to the beach here I mean there isn't this is the the last point where people are able to set up their tents and to seek some sort of of safety and a protection uh for their children I'm not talking about the entire masasi evacuation Zone this is the only place right now that somehow it provides a sense of of safety and sense of protection for people but people end up like this and these are scattered tents and soon enough we're going to see this in uh very very over crowed because of more of evacuation orders that are coming from uh parts of of the central area and more recently from the northern part of the strip from B hanon and B and more from western part of raah City right now people are forced to flee further not to the west of the city but also here to Kan yunas and to Al maasi evacuation Zone because of the systematic demolition of homes and this is in no way uh as people describe it the local residence of RA this is in no way a collateral damage or part of the intense bombing campaign because what the Israeli military is doing is conducting a a street to Street a neighborhood to Neighborhood systematically destroying all the residential homes turning entire areas uh in ra into into more uh in Rafa City into more of a waste land making it very uninhabitable similar situations to what we documented in the past in the northern part of the strip in Gaza City mainly in the eastern part the neighborhood like sha and and a tah neighborhood and we're seeing this happening in kanun after the Israeli military spent four months militarily controlling the whole city and destroying all of its infrastructure and facilities and fortunately same thing is happening in uh in RAF City with more of these residential homes are being targeted and destroyed and demolish uh people are going to go back when the dust settles uh to uh to nothing basically it's more of a wasteland uh right now and it's it's not proper for living not suitable for families to go back and to run uh the to go to go back to day day-to-day life activities or life as they know it before this war started yeah and the picture that you were just showing us uh that we were just broadcasting shows says volumes about the living conditions that Palestinians are in now thank you very much hanim Mahmud reporting from Kan yunes make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
