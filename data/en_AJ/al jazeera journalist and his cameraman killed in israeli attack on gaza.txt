okay we have some breaking news with uh alzer's correspondent isma Al Gul we understand has been killed along with his cameraman in Gaza more details of course on that as we get it but we are going to speak to Maan bishara who's in London obviously monitoring all the developments Maan extremely distressing news that Ismail Al Gul the AL jaaz Arabic correspondent along with his caran Ramy Al REI have uh lost their lives in Gaza a clear reminder of uh the serious ramifications of what it is to be a journalist operating in Gaza and getting information out of Gaza it's really horrible it's just it's horrific uh you know I watched uh I watched him over I watch SM over the past several weeks especially and U it's quite amazing to see these young people uh Al course respondents working so diligently so calmly and collectively from Gaza while um you know bombs go off everywhere around them and he seemed to me anyway and sounded to me and especially looked to me like incredibly professional journalist although at a very young age and really getting tired and isra killing um these young young young journalists uh whether working for Al jazer or other uh you know we've been saying about how this war has turned up to be a war on children and certainly certainly a war on on journalist and that's not a cliche that's not even a sound bite that's not even a line it's just it's horrible that our colleagues uh continue to be killed and assassinated the way they have been and their family members and so on so forth yes they are part and parcel of the population in Gaza and they suffer like the population suffer because Al jazer you know has not exactly been parachuting journalists they are part and possible the fabric of the of the Palestinian society and they understand uh you know what is going on and they are able to to report so objectively and yet they are targeted the way they are targeted they continue to die and the service of doing their work but also the service of sticking around with their people as they tell the of the world what is going on in Gaza so many of our colleagues have been killed us far this is just too much and at the same time we are banned really by a bunch of Fanatics and fascists that continue to carry their genocidal war in Gaza it's just beyond belief that the Rogue government that is on trial for genocide that is being pursued by the prosecutor of the international criminal court for war crimes that is found in violation of more more occupation of torture of tormenting the Palestinian people of launching a war on children and on hospitals and yet continues also to Target journalists the way it does trying to kill the messengers yeah Maran you raised an important point there of course because uh amongst all of the allegations that have been directed at Israel and its conduct in its war on Gaza of course the the killing of journalists constitutes a war crime doesn't it this adds to a growing list of allegations leveled against the Israeli leadership it looks by the sounds of it as if we have uh oh we do have marwen marwen I wonder if you did you hear that question yes go ahead yes absolutely you know we generally refer uh for example even we at our when we refer to Hamas for example we refer and it's seen or it's considered by a number of countries usually the Western countries as a terrorist organization I think it's probably time you start repeating to Israel every time we mention Israel that it's considered by most countries in the world to be carrying genocide by most countries in the world to be in violation of international law Israel is considered by most countries in the world to be an occupying power in violation of international law Israel ised by most countries of the world to be a rogue State not a state of law but an outlow state that continues to Target journalists kill journalists kill children killed doctors and nurses and academics and killed some 40,000 civilians so perhaps just as we say Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by a number of countries we should also start mentioning that Israel is considered and is certainly indicted by the international court of justice certainly pursued by the prosecutor of the international criminal court and it certainly has been called out by the highest court of the land as in violation of international law again and again and again and the latest episode is the killing of Jord Israel has become by each and every measure the leading country in the world in terms of the killing of journalists and killing of children Maran we're going to go now to Gaza and we're going to speak to hin kudri somebody who knows all too well about the stresses and strains of working uh in a war zone of course and hind I understand of course you would have known is Al Gul very well tell us about him tell tell us about his Devotion to the job well is was covering the war since day one and he has been covering everything in the north parts of the Gaza Strip especially after the Gaza Strip has been split into two the North and the South he was separated from his family he used to always post about his daughter and how he has been separated from her and he chose to stay in the north to report for Al jazer and he was counting the days where he's going to reunite with his family he was killed with his cameraman Ramy rifi and they were killed they were directly targeted in a a a white car where where they were killed they were wearing their press jackets they were covering the assassination of they were on their way back from his house in Al refugee camp and that's how the Israeli forces is targeting targeted them we're talking about four journalists from Al jazer now Shirin uh Hamza and also Sam four journalists from Al jazer have been killed so far but not only that according to the Palestinian Ministry they just announced that 165 Palestinian journalists have been killed since October 7 and those journalists were all working on the ground when they were targeted there's viral photos right now on how uh and Ramy were targeted it shows that they were wearing their press jacket every single day Al jaaz Arabic used to uh broadcast is's reports talking about different types of of of of of reports who were talking about air strikes the sewage the pment everything and I had this call uh with is a couple of days ago and we were talking about helping Palestinians sick in the Northern parts and trying to find a way to evacuate to the southern parts of the Gaza Strip SM was not only a journalist but he was trying his best to help everyone in the north to help to find food for everyone in the north and he was just a very kind person and despite the fact that we did not see each other for 10 months after being separated from the southern parts and the Northern parts of the Gaza STP were still in contact talking to each other about everything and helping each other to Air and to report about the Gaza Strip and this ongoing genocide and hinded is precisely because of the information that has gone out to the world from the likes of isma his cameraman Ramy and indeed yourself that the world has a clearer understanding of some of the atrocities that are H happening there in Gaza on a daily basis I can hear it in your voice HED this this is a incredibly emotional moment for you and the team and obviously for the whole Al jazer uh family can you give us a sense of the kind of precautions the safety concerns the measures that you have to go through on a daily basis and isma would have had to have go through to do his job we do everything we wear our breast jackets we wear our helmets we try to not go to anywhere which where it's not safe we try to go to anywhere where to keep our security but we have been targeted in normal places where normal citizens are we're trying to do everything but at the same time we want to report we want to tell the world what's going on it's heartbreaking to report this today and it's heartbreaking to report Shin's killing hamza's killing and Sam's killing and this is not the first time we're doing this but every time it feels as if it's the first time it's a great loss for us here journalists in Gaza especially Al ja's team losing uh such a colleague um hint listen we really really appreciate your reporting for sharing your uh memories of isma and um Ramy thank you very much for now okay well Ham's here in the studio I mean ham what what what do we say to that I mean extraordinary really the the level of devotion our colleagues in Gaza go through on a daily basis just to get the information out these people are living their job these people are are have family members there as we heard there from hind isma has a young daughter I just wonder what the world would be making of the conflict were it not for the work of these people this is difficult as a journalist this is a difficult conflict to cover the Palestinian journalists in Gaza are the only voice from there Israel has not allowed Foreign Press inside unless you are with them on some sort of military imbed but even then they censor what you can see they show you what they want to show you saying we have achieved this in this area the Israeli Army has repeatedly targeted and attacked journalists in Gaza who are doing nothing but trying to get the story out there to the entire world because they are our Lifeline there we would not know what is going on unless it was for these journalists these Brave Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip and whenever the Israeli military is asked about this whenever they are pressed on the issue of killing journalists and media workers more than 100 have been killed since the start of this war this is the deadliest Conflict for journalists on record and whenever they're asked about it they say that they do not Target journalists they do what they can to protect civilians which is simply not true the reality on the ground shows a much different story and then often times when these journalists are targeted the Israeli Army comes out with some sort of statement saying that they have evidence that these journalists were involved in some sort of fighting groups which is also not true which has been denied time and time again but the reality on the ground shows how difficult it is to cover this story during war during a blockade during a Siege where the information it's so important for it to get out there and the Israeli Army always denies the wrong doing here and who controls the narrative is such a an important aspect of this conflict because it's not only a conflict on the ground it's an information War before we carry on our conversation I understand we can probably see some images of the car uh in which isma Al Gul was killed I wonder if we can see those pictures of the car of isma alol there it is you were talking about sort of Civilian infrastructure being targeted of Civilian ambulances ordinary vehicles uh being targeted um obviously we wait to see whether Israel will issue issue a response but given their track record previously it's always been one of abject denial of saying look you know these people may have had links to H mass fighters of obfuscating multiple times well the Israeli Army Israeli politicians alike are always quick to issue denials that they did any wrongdoing in Gaza there hasn't been any admission of unlawful killing of the Palestinian the only time there was this sort of admission from the Israeli military was when they killed their own captives who were calling for help but time and time again we've seen the targeting of journalists we have seen innocent Palestinians civilians who've been killed you're talking about a war that's considered a genocide and and there have been 40,000 people who've been killed and Israel still denies any wrongdoing saying that they are acting in self-defense saying that Hamas is quote using these civilians as human Shields but we've seen it so many times where there are vehicles of journalists that are targeted that are clearly marked as press and I want to know is alul was arrested at alifa hospital several months ago tortured by the Israeli Army for doing nothing but reporting on the job and when he was finally released due to all the pressure that came about on the Israeli army they still denied any wrongdoing saying that they were arresting quote unquote Terror suspects anyone who knew anything about Hamas in the area but this includes journalists the targeting of journalists is something that we know is all too familiar to the Israeli military look at our own colleagues at Al jazer it didn't just start with this war on Gaza look at Shin Abu who was killed several years ago and there's still been no justice for her death there's been no justice for any journalist who's been killed by the Israeli military yeah mounting mounting evidence of journalists being deliberately targeted and as you say there is Al goul was held for 12 hours back in March uh severely beaten by Israeli forces now killed make sure to subscribe to our channel to get
