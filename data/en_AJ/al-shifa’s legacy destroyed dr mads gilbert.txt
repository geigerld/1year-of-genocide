so look at the before and after this is after the extent of the damage at alifa right now the courtyard has been bulldozed buildings are burned in Ruins this is what's left of it right now and this here is what it looked like before gaza's largest medical complex this was back in October in the first few days of the war it was the strip's most advanced hospital with specialized facilities for Pediatrics Opthalmology obstetrics Gynecology Etc let's talk about this with Dr mattz Gilbert senior consultant professor of emergency medicine at the University uh University Hospital of North Norway you have worked at hospitals in Gaza you're still in touch with teams on the ground you're joining us from truma Norway I wanted to find out first sir what information you're getting from the people you know who are in or around alshifa well good morning we first got this very uh alarming uh report from Dr Marana busada two days ago about 107 critical patients who had been moved to an old part of the shifa medical complex without water without any medical supplies not even having glows very alarming and then we get this news this morning that the Israeli occupation forces actually have completely destroyed the shifa medical complex we do not know as of yet the destiny of the 107 critical patients that were mov moved the two days ago and their staff but what we do know is that Israeli government and Israeli occupation forces this night has ended 78 years of Brave medical history because shifa hospital and shifa means the healing house the house of healing was established in 1946 and was the most important Flagship hospital for the health care for the people of Gaza my first encounter and work in shifa was in 1989 and I've been working through all these years with the brave staff and the excellent medical people in Gaza this is such a sad day I'm I I've been weeping all morning actually so you said we don't know what's become of the 107 patients who were in in critical care is that right well we don't know yet what has come of these 107 patient and I quote from the report from Dr Maran abusada a senior surgeon in in shifa he says that most of them are severe cases that had been in the ICU and 60 of the medical staff have been incarcerated in an old building in the hospital that does not have capacity to host such number of patients and has no equipment unquote so nobody knows the fate of these patients but what we see from the video footage this morning we see a massive amount of people searching for corpses for dead one for Martyrs and they find and they find the most horrible uh decomposed corpses with the maggots coming out of the The Ice and and and and and truly a scene from dant Inferno so uh to me I was last time in Gaza in shifa last summer hold on can I can I jump in there I want to ask you a question uh I want to compare what the Israeli military are saying to what you know actually happened in alifa the Israeli military say that during their operation which they say was against uh Hamas and Islamic Jihad armed Fighters they say that they gradually isolated the patients moved them out of the fighting Zone per se moved them to another building and even provided um uh water food and some level of medical assistance I'm assuming medicines but I don't actually know uh is that consistent with what you're hearing actually happened absolutely not and the Israelis are known for being the most Ardent Liars they lie about everything so from this report that I'm reading from the medical doctor says that there is absolutely nothing they don't even have glows they use plastic bags to tend to the infected wounds and they don't have the needed equipment nor antibiotics nor nothing and it's also a very dramatic uh uh report on The Negotiator from the medical team in shifa talking to the Israeli Commander he has to address to his underwear he kept waiting for two hours and the commander comes back with absolutely no answer so this is a a combination of ress and humiliation that you simply don't do to other people and you don't do it to sick and wounded People For Heaven's Sake when is this going to stop and now we hear from Gaza that they are taking on Alexa hospital and probably are planning to do the same with Alexa as they've done know with shifa so I'm just asking where is this world where where is the world order and the maggots that are creeping out of the corpses in shifa hospital now are really maggots coming out of the eyes of President Biden and the EU leaders doing nothing to stop this horrible horrible genocide mads we're looking at the pictures the very latest pictures of the aftermath right of this two weeks Siege uh on alifa the buildings are completely burnt out hollowed out out um I see a bridge connecting buildings there that's destroyed to me when I look at this and I'm of course no expert on this it looks to me like this can never be rebuilt this was gaza's largest hospital can do you think in the future this can be used again or or is alifa gone for good well I think you're right I've seen the same videos and I recognized the the skeletons of the buildings and particularly the brand new uh medical surgical complex to the north of the complex which was equipped at top level and and financed funded by by European countries where are they today I do not think this can be rebuilt it will be rebuilt because we will rebuild GSA and gsa's Healthcare and I think one thing which is you know greatly overlooked by the media is that Israel is never held accountable and never has to pay War compensation this endless this absolutely endless impunity for Israel through 75 years has made them ravage and Destroy as much as they like without ever being held accountable and in particular not financially uh accountable actually the state of Israel should be sentenced to rebuild shifa hospital and pay the full bill for their destructions um so on one side if I can jump in just to just to provide some context to viewers because um Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister did present a plan that was widely panned I have to say a plan for post Gaza part of his plan was to have rebuilding paid for by U the International Community and specifically Arab countries he was rebuffed um but he in his vision of it um he would have Gulf countries and Arab countries generally pay for this rebuilding I just wanted to complete your point there yeah thank you and and it's it's showing the the the cism of the Israeli government I mean this is this is a total Destruction of Civil Society in Gaza this is the politics of elimination well known from Colonial politics all over the world you kill the indigenous people you destroy their social Fabric and their society and you take over the land you grab the land so this is a politics well known and it's called actually the politics of elimination and and and this destruction of shifa today is the lowest point to till now when it comes to the Israeli occupation armies destruction of hospitals schools universities archaeological sites archives museums everything and that is part of the yeah yeah man can I once again get you to um can I confront what the the Israeli version of events at alifa with what you know to have happened with your contacts on the ground the Israeli military said that they saw a large cluster of armed fighters from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad and that they were fighting them um and they were trying to sort out patience this has been a big part of the Israeli narrative on the alifa medical complex they were trying to sort out patients from the fighters and Target only the fighters um what do you know about who was in the hospital and and about that fighting what I know from the reports is that there has been fighting around shifa hospital and and consider uh for a moment yourself if your National most important Flagship hospital was attacked by an invading Army who really had the intention of destroying the hospital and killing the people wouldn't you defend it in the vincinity of the hospital wouldn't you think that your army should defend your most important security hospital for the people of course they have tried to defend it but I have not heard any report of Fighters inside shifa hospital and don't forget this is the second Siege of shifa when they invaded Shi for the first time they had no proof of any military installations they didn't find anything they repeat their lies because they didn't need these lies to to attack all the other hospitals in Gaza you know out of the 35 hospitals almost every one of them have been attacked even without the excuse of being a military command center so this is this is a lie and this is beyond the point because what they are doing is destroying Palestinian infrastructure their life and their society don't forget that shifa had 700 beds and they host during the the peak of The Siege they hosted 7,000 patients the staff there they really deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for their heroic work to defend the the patients and contrast this with the lies of the Israeli army they have shown no proof of this massive uh uh military installation it's actually a blackened lie and um they have shown um just as little evidence when they have been bombing universities schools and the other hospitals so I think it's important now to um to understand that these Israeli narratives Shall Serve the purpose of defending their case in the icj uh investigation because they want to show that oh we warned oh we put out some leaflets oh we said they should flee there is no safe place in Gaza there is no water there is no food this is an allout war against a people trying to survive and they take the hospital I have another question question for you on on the medical staff and the latest that you know about the the whereabouts and the and the well-being that's not the right word but how the medical staff at ala are doing just before I get to that another word of context on what you were saying the Israeli providing proof um the Israelis in their first uh assault on alifer raid on Al shifer several months ago had said this is the Hamas command and Control Center and to your point the world never got proof of that yes there were some tunnels running through that area as under many areas of Gaza but a command and control center the Israeli uh military did not demonstrate that that existed under al-shifa today their argument for why they laid Siege to Al shifa and and laid waste to this entire medical complex was that hundreds of armed Fighters were fighting there again if the proof is there um you know I think the world would like to see it uh so to my question medical staff what do you know about the doctors nurses and other Medical Teams who were operating in alifa and helping these 100 plus patients let me first just comment to your your your reasoning and I I totally agree but if the goal was to to to fight down some hundred uh resistance Fighters Palestinians why why burn the hospital why burn this billion value uh incredibly important Institution for the for the civilian population in Gaza well this has been their in Northern Gaza since the beginning which was in in large part level the northern part of the strip so it has nothing to do it has nothing to do with any military reasoning that we are going to fight down some some fighters who are around shifa it's a blatant lie they're doing it to destroy Palestine that's the point and what about the staff inside well in this report from Dr Maran uh he says that um um the um staff are left in horrific conditions already exhausted and starting showing symptoms of fatigue and Allergy and if no solution is pursued as soon as possible the place will turn into a graveyard of patients and staff if it's not already the case unquote so so that's the that's the sad news uh we have heard nothing from the staff and the 107 patients and I don't think the Israelis care I've been they've been killing 34 40,000 people now they keep on killing and when when is this going to stop are they going to bomb ala Hospital also are they going to destroy 100% of the Palestinian health and and who's next if Israel is not stopped what will happen to the Healthcare in the West Bank what will happen to the hospital in tar and Janine AA Victoria and Massad hospital because Israel is on a rampage to reoccupy and take this land forever okay and that's the colonial fascist politics um Matt's Gilbert speaking to us from Norway thank you thank you for sharing that information that you had with us uh we will follow up on the fate of these 107 patients who were in critical care as well as the medical teams that we're caring for them uh we'll be speaking to our correspondent reaching out to anyone we can to try and find out now that the siege is over what exactly is left in the building who's left in the facility mattz Gilbert thank you very much thank you
