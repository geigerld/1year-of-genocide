Remo Salam is a un special reporter on violence against women and children she joins us from Aman an estimated 70% of Palestinians killed in Gaza have been women and children does that set this conflict apart it's common for at least half of um casualties to be women and children but certainly what we've seen here has surpassed anything we've seen in in recent conflicts uh I think you would agree that actors on the ground have run out of words to describe really the Unspeakable level of suffering and Horrors on the ground in Gaza um the commissioner for un lazarini had described it as a living hell and I would say that within this hell being a Palestinian woman or a child has really meant being stripped of any Humanity dignity safety or any special considerations that would be usually given to women and children in times of peace or conflict i i in fact cannot think of any protection that uh Palestinians that civilians are entitled to according to the laws of war that have been upheld in this conflict and I cannot think of any violation of the laws of war and human rights that uh Palestinians uh including women and children have not been subjected to what kind of protection should women and children get in uh International humanitarian or law what would a war look like that tries to respect that aspect of international law well everything that uh shouldn't happen is happening now according to the Geneva conventions and the laws of conflict so all this indiscriminate bombing slaughtering the forceful dispossession uh unfolding genocide the deliberate starvation the deliberate uh uh denial of water uh the denial of humanitarian Aid the attacks on humanitarian actors like unua like the red crescent um the the bombing of Civilian infrastructure all these are things that shouldn't happen according to the laws of war and of course within that also women have specific protections because they are women they're supposed to be um also given you know uh consideration and care for the fact that they're being women like for example when they are menstruating like for example reproductive health and we know also of the onslaught that we have seen on pregnant women uh women giving birth on infants uh we have now seemingly moved from uh bombing children including infants to leaving them to die uh and decompose in hospitals to now apparently also executing them in Cold Blood what's it like being a 5-year-old in Gaza right now H being a 5-year-old in Gaza probably having lost both of your parents and all your siblings having lost a limb um seeing no future trying to survive uh being soaked wet right now under the the rain uh going hungry not being able to eat in days um and uh feeling very abandoned by the world Rema salm un special rapporter on violence against women and children thank you very much for joining us on the program today thank you
