from the beginning of the conflict US President Joe Biden has been consistent often repeating Israel's justifications for its Siege and bombardment of Gaza I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children a damning statement from a US president except his AIDS later said it wasn't true he didn't see anything just repeated what he had heard in the media when the Al Ali hospital was shelled within hours he blamed quote the other team and he made sure to send a message of support in person inde Deeds sending two aircraft carrier groups to the region and with assets sending missiles ammunition and reportedly 100 bunker Buster bombs to Israel along with the pledge of more than $4 billion in additional assistance about 3 weeks into the war Biden was asked about the growing Palestinian death toll I'm sure Innocents have been killed and it's the price of waging a war but I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using he has called for restraint but not condemned the lack of it by Israel's military asked for additional humanitarian Aid not demanded it Biden heralded his role in getting a temporary ceasefire but as the fighting began again he reportedly told Netanyahu the military should not fight in the South with the same intensity they had in the north it appears they did anyway no public response from the US president tens of thousands of people in the US have held countless Pro Palestinian marches demanding he do more and pledging they will never vote for Biden again it's going to be a hard no for me it's going to be a hard no yeah not to say I'll vote for the other party either but um I'm going to have to see if there's an independent candidate that I can get behind and it's showing up in the polls as the American Media keeps pointing out he is 50 points underwater with the youngest group of Voters political analysts say this could cost him as he seeks reelection his support has decreased now to 177% of the arab-american electorate so he's already losing a huge support among a key population especially when we're looking at a swing state like Michigan where um Arab Americans and Muslim Americans make up a large percentage of the electorate B bid you're a liar with just under a year until the election Biden's team is likely hoping many will forget or vote for Biden because they dislike his opponent more in a close election that could be a costly calculation Patty khane Al jazer Washington make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
