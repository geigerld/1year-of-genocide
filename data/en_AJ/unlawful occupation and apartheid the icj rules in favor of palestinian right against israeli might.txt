Maran bishar though alzer's senior political analyst he joins us now by Skype from Paris Marwan is this a milestone moment that we will look back on in days to come and say perhaps this was a turning point well certainly uh in terms of uh the icj and in terms of the legal status of the occupied territories and in terms of the various details or detailed drooling that we've heard it's it's a it's a Cornerstone it's it's definitely a a game changer legally speaking not that it's surprising or shocking it's in fact if anything this is basically expanding and deepening the ruling of 2004 uh that was mentioned today about the illegality of the aparted wall in the West Bank uh but I think the importance uh of this ruling today is just how damning how detailed uh it is and it just covers all those issues that some of us like you and I and others for example in the media and Academia that had to uh deal with the headache for example of always having to read the disputed territories when we all understood them to be occupied territories but they said ah you know the legal definition is not clear well now now no one can debate I think that debate should be put to rest that these are occupied territories more importantly it's not just the West Bank as in the 2004 ruling now we're talking about one territorial Unity that is occupied territory and that is Gaza so again Gaza is an occupied territory the West Bank and very importantly East Jerusalem that was annexed by Israel since we are talking about the totality of the occupied Palestinian T That Couldn't that are indivisible if you will under international law that's also hugely important so that means the United States recognition of Israel's annexation or or moving its capital to Jerusalem that's illegal now and and definitely the US should reconsider uh that because the ruling basically uh told everyone that assist or anyone that would assist in recognition of any of the de facto policies including the annexations in the in the occupied territories that they are illegal and that they would be in violations of international law there a lot to unpack Maran TR to take them one by one but first of all this is coming at a time when there is a war going on in Gaza we know that this of course this case is not addressing and the court made it very clear it's not addressing the events post October the 6th 2023 however do you see that it does have some implications now that the court has as as you noted as well it has repeated and said Gaza is an occupied territory part of the occupied Palestinian territory so all the considerations the calculations about whether Israel is or is not acting quote unquote in self-defense in Gaza or whether it's an occupying power do you see some implications in this finding by the international court of justice today there's absolutely uh certain implications on a number of levels while the court did recognize that Israel did withdraw its illegal settlers and it the and its military physically from uh the Gaza Strip but it remained an occupying power because it could still use its Authority or its coercive policies in the Gaza or on the Gaza Strip having basically occupied the borders and the skies and and and the lands and so on so forth so uh in so many ways Gaza as I said and as the icj ruled is part and parcel of the occupied territories and I think one of the more important elements that certainly applies is this coercive inducement uh of uh uh expulsion basically of inducing people to leave which is another form of transfer which as the court recognized is also illegal and nowhere that we've seen the past nine months more of this coercive inducement making Gaza unlivable uninhabitable as Gaza so you could definitely say that there's a number of the issues here that certainly are applicable to Gaza but I think probably the IJ might be um uh saving it's ruling on the on the on what's really happening in Gaza the genocide in Gaza for a latter date uh we are all been occupied Sam as you know the past nine months with what's going on in Gaza while the other Battleground the other genocide the other war crimes were actually happening in the West Bank and East Jerusalem where the real theft of land the real annexations the real reward if you will for the criminals in the Israeli government is which is really the West Bank and the Cosmopolitan or the Metropole of uh e Jerusalem and that's where most of the violations are happening basically uh you know in the shadow of the war crimes in Gaza so underlining all of that today with such Clarity certainly puts the Israeli government on the defensive it basically has no defense but it also and that's important puts the uh you know its backers in London Berlin and and Washington also in the defensive now I'm not sure as your previous guest would have said that this is going to change anyone's mind in Washington let alone Trump if he does make it after November but I think as Netanyahu is being now met with cheers in Washington in both houses of Congress uh next week I think probably now the general assembly of the United Nations the world's Parliament should start taking measures just as Netanyahu is re in Washington it's about time to freeze Israel is its membership at the United Nation and the UN General assem Assembly is capable of doing that just as it did to South Africa after such a ruling it has every possible reason capacity and I would say moral and legal obligation to freeze Israel's membership at the United Nations Maran putting aside maybe looking into the crystal all of what Donald Trump may or may not do but beyond him in the wider Circles of power in the west do you see at all any potential for change in the political calculus that without which would leave those countries in a very awkward position of being on the one hand the countries that preach to Russia respect for international law and calling on it to end occupation in Ukraine but on the other hand continue to support what the is CJ is just called an illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and continue to send it weapons and arms even there's no doubt that I and countless people around the world nor Less in Palestine wish it but I don't but or I do rather want to distinguish between wishing and wishful thinking so I think there is a a lot of room uh for hoping that this ruling will support a a movement an international movement across the board in the west and elsewhere in the world in favor of more sanctions more pressure on Western governments to put more pressure in Israel in favor of embarrassing and humiliating those who continue to support Israel's illegal unlawful occupation annexation settlement those who continue to trade uh with the Israeli settlements like for example here in the European Union but certainly the United States even certain now Middle Eastern countries I think that all will startop putting pressure on a number of governments to do so having said that I also want to underline something very important you know they say one of the maxims of of international law is Justice delayed is Justice denied we're talking about now almost 60 years six Decades of more of the same criminal illegal unlawful discriminatory racist occupation of Palestine all right and still there are those in London and Washington still defending it or justifying Israel's policies I think this ruling hopefully will start changing some minds and hearts and maybe sing around some of those Pockets that continue to finance Israel's apart all right that's Maran bishara always a pleasure to have you our senior political analyst make sure to subscribe our Channel channel to get the latest news from alaz
