let's take this on Jord Sonet is Muhammad elmy a political analyst and professor of media studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies welcome Muhammad uh no detail yet of what went on between David Cameron uh and Benny Gans but along the lines presumably what Cameron was saying on Tuesday that patients needs to run very thin but what does that even mean because Israel has proven Adept to ignoring World opinion right I mean in many ways patience has has been running thin or or should have R thin um a long time ago uh more than 30,000 Palestinians uh have been killed many thousands other uh thousands of others missing and under the rubble uh Aid is not getting in in sufficient quantity and and uh Aid organizations are warning of imminent uh famine so in if anything David Cameron's remarks are are sort of an understatement um but uh as we've seen uh Israel is adamant about um continuing the War uh despite the fact that its closest allies like the United States have said that it's it's unwinable given Israel's uh endgame given their their primary objective as stated uh nonetheless they want to continue uh they want to continue to fight on and they seem uh adamant about that it's certainly been a big change in tune from the United States and UK there has been um I think it's been interesting to follow um you know us uh discourse uh I think this week we saw some of the most um critical discourse coming out of the US Administration that we've heard about Israel I'm hesitant to say that things have changed uh meaningfully I'm always more interested in what the US is doing than what the the US is saying because often times there's you know there can be this kind of empty empty rhetoric but I don't think there's any question that the Biden Administration is is very concerned uh they're dragged into this now uh for five months um they're seen as complicit in genocide some of the recent polling data out of the United States has to be of concern uh to Joe Biden right the court of public opinion is what you're referring to an election year absolutely and you know half of Democrats now believe that Israel is carrying out genocide so it depends on how you want to read the data on the one hand Biden can point to the fact that his approval rating has not actually gone down since October since this all started on the other hand if half of his party uh believes that this is a genocide and that he's supporting the the genocide um and if young people increasingly are moving away from Israel and closer to the the the Palestinian position which the public opinion data uh suggests then um then that those could be troubling signs and that's to that's to say nothing of the Arab and and Muslim votes which will will figure prominently into certain States like Michigan and New Jersey and in the background of cause these negotiations for a potential ceasefire uh bubbling away taking a long time to get anywhere what what are the obstacles why is it so difficult to get anywhere with this I thought it was interesting what Daniel Levy said he's somebody that you you all have had on an El jazer former Israeli negotiator and yesterday he said that hamas's position is quote reasonable the offer that they're bringing to the table they basically want a complete end to to all the cessation of violence and they're willing to give up all of the uh the captives that they have the Israeli captives that they have um that's kind of what the the broader World Community has been asking for now for for months give up the hostages let's stop the fighting Israel however as I mentioned at the beginning they remain adamant that they want to temporary pause only to resume the bombing uh and bombardment of Gaza at the conclusion of that truce and From hamas's perspective there just doesn't seem to be a lot of incentive to give up their bargaining ships on the one hand and then uh have Israel resume the bombing uh on the other hand Muhammad we'll leave it there thanks for that Muhammad Elm professor of media studies at the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies thank you thanks
