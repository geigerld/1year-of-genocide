so far more than 230 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes well inside Israel gun battles have been continuing for hours between Hamas Fighters and Israeli forces the death toll there

gun battles in 22 locations alzer's wrestle SAR takes us through a day of extraordinary developments an unprecedented Palestinian attack on Israel hamama says it fired as many as 7,000 short and long range Rockets from Gaza into Israeli territory shortly afterwards the kasan brigades the Rous military Wing launched a ground assault with Fighters breaching the Border fence into Israel some using paragliders Hamas says the offensive is in response to the desecration of the Alexa mosque and what it calls the crimes of Israel's occupation the time has come to draw the line for the enemy to understand their time is up and they can't keep going without consequences we are announcing an operation called alaxa floods in the first part of it 5,000 Rockets have been fired it is the time to unite all the Arab and Islamic powers to overthrow the Israeli occupation members of the Islamic Jihad armed group in Gaza answered the call to Arms scenes emerged of Palestinian Fighters attacking Israeli military checkpoints luing seizing and burning vehicles and taking many Israeli soldiers and civilians [Music] prisoner this is the Battle of not only the Palestinians or the gazin it is the Battle of all the Arab and Muslim nations simply for the reason that it is the battle for Palestine it is the battle for Jerusalem it is the battle for the AL AA mosque the Aras border crossing between Gaza and Israel has also been bried and the member of the Kasam brigades fought with Israeli forces at a police station in the city of sidot Israel says hundreds of his citizens have been killed and many more injured prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu spoke of a state of War calling up military reservist and declaring a 48h hour civil emergency we will take revenge for all the young people who lost their lives we will Target all of hamas's positions we will turn Gaza into a deserted island to the citizens of Gaza I say you must leave now we will Target each and every corner of the strip Israel's multiple air strikes on the Gaza Strip have already claimed hundreds of Palestinian lives and injured more than a thousand one of the strikes hit the 11 story Palestine Tower just meters away from alzer's Bureau where the media offices and lawyers were located first a warning strike and a few minutes later complete destruction it is the Israeli Palestinian conflict's most significant escalation in years with a rising that tool on both sides where and how it will end it's too soon to say R SAR Al jazer so let's get some live updates from Al a correspondents joining us this hour John henan is in Washington DC but first let's talk to Villa Barks in West Jerusalem uh villm said the Israeli Army says fighting is still taking place in the South just bring us up to date will you uh on what's Happening uh in stot well we had these 3500 Rockets over the course of the day Landing uh trying to land at least in parts of Israel fired from Gaza according to Israeli authorities you had all these gunmen entering up to 22 different locations outside the Gaza Strip some of the more than 20 km from the border between Gaza and Israel and over the course of the night according to Israeli military officials there have still been a number of gunmen HED up in some of the kbit in the communities on the edge of Gaza uh many of them holding hostages and in the instance in STO you just mentioned there that was a police office that was held by militants for many many hours surrounded by Israeli police and milit forces eventually over the last couple of hours Israeli officials saying that they have taken control of that police station instad do and have killed 10 militants involved in holding on to it throughout much of the day and villm what's the likelihood now then of an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza I mean we've seen Israel do this in past Gaza Wars and it's extremely costly in lives on both sides over the last few hours we've seen huge numbers of heavy Weaponry including tanks and artillery being moved South down towards the area around Gaza the Israeli military has warned Israeli civilians to stay away from that region it is now under military control we've heard from Israeli officials they've been calling up thousands of reservists hoping to call up many thousands more this is a war as Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister here in Israel has called it he has vowed to turn Gaza into an island of ruins in an address to the Israeli public earlier this evening and what's obviously very striking about how that will be accomplished is the fact that there are so many hostages held by Hamas according to their official leadership inside the Gaza Strip and that will make it incredibly complicated as an operation whether it's by air or by ground to try and take back those to hostages inside hostile territory all right vill marks live for us there in West Jerusalem villm thank you for that let's go live now to John Hendry he's in Washington DC John so Us Secret of State Anthony blinkin he's been on the phone to Regional leaders as well as both the Palestinians and Israelis Washington says it wants to deescalate but it's still pledging its support for Israel isn't it it's right in the US there is universal support being expressed for Israel uh blinkin has been on the phone with the foreign Ministers of Egypt turkey the president of the Palestinian Authority and in the last couple of hours he's talked to muham althani or at least we were told that he has talked to Muhammad althani the Prime Minister and foreign minister of qar and what he appears to be doing is trying to get anyone with any influence on Hamas to try to get them to draw back uh the president of the United States as well has expressed unequivocal support for Israel in this conflict as you might expect an American president to do this is what he had to say Israel has the right to defend itself and his people full stop there's never justification for terrorist attacks and my Administration and support for Israel security is Rock Solid and unwavering let me say this as clearly as I can this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek Advantage the world is watching uh John said does this unwavering us support for Israel now mean more weapons and more military aid for Israel well the US starts out by giving about $3 billion dollars in Aid to Israel each year the White House says that it is in ongoing talks with Israel to supply military aid but there are some obstacles to that first of all uh Biden himself does not have a great relationship with Benyamin Netanyahu as vice president to uh Barack Obama he visited Israel in order to try to persuade them to stop building settlements Netanyahu announced Ed new settlements at that time that was widely considered a snub also there is no US ambassador to Jerusalem at this time and uh that would hinder any effort to try to uh to try to build a bridge to create that Aid also the US Congress is in complete disarray so if they were to have to approve new Aid which they would have to do to go beyond that $3 billion figure uh you'd have to have a speaker of the house which you are not going to have until Wednesday and then you have the difficult negotiation uh between a republican controlled house and a democratically controlled Senate although on this particular issue they might be inclined to work together but as I say that's not going to happen before they select a speaker of the house all right John hendron life us there in Washington DC John thank you
