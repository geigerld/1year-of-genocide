well the AL hospital that he was just referring to is run by the Anglican communion a global Christian organization in a statement the Episcopal dicese of Jerusalem wrote this day of reflection was marred by a brutal attack on Al alaki anglian Hospital in Gaza during the Israeli air strikes there but it's not the first such attack on their health facilities on October 10th the office of the Archbishop said please keep in your prayers akley hospital's medical director whose home was destroyed yesterday today in an aerial strike against a residential neighborhood in Gaza and on October 15th the American Friends of the church wrote in a distressing incident on the 14th of October 2023 Aki Arab Hospital's diagnostic Cancer Treatment Center in Gaza City was struck by Israeli rocket fire specifically impacting the ultrasound and mamography Wards well we can now speak to Maran galani he's the director general of the Palestine red Cresent society and is currently in Egypt coordinating Aid efforts to Gaza as the bombardment continues he joins me now from Cairo sir thank you for your time with us here on Al jazer let me start by asking you about what we've just heard in the last few hours from US President Joe Biden he says that Israel has agreed to let Aid into Gaza and I quote as soon as possible what do you know about this agreement is it going to happen well nobody knows there has been for the last few days actually a lot of rumors that that the aid will come in from Egypt but also through Israel into the southern Crossing border uh entry point we have actually prepared together with the international Committee of the Red Cross relief supplies to go from the West Bank into uh through Israel into Gaza if that materialized of course nothing of this has materialized uh this uh morning today we we have met uh with Mr Griffith at at the Egyptian red crescent we are coordinating together with the Egyptian red Cent and with a number of of un agencies who were with Mr Griff we did not there there are preparations yes we are getting ready so that whenever this border crossing opens we will be using this opportunity to get critical relief for the people inside Gaza especially for the patients the hospitals and the people at large because there is no water there's no food no fuel and these are running out so critically to the point I think if there if there is no Aid coming in in the next 24 hours I think we are going to see a real more even of of a of a of a more death more misery and it's going to be a horrible horrible situation on top of what we have already SE as you've just said there that the needs are of an enormous magnitude is an agreement likely to allow for the scale of the aid operation needed there's been plenty of talk of rougher border crossing but this is presumably going to require the opening of another border crossing Beyond raer look if I want to be frank and honest and and I'm not I don't think I'm I'm I'm uh sort of saying any any secrets but these discussions are talking about a a a a camouflage a a an opening of a certain number of hours limited with a lot of conditions that can barely provide fuel for the hospitals and Medicine there will not be a real relief coming in if that's what they're talking about they're talking about maybe 10 to 20 trucks wow in total and that that is that is that is in my opinion it is just a camouflage it is to provide for those who are supporting the war for those who are beating the drums of War to say here we have we have allowed and and pressured in order to have some Aid coming in the second point which I have been emphasizing is Israel is the occupying power it is responsible for the the safety and the protection of the saan population it can at any time get Aid into Gaza they can check it they can make sure it is it is it is Aid it is food it is water and nobody can stop them it is there we have our trucks ready from the West Bank a lot of other organization will be ready to bring in stuff through Israel into the southern entry point but that's not the point the point I think is as we have we have heard from the Minister of Defense himself is actually a collective punishment and it is to start and pressure the people inside G Gaza it is it is a punishment of the whole people of Gaza you mentioned there that negotiations have been ostensibly continuing well during that time that those have been taking place we've seen ambulances hospitals refugee camps as we've been hearing all hit how will you protect your Aid workers who who are doing the distribution th this this is this is a this is a very important question question and and it is quite honestly Israelis are not interested in protecting hospitals or medical missions look for the past few days we have been receiving daily threats from the military authorities our Hospital directors every day they get text messages and they get phone calls telling them get out or you are responsible for whatever is going to happen to the people inside Gaza we're telling them we are Sheltering five 6,000 people in our hospital we I have to verify this but I was told on the on the eve of the bombing of alah hospital just after that our colleagues in Gaza one of my colleagues in Gaza there was a message coming from the the military coordinator as they call him to our Hospital saying leave leave the hospital or you will be responsible for the people who are going to die so I don't think that and we of course we have lost quite a number of of medical personnel in Gaza but also in the West Bank with direct targeting of those paramedics and ambulances so all this talk that that Israel is really concerned Israel makes sure that it protects and doesn't Target the medical facilities and medical personnel is not backed by any evidence on the contrary we we are we have been documenting for years but this last year we have been documenting incident after incident where our colleagues are deliberately targeted intimidated and and so and threatened as as in the case with our hospital so I I want to ask you a little bit about something you you just mentioned earlier you talked about Israeli checks on the aid and that you're very open to all of all of your trucks being being investigated or or um checked by the Israeli military now the US has been very clear they've said that Aid will only flow if Hamas doesn't receive any of it now given the nature of Hamas as I was discussing with an earlier guest as a social movement as well as the very densely populated nature of the Gaza Strip is that realistic when it comes to Aid distribution is there a plan for that look this is the irony international law says you get Aid to the civilian population you don't ask what religion they are what political color they are people who are in need they are civilians they are not arms beers you get Aid to them based on needs not because not based on their political convictions not based on on on whatever other qualifications and it is really surprising that this is coming from the US because international law is very clear International humanitarian law is very clear you cannot starve a population you cannot use Aid or food and water as an instrument of War for any political or military ends and it seems to me that they are using this Aid aspect to instrumentalize the aid and the humanitarian assistance to in in order to fulfill or to support the the military goals and and this is this is ridiculous this is this is a violation of internal law and none of the international humanitarian organization of course and our humanit local humanitarian organization such as the red Cresent we're not going to do that we will be there we provide aid for civilians and I I I stress that the civilians who need that Aid the wounded and the sick that's who we were work with we do not provide aid for any political party or any other group our Aid goes to those who need it from the civilian population who are in a real dire situation Maran jalani there the director general of the Palestine red cresant Society speaking to us live from Cairo sir thank you so much for joining us here on Al jaer at such a busy busy time for you we really wish you and your organization all the best with the work that you're doing thank you
