now in the last few hours Israeli tanks have begun firing artillery shells at buildings at the Rafa land border crossing now this is a key entry point for Aid coming in from Egypt air strikes have also been targeting surrounding neighborhoods over the last few days let's go to Anthony Lowenstein he's an independent journalist and author of The Palestine laboratory which is a book on Israel's arms and surveillance industry joins us now from Sydney good to see you again Anthony so this is a this is a very recent development this is this has been happening the last few hours that Israel has started shelling the Rafa land Crossing between Egypt and Gaza what do you what do you make of this it shows that once again there are no red lines you know after the last months when we've consistently heard from President Biden many in the EU even in the Arab world that there's a red line Israel cannot go into rougher that red line does not exist and what we're seeing I think here is netanyahu's so-called strategy which is that he realizes within the Israeli public he's deeply unpopular his stated aims on October the 7th none of them have been achieved namely so-called total victory over Hamas destroying Hamas or getting all the hostages back none of that has happened and he therefore feels that continuing the war a so-called Forever War is essential and it's important just to note that ruffer of course as you rightly say is not just a key crossing point for aid but also for people but the only way Palestinians can get out of Rafa the ones who are able to leave is there and if that border shuts then the roughly 1.5 million Palestinians who are trapped in Rafa have nowhere to go I mean we're hearing from Israeli media reports that Israeli forces are planning to capture this border crossing in the next few hours talk us through uh the significance of this border crossing how significant would it be that dided happen I me this is where the majority of aid for example comes in and the fact is as vir every Aid organization is saying for months that there is a literal famine going on in northern part of Gaza and many other parts of Gaza and a key entry point for the aid that is getting in which is still far far too little is Raa so if that shuts what that essentially shows which has been clear four months starvation is the point I think for a lot of people in the International Community the idea that a state that we see is democratic when I say we I mean much in the western Elites see as Democratic Israel would deliberately starve a Palestinian population is seen as so outrageous sure Russia or China would do that Israel would never do that but in fact that's what they're doing right now so if ruer is shut down or reduced in terms of the ability to get Aid in already there is massive malnutrition starvation children are d there's an access to water problem there's huge amounts of pollution within the water that many people are drinking many diseases are exploding in ruer and elsewhere and even in the areas by the way that Israel has claimed the so-called safe zones and there are no safe zones in Gaza are being bombed and yet again we see that the US and frankly much International Community which basically means the US will not put a break on Israel which they could do you think that this is it this is effectively that much touted Rafa operation that we've all been sort of dreading is this starting now look it may be and but I think what Israel will find even if they go into ruer with lots and lots of troops and they try to destroy more tunnels or try to get some more Hamas lead is what they'll find in other parts of Gaza the as the US found in Iraq or Afghanistan after years of occupation you cannot actually successfully occupy territory without insane amounts of troops millions of troops which Israel does not have so even if Israel's in Rafa what we already seeing in other parts of Gaza the North and elsewhere is Hamas forces still operating still existing still fighting that will continue it is impossible to finally militarily destroy hamus you can degrade them to be sure but the idea that somehow you can destroy that and it's important to not that there are some Gin who undeniably despise Hamas because of what's happened in the last six months along with Israel of course but hamas's popularity in the West Bank is growing other parts of the Arab and Muslim World Hamas support is increasing you cannot destroy the idea of what Hamas is for better or worse and the dreaded Rua incursion or Invasion really shows as I said before that there's been no serious International pressure on Israel none weapons are still flowing from the US and Germany particularly and it's pretty shameful to me that all the outrage fo outrage that we read in the international press regurgitated from us officials and European officials and even Arab officials means nothing on the ground where Israel is seemingly about to go into rougher and cause Carnage indeed okay good to speak to Anthony Lowenstein independent journalist and author of The Palestine laboratory thank you make sure to
