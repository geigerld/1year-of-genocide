increasingly in Gaza there is nowhere left for Palestinians to run from north to south Israeli air strikes have repeatedly hit refugee camps residential buildings before the war these were gaza's main population centers home to more than 2.3 million people under an Israeli Land Air and sea blockade on October 13th the Israeli military ordered more than 1 million people in the north to move South saying it was for their safety and nearly 2 months of War about 1.8 million Palestinians have been uprooted from their homes most of them made the journey to the South the UN says 98,000 displaced people are Sheltering in 99 facilities in central Gaza can yunas and ruer and now after a weekl long ceasefire Israel has expanded its offensive hitting crowded neighborhoods in parts of Southern Gaza its Army has dropped leaflets calling Kan Yuna City a dangerous combat zone leaving displaced and distraught Palestinians with nowhere left to go we're joined Now by Chris Gunners he is a former spokesperson for anra that is the un's Palestinian Agency for refugees he's also founder of the Myanmar accountability project a humanitarian organization and he's joining us live from London thank you very much for your time Mr Gunners you know Gaza very well when you hear that four and five people have been forced to leave their homes in Gaza one point 8 million people those are the new UN numbers out today can you tell us what that means for people there it means that the people of Gaza are staring into the humanitarian abyss and to be clear this is a humanitarian abyss of choice unra the main UN agency charged with bringing relief houses they they do um schools hospitals um that organization is frankly literally Running on Empty there's almost no fuel for unra so their operation is entirely or nearly shut down and that means that for the people of Gaza their Lifeline has gone and what that means for me as someone who works on accountability in relation to Myanmar not not Israel Palestine it means there has to be accountability so what we're seeing is the potential crimes being committed International crimes so the withholding of international Aid look at article 7 and 8 of the Rome statute which defines war crimes and crimes against humanity deliberate killing that's another crime defined by the um by the Rome statute and what I say is and I include Hamas in this I would like to see all of the crimes being committed investigated and already there is an investigation because the international criminal court has an open investigation into crimes committed in the territory of Palestine so I would call for all of these crimes to be properly investigated and the perpetrators to B to be brought to individual criminal accountability that's what we have to see sorry and you're not of course you're not the only one calling for that and there has to and there has to be accountability later but now what needs to happen to get Aid into Gaza for those 1 8 million people who are depending on it it's actually very simple there's a crossing point called Kum shalom it's in the south of Gaza between Israel and Gaza itself it's like a port with lane lane after Lane like you know you get coming through major ports it's possible to get hundreds and hundreds of trucks through Kum Shalom every day before this war not through Karam Shalom but unra was bringing in 500 trucks a day in order to deal with the sheer magnitude of what we're now seeing in Gaza we need to open up Karam Shalom and have a massive injection of Aid into Gaza only that I think will avoid who can force what is already who can force who can force Israel to open up that Crossing well it's clearly the Americans um because it's the Americans who are frankly supplying billions of dollars in economic and military aid to to Israel and just a few days ago we had Mr blinken saying that Israel has to meet its obligations under International humanitarian law and that involves protecting occupied people because Israel controls the lanan air borders that gives Israel effective control which means that it is an occupying force and an occupier has specific obligations under the Geneva conventions to protect occupied populations so the whole the Kum Shalom needs to be opened up and Gaza needs to be flooded with food with water with fuel there's a massive need for Aid and that must be met because if it isn't we're going to start seeing huge numbers of deaths caused by the kind you know watery diarrhea that can become a killer and that is what the people of Gaza are facing yeah on top of the more than 15,500 Palestinians who've already been killed since you were talking about accountability what we are seeing happen in the trip we have seen for the past 15 years during conflicts there which you have lived through do you think that if Israel had been held to account in the past for things that it's doing now that we would be in a situation that we're in now what I would say is that if there had been proper accountability let's suppose a situation in which there were arrest warrants put out for Mr Netanyahu for example the Israeli defense minister if Israel knew that further demonization which there has already been an actual criminal accountability held against their leaders I think there would be different sorts of decision making and it may be I'm not saying definitely it may be that had there been proper criminal accountability against people on both sides then perhaps this conflict would have gone in a different direction people have to know that this whole sale industrial scale Slaughter that's going on has a price tag and that price is criminal accountability it's happened in Yugoslavia for example bovich and karajic and madich the bosan servs and president of Serbia when it became politically expedient for Serbia to hand over mosovich he was no use politically to them he was handed over to the he who knows what Mr netanyahu's future is perhaps one day he'll become politically dispensable and perhaps he will have a different fate perhaps he too might end up in the ha to face accountability and Mr ganis again for now for the immediate future of those 1.8 million and Palestinians and Gaza who are displaced you have said in the past that Palestinians that they are truly the dispossessed of the Earth how concerned are you that they will be able to return to their homes you know it's a great concern I've been speaking to people in Gaza remember these are refugees who were made refugees in 1948 then in ' 67 they saw the occupation begin and then from 2007 they saw the blockade so there are three levels of catastrophe and crisis that we're seeing and what we know from what we've seen since the 7th of October is that there are very few constraints against Israel and what we're seeing as by the way Israeli ministers have called for um another Napa in Gaza and I fear that that is what is being perpetrated today just lastly Mr Gunners we've spoken about how to get that much needed Aid into Gaza but what about the bombing how do we get the bombing to stop is it also solely up to the US now to put real pressure on Israel yes I mean the last time this really happened was under James Baker US seu state um you know many decades ago where he made it clear that there were going to be Financial penalties and my concern is that unless America is prepared to talk about serious economic and diplomatic repercussions for what Israel is doing today the widespread disregard for international humanitarian law then I think this kind of bombing is going to continue and an additional concern is what we're going to see is refugees in huge numbers being pushed into the Sinai the effective um ethnic cleansing which is why I also think that there's been some discussion around un circles I'm not saying in the UN of some kind of protective presence to make sure that we're not seeing Mass Force displacement which is a crime it's an international crime and we have to make sure that that does not happen because as I say truly they are the dispossessed of the earth and they must not see further dispossession Mr gunnis it is great to get your insights on the story we really appreciate it that is the former spokesman for anra the un's Palestinian refugee agency Chris gunnis live in
