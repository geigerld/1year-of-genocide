from occupied East Jerusalem and H what are we hearing from the Israeli military on this the Israeli Army has released a statement saying that at least 40 Rockets were fired from Lebanese territory many of them intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system and the rest falling in open areas at this point in time they're not reporting any injury or damage to buildings or infrastructure it comes after these Isis had struck several targets they say inside of Southern Lebanon that belong to hisbah the Israeli Army is also saying that earlier on Friday they shot down two hisbah uavs that they say were explosive the continuation of the exchanges of fire the Israeli Army says is escalating and they are turning from the defensive to the offensive to actively pursuing hisbah wherever they are but this has been something they've been saying for the last couple of weeks that they're just no longer on the defensive but in fact actively pursuing hisbah wherever they operate whether it's in Beirut whether it's in Syria or all across the Middle East the Israeli Army says they're prepared to fight hisb La Moore the Israeli Army Chief of Staff in fact approving plans for more army and military activity in Southern Lebanon what they say against more hisbah targets and infrastructure but at this time the Israeli Army has not yet yet responded and has not yet struck anything in retaliation they say for these rockets that were fired in one of the largest barges we've seen since these border cross border fire exchanges began all right good stuff there from H for us actually let me keep you for a moment and ask you about another development that's been going on with the reports of the head of centcom in Israel hamda what is his mission understood to be exactly well it's quite interesting because this latest barrage of rockets comes as the Israelis are anticipating a retaliatory attack from the adians for striking the adonan Diplomatic mission in Damascus just a couple of weeks ago so there is a lot of fear within the Israelis that there is going to be some sort of large attack in response and that it is going to be inside of Israeli territory the head of centcom meeting with both the Army chief of staff and the Israeli defense minister who says quote the US and Israel stand shoulder toosh shoulder in the face of any sort of Iranian threats the Americans say these are viable threats and they are also expecting some sort of response now yab Galant the defense minister says that there will be an appropriate response from Israel if there is an attack on Israeli territory so there are a lot of moving Parts here within Israel's war there are many active and open fronts you have the war on Gaza which is entering its seventh month we have passed the 6mon mark there you have the situation on the northern border that is continuously escalating that there is no chance according to the Israelis of it really being solved with any sort of diplomatic measure and then you have the anticipation of this retaliatory Iranian attack on Israeli territory so there are a lot of moving Parts but the Israeli defense and security establishments say that they are prepared for a wide variety of scenarios and they have raised that alert and preparedness level to the maximum possible scale all right thanks so much H let's continue the discussion we've got here in the studio Al jazer senior political analyst mwan Bish joins us now on set mwan first of all let's put this in context this is not the anticipated Iranian strike that people have been talking about right it's safe to say that this is this is part of the exchange and dynamic between Hezbollah and Israel it is but it's also part of the escalation MH this is not the same that we've seen the past six months I am not exactly um on board with Israel's own characterization of this as going from the defensive to the offense because Israel wasn't exactly on the defense the past six months if you look only at the number of casualties and The Targets in in southern Lebanon you will see that Israel has killed at least 10 times times more um hisbah and Lebanese than Israelis were killed in the exchanges and far more targets were hit in southern Lebanon than they were in Israel so Israel is not just going simply from the defensive to the offense it's actually escalating the war in Lebanon as it is or has escalated the war with Iran but what we see today yes as you stated is hisbah responding uh more forcefully would say to Israel's repeated escalations we saw today earlier today we saw Israeli strikes on Lebanon we should put it in that context amidst the the talk from Israeli military officials on Sunday talking about what you just referenced there going on offensive operations is there do you see preparations for anything approaching a round offensive well you know we've we've heard uh from the likes of Israel Defense Minister you have galons threats and ultimatums that if hisbah escalates further that Israel is going to turn beut into another Gaza right so that's been the ultimatum MH um I'm not sure how serious that is I doubt at this point in time while Israel is consumed by the war on Gaza that it will open another land front in Lebanon it certainly would drain its uh sources big time how much of a strain would that be to the Israeli military which is having to reach out to the Earth to ask for more ammunition just to keep its war going in Gaza absolutely I think what we've learned the past six months that despite all the talk about Israel's Regional superiority and it does have a superiority on a number of fronts notably Air Force and the likes but opening two land fronts with two non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah would probably be a blow to Israel at this point in time and that's why the Israelis have actually avoided any such uh opening of two land fronts because Israel would have liked this very particular Netanyahu government is in fact I mean that's the whole point of attacking that Iranian consulate right it wants to expand the war but it doesn't want to do it a alone it wants to bring the United States in so if there's going to be any land invasion of Lebanon or any expansion or to new fronts it's going to have to involve with the United States and just quickly about that just quickly it's paradoxical huh that for many decades we thought that Israel is meant to serve Israel's America's security and strategic interest in the area but for the past six months what has been proven is that it's the United States that serves and protects Israel's strategic and Military interests in I'm glad you're mentioning the US in this because this is coming as we've got the centcom chief visiting Israel is this a coincidence it's absolutely not a coincidence I mean if anything what there's two main things have to be said about that because I've been thinking about that much much of the day to be honest one I mean yes he is there to study and prepare for the Iranian response but more importantly more importantly the sencom head is in Israel to prepare to for the Israeli response to the Iranian response because that's more important for the United States at this point in time I think I think the United States understands the bid admin understands that Israel can or will be somehow in a position to resp to to defend whatever whether it's against Iranian drones or against Iranian missiles and the United States could help but the major escalation will happen is is in Israel's response to the Iranian response does does the US want to see a major escalation does it want to get bogged down yet again in another Middle Eastern conflict when you listen to them despite the tough talk we're hearing when you listen to them uh you hear two things at the same time one is that they have Israel's back they're going to do whatever it takes to defend Israel as Biden put it on the other hand they don't want in their terms the regionalization of the war on Gaza that's what they say now they're trying apparently at this point in time to manage the the response to the Iranian response they're actually even trying to manage the Iranian response itself there is indirect talks with Iran about what it will response will be right and that's why the Iranians have been quite koi about what exactly they are going to be doing is it going to be major it's going to be a oneoff or it's going to be series what do you think is likely to happen there's a lot of anticipation about whether it will be a massive Iranian attack is that likely that's what the Pentagon is saying and they're talking about the end of the week which means today tomorrow God knows when the Iranians continuously remain ambiguous and I think it's to their to their to their credit to their advantage they're clever about it because the longer it takes and the more guessing there is and the more diplomats pull out of Israel and the more tourists don't go to Israel the better it is for Iran's capacity to uh issue threats but look look Sami there is one one important point that would well we haven't missed but we haven't really uh underlined which I think is the most important point of all this discussion and it goes as as follows Netanyahu has been playing Biden like a fiddle he has has played Biden for months now Biden continues to say I have Israel's back and Israel have a right to defense itself while Netanyahu is taking this notion of Israel's right to defense itself into whole other Arenas like genocide in Gaza like regionalization of the war when he can the at the service of his and his coalition's shortterm interest he is sacrificing Israel's and regionals long-term survival and and and interest and bringing the United States into it because if this thing escalates and it could very well escalate it could very well turn into some kind of regional confrontation the United States will get stuck in a Middle East that it has tried for the past many years to escape after 20 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan after 78 trillion dollar of American losses we were supposed to be in an era of ending the forever Wars but Netanyahu once again is playing Biden like a fiddle he's trying to bring the United States back into the Middle East into a major confrontation with Iran I'll tell you how what will be the the Catalyst for that why was Netanyahu taking those photo up in the with the press in front of an F-15 I'm not sure F15 or F35 in front of a major uh fighter jet today and yesterday it's because there is an understanding that he could actually attack Iran attack Iran nuclear nuclear program that he will take advantage of his own escalation against the Iranian Consulate in Syria in order then to take it as a pretext whatever the Iranian response is and attack the Iran nuclear among other Targets in Iran right that will mean an absolute regionalization involving the United States and Iran and I think that's what the United States worries about but the United States is not taking the initiative it's only responding to netanyahu's own ploes I guess time is going to tell and you'll be here to help us analyze it Maran bishara make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
