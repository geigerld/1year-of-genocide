the international community's efforts address the plight of the Palestinian people to enable the realization of their inalienable rights including to self-determination and freedom and to bring an end to the grave and historic Injustice they have borne for over 75 years since the start of the nakba an ongoing and Searing nakba that we have painfully witnessed in the dark days of these past weeks and across the decades we are grateful to Ambassador Ahmed fisel Muhammad VI Vice chair for presenting the committee's annual report to the general assembly reflecting on the committee's many effort over the past year and its appeals to the International Community As We Gather once again in this assembly to address the question of Palestine to take stock of where we are today and where we are going as the United Nations carries forth in its permanent responsibility towards the question of Palestine until it is justly resolved in all its aspects in accordance with international law and the relevant un resolutions Mr President the UN Charter starts with this line we the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding Generations from the scorge of War I often repeat this line in many of my statements not a single Palestinian generation has been saved from the scourge of War every single one has witnessed and endured Horrors in it flesh an entire nation over decades has faced this position displacement denial of rights destruction and death M May m maybe since the 1948 generation this generation is the one that has has suffered most painfully and traumatically this is the deadliest period ever endured by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and they have witnessed many previous assaults this is the largest Force displacement of Palestinians since the nakba this destruction is apopyp and the humanitarian crisis catastrophic there are no laws no morals no principles in this world that can justify this abhorent in Humane reality it is one that shakes humans conscience and demands Global action for justice Mr President the massacres against our people in Gaza have mobilized peoples and Nations all around the world speaking out against Injustice and calling for justice calling for a ceasefire now in Gaza I repeat calling for a ceasefire now in Gaza calling for an end to the Israeli occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people calling for a free Palestine the general assembly was the first un body to reflect This Global outrage and to take a clear and unequivocal stance for calling for an immediate durable and sustained humanitarian truths leading to a secession of hostilities I must add the Secretary General called for a humanitarian ceasefire now now and the president of the general assembly few minutes ago in his statement repeated the same idea the assembly convened in an emergency special session and took this courageous step over one month ago 2/3 of the UN membership voted in favor of this resolution had it been implemented then thousand thousand of Palestinian lives would have been spared and families would not have endured such Agony and anguish in adopting this resolution the general assembly was Guided by the imperatives of legality morality and humanity and it proved also to be correct politically it took the security Council several more deadly and devastating weeks to finally act on a less ambitious resolution but driven by SE by several of the same humanitarian considerations addressed by the general assembly as the assembly's resolution had foreseen only a truth could allow sincere efforts to begin to address the humanitarian catastrophe being inflicted by Israel the occupying power in Gaza only a truce could lead to the release of people held in captivity and avoid further Regional escalation this truth must turn into a permanent ceasefire the massacres of Palestinian children women and men cannot resume should not resume you should not allow it to resume the human conscience cannot bear it international law including humanitarian and human rights law prohibits it international law but also the Norms of humanity demand that we act to stop this war against innocent civilians and save human lives that we act for humanitarian Aid and access throughout the Gaza Strip the return of those displaced without delay the end of The Siege and blockade and that we act for accountability nothing can ever justify war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide Mr President as more and more images of the the devastation in Gaza reaches the world each one of us has a choice to make either for protection of civilians or their Slaughter either for the rule of international law or indiscriminate Vengeance either for the prospect of peace or P or Perpetual conflict virtually every nation represented here has decid decied some sooner other than later to join the right side of history now we need to stand United in putting an end to this madness and charting a way forward for a more just peaceful stable future Mr President 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza including more than 6,000 children and 4,000 women more than 30,000 people have been wounded with many suffering amputations and burns enduring their injuries and pain without medical care and with nowhere safe to heal and recover over 1.8 million civilians in Gaza or nearly 80% of the population are estimated to be internally displaced the majority of them refugees displaced for the second third or fourth times in their lives of them nearly 1.1 million are Sheltering in 156 un facilities across Gaza bearing indignities that no human should be forced to bear and will and still not protected even under the UN flag even that is not respected by the occupying power as it deliberately strikes at homes schools hospitals and un shelter with barbaric and punitive violence intent on destroying the bases of human life in Gaza intent on and terrorizing and traumatizing everyone the sheer magnitude of the killing and maming of the destruction and forc displacement is testimony to how indiscriminate this war is and goes to show that its primary targets and victims are actually the civilian population in the Gaza Strip no conflict in recent memory has seen so many children killed at this space civilians killed at the space journalists killed at the space un staff killed at this space humanitarian and medic IAL Personnel killed at this space this is a full-fledged war against Palestine and its people this is Rec confirmed by what we are witnessing in the West Bank with over 230 Palestinians killed and thousands have been injured in the p in the span of seven weeks at the hands of isra isi occupation forces and settlers added to the more than 180 Palestinians killed prior to October in total among them 107 children this is the deadliest period virtually ever witnessed in the West Bank over 1,200 Palestinians have been displaced over the same s week weeks period added to the more than 1,000 forcibly displaced earlier this year as Israel carries on nonstop with its illegal settlement colonization and annexation of our land more than 3,000 Palestinian civilians including childr have been arrested and detained by incessant military raids by the Israeli occupying forces across the West Bank including East Jerusalem in the same 7 weeks period now bringing the number of prisoners to over 10,000 Palestinians held captive in Israeli jails enduring you H inhumane conditions the oppression and persecution abuse and discrimination against our people continues unabated under this illegal Israeli col Colonial occupation and upper tide regime it is the same logic at play everywhere for the Israeli government the priority is not security it is the destruction of the Palestinian nation of the very presence and existence of the Palestinian people on their land of Palestinian statehood even at the expense of security through this dispos through disposition displacement denial of rights and if all that is not enough then through death even their right to life is denied you know how we know all this because Israeli leaders cannot get themselves to hide it anymore they are telling you this every day in every statement they make in the words of one of them Palestinians have three choices and this one is a minister sitting in the cabinet of prime minister Netanyahu the choices are surrender and subjugation Exodus or death three choices surrender and sub subjugation Exodus or death and we reject these things because we are proud people and we are determined to live in our national Homeland Mr President this cast rophe demonstrated two things that there is no peace in the Middle East without a just and Lasting solution to the question of Palestine in accordance with international law and resolutions and that pal Palestinian Freedom not further oppression and occupation is the path to peace and security for all

right to life the right to exist in dignity and peace and and stab ility in our homeland Palestine Palestine cannot Remain the exception to the rule of law and the enjoyment of Human Rights all our efforts must be dedicated now to prevent further massacres and to ending the assault on the lives and existence of the Palestinian Nation but we must in parallel be preparing for for an unprecedented bold and Collective effort to end colonization and occupation and aperti and to achieve peace the two- State solution requires a strong independent and Sovereign Palestinian State on the 19667 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital those who favor such a solution must take action against the colonial occupation that prevents and kills such a prospect and must recognize the state of Palestine provide it with membership at the UN and help it actualize its sovereignity on the ground you have to act now we have to become like you a full member in the United Nations to begin the process of the actualization of the two State solution after we end the occupation it is your Collective responsibility to allow us to accomplish that there is no peace in Middle East without a solution to the Palestinian situation the words of Riyad mansor the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations speaking there at un headquarters in New York addressing the Assembly of Nations a reminder of course
