well let's now bring in nebal farak she's a spokeswoman for the Palestine red cresant Society she joins me now from rala nebal if you don't mind I want to start with what I was just discussing there with hany to try to get a clearer overview we understand at least 60% of Health Facilities have now had to stop operations we were hearing there about requests for for more evacuations how many hospitals are functioning in Gaza at the moment and what sort of services are they able to offer at this stage basically almost 16 house hospitals out of 35 Hospital have already went out of service due to either bombardment or running out of a fuel and medical supplies now the rest of the hospitals are witnessing a collapse they are literally collapsing witnessing a severe shortage of medical supplies and medicine as well as running out of a fuel the situation H even in Gaza and the another Northern is worth sing day by day because of the Israel prev ition of the arrival of Aid to the north and Gaza it has completely separate the Gaza and the north from the south and now the aid is only getting into the South but not of the aid is getting into the north the Palestine red crescent as a humanitarian organization we are unable we along with other humanitarian agencies who are working in Gaza Strip up to this moment are unable to allow the entry of Aid in Gaza and the nether although hospitals are extremely collapsing now they are working in full capacity trying to save as much people as they can although people are now getting treated at the ground in in hospitals Corridor because uh already they are overwhelmed a high number of casualties since Israel intensify its air strikes in Gaza and the North this comes with this extreme shortage of medical supplies and medicine and running out of a fuel but I want to say an example alud hospital is run by the Palestine red cresant we are only 36 hours far and we will be completely running out of a fuel for alot hospital that means our hospital will stop operating and that means our patients who are correctly injured connected to life support machines and oxygen as long as also babies and incubators will lose their life in hours due to a complete cut of power since up to this moment not even a one liter of the fuel has been allowed to get into Gaza because Israel refused to allow the entry of a fuel to Gaza although it is urgently needed fuel means life now we are ours from a complete shutdown of all hospitals in Gaza a complete also top of all ambulances in Gaza ambulances need fuel in order to continue operate even truck Aid will also stop because basically trucks need a fuel and then we will be unable to receive the humanarian aid or distributed as well as you say fuel has been a huge huge problem we've been hearing that everyone has been on the cusp of of closing down at various times we've been wondering how is anyone at the moment still operating that there were hospitals that were saying that they were going to run out but some of them have managed to continue functioning in in some capacity are we just seeing rationing take place here or are there is there fuel being found somewhere else I'll tell you our example as the Palestine R Cresent we run alot hospital we have been preserving energy in unprecedented ways I don't think none of the hospitals in the world will do that could you imagine that we turn off the ators all day long and then just turn it on when there's emergency cases getting into the hospital when uh when we operate the generators for oxygen to have oxygen for our patients who are connected to to oxygen machines we have to turn off the AC from the Intensive Care Unit to preserve to preserve energy as much as we can we are literally trying trying our our best to continue providing our life saving services in Gaza we are the lead Emergency Medical Service in Gaza we uh work our ambulances is in ground trying to save uh people's life however already three ambulances stopped because running out of gasoline I just got a call from my colleague he told me that five ambulances in the northern are on the way to complete stop because they already run out of gasoline the situation is just catastrophic we have been trying our best to continue providing our humanitarian services our life saving services in Gaza however we have been left alone up to this moment the International Community have failed to support the humanity in Gaza have failed even to support us as a humanitarian agency to continue providing our life saving Services up to this moment International Community can't even allow the entry of nonstop humanitarian in Gaza including a fuel nbal I know that the conditions are are truly terrible there on the ground you talked about having to turn off oxygen turn off ventilators to to turn off the machines that are keeping people including newborn children alive have we seen seen these things take place at other hospitals that have had to shut down absolutely and now all hospitals are just just working from their humanitarian Mission they are trying to continue working to the last second in order to support the civilians in Gaza who are been under intense bombardments that is taking place for over a month with this large number of casualties and people who have been killed most of them are children and women so continue operating that doesn't mean that the case is well the situation in all hospitals is already catastrophic and we are on our way for a complete shutdown for all hospitals that means over two million civilians in Gaza they are not only with no food water uh medicine uh Power and even fuel they soon will be without even medical care services without even Emergency Medical Services that means Palestinians will have to die under the rubble because there will be no ambulances that could transfer them to the hospitals that at at that time hospitals will be completely shut down that mean we urge the International Community we urge all world leaders to intervene immediately to intervene immediately to ensure first the protection of civilians and Health Care personnel and hospitals who should be protected under International humanitarian law to ensure the allow of Entry of humanitarian Aid unconditional nonstop safe humanitarian Aid into Gaza including the fuel to save thousands of others Palestinians who might lose their life due to this complete blockade Nal farak there a spokeswoman for the Palestine red Cresent Society describing some of the conditions that their very brave medical staff are working in in Gaza thank you so much for joining us nabal and we really wish you and your teams all the best thank you
