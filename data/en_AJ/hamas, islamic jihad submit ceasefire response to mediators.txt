[Music] you're watching Al jazer I want to tell you straight away about some breaking news that has just come in uh we are told sources have told Al jazer that Hamas has submitted its response to the US outlined ceasefire proposal that's coming as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group issued a joint statement expressing Readiness to reach a deal now according to sources they have made some amendments the Amendments include a withdrawal from the entire Gaza Strip including the Rafa Crossing and the Philadelphia Corridor we'll try and get you more details as they come in and then we'll share them with you um at this juncture I want to bring in our guest James Elder he is a UNICEF spokesperson and he joins us live from in Gaza James grateful to have you with us um you're back in Gaza how would you describe the situation hell on Earth Lea um after what happened over the weekend to be today in alaxa hospital um where which was already packed already Beyond capacity last week and then to have 400 people with these horrendous wounds of War coming in the space of an hour so again today walking around with a doctor with these incredible Physicians who are doing 24-hour shifts we're walking over children with these wounds of War on the floor you know with head with head injuries because the capacity has just been absolutely absolutely devastated it felt like it could have been day one of this horrendous war on children it is of course day 250 and then to leave the hospital and of course all we see is Rubble I I I walk outside and and there is there is a lady who's in tears because her family home has been destroyed her husband's killed and she just wants wants a tent Lea as you and your viewers know these stories are everywhere but they're Relentless and that's why we hope this talk of a ceasefire for th those people in power who seem to be honest utterly disconnected from the suffering of the civilians of Gaza hopefully now this is that moment because people from what I'm seeing this time around look like they're just hanging on just hanging on I mean the atrocities that have been unfolding have been truly shocking what do you make you know as as you're witnessing the situation there where you are on the ground and the wrangling over the ceasefire that just contined news yeah it is I I think you know we have to move beyond the words we have to look at at the evidence on the ground and the evidence on the ground literally in terms of the rubble or literally with Wounded children in tears on the ground is there for all to see the intent here has been the devastation of Gaza and the devastation of Gaza from schools and and universities the education to the agriculture to to the learning capacity it's it's it's been ubiquitous uh and we see this across now the G of strip to see a million people have had to move from Rafa exhausted Shell Shocked to try again and find another home Believe It or Not There is a shortage now of tents and people are under plastic sheeting it's 45 degrees so I think it's very clear what the reality is that people are enduring now of course they hold on to hope people have to hold on to Hope Lea when I meet people again people I've become friends with and I say how are you which sounds like such a silly question their response is alive this is people are grateful for being alive it is insane that that this beautiful Society is being reduced to gratitude for being alive so yes the ceasefire needs to look into the eyes of doctors who ask me how much more evidence does the Western World need or children who simply plead plead to see their parents again this is what this fire hopefully hopefully will bring James Elder UNICEF spokesperson sir thank you so very much and I want to go now to Imran Khan who is in the Jordanian Capital Aman uh just to get some more on that breaking news that we've been telling you about Imran I understand you're joining us on the phone can you hear me okay yeah I've got you Imran uh so as we've just uh broke the news that Hamas has submitted its response to the US outlin ceasefire proposal what are you hearing from your side well what Hamas sources have told Al jazer is they are ready and have submitted a response to the proposed ceasefire deal to the qari and Egyptian mediators this is a joint statement that they have released so it's now very clear that they are willing to negotiate earlier in the day uh we heard from an Hamas official after the resolution uh news had broken in the security Council that Hamas were willing to send negotiators this is now a step forward to that they've responded to the Egyptians and the qataris Hamas are now ready to do something that will get to a ceasefire the ball is now in Israel's Court remember the ceas the original ceasefire deal that put forward he always said this is the Israeli ceasefire deal Israel was quite surprised by that um and what Israel said was we are willing to perhaps commit to the first phase of this which is a original six week Seas deal and then um the release of captives uh but what Anthony blinkin has done for the last four days uh is talk about the idea that this is on Hamas Hamas need to respond Hamas need to do something this is on Hamas well this is now hamas's response Hamas have quite clearly um said they are willing to negotiate and this let's see what happens in the next couple of days remember on Wednesday Anthony blinkin is in Doha there is a press conference happening at 5:00 p.m. local time with the air of Qatar he's going to have to take in this Hamas response and talk about that at the ceasefire at the um sorry the uh press conference so right now it's very breaking news there's only a few details that we have but the clear messages from both Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas that they are willing to talk they're willing to talk Imran but a salian detail here according to sources is they um they have made some amendments and the Amendments include a withdrawal from the entire Gaza strip including Rafa Crossing and the Philadelphia Corridor are these non-starters though for the Israelis well Hamas have actually always called for a permanent ceasefire that was always what they were working towards all of these are now just negotiating details whether they're negotiating right now in public which is what's happening or whether they're negotiating in private hamas's position has always been very clear a permanent seire that's something Israel does not want to do prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has always been very very clear we need to destroy Hamas both politically and mil militarily most of his actual generals most of the Israeli security establishment thinks that that goal may not be able to happen in the way the Prime Minister wants so although they've been clear on the details they haven't changed the Hamas haven't changed their position it's always been about a permanent ceasefire for Hamas it's always been about a permanent ceasefire for Hamas I'm just wondering in terms of from the Israeli leadership's perspective of specifically prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu um you know if they if he were to accept a ceasefire would that essentially spell out the end of his government that is a question that I sorry I can you still hear me yes you're we can hear you Iman uh that is a question better put to analysts and people who are have an opinion all I can report is the news to you and the news and sorry I'm I'm pausing slightly because it is a very awkward question to answer here's here's the thing in Israel the common thinking is that if uh there's an end to the war and there is a a new election prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu loses so he continues the war because he wants to stay in power that is an opinion that many people in Israel hold I think that's the only way I can answer that question gotcha no worries so Imran in terms of you know uh up to now we I mean we've heard today from uh US Secretary of State uh uh blinkin Anthony blinkin but I'm wondering have we heard from um prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing uh this resolution that was passed in uh the uh un Security Council well let me tell you the response to the UN Security Council resolution was incredibly muted the only real thing that we heard was actually a statement by the uh US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who turned around and said Mr Benjamin who has committed to a ceas fire proposal compare that to what happened with the last three C5 proposals when Israel went after the United Nations and said the United Nations are anti-israeli the United Nations are anti-semitic um they couldn't do that with this resolution because it was us Le and even the Israelis would not criticize the US now backstage uh there was a lot of confusion because Anthony uh sorry President Joe Biden had always said that this was the Israeli proposal that they were putting forward in Israel there was a lot of surprise about that because they thought that they would commit to the first stage of it which is a six week ceasefire and then the release of some captives and then another stage but what they didn't want is is the idea that the third stage would be Israeli troops withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and the rebuilding of Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been absolutely clear about this and I'm going to repeat this again he wants to destroy Hamas politically and militarily in his close circles and in the far-right government the ceasefire deal is being seen as allowing Hamas to survive and that's a big political problem for the Prime Minister Imran Khan reporting Imran grateful for uh your reporting and uh thank you
