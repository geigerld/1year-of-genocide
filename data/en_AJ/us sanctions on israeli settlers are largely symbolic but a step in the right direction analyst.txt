the Biden Administration says it's sanctioning dozens of Israeli settlers that it accuses of carrying out attacks in the occupied West Bank paty khh reports now from Washington DC the videos are everywhere daily evidence of Palestinians being violently attacked by Israeli settlers often armed and in some cases murdering Palestinians burning homes businesses and cars they have weapons and started shooting at us we were trapped here in the houses with the children before October 7th the United Nations says violence from settlers had already displaced over 1,00 Palestinians and that since the beginning of the war daily settler attacks have more than doubled now the US is imposing travel bans on a few dozen of those responsible possibly including their family members as well the state department careful to point out it involves both sides as secretary blinkin made clear to leaders of the government of Israel last week week during his visit to the region they need to do more to stop extremist violence against Palestinians and hold those responsible for it accountable we will continue to insist that both Israeli and Palestinian leaders take action to interrupt the increasing levels of violence against civilians in a state of Law and Israel is a state of law the right to use violence belongs only to those who are certified to do so by the government in our case that's the military the Israeli police the shinb and such that will likely ring Hollow to the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank who say Israeli soldiers are often there and do nothing to stop the violence he saw the settlers some of them had weapons and were shooting it was fine with him but if you were standing 200 M from the settler telling him to go away the soldier would shoot you why is this happening repeated attacks with no consequences except now now one less place to visit for a few dozen Israelis Patty Kaine Al jazer Washington well we can get more on this from our White House correspondent Kimberly hit who joins us from Washington DC and Kimberly tell us how are these measures going down in the US well it's certainly being received by the largest Islamic group in the United States known as care it's the Council American Islamic ations uh as a step in the right direction but certainly not going far enough and here's why uh because what is well known is that many of these extremist uh settlers are dual passport holders in other words they have Israeli citizenship but they also hold American passports and that means that these restrictions are essentially meaningless for at least 15% of them uh they're able to to come into the United States because they're also US citizens so in other words uh they can continue to act with impunity and so what the Council on Islamic relations is saying is that there needs to be something with more teeth particularly when it comes to American citizens for example uh criminal charges the other thing that the that this group is is asking for is uh sanctions against the extremist cabinet members such as uh the National Security uh Minister Ben gavier the cabinet member that is a a known racist who espouses hate against both Palestinian Muslims and Christians uh justifying it as being something he says is in the Torah and uh essentially has been documented by Amnesty International as uh conducting and overseeing in the prisons as of October 7th uh torture Mur murder kidnapping uh and other atrocities uh under his watch so uh this is certainly again something that in terms of these visa restrictions being viewed as a step in the right direction but again this is being viewed as more something that the Biden Administration has done to satisfy political pressure but uh there needs to be something now that has real teeth in the eyes of many here in the United States of criminal nature through the justice system and that's what uh many here are pushing for Kimberly thanks for that and listening in is Adam Shapiro who's a director of advocacy for the Israel uh for Israel and Palestine at daor of Human Rights and foreign policy Think Tank he joins us live on Skype uh from Michigan in the United States and Adam Shapiro you heard Kimberly there these measures uh essentially meaningless many of these settlers are dual Nationals with the US passports anyway denying them visas doesn't get you very far how much impact uh realistically is this going to have on settler communities and settler activity across the occupied West Bank I think your correspondence is correct to to report that these uh this action is largely meaningless um and symbolic um the as you point out correctly those who are dual citizens and and there is certainly a category of those settlers who have committed violent acts against Palestinians who are American citizens or citizens of other countries and who won't be impacted by this Visa ban um but we we should understand this though I do think as an important signal that the administration is taking this issue more seriously we also do know that behind the scenes um uh not necessarily publicly announced that the administration is looking at other avenues of sanctioning um through means that it has its disposal that it uses uh towards individuals in other countries for similar types of human rights violations and so I think we have to understand this also that this is the beginning of a process that it's upon incumbent upon people like myself and others who work in the advocacy Community uh to keep pushing on and to keep uh pushing this Administration to take more meaningful steps and more uh consequential steps uh in order to to not just you know issue B Visa bans but also to actually have concrete sanctions including uh you know following what weapons are being used and if these weapons are americanmade and supplied weapons then dealing with the with that through the mechanisms that Congress has and and the administration would also have um as well as potential criminal proceedings going so far as as as as to use the criminal justice system they are as we we've said many of them dual Nationals American citizens as well that could be a measure with real teeth is that on the cards I think potentially that is definitely on the cards if we can make the strong enough case against an individual with especially the one with American citizenship but besides you know uh the judicial sort of criminal process there's other steps such as asset freezing um which would include bank accounts there's looking at the larger ecosystem of settler violence which would include looking at the NOS that provide charitable tax deductible funds uh to settlements and settlement Enterprises and then at a larger scale which is tied to the state because as your reporter you know noted uh there are those in the current Israeli government who are settlers themselves who are actively engaged in inciting and supporting settler violence and so looking at you know settlement Regional councils um which are these bodies governing the settlements and who are you know who involve many of these violent individuals um looking at these as criminal organizations much in the same way as a narc trafficking group would be looked at as a criminal organization with financial assets with other types of control and and weaponry and and uh using violence to execute you know its uh its plans I think that this is something that's available to the United States looking at it from from this angle and I think that's where we have to push the government but as things stand you'd agree that this is pretty much a symbolic gesture now albeit perhaps a message aimed by the Biden administration at the Netanyahu government which of course contains some senior figures in the settler community that perhaps more pressure is being prepared perhaps they are willing to go further I I definitely think that they are willing there is a willingness to go further I think this is also in part um the president's effort to sort of address The Descent Brewing internally in the state department and in other US Government administrations which are unhappy with Biden's policy towards Israel uh in in general including what's happening in Gaza but also what's Happ been happening in the West Bank um I think at this point the Biden Administration is starting to to wake up to understand that small gestures such as this will not have the results that it is hoping for or expecting that this current Israeli government just is not concerned at all with warnings they're only they only take notice when there are direct actions and that now is on the plate for the administration to do okay Adam Shapiro there with the human rights and foreign policy Think Tank Dawn many thanks for your thoughts thank you
