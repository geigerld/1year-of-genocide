I spoke to James Elder he's unicef's Global spokesperson he joined us from Gaza as the air strikes took place I've been coming here every day for a week and there are now children I know I know by name teaching a few kids to juggle something to break the moment to break the spell of of what they're under um and you can see gently gently they you can hear explosions again again now you can see the gentle change as they loosen as they the bit of childhood seeps back into them that was gone again today the fear the trauma the look in little boys and girls eyes as they see and they notice that that look of their parents that their parents are losing control their parents may not have the ability to protect them that's terrifying I sat again with a little boy I've been seeing Rob um ahed he's three he's lost his leg he's not speaking again he's absolutely mute he can hear the sounds here but yes of course the the medical staff here what to say they're phenomenal they they they never stop I'm sure they never will stop but the health system as who says time and again despite who's incredible efforts it's exhausted you know you cannot you cannot possibly in all good conscience start attacking the people of Gaza again and think that you will not have a massacre on your hands so the health staff will keep going my United Nations colleagues they they they don't stop go to the front lines because in their heart they believe they can make a difference and the in the worst times the most difficult times is when they come to the four but they too have families they too have children and loved ones who will be terrified right now as they as they too are near the front lines everyone does what they can yet it seems the only people who can make a decision um are not doing what they should James if you and the team there need to get to safety and of course anybody around you as well as those those attacks continue please do so please just stop and get to safety as fast as you can in the meantime just very quickly can you talk to us about what you're hearing the explosions that you were describing to us just a moment ago can you just talk to us about um the sounds that you're hearing and how close they might be to where you are yes I can I have no military expertise Rob just seen too much of this um so the first thing you notice is is the sound but simultaneously rob you just see in my peripheral vision or early when there attacks you just see people shutter particularly children you just see that reflex action that is becoming learn behavior of of fear seeping in so you know it's a sound first and there's drones and I'm still unable to differentiate between what flies over and what strikes and then it's plumes of smoke if it's close then you hear very quickly within a couple of minutes screams I guess of family members of loved ones as they see the reality of of another another person killed um and look it's kind of you of course of course we would move but as we've heard time and again there nowhere is safe in Gaza the the people in shifa saw this I cannot imagine I cannot imagine if you if you need and the team need to get brought to this Hospital uh of course we don't know what safety looks like there hundreds of children Robb in this Hospital who don't know what safety looks like the medical staff there there is no bunker here it's not the Ukraine no one knows what safety looks like they they they know what fear looks like they know what death looks like um and and we we pray that that that those who have the influence to to stop this to end the trauma and end the killing also understand what Their Fear um and what death for the children of Gaza looks like
