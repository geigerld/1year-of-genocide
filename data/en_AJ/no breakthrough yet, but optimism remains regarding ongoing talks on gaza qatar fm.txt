I have and if you have any questions I'll be ready fromer thank you Dr Majid the statement of Biden yesterday that I optimistic and the reservations of Hamas according to us hamdan where are now the mediation efforts and uh is there a real breakthrough and this can lead to more optimism we are still waiting for the announcement of the agreement within days thank you regarding the mediation at the time being or for the time being as we have said before so many developments have uh occurred and uh the meetings that have been dealt with through the media we don't have particular thing to announce today but we are uh we feel optimistic and uh the ongoing talks are there amongst the parties concerned but there's no uh particular development for the time being we are still within the framework of the mediation we heard some statements here and there through the media Outlets is the visit of His Highness the Amir to France will be accompanied by a solid result of break through in this uh effort of mediation particularly there are meetings in Paris regarding the gas summon that would be held in Algeria and hisus the Amir will take part as well or there are there any particular steps in this connection regarding the visit of his hir to France it's a minister of state and is related to the bilateral relations between the two countries regarding the Summit I have no I documented idea for the time being and I will tell you later if I have we have seen during uh the last few hours some development or some incident regarding the meeting of His Highness the Amir with is chief of the political Bureau of Hamas in Doha and a visit by a a delegation from Israel to Doha also theist the Amir is in a visit now to Paris can we have any connection between these events and can we expect a cease fire or truths or even a s of a Cession before the month of Ramadan as I said we don't have anything now to announced the efforts are being made meetings are ongoing on all levels and as we said we we need to be optimistic but we don't have certain thing to announce now I have a question regarding the starvation in Gaza and uh this starvation matter is the Salvation matter contained within the mediation efforts yes undoubtedly uh the International Community as a whole is uh clearly uh standing against the uh starvation in Gaza Strip not only on the north but in the entire of Gaza Strip we have seen videos that they wct this painful humanitarian uh position in Gaza thousands and thousands of people without water without food without electricity without even the basic things for a normal life it is a catastrophe that uh uh we should not give a blind eye to it not only within the talks but we have said that always that the humanitarian uh side must be always there the what is going on in Gaza is a violation to the international laws International Norms International agreements and it is painful to see this spot as uh as included in the media aan talks but undoubtedly as I said the humanitarian side in Gaza is part of our efforts despite the Israeli negative reactions and the situation of Hamas and three American vors but Biden still say that there might be a truce on Monday is this the result of the Paris talks or it is something from President Biden and the Israeli silence does it mean Israel accepts that another question regarding the uh content of the icg and the Israelis secret repes do you think one day we will know more about this I'll start by saying that no comment regarding the current talks and negotiations regarding what has been said by Biden probably to ask the White House is better but let me say that the efforts are ongoing meetings and talks are ongoing and all parties are involved but we hope that uh the session will be today before tomorrow but we don't have anything particular to say mad F from jaaz English I want to ask about the delivery of the humanitarian Aid to Gaza we had some news that the jordanians have air dropped some humanitarian Aid on the Gaza Beach and this was really difficult and people have used little boats to go uh deep into the sea to get some Aid like flour and other things Doha has sent humanitarian Aid in cooperation with the French PE officials do you have any green light that say that these Aid will enter Gaza will go to Gaza has the Israelis or have the Israelis submitted any flexibility to the negotiators we appreciate the efforts of every country Regional countries International countries to deliver the humanitarian Aid to the gazin the lift that has been made to send C humanitarian Aid to Gaza challenges regarding this humanitarian Aid are ongoing and yesterday some reports uh were uh saying that almost half of these humanitarian Aid have entered only and on The Daily uh uh work and efforts being exerted the the Palestinian red CES said that 20 uh 4 hours 48 hours will be hold of this delivery and the situation is deteriorating and undoubtedly the International Community must be serious in dealing with this matter this is a clear violation to the international law and this must be dealt with in a clear way we haven't seen a real pressure by the International Community in this regard a must enter Without Limits and without restrictions and still the talks are ongoing regarding facilitating delivering humanitarian Aid to the gazan people thank you and there you are listening to Majid alansari the spokesperson for the foreign Ministry we have been listening very closely or waiting for uh the foreign Ministry in Qatar to speak which is why we went there thinking they may have more information about the ongoing negotiation ations if they were ongoing between all of the stakeholders regarding the war on Gaza confirmation of course from our correspondent in occupied East Jerusalem that the Israeli delegation is in Doha uh non-committal certainly from the spokesperson here to say that they are here but he said all sides are talking to each other uh mediation efforts continue uh there's no real breakthrough he said no particular announcement to make we are optimistic but there are no developments Muhammed Val correspondent who was in that um news conference as well also asking about the aid drop um made by uh the jordanians which landed just off the coast we've got pictures of that later coming in the program of course gazans rushing into the water to try and collect most of that
