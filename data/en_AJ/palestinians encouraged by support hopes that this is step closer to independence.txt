it's another day under Israel's military occupation here in the occupied West Bank but Palestinians we've been speaking to tell us they have more reasons to feel hopeful now they've been seeing how three Western European countries are renouncing to recognize Palestine as an independent state but they're also saying that this comes on top of a wave of protests that have been supporting Palestinians in the past few months they've been seeing also students all across the world and is specifically in the US demonstrating and protesting for Palestinians we've met a Palestinian woman whose family is in Gaza now she lost her father in the beginning of the war on Gaza and she says she feels that his blood didn't go in vain I hope that all countries in the world recognize Palestine and end the war on Gaza we want to be like the rest of the world to live freely in our own State Israel needs to be put in its place I hope that more States will recognize Palestine so Israel is forced to end its War we're noticing a big change in the way Western countries perceive the idea of Palestine it's a positive shift that states are supporting us now the Palestinian presidency has welcomed the decision we've heard PLO officials calling it a historic one saying that this comes after series and years of diplomatic work in the international Arena and also in the United Nations today what we see is an important shift and this shift will be followed by others and we will continue to press on until we achieve our inalienable rights to self-determination Independence and to celebrate with the whole world this achievement the only achievement for the Palestinian people is ending this Injustice that has been going on for ages for years Palestinians have been telling us that they felt that they've been left alone abandoned by the rest of the world and they hope that this recognition will be one step of a series of steps that will bring them closer towards Freedom towards having their own independent states nid ibraim Al jazer the occupied West Bank Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
