17 countries including the United States have released a joint statement calling on Israel and Hamas to do whatever is necessary to agree on a ceasefire deal they also want the captives being held in Gaza to be freed let's get the reaction from the United States now Alan Fischer joins us from Washington what else did this statement have to say Alan well this coming from Joe Biden who of course is in France for the 80th anniversary of the dday commemorations but he's teamed up with the 6 SE other countries who say they have captives currently being held in Gaza to release this statement it says As Leaders of the country's deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza including many of uran citizens we fully support the movement towards a ceire and hostage release deal now on the table and is outlined by President Biden there is no time to lose we call on Hamas to close this agreement that Israel is ready to move forward with and begin the process of releasing our citizens now the statement which is only two paragraphs long continues we note that this agreement would lead to an immediate ceas fire and Rehabilitation of Gaza together with security assurances for Israelis and Palestinians and opportunities for a more enduring long-term peace and a two-state solution opportunities not committing to a St two-state solution at that point at this decisive moment we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final comp compromises are necessary to close this deal now remember we were told that this was an Israeli plan but here is a statement saying they have to make compromises to close the deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages as well as those on both sides of this terrible conflict including the civilian population it is time for the war to end and this deal according to this statement is the necessary starting point what's the thinking behind all of these countries coming together in this way to issue this statement Alan what are they hoping to achieve well this is clearly part of the White House's pressure game Joe Biden announced this statement there was some speculation that he did this without fully getting the Israelis signed on to this and certainly Benjamin Netanyahu has made some interesting comments which suggest that this may have been a a bit of a surprise to him and certainly he's aware that far-right members of his coalition government have threatened to collapse it if in any way Benjamin Netanyahu signs up to this so that's why there's that important comment about how Israeli leaders need to make compromises as well but the White House is putting pressure on Hamas as far as they're concerned they already have Israel signed up in all but the letters on the dotted line and they really want to put pressure on Hamas this isn't terribly new because you'll remember that about a month ago there was a peace deal that was floating and Hamas accepted that we were told that all the pressure was on Hamas to accept it by the White House and Hamas said yep we sign up to this and of course it was Israel that hadn't signed on so you can see it's almost like trying to force two bits together like two magnets but they can't quite get them joined and so this is part of the White House pressure campaign to get both sides to sign on to a ceasefire and then look to a longer term peace deal all right thank you very much with the latest from Washington on this story Alan Fischer well let's get the Israeli response then because the government there has banned alaz from reporting inside the country Imran Khan joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman have we heard anything from the Israelis uh we haven't heard anything from the Israelis we're unlikely to hear anything from the Israelis anytime soon there's a lot of very strong language as my colleague Alan Fisher was just pointing out there particularly when it comes to the two-state solution remember prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly said time and time again over his entire career that he's very proud that he hasn't had uh he hasn't developed uh negotiations for a Palestinian state in fact his exact quote is I'm very proud there hasn't been a Palestinian State on my watch so they're likely the Israelis will be likely looking at this language and understanding this yes it's coming from a pressure campaign by the us but how much can they withstand that pressure that's probably uh the question they're asking themselves but there is reaction from others not directly to the statement but about the ceasefire talks we've been hearing from Egyptian security sources talking to the Reuters news agency they say the talks are ongoing but neither side is getting anywhere close to an agreement they also say that uh the Qatari and Egyptian mediators have met separately with Hamas and with us officials but they can't seem to get any agreement uh there's also a statement from a senior Hamas leader Samy Abu zorri uh who says whilst they welcome uh Biden's ideas the US draft resolution at the UN Security Council was dependent on an Israeli ceasefire proposal that Hamas had already seen and rejected the US document has no mention of ending the aggression he said uh the Israeli documents speak of an open-ended negotiation with no deadline during which the occupation regains its hostages and resumes its War we've told the mediators that this paper wasn't acceptable to us so significant significant gaps uh in both sides Hamas rejecting this outright but now saying they are wanting to look at it but they want deadlines they want clearcut deadlines and so far this proposal that's being discussed it's being pushed by the US doesn't have thank you very much Imran Khan reporting to us there from Jordan uh the capital of Jordan Aman and just to reminder that's because Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet has banned Al jazer from reporting inside Israel make sure to subscribe to our channel to get
