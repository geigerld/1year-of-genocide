gues has invoked his most powerful diplomatic tool to direct the security Council to meet over Gaza he's calling for an urgent ceasefire to avert what he calls a humanitarian catastrophe Let's cross live to the UN in New York we're joined Now by Kristen salumi so Kristen put this in context what does this mean yes well we have received through diplomatic sources copy of a letter that the Secretary General has submitted to the security Council invoking article 99 this is the secretary General's equivalent of pushing the panic button article 99 in the UN Charter gives him the authority to call for a security council meeting for any topic that he views as a threat to International Peace and security it doesn't have to be on the agenda it doesn't have to be called by a council member and he is doing so over the situation in Gaza in the letter he urges uh the council to use its power to press for a ceasefire in Gaza saying that uh the humanitarian situation cannot be addressed in the current uh environment that the situation is uh at uh that the humanitarian uh response is at severe risk of collapse if there is not a ceasefire and uh more Aid is allowed to get in he uh is doing this as a majority of council members have actually expressed their support for a humanitarian ceasefire uh however the council has not uh invoked a resolution calling for a ceasefire the United States has been very clear in its opposition to doing so the United States being a veto wielding member of the council as recently as yesterday said that it does not believe that Council action would uh help the situation they instead called for continued negotiations said that the United States was continuing to work with Israel to improve the situation for humanitarian access on the ground but uh as the situation goes from bad to worse we see the Secretary General uh invoking this power to press the security Council to take action uh that it has been unable to do so far so this is a pretty significant uh Ste by the Secretary General in his entire time as Secretary General since 2017 he has never once used article 99 this is the first time so that uh gives a sense of just how uh dire the situation is in Gaza and it comes as we just heard from the Palestinian ambassador to the UN as well uh he came to the stake out with a members of the uh Arab group and organization of Islamic cooperation to say that they would be going to Washington DC tomorrow to also press us officials for a ceasefire so what we're seeing from un officials and delegations here at the UN is a full court press to try to get a ceasefire uh and some relief for the people of Gaza all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Kristen salumi let's
