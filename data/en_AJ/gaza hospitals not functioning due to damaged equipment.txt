due to the ongoing War for the past 8 months the status of medical equipment and machines in Gaza hospitals has been quite dire and catastrophic and here are some of the key points of the situation that shortage of medical supplies the lack of advanc of medical equipment the electricity and shortage of a fuel is among the many problems that are causing this Health Care System across the strip to be overwhelmed and close to be very crippled everywhere go this particular Hospital many of the machines and Equipment are broken are not operational and the fact that we're seeing right now here in the hospital a medical engineer from one of the medical missions volunteering at alaka hospital working on fixing some of these machines so they're back on track helping the medical staff and the hospital to Opera and sustain khed good to have you with us can you tell us what what's going on here uh so we have a c one it's the image intensifier one out of two that it's not working so we're looking at it now we're trying to pinpoint the problem exactly to know why it's not working uh we had two of these machines in the hospital this one has been done for more than a month the other one uh has been down for about 10 days now thankfully we were able to get it back on track working yesterday so what that means is for the past 10 days we had no image int intensifier working in the entire Hospital which means all Emergency Operations and surgeries had to be posed put on hold and patients are just piling up which made a big big workload on the doctors we have three anesthesia machines right now in this hospital and all three out of three are not working so this is one of the machines that you worked on and getting it ready back to the operation rooms how did you get back on track actually it was very challenging it was both software and Hardware problem and there is uh sometimes is because especially that it's both of them we can say that one of them at least was CA due to the electricity keeps cutting out and coming back which are uh which can overwhelmed the power source and uh burn the motherboards so the motherboard was the hardware issue and then we had the software issue as well you're here volunteering supporting this hospital to keep running to keep sustainable at the very very difficult situation what has been your personal experience so far um I've I've got no words it's nothing like like I've experienced before even though uh I've I've had a lot of uh programs to prepare me for this and I I've watched as many videos as I can but when you're in the situation it's different when when it's life saving people go out of the ordinary out of the textbook and they just come out with with Solutions but still these Solutions do not always work but you can see that they they do their best they go above and beyond my My overall about the situation is it's uh it's it's unbearable it's it's not normal hospitals shouldn't be that way hospitals are overcrowded they running on 300% capacity hany Mahmud AL jazer Central Gaza Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
