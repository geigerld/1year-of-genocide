with Israel expressing cautious optimism on the possibility of a ceasefire deal in Gaza let's now get the view of Hamas spokesman Usama hamdan is an agreement close in your view thank you for having me uh unfortunately everyone understands now that what Hamas had said in the last six months is true that bamin NY and his government are not willing to achieve an agreement in fact the Israelis uh in those two days negotiation rejected the paper which was introduced by the Americans in 24th of June based on the Mr Biden initiative and the the security Council resolution and also which considered all the Israeli points they rejected that even after Hamas have accepted that and the two days negotiation they stand against the paper and they have new ideas which was discussed before I believe uh we have to recall what G have said the Army minister in Israel he said the main obstacle to achieve an agreement is Netanyahu he was and he is the obstacle so I believe in those two days everyone discovered that the obstacle comes from the incubation when Hamas accepted the uh proposals in the 5th of of June Israel rejected that after four weeks and when Hamas accepted the paper so then can I ask you Mr hamdan would Hamas would would Hamas make compromises then on a continued Israeli presence in parts of Gaza if if it meant a temporary agreement could be reached well I I think we have compromised there was a paper introduced by the mediators and we accepted that in the 2 of of July and this paper was clear about the ceasefire the on two on two levels or two stages and the withdrawal from Gaza including Philadelphia and ra Cross Point and it was clear about the whole issues and it was considering all the Israel's questions at that time more than the questions of Hamas we accepted that but Israel reacted by assassinating the the head of the Poli of Hamas Mr what we have told the the the mediator the brothers inq and Egypt was a clear position the United States have to make a real pressure can I just clarify forgive me can I just clarify then following the assassination of isia does that still stand with Hamas except a temporary presence in some shape or form in parts of Gaza including uh Rafa and that the Philadelphia Corridor if it meant that the the bombing and the killing would would stop at least for a little while well I have to be clear from day number one when Baris initiative came to our hands we've said we will not accept temporary Arrangements it has been done in November 2023 and the Israel is undermined that so we want a full Arrangement and all the negotiation were with the mediators on the basis of a complete Arrangements including ceasefire and an Israeli with from all the parsing Gaza on two stages that was clear two stages the first stage the first phase for six weeks the second phase for another six weeks so all that was was arranged and the Israelis have accepted that before this and those days they have rejected that back saying that they they are not can I can I ask Mr H can I ask you though by I understand I understand what you're saying but by but by insisting that these that these issues be resolved at this stage in the process does that not essentially give the Israelis a pretext to continue with the war no well the Israelis have added another condition they accepted before to withdraw from narim but now in those negotiations last two days they have said they are not willing to withdraw from narim so they are stepping back not Hamas is stepping back even after the assassination for brother we declared and we informed even the mediators we will not postpone the negotiations we are going through brother is was doing his best to achieve an agreement and we will follow that with the new leader of Hamas we informed everyone that we are going to do that so the problem came from the Israeli side who tried to add more conditions who rejected what he had accepted before this is the problem Philadelphia was part of the arrangement which was proposed to us in the 24th of June and we accepted that on the 2nd of July now he is not willing to withdraw after the pressure of the Americans he said that he he he is ready just to achieve a kind of arrangement without a complete withraw right but you are asking for conditions that the Israelis are now saying are completely unacceptable in terms of removing um the entire security presence from Gaza asking for a complete withdrawal much of this is going to take some time to try and figure out meanwhile it's been 10 months of War suffering famine despair really an appalling level of human suffering in Gaza do you what is going to happen if this agreement collapses and there's nothing to come from this with you that the main purpose for for all the negotiation to stop the suffness of the Palestinians to stop Israel from having the right of killing the Palestinians what they want and they have declared in those two days negotiations they want the right to come back to the fight even if there was a prisoner exchange they want to have the right to attack Gaza whenever they want they wanted that clearly How can any Palestinian accept that for them we are talking about a complete ceas fire and withdrawal I have to add another thing in w they are killing the Palestinians there is no fight there is no clashes there is no Hamas fighting them but they are still killing the Palestinians in Israel they don't need to have an excuse to kill the Palestinians they just killed the Palestinians for the killing itself they want to get rid of the Palestinians this is why we insist to have a stable ceasefire a guaranteed ceas and a complete withdrawal if they stayed in his they said in Philadelphia they will keep killing the Palestinians we want to push them out of Gaza in order to secure the lives of the Palestinians not to give the Israelis the right to attack whenever they want right Mr Haman thank you make sure to subscribe to our
