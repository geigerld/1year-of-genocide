diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are increasing Hamas delegation is in Cairo to meet mediators from Egypt and katar CIA director William Burns is also there the Israelis have yet to send their delegation and it's not clear when that will happen sticking points remain as Hamas demands Israel ends the war in Gaza permanently that's something prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's government is refusing to do and in Israel the government is under mounting pressure thousands gathered in Tel Aviv to attend a weekly anti-government protest against Israel's handling of the war they're calling for the prime minister to sign a deal with Hamas to return captives held in Gaza I'm here today to support uh a deal now yesterday we need to bring him back we need to bring all the hostages back the alive ones the the dead ones we we got to bring them back we got to switch this government this has got to end Netanyahu we call you to reach a ceasefire deal which secures the release of all captives you're taking more time so you and Ben gavier can stay in power you don't care about the 133 or 132 captives an operation in Rafa will cause the death of the captives you don't have mandate to kill 132 citizens of Israel let's get more now with our correspondent Stephanie deer in occup P East Jerusalem Stephanie protesters are demanding that the talks resume is the government listening well you heard there and if we break down their demands some of them are calling for early election some of them are calling for the government to step down for Netanyahu specifically to go that he is responsible for October the 7th um for the captives to come home for any deal at this point at whatever it costs to be made so are they listening at this point in time I think we can say no um these protests have been going on for months and months and months and the feeling is and you heard there from a family member of one of the captives that if Israel goes into Rafa that it's very unlikely that any of the captives however many remain alive at this point will return home alive so we have a very critical juncture in the talks you also heard him there mentioning benir itar benir this is uh one of the right-wing cabin members of netanyahu's government that really ensures along with bezel smotrich the survival of this government he made a statement yesterday saying that he was very happy that Israel hadn't sent a delegation to Cairo that he hoped that Netanyahu would make good on his promises to Ben G that he needs to go into Rafa and then if he doesn't that the Prime Minister knows the consequences and I that is alluding at potentially leaving government and causing a collapse of the government so that gives you an indication of the domestic pressure Netanyahu is under Netanyahu is a man who at the Forefront of everything is his political survival so uh I think you mentioned there in terms of an Israeli delegation to Caro it's going to be very interesting if at some point we see an Israeli de delegation go that will be a positive sign but at the moment some kind of impass certainly and more and more reports in the media now pointing the blame at Netanyahu that he's the one who doesn't want a deal earlier just briefly and blink the US Secretary of State was here just a few days ago saying that the onus was on Hamas if Hamas didn't accept this deal it was them who didn't care about their people well now you know we have leaks that Hamas is probably going to accept what's on the table and it's the Israelis particularly the Israeli Prime Minister uh who seems to be delaying and scuppering what is on the table at the moment and Stephanie regarding the talks themselves then what might we expect next realistically well they resumed today in Cairo you mentioned there you still have the head of the CIA William Burns in Cairo along with the Hamas delegation there will be intensive negotiations ongoing also pressure on the Israelis because as we know the Americans and the Egyptians and the qataris also have made it clear that they want no Rua offensive so we're going to have to wait and see what comes out at this point it's not only waiting for Hamas what they have to say even though the Israelis say we need a positive from Hamas before we send a delegation there's a lot happening in Israel we have a cabinet meeting at 11:00 a.m. local that's in about 3 hours time sometimes the Prime Minister makes a public statement we'll wait and see what he has to say but we're in a it's an impass at the moment critical times and it could go either way we're going to have to wait and see how the days unfold in occupied East for us Stephanie thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al here
