we're breaking into our schedul programming to take you to beay where the hammer spokesman Osama Haman is speaking on the ceasefire deal or not let's listen into what he has to say who are deceived of the peace and those who are deceived of the US role as a mediator to achieve peace in the Middle East you need to reconsider all of this and Ramadan must be a holy month to support the gasin to support the resistance the resistance is still the option of the Palestinian people and of the nation finally I ask Allah Almighty to help this Union and to help this conference and to unify the imams of our nation to achieve the reconnaissance of our nation our our nation must be together working together as they are asked by Allah Almighty a big salute to the great people of Gaza and may Allah Almighty reward the people of Gaza forgiveness and mercy and those the resistance people the Lions on the ground they have uh uh they have done a lot of things and they have proved how strong and resilient they are to the powers to the Palestinian powers and faction let's say Ramadan is the month of jihad and we can continue this in Ramadan and we will follow the steps of the Prophet Muhammad Beast be upon him and we will do our best we will take a lot of uh principles from the month of Ramadan on how to support the right and to how to seek Justice and Allah Almighty is great and most of the people don't know that it is Jihad Victory and peace be upon you all mam the spokesperson for H speaking in Beirut we have been hearing and seeing periodic statements from Hamas in the lead up to any potential uh ceasefire which is under negotiation after a Paris uh meeting what nearly 10 days ago uh a shuttle diplomacy across the Middle East with uh the mediators and certainly a delegation of Hamas in Cairo right now what we do understand is that the Israelis have not sent a delegation to Cairo they are unhappy uh with certain elements of the agreement which is about the way the hostages will be released and the number of Palestinian prisoners that uh Israel detains uh that are actually incarcerated in Israeli jails now Hamas is not happy with that side of said agreement the exact minutia of the details are still under wraps but also adding to all of this we have a scenario where the um us uh is hosting uh Benny Gans and Benny gance is himself a part of the war cabinet and a former prime minister he's in the US to talk to uh the US vice president uh and various officials in the US now the US vice president has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza using some of the strongest language from Washington since the start of Israel's war on the Strip now Kamala Harris says that Palestinians in Gaza are suffering a humanitarian catastro rophe she says that a ceasefire is essential to secure the flow of much needed Aid and the release of the captives and given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table this will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of Aid in this would allow us to build something more enduring now rosn Jordan has more from Washington DC essentially the vice president kamla Harris is responding to domestic political criticism and uh Grassroots criticism in this country that the Biden Administration is on the wrong side of history in the war on Gaza that it has been uh giving Israel too much cover as it carries out its war against Hamas and other groups inside Gaza while not doing enough to actually protect Palestinians who live in Gaza the uh vice president using the word ceasefire uh repeatedly during her remarks at a bloody Sunday uh commemoration in Selma Alabama underscored the need to try to get this temporary six weekl long ceasefire into effect as quickly as possible she also had tough language for the Israeli government of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that much more needs to be done to get humanitarian Aid in she called on the Israeli government to uh try to help restore basic Services inside Gaza uh notably because so many uh buildings and communities have been destroyed in Israeli air strikes well joined I by Hassan barari he's a political analyst and an officer of international relations at Qatar University very brief statement from Assam hamdan uh the hamama spokesman in uh Beirut talking really in general terms about a ceasefire for Ramadan what imams the the priests and clerics uh should be thinking and saying in terms of uh Gaza but very little really on any talk about ceasefire any talk about the negotiations that are ongoing at the moment in Cairo very little we can read into this for the moment because negotiations are so delicate well I you know I agree with put all the conditions and now they're waiting for the isra to respond and a compromise should be reached somewhere I don't know where and and when but it's going to be in Cairo if if a deal is going to come out is going to be in Cairo so usam hamdan is maybe telling his audience about what is expected but not going into details because I think he's unaware of the details uh given the fact that negotiations is still not uh taken in place indeed one of the moving um Parts in this is the fact that the Israelis haven't sent a delegation to Cairo they're not happy with parts of the set agreement and we don't really know the fine print of that agreement uh but we do know it's all to do with how the captives are where they are and how theyve been released and how they will be um uh equated to Palestinian prisoners that are also incarcerated in Israeli jails well there's a sense that the Israelis are looking for intelligence you know uh they want to know the the names and the where about and this is something probably suspicious you know and that's why Hamas is not is unwilling to offer the Israelis this at this time probably they will provide the information later on if there is a deal in in uh looming uh but uh until and in this at this point I think it is difficult for Hamas to give them the details because they interpreted this as providing them with intelligence necessary for the Israelis in in days to come if a deal is not reached uh so we we have to wait and think uh Israel is is unwilling to send the uh the delegation now but this is not a final say and they will probably send that later on because the Americans would step in and they would put a lot of pressure on the Israelis and the Israelis would go at the end of the day they will go and negotiate now whether they're going to reach a deal before Ramadan or after that or during Ramadan you know this is this remains to be seen nobody has an exact answer to this it's interesting we've asked lots of analysts how you assess this Hamas are talking uh the leadership of Hamas in the negotiations they're outside of Gaza there is a Hamas within Gaza there are sporadic and broken lines of communication it takes time to get messages to and from if that is at all possible for certainly hamas's side one wonders whether those communication links are clear or are broken or how they're actually getting those messages to each other we don't know the logistics but I just wanted to talk to you about the difficulty in getting messages from inside a war zone to outside to the negotiators well absolutely you're right I mean the communication is almost broken because and everything is censored and the people Hamas leaders inside Gaza are almost isolated from the world simply because of the continuous bombardment but also the political leadership outside uh Gaza are actually entitled to come up with a deal if the deal meets the demands of the people inside and we know the the Broadline uh the broad Baseline of of the agreement from Hamas perspective is a seize Fair now whether permanent or not you know I think this is not a final say h they will be exchange of prisoners but also the humanitarian Aid uh to reach people especially in the northern part of Gaza so if the leadership in in the in Qatar and now in Egypt can reach a deal with Israelis on these issues I think the ones inside Gaza will be probably happy uh for this simply because they cannot take part in these negotiations they have to to rely on the uh um the external leadership and while those negotiations carry on there is pressure from all sides to try and find a solution to this can we just talk about sort of the pressure that's on the US uh Democratic party right now especially the president and now the vice president who has remained pretty quiet really but now is very vocal why is CA Harris pushing this forward why is her voice being heard so very vocally right now over the weekend well there there are a couple of points in this and the first one is they're embarrassed simply because they um they said Monday would be the day for a deal and secondly uh there's the internal critiques in uh within the United States against the leadership and many analysts and many also Grassroots of the democratic party think that Biden is not taking the right course and he's maybe on the wrong side of history and simply because the Americans are providing the Israelis with everything they need and everything they want actually H they should have a say so Biden is through Camila Harris is trying to send the message to the Israelis that probably they're growing impatient with with Netanyahu and also there's a limit of what they can do but more importantly they're receiving benians which is the competitor of Netanyahu and this is a clear message that the Americans are really trying to find a replacement for netan and and this probably will change the priorities of netan because netan is afraid of internal scene now if the United States stepped in to change him I think he would be in trouble Hassan barari thanks so much for your analysis sure
