will fighting in gaza turn into a wider war israel launches airstrikes on gaza and palestinians hit back with more than 100 rockets what prompted the latest escalation what impact will it have on daily lives this is inside story hello and welcome to the show i'm sami zaydan fears are growing of another war over gaza after israel launched their strikes on the palestinian territory the military is warning of a week of operations against armed groups tension had been building since tuesday israeli forces arrested bassam assadi a palestinian-islamic jihad commander in the west bank that day the armed group threatened to retaliate israel then closed roads near the border with gaza a day later and on friday israeli missiles struck what the army said were islamic jihad sights in the strip one of the groups senior commanders was killed several civilians died as well including a five-year-old girl what is this child's fault she was dreaming of going to kindergarten and asked her father for a school bag and clothes what has she done wrong this innocent child well israeli airstrikes have continued for a second day you must say it has more from gaza city this is the second day of israeli raids across the gaza strip in a serious development of these raids israel now is targeting residential buildings in residential homes and even civilians this used to be a two-story residential building of four apartments it has been totally destroyed and brought to the ground the families here were given 15 minutes to evacuate before it was completely destroyed not only this building has been completely destroyed but all the other residential uh buildings and apartments adjacent to this building have been partially and severely uh damaged and this is a serious development another home in talilhau area also a couple of meters away from this area has been targeted medical crews tell us that a lot of injuries mostly from children were abroad out of that targeting we do not have uh the final number from the ministry of health but until now 12 people have been killed and over a hundred have been injured in the latest israeli escalation on the gaza strip you may see it for inside story gaza jihad fired more than a hundred rockets towards southern israel many of them intercepted by the iron dome defense system john holman has more from the israel gaza border we're here on the border between israel and gaza back there in the last few hours there's been rockets heading across from gaza into israel a lot of those have proved ineffectual either because israel's iron dome anti-rocket system has shot them down all because they've landed in depopulated areas or full and short in gaza this has come this retaliation after israel on friday launched strikes into gaza that killed a leader of islamic jihad that came after earlier in the week israel also detained a leader of islamic jihad in the occupied west bank so at the moment it's two actions from israel especially the strike on friday that's caused this retaliation from islamic jihad now the question that everyone's asking is whether this will escalate further that seems to be a question of hamas the other group in gaza that control much of gaza get involved in this or whether they don't there's also questions about why israel has chosen to do this they say that it's been in essence a preemptive strike because there's been a threat to them from gaza a lot of other people speculating this is about internal politics and elections uh yahil lapid the acting prime minister wanting to show that he's strong we'll see how this develops in the coming hours and the coming days john holman inside story now let's take a closer look at the palestinian islamic jihad or pijs it's known the group was founded in the 1980s and is the second largest armed group in gaza after hamas the two often act independently of one another the pij keeps a presence in gaza and the occupied west bank with a focus on military confrontations iran is a major financial supporter the group has been designated a terrorist organization by israel the united states the european union the uk japan canada and australia when islamic jihad and hamas have a common stance against israel but the relationship can become tense when hamas exerts pressure on the pij to stop attacks or retaliations [Music] let's bring in our guests into the show we have joining us from gaza ranji surani a lawyer and the director of the palestinian center for human rights from ramallah no rauda a political analyst and columnist and from west jerusalem yoni ben menachem a political analyst and journalist a warm welcome to everyone if i could start with noor do you think we're going to see another full-blown war in gaza well i think that's still um it's still not clear so far it doesn't seem like this is going to uh escalate into something like the aggression that we saw last year but i think it's important to remind the viewers that gaza has been under assault and siege for over 15 years in fact a lot more than that but let's just examine the past 15 years this is one of the most densely populated areas in the world the majority of the population of 2 million are children and they most of their lives has been spent under a siege by israel and so that that means that they've lived their life in a state of uh perpetual trauma uh perpetual violence as well and and these episodes of uh outright assault and military uh raids are just the you know the heightened uh um accents right right more into the the reality of the daily grind of life for people in gaza but let me refocus us back back on the question of what gaza is heading into and let me ask yoni do you think the israeli leadership wants a full-blown war right now with gaza of course not who wants a war nobody wants a war i think what happened is that the islamic jihad organization they tried to change the rule of the games and they create a new equation and they escalated over the arrest of uh bassam sadi one of their leaders in the west bank in janine who was arrested and and since they tried to change how did they escalate things yoni when even after that arrest on tuesday we didn't see the much-feared wide wave of palestinian rocket attacks into israel after that arrest on tuesday up until the attacks the israeli raids on friday right right but of course i don't represent the israeli government or the israeli army but the the army the israeli army says and security israel's security forces says and i don't have any reason to doubt them because the check that i made with my sources confirmed that the islamic jihad was planning a an attack on the israeli settlements on the border with gaza using a anti-tech connect missiles and snipers what israel did what israeli army did they thwarted this plant attack actually what they did is a preemptive strike on a few activists of the islamic jihad and this caused the escalation and the the rockets over 200 rockets were launched by the islamic jihad towards israel let me bring noor back in as the only said no one wants a full-blown war why are we seeing an escalation then noah well i think uh this israeli government manufactured this escalation it pushed for it over the past two weeks it did it took uh every measure imaginable to increase tensions whether it's by raids and detentions and assassinations in the west bank by sealing off the gaza strip which cannot survive without access to goods from outside the strip immediately after detaining bassam assadi and then by assassinating a prominent leader of the pij in gaza on friday uh this was this is on on the israeli government this is on the israeli prime minister who's going to run for elections and and unfortunately we've seen this trend before we've seen israeli leaders feeling that they need to prove themselves worthy of the israeli vote especially those votes on the right by proving that they can be tough on the palestinians that they can commit war crimes against the palestinians um without hesitation and that's uh really what we're saying what we're seeing we're sp seeing it really jump into the israelites he said look i checked with my sources this was an intervention by israel to stop a planned attack by palestinian islamic jihad i think he's referring to the israeli airstrikes which began on friday right well i mean you know your guests might consider the israeli army a credible source but i think uh those of us who've covered this for a long time and and and still remember uh spin that was it was told even about the killing of uh our dear colleague shirin abu aklay uh no to doubt the credibility of this occupying army there is no such thing as a preemptive strike you cannot kill someone extra to judicially assassinate someone because you think they're going to carry out something the fact is not a single shot was fired from gaza israel escalated israel targeted islamic jihad in the west bank and gaza israel created this escalation created this mess will have to take responsibility for it what is happening is is on their hands all right maybe it's important to take a little step back raji whatever the uh you know how this got escalated at this point we're getting reports of civilians paying a price um including children being killed in some of these airstrikes by the israelis what would a wider war mean for basic human rights for civilians both palestinians and israelis living in the south palestinian israeli conflict one of the most well documented conflicts in the modern history and i'm not saying you know documented it's legally documented and there was the entire file of the offensive of 2014 represented to the icc and there was an investigation open and adding to that the great marshal for 10 plus the blockade on gaza adding to that may 2021 last year offensive every time israel targeting us to offensive in god's attack gaza it's deliberate intentional it's very clear in the eye of the storm civilians and civilian targets more than 70 percent of the casualties and killings and destruction of may last year where civilians and civilian targets including 62 children has been killed in 11 days so uh israel i mean what they are doing they are not really i mean targeting the jihad islamic per se or hamas who are the good guys in in this time but they are targeting palestinian civilians they are the ones in the isle of the storm and they are very doing this to them killings enduring destruction social economical suffocation i don't know why they've located gaza for the last 16 years why 2.2 million people in 365 square kilometers has been persecuted with the crime of blockade according to our own statute it's war crime it's persecution and israel should be hold accountability for it and for many many rights sorry let me bring in yoni again um you know noor touched on the point of upcoming elections in israel and many analysts including even some israeli commentators uh have written today about their suspicion that the israeli airstrikes might have something to do with those upcoming elections what do you make of that yoni look if eventually after this round of fighting will be over and the politicians will use what happened in gaza in their political campaign this is possible but to come and say that this is the reason for what happened for the preemptive strike to thwart the terror threat from gaza i think this is exaggerated i think that and i didn't get the information as the the guest from ramallah said from the israeli army i'm covering this what is happening in territories for the last 40 years and believe me i have credible sources and i checked this information there thoroughly and and the the reason for this attack was to a thwart a terror attack it's got nothing to do with politics but i it's possible that the politician will use it in their political campaign this is a possibility yoni what prompted the um israeli raid on janine on tuesday you you referred to the reason for the israeli airstrikes on friday being a pre-emptive strike to stop attacks on israel what prompted the the beginning of this round with the the move which israel made by raiding janine on tuesday dragging out bassam sadi from the camp video showed him being dragged dogs biting him that sort of operation i mean at that time again though we didn't see the volleys of palestinian rockets going across from gaza into into what is happening what is happening in jeanine is a daily thing the palestinian authority lost control in the city of geneva the refugee camp of janine and the few villages surrounding it they they cannot control these areas anymore security wise and this as a result the activities of the armed the military group palestinian groups in janine developed they started to uh to to become a threat to israel's security and as some of the of them even infiltrated israel and carried out terror attacks like the one in tel aviv so what the israeli army was doing there was a operation of arrests and the basamis basami sadi what you said right from the house and so on he was he tried to escape from the israeli army and he was captured and taken to detention and interrogation this is what you saw these are the pictures that you saw right no i guess for many including the un investigators that handed in a report on june the 7th it comes down to when you start to break it down like we're doing on this show it comes down to the occupation they say that these tensions they're referring to the last major war between israel and gaza were caused by what it calls a perpetual occupation of palestinian areas with no apparent intention of ending it is this violence simply the cost of what the un investigators call a perpetual occupation absolutely and it's also the result of the arrogance of israel the occupying power that expects the people it occupies to be subdued to die quietly to surrender to detention quietly and to not resist or demand freedom that is not not a tenable formula it is not a situation that any occupier has been able to create much less israel but because israel has gotten so used to being treated exceptionally to countries covering up for its crimes protecting it from accountability whether at the international criminal court or otherwise it has become so audacious in expressing its indignation at any sign of palestinian resistance or demand for freedom it expects uh that all palestinians will acquiesce to its hegemonic power and so it doesn't see that its raids on janine are provocative it doesn't see the killing of palestinians as a incendiary as illegal as crimes and it it doesn't expect or doesn't accept that such crimes such murders would have a reaction so long as th this occupation and the culture of impunity with which it operates continues then of course we're going you know this uh um this reality of brutalization of traumatization of violence will will persist um and really ordinary palestinians are the ones who continue to pay a very dear price especially in gaza let me take that point back then to yoni i i mentioned what the un investigators had found on june the 7th human rights organizations have said similar things you can look up amnesty international 2021 where they say quote unless the world presses israel to address the root causes like the illegal blockade of of gaza impunity dispossession oppression of palestinians there'll be another round of civilian deaths and destruction does it not come back yoni to this being the price of occupation and and blockade look uh it's very it's clear that the solution to this problem is a political solution and not the military solution is it not the end of occupation though yoni look a there are different school of thoughts about the word you use the occupation especially as referred to gaza strip israel withdrew completely from the gaza as you know it's true there is a blockade on gaza but this is a result of what happened in gaza itself when a a terrorist organization called hamas made the coup d'etat and took over by force took over the gaza strip expelled the the palestinian authority from gaza and they built a big terror infrastructure in gaza which is a full of tunnels rockets and his old aim is to try and attack israel and destroy the the state of israel they say publicly even the islamic jihad just look at the name of this organization jihad what does it mean in arabic of course you know what it means it means holy war holy war against who actually actually it means a struggle but perhaps we'll get lost in semantics too deep into us no no no no it doesn't of course mean the destruction of the state of israel or holy war victor anyway unbelievable all right let me because we've only got a few minutes we haven't really heard enough i don't think from rajiv raj you were already getting reports that for example israel has stopped the shipment of fuel into gaza because of this latest escalation and that the power station of gaza is not now functioning tell us what that means for daily life people going to school people in their homes for hospitals our electricity plan has been shut down this morning there is no electricity in entire gaza and i'm sitting with you just for one reason that i have my private generator otherwise it's mission impossible even to contact the outside world second it's not only i mean you know for civilians and civilian news but the entire hospital system collapsed and their health system collapsed i mean there is hundreds of medical operations should be carried every day now it's almost zero level because operation theaters doesn't work at the time being even transferring what we call it life-saving cases to israel is not allowed so many will die ultimately i mean because of lack of transfer to receive developed medical care and life-saving radiotherapy etc not allowed i mean to be taking gaza and the level of suffering i mean on this sector immensely huge all right well i think we're going to have to leave the discussion there let's thank our guests
