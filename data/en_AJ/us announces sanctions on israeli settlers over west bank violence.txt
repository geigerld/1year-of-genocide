I'll speak to Eli Clifton who's a senior adviser at The quiny Institute for responsible statecraft joining us from New York welcome to Al jazer how effective do you think the sanctions will be in deterring violence in the occupied West Bank thanks for having me well I mean there's no evidence that these sanctions to date have deterred settler violence at all um so but they do serve a couple of important roles they do offer a fig leaf for both the idf's complicitness in enabling and protecting settlers to act with impunity and you know perhaps more importantly for the Biden Administration here it attempts to preempt questions for them about US military aid to Israel and the decision not to designate specific IDF units as participating in human rights abuses now that's a designation that could lead to the use of US law the Ley law to withhold weapons transfers to those units so those pressures they're particularly acute right now in the final months of the US Presidential saying is the US just doing this sort of as a distraction then well I think it partly is a distraction and partially to manage a difficult situation when you have 44% of likely Democratic voters opposing US military aid to Israel at least in terms of its war against Hamas with only 25% in favor so they have to do something but they don't want to do something that actually could could have long-term effects on the US Israel relationship why now though because there's years of accumulated evidence that this particular organization has been funded and supported by the Israeli government as well as senior members uh senior members of the NGO are affiliated with the parties of the ultra nationalist ministers like benir and smrc who as you know have called for violence against Palestinians so so so why now well I think that you know we're facing unusual pressure right now for the administration to do something because not just in the presidential election cycle but there's also you know a growing concern that the war in Gaza uh and now the the expansion of the military actions by IDF into the OR broadening their activities in the West Bank could actually pose uh you know to be a spark to light a regional war and so there certainly is a strong desire in Washington pre to prevent that but there's also competing pressures not to do something that would fundamentally change the US Israel relationship now all of this is coming at the expense of US policy in the region that could actually help deescalate tensions with Iran and Hezbollah and could help bring a ceasefire in Gaza and a release of hostages and those are policies that wouldn't only benefit people in the region but it would also serve US National Security interests of avoiding getting drawn into another endless war in the Middle East so unfortunately uh the the policies and the sanctions that were just announced um it's it's to present the appearance of doing something to express disapproval with what's happening but not to actually take the types of actions that Democratic voters would want uh and are pushing the president to undertake but also the types of actions that could actually make a difference in in you in in Israel policy in the in the West Bank as well as in Gaza look speaking of Israeli policy I mean the head of the shinb himself the shinb of course is the Israeli Secret Service he said that settler violence is doing Indescribable damage to Israel do you think that the statement will make officials in Israel and even in the United States stand up and take notice or do you think that state-backed settler violence as described by organizations like Amnesty International is State policy look the alarm bells are certainly ringing both in Israel uh as well as here in in the United States about the policies that Israel is undertaking in the West Bank as well as in Gaza however you know this war has been going on since October and the reality is that there hasn't been much of an effort to actually constrain or curtail Israel's actions on the ground so is it State policy in Israel well certainly it appears to be the policies of the war cabinet in Israel and in as much as it affects us policy it doesn't seem like policy makers in Washington are willing just yet to take the types of actions that might be required to try to change the policies of the war cabinet all right you like Clifton thank you so much for joining us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
