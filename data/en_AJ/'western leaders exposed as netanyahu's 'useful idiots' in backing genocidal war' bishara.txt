let's bring in Al jazer senior political analyst m bashara in London Mr baral's words there were um slightly polite I would say with the Secretary of State on the other side of the table Maran but he's been a lot more firm in his statements which has caught the attention of not just the Americans but across you might say uh the European political Spectrum too well yes I mean his accusations of Israel of weaponizing hunger of starving the people of Gaza creating famine in Gaza leading to the death of so many children in Gaza calling it a war on children I mean that sort of uh language from the European higher commission for foreign policy is new it's late but you know as we always say it's better than never it's been five months of this and seems like they've been awakened to it but I think there's a there's there an interesting moment here so it's the fact that the am an are letting the press in to the meeting allowing this kind of a sound bite to be aired around the world in Europe in the United States and so on I think that's important that's relevant not only to what bell is saying but the fact that the Americans want it out they want to show that the Americans are and the Europeans are are in agreement over the fact that uh Netanyahu is weaponizing hunger and this Aid through the uh through the sea roots or by air is not sufficient the borders must be open you know I wonder if uh these leaders and others like blinkin like Boral and here in the UK and elsewhere are feeling more and more like they are they are or they have been netanyahu's useful idiots because for five months they supported him unconditionally hoping that when the time comes he will listen he doesn't listen he turns his back on any advice on any opinion on any criticism or condemnation and continues with business as usual Killing Fields in Gaza would it be fair to say that Burell is also feeling that pressure to Maran because there are other European governments within the EU and European leaders who have criticized Israel a lot earlier than what Burell is saying right now there are splits in the EU there have been splits in the EU a number of countries like Ireland Spain Belgium Norway and others have in fact been outspoken others haven't some have been stonch supporters of Israel but be that as it may there's a new I would say some form of a consensus emerging and that's what the Burell has actually underlined that he now he's speaking for Europe when he spoke at the UN Security Council and as he speaks in Washington that Europe is fed up uh with with the weaponization of hunger in Gaza which is really a war crime the fact that nany continues with with his usual uh you know pure evil as it were and not listening uh to his close allies who have been supporting him shielding him uh internationally on the other hand yes there is an increasing public opinion that is outspoken I've seen it personally in the in the streets the artist movements seen it in the Public Square we've seen it in all walks of life in countless Western cities where more and more people uh are speaking out against the injustices against the genocide that's unraveling in plain side on their TV screens and of course that does bring me then to the next question which was about sort of that that European movement the public movement at the moment there are really important EU elections coming up in June and and the public are not stupid across Europe those that are voicing uh their opinion about what they see happening in Gaza are certainly making their feelings known in The Ballot Box we've seen a recent uh British byelection in the northwest of England where the winning candidate fought just on one subject and that was the war on Gaza and how he as an independent was very different from the the the parties that that you might say run the United Kingdom right now there is no doubt that Western public opinion is an educated public opinion in general and Western Elites are some of the more intelligent Elites there's no doubt like other Elites around the world intelligent well read and they can see and they can and they can tell right from wrong and they can see the double standards they can see their leaders response in Ukraine how it differs from their leaders response in Gaza and the can see the hypocrisy that their leaders claim one thing about human rights but respond another thing when it comes to the violation of human rights in Gaza another thing they can tell is that in the end of the day leaders tend to have one standard not double standard and that's their interest and the and the interest of their countries especially when it comes to their allies the case of Ukraine and Israel but they just cannot stand the injustices anymore that is carried in their name because in the end of the day their governments are complicit in genocide in the war crimes in the state Terror that is taking place in Gaza so they understand that it's their tax money that is going to subsidize Israel's genocidal War they understand that their leaders can do something about it and they are not so I think there is a general understanding that Israel is on the wrong that this war is immoral that supporting it is immoral and it has proved to be counterproductive in the sense that it's not resolving any of the underlying issues the conflict the occupation the suler colonial regime the insecurity and so on so forth in fact if anything the whole region now is more stabiliz destabilized than before so I think there is a general consensus especially among the elites but also among the public at large that something has gone wrong over the past five months that their leaders had proved to be useful idiots for Netanyahu who used them squeezed them got all he wanted out of them in order to carry his personal ideological and Colonial agenda in Gaza that proved to be genocidal mam Bashar we'll leave it there for now obviously we'll continue to monitor events and get your analysis as time goes by for the moment thanks for joining us
