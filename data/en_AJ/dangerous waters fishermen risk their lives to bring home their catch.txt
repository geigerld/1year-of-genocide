Palestinian fishermen in Gaza are using whatever they can to get out to sea this old door is now a makeshift boat necessity has forced them to use whatever they have to continue fishing in this war we have lost all of our boats and fishing gear we are left with nothing fisherman started to improvise using very primitive methods I'm even using this door as a raft to float on the water and try to catch some fish to feed our children the fishermen say Israeli forces routinely attack anyone who Ventures beyond the harbor but despite the danger they do what needs to be done when we go on our fishing routes as soon as we leave the port the Israeli Navy starts firing on us indiscriminately all we ask for is to go out to get some food and come back safe to our children we want to have a future very little Aid is getting into Gaza that means finding food can be the difference between life and death but while hidden out to see has risks there's no safety to be found on Shore either danger is always present for example only two days ago this is our neighbor's shed they were sitting here trying to mend their fishing nets when an Israeli drone fired a rocket at them here's the blood of the Fallen fisherman he was sitting on this chair at the end of the day a Mist catch but enough to make the trip worthwhile coming back alive is more important than seeking more fish in deeper waters many Palestinians take their chances on the sea although they can't go far the Israeli military has made it very impossible for gaz's fishermen to enter their Waters and search the food they desperately need they try to return with at least some fish yet most often it's barely enough to feed themselves and their families the situation is desperate but that's forced people here to be resourceful and even without pots the fishermen of Gaza are still finding ways to survive ibraim Al KH Al jazer Port of Gaza Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
