Al jaz's hind Al hudi is in Dar Bala where that attack on world Central Kitchen employees happened she reports from the scene I'm currently standing in front one of the vehicles that has been targeted by the Israeli forces last night this car and two other cars across the AR Rashid Street have been targeted by the Israeli forces three of the cars are for the world Central Kitchen and they had uh Aid workers in uh inside the cars uh so far we know that an Australian a Polish a British a Canadian and an American and a Palestinian uh Aid workers were targeted in those three cars it's very obvious that these um workers were working with the world Central Kitchen as we see vests and uh the logos of the wck organization we know that these um uh cars were on their way back from the port Northern of the Gaza Strip to their guest house in Raa and every car is is separated by at least 500 M which shows that this Convoy was directly targeted by the Israeli forces this will have a lot of negative consequences not only on the humanitarian sector in the Gaza Strip it will also have a huge major consequences and a negative impact on a lot of Aid workers on International agencies currently operating in the Gaza Strip these Aid workers were having an aid ship and a convoy that had at least 400 uh metric tons of food to the north of the Gaza Strip on the day they were targeted this is alaz Gaz well let's now speak to Tess Ingram who spokesperson for Unicef and she's joining us from arafa in southern Gaza Tess good to have you with us on Al jazer the killing of these Aid workers must be extremely worrying for you and your teams in Gaza yeah it's incredibly worrying for all of us we just had a meeting about it here among agencies and it really just speaks to the unacceptable conditions that people are living in here in the Gaza Strip and that humanitarian Aid workers are operating in it's an immense tragedy and it adds to the toll of you know 30,000 people who've been killed since the escalation and 174 un colleagues who've also been killed so it's it's a dark day for us here those conditions that you talk about the extremely difficult conditions that you talk about can you tell us a bit more about them because world Central Kitchen in their statement said that they uh actually coordinated with the Israelis uh about their their location and where they were going their car was clearly marked their vehicle was clearly marked what sort of uh you know uh talk do you have with the Israelis when you're you're uh operating on the ground in Gaza and how difficult it is to actually coordinate with them so like conflicts all around the world humanitarian agencies have a coordination and notific ation system where we say this is where we want to go and what we want to do and we get the security assurances that we need to do our job and that is not functioning properly here in the Gaza Strip and we've been warning for a while that it's not working we're not getting the security assurances that we've need and this is not the first time that we've seen a vehicle being hit under colleagues have been targeted before and so it's incredibly concerning all of the colleagues here are really just trying to help people and it's even worse that these colleagues were trying to deliver food where on the precipice of a famine it could happen at any moment now and this was you know 100 tons of food a that was being unloaded so it's it's uh it's an unspeakable loss not just for the people but for um the the community of Gazza is as you say it's not the first time that Aid workers have been targeted um do you believe they're being deliberately targeted I think that we are here just trying to do our job and what we need to do now is is have a look at this situation assess what has happened overnight and decide how we move forward because it's it's incredibly tough here on the ground not just for us but for the people of Gaza the bombardments are unending here all all night all morning and and we're some of the most protected people in the GSA strip we have you know armored vehicles and and um jackets like this so uh for everybody in Gaza it's it's incredibly unsafe yeah no one is safe in Gaza uh Tess what impact will will this attack have on Aid agencies operating in the Gaza Strip could could this cause you for example UNICEF to reconsider your operations on the ground we're still waiting for more information on the strike you know World social kitchen has obviously said that they're pausing their operations for the time being UNICEF is continuing uh for the time being but this is you know a very serious um moment in what has happened in the Gaza Strip and as I said it's it's another incident on top of the so many that we've already endured here and it's it's um it could have serious impacts I think world Central Kitchen pause on the aid operations because you know as we know World Central Kitchen was bringing in a lot of food a lot of hospitals were relying on world Central kitchens um food that they were providing so this could have an impact uh their po thank you very much for speaking to us Tess Ingram from UNICEF join joining us there from Rafa Southern Gaza
