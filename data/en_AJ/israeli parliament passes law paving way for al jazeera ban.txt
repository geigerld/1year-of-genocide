Israel's parliament has passed a law which could allow a potential shutdown of foreign broadcasters in the country including Al jazer the caness had voted overwhelmingly in favor of the law which Israel has been pushing since the beginning of its war on Gaza the law allows Israel to shut down any broadcaster if it deems its content threatens National Security Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on X saying Al jaer actively participated in the October 7th Massacre and incited against against Israeli soldiers he says it's time to remove the mouthpiece of Hamas from our country and called Al jazer a terror Channel Netanyahu says he intends to take immediate action to stop alzer's activities in Israel well the US state department has responded to the knesset vote saying that it supports Al jazer we support the independent Free Press anywhere in the world and we think the work that the independent Free Press does is important everywhere in the world world and much of what we know about what has happened in Gaza is because of reporters who are there doing their jobs including reporters from Al jazer um I'll say just with with respect to Al jazer obviously we you know I think it's well known that we've not always agreed with all of Al jaz's coverage but it's a media organization that we engage with I've done interviews with Al jazer other people from the Department have done uh interviews with Al jazer so um what we will continue to make clear is that we support the work that the free press does
