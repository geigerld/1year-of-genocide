Bernard Smith joins us from rala in the occupied West Bank now and as we heard the Palestinian president denouncing Israel yet again but what else did he have to say well those were very strong words from Mahmud Abbas some of the strongest is said since October the 7th because the Palestinian prime minister is under an enormous amount of pressure really he's very unpopular amongst uh Palestinians in in the occupied West Bank and in Gaza um the last polling was done that suggested 80% of Palestinians actually want him to resign so he's under pressure to sort of take a tough stance to try and win some support he's also met a couple of us diplomats who are in town today he met Brett mcer who's a Middle East Affairs coordinator at the security Council and with Barbara Leaf she's an assistant Secretary of State and he reiterated again to them as Representatives the US US government that he wants them to put pressure on Israel uh to have a cease fire in Gaza and he also said that he wants an acceleration of humanitarian Aid to Gaza okay thanks so much Bernard Ben and Smith for us in the occupied West Bank
