the US Secretary of States in Israel in another push for a ceasefire in Gaza he says a deal is achievable to pause the near seven-month War but the Israeli Prime Minister has again vowed to invade Rafa so how will Benjamin netanyahu's comments affect mediation efforts this is Inside Story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Nick Clark so the time is now Anthony blinkin striking an urgent tone in his attempts to get a ceasefire in Gaza America's top Diplomat says a strong proposal is on the table as he makes his seventh visit to the Middle East since fighting began in October that as indirect negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas carry on in Egypt but questions being raised about the chances of an agreement being reached after the Israeli Prime Minister reiterated his plan to invade Rafa Can Benjamin nety who's threat disrupt talks to end the war this killed more than 34,500 Palestinians we'll explore this and other issues with our guests in just a moment but first this report by Kao Lopez hodan A Renewed push to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling for an agreement between Israel and Hamas it's a message he emphasized earlier while meeting with Israeli president Isaac Herzog we're determined uh to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home and to get it now uh and the only reason that that wouldn't be achieved is because of Hamas critics say it's not that simple Israel has begun launching air strikes on Rafa and Netanyahu was threatening to launch a Fool's SC operation in the southern city with or without a ceasefire deal we'll enter Rafa because we have no other choice we'll destroy the Hamas battalions there we will complete all the objectives of the war including the repatriation of all the abductees Allies like the US Germany and France have warned Netanyahu against the move but he's under greater pressure from within his own government support from farri min SS gave Netanyahu another term and they've warned him they can also end it the Prime Minister has promised that Israel is going into Rafa he promised that we're not ending this war and a neglectful deal will not be made I congratulate those words and I think the Prime Minister understands the implications if this does not take place more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th Hamas leaders have accused Netanyahu of intentionally extending the war to stay in power bring our children home today in Israel families of captives are staging protest demanding a deal to get their loved ones home apply whatever pressure is necessary to Hamas but not only to Hamas also to the Israeli Prime Minister apply whatever pressure is necessary and in Rafa about 1.5 million Palestinians wait with nowhere else to go the UN Chief Antonio gutiz says an assault on the city would lead to an unbearable escalation with devastating consequences in Gaza and The Wider region Kia Lopez oan Al jazer for Inside Story So plenty to take on let's bring in our guest joining us from London is Daniel Levy he's president of the US Middle East project and a former Israeli negotiator noro day it's a political analyst she joins us by Skype from Aman and joining us by Skype from Washington DC is William Lawrence he's a professor at American University and a former US Diplomat a warm welcome to each of you so as negotiations continue I'm wondering what the motivation is for Benjamin Netanyahu Daniel Levy uh to say that he will invade Rafa ceasefire or no ceasefire does he mean it how can there be a ceasefire and a wholesale attack on Rafa Daniel over to you the simple answer Nick is those two things cannot go together and to the extent to which there was some sense maybe this prolonged impass in the mediated talks could be found a way out of precisely because For the First time there was a sense that maybe the US was leaning into the idea of a permanent rather than a temporary ceasefire and that would allow Hamas to move the negotiations forward from their side to the extent to which it looked possible prime minister Natan yahu just took a sore to that he just chopped that off at the knees because by insisting that a rougher operation would go together would continue no matter what nanyu was conscious of what he was doing and he was yet again trying to undermine the talks but what's important to acknowledge here Nick is he was doing so because he felt confident he had already heard the American side say it's a generous offer Hamas over to you if this doesn't happen there's only one party to blame so nanyu was essentially LED off the hook yet again by an American president an American Secretary of State an American Administration who have allowed this war to continue who have provided the weapons and Natan is in no hurry for him a long War a Forever War is politically beneficial and I do think one should take the Israeli Prime Minister seriously I do think the preparations are being made fora I do not think there is an IDF consensus but if nanyu has his way and he is not stopped then the over 1 million Palestinians in Rafa are going to face what is going to be one can imagine yet another horrendous violation of international law Devastation killing and you know that that is going to happen if something else doesn't intervene and it blink just blew the chance right can something else intervene William Lawrence what do you think Netanyahu let off the hook and if so what are the implications for any ceasefire deal well I agree Gro Moto with what Daniel's saying I I I don't think he's entirely off the hook I still think that the US pressure is uh quite intense I think this uh there's many flaws in the negotiation here both the public and the private part uh one is this idea of a permanent ceasefire that's called a peace treaty or an Armistice and that doesn't exist it's not even really on the table uh and now that's why we're seeing phrases like sustainable calm and you know longer syation of hostilities for a year uh formulas within which could be pressured and if you parse netanyahu's statements since early February uh you know when this was first proposed and the Rafa operation was first delayed he leaves wiggle room he'll say things like well I won't be forced into something I don't agree to but then he implies if he agreed to something then you know he could be given another way out which is the Americans Made Me Do It um there's also a problem here that Israel is operating as if Hamas is in a very weak position which they don't believe they're in Hamas is believes the US sorry the Israeli side is in a very weak position because of the protesting United States and other things and operating negotiating on that basis isn't really going to get us to an outcome um I think the latests are promising and not impossible um the this this sort of um dance that's going on where Hamas goes to Cairo and leaves and Israelis go to Cairo and leaves is not good I Wasing this week they'd all be in one place and maybe Bill Burns would show up I heard that technical negotiations will shift to Doha tomorrow uh but this isn't over yet one way that um you know one commentator here in the US pH it is Netanyahu is a choice between Rafa and RI and all of the meetings in Riad and all that effort to sort of offer Netanyahu a big normalization not only with Saudi Arabia but much of the rest of the Muslim majority countries which would follow uh is not off the table yet uh that package is still being discussed along with the day after proposals uh that are going on sure and no do you think Hamas would agree to this H so-called prolonged period of quiet given what Benjamin Netanyahu is saying about invading Rafa whatever happens I think Hamas finds itself in a difficult position because the mediators uh whether it's Egypt or Qatar have put uh all their weight Behind These latest efforts to reach a ceasefire the situation on the ground is untenable you have uh the whole population on the brink of famine you have an impossible situation where more than you know a million people nearly a million and a half people are you know supposed or expected to be cramed in an area with absolutely no services or infrastructure to offer which is called Al maasi it doesn't fit them it cannot accommodate them and everybody knows what a RAF Invasion would mean but on the other hand I think it's important to also not that Hamas also has to speak to it own constituents it cannot be seen as surrendering it cannot be uh seen as accepting anything that that is on the table especially in light of what it heard and what the whole world heard from Netanyahu Promises of continuous war of almost endless war and seeking the decimation of the enemy we're almost you know in in a in an exchange that belongs somewhere in medieval times where you have one power that goes uh against you know at War and they want complete an absolute surrender I think the adults at the table should understand by now that that's not going to happen happen but I find that one of the things that perhaps is keeping negotiations back is the fact that the Americans haven't completely let go of the idea that they can deliver to Netanyahu and to Israel a victory through these talks through normalization with Saudi Arabia um while at the same time uh promising a political Horizon for Palestinians so in a way canceling out a major Palestinian player while claiming that this would ultimately be positive for the Palestinians and I think that is one of the reasons why you have a stop and go Dynamic at this point even though you have this big carrot of normalization with Saudi hanging uh in the distance yeah stop and go is the phrase isn't it Daniel so as nor say it's a difficult position for Hamas but if just let's just say Hamas do agree uh where does that then leave Benjamin Netanyahu because he can't then go into rafic can he or does he just wait no I think prime minister Netanyahu knows that he can create the conditions whereby there can be no Hamas agreement Hamas will not go into a ceasefire if prime minister nanahu is promising that after a few days of calm we are going to make the hellscape even worse and the American sponsors of Israel are blaming Hamas saying well we don't think you should do ruer quite that way unless there is an unequivocal American willingness to say this is as William said a sustainable Cal whatever language you want to say there will be no ruer full stop we are the guarantors if that is not said then I do not think there is the prospect of an agreement prime minister nanyu knows that that is why he has positioned himself in the way he has but prime minister Netanyahu doesn't want to take the blame there's a poll in the Israeli media today which says that the Israeli public would support by 47 to 32 the rest of don't knows um a deal that involved the release of the hostages a permanent end to this war and the release of thousands of Palestinians they call the terrorist Palestinians held uh in Israeli prison he knows that there is not a consensus around Raa he knows that within his own military they're a reservist who have said they will not show up because of burnout he knows that 400 families of soldiers in regular Duty have written to gance and Eisen Cott in the uh War cabinet to say if you go into Ruther it's the end of the hostages please withdraw from the government if that's the proposal so there's internal pressure he needs a way out from that internal pressure the way out from that internal pressure is to blame Hamas and rather that making this harder for Netanyahu it does seem that the Secretary of State and the president have just given Netanyahu his his get out of this card which for him is of course also a get out of jail free card because he is after all still a prime minister in court who for his political survival needs the continuation of the war right now the International Community of course has made its position clear President Biden has said the invasion of Rafer is a red line uh not easy to see how the Israeli offensive Rafa could be compliant with international law so says the UK Deputy foreign minister Andrew Mitchell France has weighed into the UN Secretary General has said uh also there's an assault on Rafa would be an unbearable escalation appealing for all those who have influence over Israel to do everything in their power to prevent it so that that's a general view internationally William Lawrence first up what does uh President Biden mean when he says it's a red line can he bring any more pressure to Bear what if he Netanyahu did go into Rafa would he do anything well as one senior qari negotiator told me uh if the Americans put in 20% more pressure in Israel this thing would have already been over um but let's talk about Rafa for a minute the Americans keep saying no but and the but means protection of the 1.5 million civilians ined around Rafa and the way to sort of see where that's going is uh the 40,000 tents for 400,000 people which began to be built north of Rafa and then doesn't seem to have gone any any further the Israelis are telling the Americans nothing would happen until after Passover and it would be 2 to four weeks to move everyone out before the ground Invasion the Americans were saying it should take more like three to four months to move everybody uh and then this gets to another thing a qari negotiator told me said this is basically about hostages prisoners and troop movements and when he says troop movements he means which where do the Israelis pull back to and the latest offer was sweetened with a pulling off the Nets serum Corridor which divides North and South Gap and the opening of those two rows rows of the main roads that go north south in Gaza and also a big movement of population back towards the north which would presumably need to be supported by the new $230 million Pier being built largely because the Israelis won't let in Aid uh despite all of the arm twisting America says it's doing on the aid and so all of that suggests to me that things aren't as imminent on Rafa as they keep saying um blinkin did say again the day before yesterday there's no plan we've seen Austin testified the same thing yesterday so the Americans are not signing off on Rafa and would want a massive protection of civilians we haven't seen yet so in essence the Americans have kind of boxed n Yahoo in without anyone really recognizing it or giving them credit for it they're basically saying ceasefire or Rafa operation in a way you've never done any of this operation and that's something that n's having a hard time swallowing and that's one of the reasons we're also at this impass and nor I'm going to throw it to you now for any comment off the back of that but I just want to say this that the UNA Chief Martin Griffith said that the simplest truth is that a ground operation in Rafa will be nothing short of a tragedy beyond words no absolutely I think it would be apocalyptic I mean we've seen the scenes of the aftermath of ground invasions in kanun in Alat in Gaza City in Bia and and they are scenes of utter decimation uh fast forward six months where you have an entire population that is malnutrition that is fatigued that has lost you know loved ones that knows there's no way out there is no no hospitals to go to even and you've got yourself a combination that no amount of Aid can possibly um amarate or or make better um let alone the fact that Aid would be very difficult to come in and so on but I think what's really interesting right now about all of these statements we're hearing from blinc or from Washington is just how elastic those American red lines have proven to be and we've seen Netanyahu push the boundaries time and again since October we've seen him test the uh Biden administration's willingness to use the stick instead of the carrot and every time he's come out on top even when it comes to the application of US law regarding you know allies that violate human rights regarding the leh law regarding settler attacks regarding um the attacks on humanitarian Aid workers and so on so I think in many ways Netanyahu feels that no matter how much he kind of turns his back to the Biden Administration given the fact that this is election season given the fact that Biden is so ideologically married to the idea that there can be no daylight uh between Israel and the United States that basically Netanyahu will get away with whatever he wants he's more focused on keeping his Coalition and as Daniel said on staying in power on staying out of jail so if it takes uh taking the Americans by surprise and going into ra I think he will do it and that's I think where all the Panic the Justified Panic on the ground in Gaza lies the knowledge that can get away with it and that people have to figure out where they will go which you know over which Rubble uh they will set up the temp now Daniel over to you with this question Benjamin Netanyahu says it's all about finishing off heras first of all do you think that's possible because many of the group's prominent leaders including ywa Sina are believed to be still alive and believe to be there but nobody knows for sure where if they are and secondly how disabled is Hamas from your perspective it's a it's a nice narrative for Netanyahu to have as I've said I don't think he's in any hurry to do Raa I think he has a problem because if he does go into Rafa he can't tell that story anymore he can't say well now when we do Rafa we'll actually have eradicated Hamas this has been six months where it's not gone that well on the battlefield for Israel so has quite effectively used its asymmetric capacities of course it's been devastating for the Palestinians inside Gaza but the military themselves do not have a consensus around Rua because they will also no longer have a story to tell the myth of Israeli invincibility was shattered on October the 7th the Army can still say well if we'd been allowed to do rougher then we really could have finished this job but pressure meant we couldn't go into Rafa and you are going to have and this is what some of the military commentators and some of the leaks have told us that they're not looking forward to that they know that some very unpleasant let's say fighting awaits the Israeli military uh in Rafa so no Hamas will not be eradicated natyu will not have his total Victory when it was the six-month anniversary many of the Israeli military commentators were saying this looks more like total defeat uh than total Victory he needs to pump this up but I don't think there is a big belief that this can be done I think the Americans have tried to say can we give you more goodies can we sweeten the pot with a deal with Saudi Arabia and I think nanyu has looked at this and said it's not a Riad or Rafa I want both Please Mr President and if it's not you who gives me both someone else will give me both just as I got Al kuds and Abu Dhabi I didn't have to choose between the two of them I could maintain all of the occupation and get normalization elsewhere that's what I expect here and so Netanyahu I I don't want to suggest that he he feels everything is in his corner he has felt certain pressures but unfortunately every time the Americans could have put the lever that matters most to him which is the continued Convoy of weapons to continue this war they chose not to and I don't see any change in that no we're coming towards the end of the program what shift just very slightly what about Egypt what's Egypt's role in all of this how worried would Egypt be about a potential Israeli invasion of Rafa Egypt should be and is I think very worried about an invasion of Rafa this is a threat to its National Security Egypt is the uh the country bordering Gaza it cannot be seen as shooting at Palestinians seeking refuge and safety in a fellow uh Arab country but at the same time it does not not want to go down in history is the country who allowed or facilitated the expulsion of Palestinians yet again from their Homeland and so Egypt I think will do whatever it can to push things towards an agreement even if it were a you know half good agreement whatever kind of agreement that can be reached momentarily hoping that that could kind of snowball into something more significant but for Egypt this is a threat right at its doors and it has to do something in order to at least justify where it stands to its constituents to its people uh and not not look like a sell William big protest going on in the United States aler we've been covering all sorts of protests happening at universities as it is right now so if there was an invasion of Rafa what would the implications of that be on the numbers turning up at those protests and the potential for that getting more more out of hand if Israeli troops do go in and the implications of course as Daniel's referenced in this election year with President Biden going to the polls in November I think it' be quite massive I think uh we're getting close to 10% of All American four-year colleges having major protests and the numbers are just growing with each unnecessary police action I haven't se there a few police actions in neigh are but most of them are just applications to State violence for No Good Reason uh and it will continue to grow I think there's been a mistaken analysis that this is going to force Biden in any palpable way I think it's actually happening is now that Progressive voters and Arab and Muslim leaders are saying they would never ever ever vote for Biden that's pushing Biden back to the center the haen voters and all that and I don't think the protess will massively affect um Biden's decision making but um the general position of Americans now and of the democratic parties this needs to end immediately um if I could just add one thing uh to Norah's answer uh Egyptians have threatened to um suspend this peace treaty which would be pretty important and the way that Border's managed there was a terrible article in foreign policy saying that Egypt needs to Tak in the refugees which is a non-starter given the history of 48 and 67 of the god the population but I really do believe if I could just add one more point that there's a proof of concept here that American pressure can work it works to force the 94 sorry the November 24 C- spot it forced the Israeli response to Iran to be less it forced the Israelis at one point to quadruple the a going in although it's wly insufficient and it delayed the rough operation by three months now so there's there's American pressure can work and Americans just have to push just hard enough as the Qatari said uh to force Netanyahu into this ceas fire and it it can be done if it's done in the Right Way Daniel can American pressure work here's a question for you spin forward 3 months where do you reckon will be them I think we will be probably with Israeli troops uh in Rafa doing their worst um and you know we're in the summer heat is a factor uh the the the famine spread of disease humanitarian crisis is not going to go away I think we'll all be waiting with some real interest as to what the Democrat convention in Chicago is going to look like I hope that's not where we are I do not think the Americans have pushed off ruer I think Netanyahu has been in no hurry I think his military was not ready for it and I also would not discount that nanyu still has other War making options with hisbah in the North and the file on the escalation with Iran is not yet closed but crucially I would say Israel would be ill advised to continue to test its military only path in the region because it is I would argue storing up some very very serious future problems for itself at home in the region and internationally those don't play out Accord according to an American electoral calendar of a few months though all right we run out of time we'll have to leave it there Daniel Levy Nora day and William Lawrence thank you very much for joining us here on aler on Inside Story and thank you too for watching you can find this program and
