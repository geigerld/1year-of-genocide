well China has called for an International Conference to discuss the war in Gaza the foreign minister has spoken with both the ministers foreign Ministers of Palestine and Israel wangi says that China is worried by the escalation and is calling for a two-state solution too to this crisis well for more on this let's speak to Katrina Yu in Beijing Katrina as I've just been saying wangi has been on the phone to the foreign Ministers of both sides what are they hoping to achieve well we've seen this past year Beijing looking to play more of a of a role as an international mediator that's what foreign minister wangi seems to be doing here he urged both sides for an immediate deescalation China is very worried that this war is going to spill out into a wider conflict so on Monday he made two separate phone calls to the foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority and Israel's foreign minister now speaking to Riyad Al Maliki he said that Beijing deeply sympathizes with the difficulties of the Palestinian people he's condemned attack on civilians he said that China is going to continue to provide humanitarian Aid and he says what Palestine needs now is security food and medicine and not war weapons and ammunition now in a separate phone call to Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen he said that while every country has the right to self-defense he urged Israel to do what it can to protect civilians he says that Tel Aviv has a choice between War and Peace and it's imperative that it must do everything it can to prevent the situation spiraling into an even further humanitarian catastrophe now these two phone calls are the highest level communication that uh Beijing has had with either government since the War Began Katrina I'm curious do you sense a different approach to this conflict from developed and developing countries like Russia and China versus say the West well China since this conflict began has called for an immediate deescalation and ceasefire unlike the US and many of its allies that have called Hamas and condemned them as terrorists Beijing has refused to do so which has drawn much criticism from Washington and other Western Nations at the UN though we saw that China's Representatives had more direct words it said Israel needs to stop what it said is a collective punishment of the people of Gaza and like some of other nations we've heard today Bing says the only chance of a long-term uh peace in that region is the establishment of a two-state solution and Beijing has blamed the breaking out of this conflict on essentially the International Community shelving the rights and interests of the Palestinian people for decades Katrina you there with the latest view for us from Beijing thank you Katrina
