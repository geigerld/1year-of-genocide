the UN Security Council is due to vote on a resolution calling for the suspension of hostilities in Gaza the vote has already been delayed twice this week as diplomats have been negotiating with the United States the wording of the resolution earlier this month Washington vetoed a resolution calling for a ceasefire the latest draft calls on the parties of the conflict in Gaza to comply with their obligations under international law regarding the protection of civilians it also calls for Urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full Rapid Safe and unhindered humanitarian access additionally it calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages let's bring in our correspondent Gabriel elizando he's joining us live from the UN headquarters in New York and it's been delayed for days Gabe that gives us an idea of just how contentious the wording of this resolution has been doesn't it yeah it really does and it just shows you how serious everyone is taking this resolution given the situation and the humanitarian disaster really catastrophe that's playing out in Gaza right now uh things are moving very fast here at the United Nations I'll start off by saying that let me just tell you initially what's going on right now the uh Security Council Members uh for the last half hour or a little bit more than that have been behind closed doors and what's called closed a closed session they've been trying to hammer out some sort of agreement that the US uh can agree to basically on this draft resolution that has now been on the table for several days now uh that closed door meeting we believe has ended and now we're waiting to find out if the ambassadors come back into the security council chambers and hold a vote or not that is what we're waiting for literally at this very minute right now the key here is not only the language is the key but the there's really two key Parts there's a suspension of hostilities that was the first issue that the US was kind of grappling with would they accept that and the second is now this monitoring mechanism We Believe could be a point of contention in the uh draft resolution it calls for a monitoring mechanism essentially in short what that means is it would mean empower the United Nations uh uh to facilitate the entry of Aid into Gaza and then facilitate its distribution essentially taking power away from the Israelis on that part there so clearly the US has some problems with this and if you're asking yourself why this is important is because the US can veto this and then it would uh stop any further movement on this resolution of course they're one of five countries with veto Power number one but number two why are these negotiations dragging on so long the answer is we believe because this is so high-profile because the language is so important because it would is a binding by international law if it passes we believe that the US uh ambassador to the UN is having to go to Washington and ultimately any language uh would have to be signed off on by the White House and so even if they perhaps agree to something here at the UN meaning they mean the US to a draft they've then got to go to Washington We Believe to get sign off at the very highest of levels and that takes clearly takes some time but it also shows you how important every little word is in this resolution and lastly I'll say uh this resolution has overwhelming support we do think that it would pass with the nine votes needed again it now comes down to the United States would they abstain and let this go forward or would they veto it that's the big question and Gabe we are hearing from the United Nations that the security Council that vote has been delayed to Thursday was supposed to take place on Monday it is now supposed to take place on Thursday uh let's listen in to what's happening at the security Council I think everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and that is uh implementable on the ground and there are some discussions going on about how to make that possible Madam Ambassador or the discussions going on uh between Hamas Egypt and Qatar uh impacting the decision to delay and could that change the text of the resolution uh those negotiations have been ongoing stopping and starting since the start uh of this conflict following the seventh of October attack on Israel those conversations will continue uh and they have not been raised in Council liberations they are not part of our discussions on the text that is responding to a humanitarian crisis that we have seen in Gaza and with the backlog of humanitarian Aid not able to reach uh Palestinian civilians on the ground in Gaza that is the response that has been drafted by the council as a result in response to that so I mean compared to yesterday or the day before are you more optimistic today I believe that capitals that have equities in this file are engaging at the highest level of diplomacy to reach a text that will have impact on the ground diplomacy takes time it means uh evolving conversations and people are giving it their attention at the highest levels of the capitals that have leverage on this so I think from that sense um you have to be optimistic in diplomacy otherwise we wouldn't all come into this building every day in that sense I am optimistic but in another sense if this fails then we will continue uh to keep trying because we have to keep trying there's too much suffering on ground uh for the council to continue to fail on this and we haven't failed we have a resolution 2712 we need to build on that resolution and I hope we will also adopt a humanitarian resolution that responds to the crisis on ground one more question please about your position uh in your National capacity about the role that the UN should take in monitoring uh the implementation of the resolution do you think that this should be a un uh uh Mission or the UN should take should monitor the implementation or other parties I think that the UN has one of the most trusted brand names globally it has credibility and it has experience on the field so I think the UN is the the the organization that we have for implementation and I think countries in the region have come to the UN asking for their support in the face of this crisis so this is a resolution that was borne out of a conversation uh and discussions at the ministerial meeting in Riad it is a Arab OIC discussion about the immense burden that Regional countries and partners are facing in terms of scaling up humanitarian Aid into Gaza and in particular Egypt which is why Security Council Members many of us incoming and present went to the rafah border crossing with Gaza last week and saw firsthand thousands of trucks and the convoys uh leading into Gaza that are unable to go in medical equipment that is unable to go in ambulances are unable to evacuate wounded people we met with Wounded children in the al-arish hospital the Egyptians are doing a phenomenal job on the border of Gaza to try and support the Palestinian people but this is this is also fundamentally uh needed to be supported by the United Nations and by all regional and international Partners so uh I think we do trust the UN to have a role here thank you so much and I appreciate your appreciate your patience regardless of what this diplomacy yields will this still go to a vote this this will go to a vote the the uae's pen holder will bring this resolution to a vote and we hope for a resolution that has impact on the ground and is adopted do you expect 10: a.m. expect in the morning so we have been listening there to the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United Nations uh the United Nations security Council Lara nus and she was speaking about that un Security Council resolution that we have been expecting a vote on since Monday and we have have just heard that it's been delayed to Thursday now she spoke of the backlog of humanitarian Aid that's unable to reach people in Gaza this resolution is voting on is calling for a suspension of hostilities in Gaza and also on speeding up and expanding humanitarian assistance into Gaza let's bring our correspondent Gabriel elisondo back in he's been listening in he's live for us at un head Head Quarters in New York and uh the UAE ambassador of course the United Arab Emirates has sponsored this resolution it is the only Arab member of the 15 member Security Council Gabe and uh Miss nbe was said that she is optimistic about this resolution but if it fails that they will continue with their efforts because there is too much suffering in Gaza yeah that's right there are a couple things she said there that were really key at the end she was asked will there be a vote and she said yes there will be a vote at some point will that vote be on Wednesday it appears that's not the case now it's being delayed again we're we're told until Thursday she also said that uh uh there's been engagement at the highest levels of diplomacy as I was mentioning before when I was speaking to a few moments ago I was saying how we believe that at least with the US side of this they're having to get sign off from the highest levels in Washington DC even higher than the Secretary of State perhaps going all the way to the president uh Joe Biden having to sign off on this resolution on how the US would vote here at the security Council uh so it's clear now that both sides and when I say both sides let's be clear what I mean by both sides is you have the US clearly on one side and you have the majority of the security Council Members on the other side that want to vote and that want to vote for this draft resolution four pages as it's written now when I say the other side I mean the United States that is clearly uh the country that is holding this up and clearly the country that is asking for delay after delay after delay to try to find some sort of compromise on a resolution they can vote for I do not think the US wants to use its veto power it already has vetoed two two other Security Council resolutions one on October 18th that called for a humanitarian pause another veto by the US on December 8th that called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire if the US was to veto another Security Council resolution on Gaza especially this one that is entirely focused on humanitarian efforts on scaling up humanitarian Aid into Gaza for the people that need it the most I think it's very well understood that the US would lose a lot of Goodwill uh not only in the security Council but in the world more broadly that is pretty much well accepted so I think that the US is being very cautious now and when I mean cautious I mean that's why this is having to go up to the highest levels of government at the us because they know the ramifications of vetoing this but they also know the US that they are Israel's main Ally here and they have been in lock step they meaning the United States has been in lock step with Israel since October 7th these are the political Dynamics The Diplomatic dynamics that you're seeing played out being played out in real time right now in the United Nations security Council but to recap what you just heard from the Ambassador the the the UAE ambassador to the UN there is she is expecting a vote on this uh but now it's being delayed until at least Thursday and she's confirming that there is still uh negotiations at the highest levels from the main countries involved in negotiating this draft resolution right Gabe thank you very much for that Gabriel Alando live at the UN headquarters in New York
