US President Joe Biden says Israel's prime minister isn't doing enough to reach a Gaza ceasefire deal and secure the release of captives his comments follow the recovery of the body of a US Israeli citizen along with five others in southern Gaza on Saturday Benyamin Netanyahu has asked for forgiveness for not bringing the six captives home and has called for Unity across Israel that's as tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in Israeli cities for the third day they're demanding Netanyahu agrees to a ceasefire deal to bring the remaining Israeli captives home one of the sticking points during Seas fine negotiations has been the Philadelphia Corridor which is the buffer zone between Egypt and Gaza it's 14 kilometers long and it represents the entirety of the Border area between Gaza and Egypt Israel managed the area controlling the movement of goods and people until it withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005 Egyptian forces took over patrols but Israel still inspected all deliveries into the territory this may Israel said it was taking control of the buffer zone both Egypt and Hamas strongly oppose Israel's control over the corridor joining me now here on set to discuss all of this is Hassan barari professor of international Affairs at Kut University good to have you with us so is this now the sticking point in these ceasefire talks it is indeed I just um listened to Netanyahu speaking in a press conference just you know half an hour ago and he made it perfectly clear that Israel will not withdraw from the Philadelphia uh Corridor and doesn't seem like his minister of defense is on the same page with him on this issue of the Philadelphia well yeah but the the problem here that the the bone of contention between them is a personal and secondly is what is what should comes first for Gant you know the release of the hostages is very important and staying there with maybe in danger and jeopardize their lives so there's here a problem of of order between both of them but we know that there a lot of personal things between the two the two people and we know that this government is right-wing government is an extremist government that has been committing a genocidal War and the seconding point is there I'm not saying that Israel will uh continue uh um you know kind of uh uh committed to this because they cannot concede in in the press conference uh but it's it's obvious that Netanyahu has been adopting this position for such a long time uh with the purpose of undermining the peace talks and the pressure or the difference not only between the Prime Minister and the Israeli Minister of Defense Joe Biden's comments show there's some daylight between the Prime Minister and the US president as well right there is a huge uh I would say a huge gap between both of them now when it comes the need to get the deal done uh Biden feels that he doesn't have more time but the question is is how to to pressure Netanyahu uh just saying that Netanyahu is not doing enough no Netanyahu is doing too much enough to undermine the talks and to undermine even Biden's proposal and he knows that he has kind of impunity so whatever he does the the US is continuing of course to send military weapons and AIDS to Israel so you know this reported of a take it or leave it deal how seriously will that be taken by Israel when the US provides military and diplomatic cover if this is not linked to a price tag imposed in Israel I don't think that Netanyahu would budge uh but also maybe the United States can come up with different argument that had the Israeli government signed the deal uh the sex hostages would have been released or have been um have been uh saved uh there's a lot to add to the internal debate in Israel but the Americans are not doing that they're just saying you know needs to do this or that what they need to step in and be a partner in in the debate in Israel because there Dynamics in Israel uh that the American are not really exploiting uh on that point we're seeing the pressure building up domestically the protest actually continuing in Tel Aviv and the live pictures we're showing from West Jerusalem we're seeing moves we're seeing those statements from the US we're seeing moves from the UK to at least hold some weapon Supply is the pressure converging internationally and domestically on Netanyahu yeah it has been converging for a long time now but the question it's not enough to make Netanyahu Bud simply because Netanyahu uh his his number one objective now is to keep his Coalition with the far uh rightwing in and and intact because it's Survival game for him he knows the moment that he signed a deal the government would come to an end and those people would would walk out of his government and here I'm talking about B fair and Mish and all these right-wing people and the government would fall down and this will take Netanyahu to the court uh so he is buying Time by per by perpetrating the war and by defying all these International and domestic uh pressure but if the convergence you know continues for a long time with with more Israeli take to the state I think this will probably change the game in Israel all right I guess time will tell thank you so much Hass barari from University make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
