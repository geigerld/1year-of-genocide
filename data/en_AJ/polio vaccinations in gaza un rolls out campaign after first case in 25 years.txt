day two of an ambitious program that may save children in Gaza from polio which can cause paralysis and even death Gaza once had a 99% vaccination rate but since Israel's war on Gaza that's dropped and last month this child was confirmed as the first case in 25 years so the UN has stepped in as you can see behind me there are already hundreds of people here hundreds of families and children ready to get their vaccination and unra is here with the World Health Organization and UNICEF parents have been bringing their infants to be vaccinated at medical facilities the World Health Organization says a drop in routine vaccinations in the occupied territories including Gaza contributed to the reemergence of polio in the strip Palestinians say the main reason for the return of polio is the collapse of gaza's health system and destruction of most of its hospitals and that collapse apps along with Israel's destruction of water and sewage facilities have meant there are many other life-threatening problems as well I had both my daughters vaccinated against polio however there's been an outbreak of many other communicable diseases sewage water has flooded roads there's a shortage of detergents and medicines are unavailable how can we protect our children hundreds of thousands of people are living without access to Basics like clean water adequate food and even even soap leading to outbreaks of diarrhea scabies lice and other illnesses diseases have spread like wildfire from hepatitis to blood infections my son contracted sepsis we're living in tents in unhealthy conditions Palestinians and Aid agencies say what is really needed to ensure the health and safety of children is an end to Israel's bombardment vaccination has provided a solution to another problem caused by the Israeli occupation instead of remedying the root cause which is war and some say even the vaccination program itself may prove difficult since most children will require two doses with a 4- we Gap in between these children are having their fingers marked to show they have had their first shot but it's not clear yet if they'll get their second although there have been agreed upon pauses in the attack there's an urgency to complete the campaign in time IM Kimber Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
