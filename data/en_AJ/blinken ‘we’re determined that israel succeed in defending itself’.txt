have well US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin as you know is in Tel Aviv he's met with prime minister Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin n who is speaking now at the airport let's listen him as uh as I did as well in my conversations with u Egyptian colleagues and the gari farm Ministry yesterday uh I also had a chance to meet with the hostage families again uh and it's hard to describe what they're going through every single day um we uh we made progress in the last couple of weeks on the hostage negotiations closing gaps but almost by definition when you get down to uh the last items they they tend to be the hardest so there's still a lot of work to be done hard work to be done but we're determined to try to get it done we also talked about the imperative of surging and sustaining humanitarian assistance for the people in Gaza 100% of the population of Gaza is acutely food andse secure 100% is in need of humanitarian assistance there have been some positive steps taken in recent days to improve the situation but it's not enough and we talked about what needs to happen uh to get much more assistance to many more people more effectively uh we also talked about uh Rafa we share Israel's goal of defeating Hamas which is responsible for the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust and we share the goal of ensuring Israel's long-term security uh as we've said though a major military ground operation in Rafa is not the way to do it uh it risks killing more civilians it risks uh wreaking greater Havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance it risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security and standing so we're looking forward to having Israeli officials in Washington next week to talk about a different way of achieving these objectives objectives that we share of defeating Hamas and ensuring Israel's long-term security uh it really requires an integrated humanitarian uh military and political plan as I said we'll be talking about that next week going through the details of what we see as the best way forward uh we also had an opportunity to talk about the longer term trajectory uh what needs to happen once the conflict in Gaza is over uh conversations that I had with our partners over the last couple of days and that we had here in Israel as well um we're determined that Israel succeed in making sure it can defend itself uh that October 7th never happens again that it emerged from this strong secure integrated in the region uh uh with a future of security and peace not only for Israelis but for Palestinians and for our other friends in the region and we believe there's a path forward to do that we'll be continuing to work to flesh out that path and to try to walk down it in the days when we Saye um Mr secretary thank you uh can you give us an update on the ceasefire talks in Doha what is the latest that you've heard from the negotiators and also today Israel has announced um a land seizure of 800 hectars in the occupied West Bank just when you're are doing your visit here what are your thoughts so on the on the negotiations I can't give you any any more details other than to say that we're intensely engaged in them working with the qataris working with the Egyptians working with Israel and uh we have teams in in in Doha and as I said uh we've gotten it down to uh a few remaining gaps but the closer you get to the goal line the harder that last yard is so uh there there are some hard issues to work through but we're determined to do everything we can to get there and to get people home uh and um the negotiators will be working intensely to see if we can get that done uh I hadn't seen the news you referred to but look you know our uh our views uh on settlement expansion uh you know our views on um everything from demolitions to evictions uh to other steps unilateral steps uh that are taken that um make the already challenging Prospect of two states even more distant so I haven't seen the specifics of this but anyone taking steps that makes things more difficult more challenging this time it's something that uh we uh we have a problem find of clarification when you say we have teams you mean us has teams on the ground in Doha today and can you just confirm the negotiations have begun like they've been continuing this I can't it's it should be going going forward if not immediately now certainly in the hours uh ahead Michael uh thank you uh can you tell us in Practical terms what the US was trying to achieve with the resolution that was put forward at the United Nations today and then on your conversations today um you described in Broad stroke some themes that are familiar I wonder whether you delivered or heard any messages today that are new and different from your past conversations here so on the uh on the resolution which got very strong support but then was cynically vetoed by um Russia and China um I think we were trying to show the International Community sense of urgency about getting a ceas Fire tied to the release of hostages something that everyone uh including the countries that veto the resolution should have been able to get behind um the resolution of course also condemned Hamas it's unimaginable why U count wouldn't uh be able to do that uh but I think the fact that we got uh such a strong vote despite the veto uh by two of the permanent members of Security Council again is is evidence and demonstration of the um commitment the conviction of countries around the world notably on the security Council uh to see about getting the ceasefire uh getting the release of hostages now that's what the resolution said that's what it called for and I think there it it showed that a strong commitment into that from many many countries um with regard to the conversations we had look this is uh this is an ongoing process as I said we really were focused on three things the hostage negotiations humanitarian assistance uh and rafen uh and it was important that um again we we we focus on all three things we I can't I'm not going to get into the details of what we discussed uh but I think uh from from my perspective at least these were important candid conversations to have at a critical time on all three uh of those issues know that it will be isolated if it doesn't change its path again we what I what I shared and I think what um uh they've heard from President Biden as well uh directly is we have the we have the same goals the defeat of Hamas Israel's longterm security but a major ground operation in Raa is not in our judgment the way to achieve it and uh you know we've been very clear about that but most important we have a senior team coming to Washington next week we'll all be taking part in those discussions we'll be able to lay out for them in detail I started to do that today but it's important that the teams with all the expertise lay out in detail how those goals can best be accomplished with an integrated humanitarian military and political plan um we'll put all that on the table uh of course we'll hear from them too uh and uh we'll take it to next week thanks well you've been listening there to US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin speaking in Tel Aviv after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier on Friday now he said that progress has being made on negotiations in Doha they've gotten it down he said to a few remaining gaps but there is still some way to go Lincoln also says that he pressed the need to increase humanitarian Aid and warned Israel against its planned offense of in Rafa he says they also discussed long-term plans including the integration of Israel in the region well let's now go to H salut she's an occupied East jerusem keeping an eye on this visit for us H there are still clearly some broad differences of opinion between blinkin and Netanyahu that's exactly right there have been disagreements between American and Israeli officials for some months now specifically when it comes to this ground invasion in tah Netanyahu in fact speaking earlier today saying that the ground Invasion will happen with or without us support that if it doesn't come with us support Israel will be forced to do it alone the Americans have actually asked the Israelis at the request of US President Joe Biden to send a delegation to Washington to brief them on plans of how exactly this ground invasion is going to work with nearly a million and a half Palestinians seeking refuge in gaza's Southernmost city earlier today you also had the US vice president kamla Harris who said that there is nowhere for these Palestinian civilians in raah to go to and then we just heard from blinkin who said that this is a war that will require humanitarian political and Military type of thinking not just one way which Netanyahu says is military pressure so the continued disputes between American and Israeli officials are quite prevalent now when it comes to these negotiations in Doha blinkin is saying that there is progress and the last bit of it is always the hardest these final sticking points but during the same hour Israeli officials speaking anonymously to Israeli media have said quote that there is no real progress in these talks and that's because of sticking points from both side with that Hamas wanting to see an end to the war and the Israelis saying that even if there is a long pause in the fighting the war will continue after that especially when it comes to this ground Invasion into ra that is seemingly causing now some problems between the Americans and their Israeli counterparts Hut keeping an eye on that blinkin visit for us in Israel thank you very much H well I joined now again on set by our diplomatic editor James Bay James I'm curious about what you made of blinken's tone because as we heard from H literally earlier after that meeting with Netanyahu Netanyahu walked out and said he's going to go ahead with his raffer offensive with or without Washington's support but now we've got blinkin getting on a plane at the airport saying oh no no they're still trying to convince them I'm afraid to say that um Secretary of State blink's comments were exactly the same comments as he made before he started the trip when he arrived in Caro and as he was leaving he said the same thing he hasn't changed the script but what really went on in the meeting I think will be very very interesting because there are big big problems uh between Israel and the United States right now uh there is um the problems of the Rafa offensive which clearly is the number one problem the US says that should not happen and the Israelis say it's going to happen whatever if you support us fine if not we're going to go ahead anyway uh there's the problem of humanitarian Aid if that resolution had passed today there are sections in that resolution really very critical of Israel um they didn't name Israel but they did say that there need to be lifting of all the barriers to International Aid many more Crossing points Maritime uh route um into Gaza uh all of things that aren't happening because Israel is not allowing them to happen um and then with regard to the way forward longer term Israel opposes the presence of the Palestinian Authority to run Gaza that is the US's preferred solution Israel opposes the idea of a two-state solution and add on to that the fact that now we're in a position where the United States is in a really difficult position at the UN Security Council they've flagged the idea that they support the idea of a ceasefire even though their resolution um many say wasn't really a proper a proper explicit demand for a ceasefire um so they now may well be in a position that they're going to have to either abstain or vote for a resolution for ceile creating yet another obstacle and problem uh between the Netanyahu Administration and the Biden Administration well interesting Dynamics there I wish we had a little bit more insight into them James Bay our diplomatic editor thank you for joining me again on this
