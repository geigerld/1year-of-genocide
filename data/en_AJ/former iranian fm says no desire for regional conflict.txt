to discuss all these developments in Gaza and elsewhere let's now speak to Ali Akbar salahi who's the former Iranian foreign minister is joining us here on the newsour on Al jaaz Mr SEI thank you so much for your time thank you for coming into alzer at this dangerous time for the region how does Iran view this war on Gaza and does it see itself playing a role directly or indirectly well this is no secret that Iran has always supported the uh group like the Hamas group and the Jihadi group The Resistance group as a as a whole and we have supported them in many ways uh especially in um you know mainly in terms of educating them how to enter into crisis such as the crisis that they have had so far but uh this is as far as we have gone yeah you've supported them in many ways was their support on October the 7th excuse me was their support on October the 7th on the attack Hamas conducted we were not because they take their decision on their own but uh this does not mean that we don't support them we have always said this we have said it loudly that we support the resistance group but they are independent in taking their own decisions because uh as is the case with his for example in Lebanon we have absolutely no for example no voice on making the decision that they want to make right because in the west Hezbollah is widely seen as being uh supported by Iran of course and uh is widely seen as being controlled by Iran you're saying that's not the case it is supported by Iran but it is not controlled by Iran that's what I'm trying to say hisbah is a group that is matured enough that can make its own decision very discreetly and it can make its own decision based on rationality and wisdom and that has been uh utterly said by Mr nasah that Iran has nothing to do with the decisions that are made by the Hamas group or the hasbullah group yes we support them morally we support them morally and U in other ways also we support them probably in teaching them the U the art of combat for example but this is as far as we go okay so then when you see the tensions along the Israel Lebanon border right now we've seen escalation in the last few weeks since the October uh 7eventh war on Gaza began Hezbollah you say you support Iran support their allies what is the message Iran today is sending to Hezbollah is advising Hezbollah is it to deescalate contain the situation along that Israel Lebanon border well what Iran wishes is that this war crime the atrocities that is being played by the Israelis against the poor people of Gaza to stop okay and uh but Iran is not as it has uttered many times it has said many times uh that Iran has nothing to do with the decision that has been made by Hamas okay but we support them all along and we add our voice to the voices of others people of conscience all around the world who have gone who have come out to the streets and shouting against the Israeli brutality and uh the unprecedented brutality that Israel has really uh putting uh I mean um playing against the Gaza people we have said it very utterly that uh we hope that this uh conflict stops right and that the people of Gaza are given the chance of living like any other people in the world right let me just pick up on Hezbollah once again what is Tan's advice to Hezbollah today is it to deescalate the the situation along the Israel border is it to contain it because Iran's security and interests are also at risk here aren't they well as I said you see we have no I mean Iran as it as Iran per se has nothing to do with this conflict which is going on although we support the uh the U the Palestinian views we support the Palestinian decisions whatever decision they make but uh we have have absolutely no voice here in order to tell them what to do and what not to do so no voice either with the huies in in Yemen for example they fired a number of towards Israel no no okay we have said this and everybody knows that I mean the hthis andah and the Hamas they are matured enough to make their own decisions because making decisions in such very uh sensitive uh moments it's not an easy thing to do so it is them to make an appraisal of the situation and then make the right decision okay let's move away Mr SEI and discuss the relationship now with with Washington with the US which I think it's fair to describe it as a Tense one Iran's relationship with the United States the US in recent days has targeted sites in Syria which is says are links to Iran uh and to the Revolutionary guards it's accused Iran and its allies of of attacking US troops in the region what what do you respond to that well I mean it is the same reasoning when the United States has no reason I mean it has no justification for its presence in the region and when the United States supports all the criminal acts of the Israeli regime against the deprived people of Gaza so they are looking for all kinds of justifications uh that has no value for us and so they keep on saying that okay we have attacked Iranians in Syria okay we what do we have in Syria we have advisors in Syria so when they say they have attacked places in Syria that belongs to Iran that is not true I mean our military presence in Syria is based upon invitation by the government of Syria and it is mainly an advisory role that Iran is playing in Syria so I don't know what America where are they bombarding so it is up to them to decide wherever they want to bombard but this doesn't mean that it is an Iranian foothold that they are bombarding that you you talk about the US presence in the region Mr CI and and there's a report in Al monitor newspaper which says that Iran is hoping to use this war on Gaza to force the Americans the US military out of the region and will do this by using Pro its allies the pro Iranian militias and so on what do you respond to that well we have said this many times we are not shy of saying it we we want the US to be out of this region what does us have to do in this region and they are thousands of miles away from this region imagine if Iran is near the US border what do they how do they uh react to that so the same what's prepar to do then to see the US move out of the region excuse me what is Iran prepared to do to see the US leave the region well um Iran does its best but in a way using its rationality and wisdom we do not uh really sort of uh put ourselves in a situation that would end up uh in confrontation okay that is for sure but of course that does not mean that we do not keep our diplomatic pressure so there are many ways of putting pressure on the US to leave the region one of them is diplomatic pressure and then uh um coordination with the uh resistance groups in the region so that they will see that for sure that the US will have to leave this place well but there's been a huge buildup o of US military hardware in the region since the war on Gaza this latest one began on October the 7th and that's worrying a lot of people a lot of people are concerned that there could be a spill over and that we could see a regional conflict is that something that concerns you how high is the risk of Confrontation today of course we do all our best so that this crisis will not to spill over we don't want to see any confrontation with uh so that this crisis will SP and we have said it many times our foreign minister has said it our president has said it that we wish that the isra ISIS come to their um senses and that they stop this atrocities against the gazan people and so that crisis will stop but if they insist because I think the Israelis want to transfer the crisis from inside Israel to outside Israel this is what they wish because Israel is now the whole country so-called country I mean we are not recognizing of course Israel but the people in Israel are all out of job and work Israel is not functioning anymore it is engaged with the war with in Gaza so um um we hope that this does not spill over but they are trying their utmost to really transfer this crisis to outside Israel so that's why they are uh raising the crisis in uh in southern Lebanon for example and uh they are trying to get Hezbollah involved more in this crisis right but of course hisbah and others know what to do and uh they uh certainly make the decisions as I said very discreetly and uh very rationally and using their own wisdom they make an appraisal of the situation I mean they so it is not you see the Israelis have come to their senses and to their understanding that the other side is really uh a side that uh does makes its move based on all kinds of calculations right uh so they they move very cautiously but very steadily and they know what they are doing so you you believe that a a spillover should be avoided uh in the region I wanted to ask ask you about Saudi Arabia uh and Arab Unity Unity among Islamic countries and and uh the Arab world there was a conference uh in uh Riyad a few days ago where we saw Arab leaders Express Unity with uh Palestinians in Gaza called for a ceasefire the Saudis before the start of this conflict there was talk that Saudi Arabia and Israel were towards a path to normalized relations there's been a rosma in in recent months between Iran and Saudi Arabia as well we saw the Iranian president in Riad at the summit actually which was quite significant how does Iran I mean the normalization Talks Of course have been sold for now but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're off the table how does Iran view that right now the the the unity among leaders of this region when it comes to the Palestinian cause I think after the Gaza crisis this normalization Pro uh process will not to the best of my U understanding will not move as it was before it will it is certainly has been installed and so probably it is not very easy to continue with the same pace and with the same rate and uh the process of normalization so I think the Awakening of the public opinion the Arab public opinion after the crisis uh Gaza crisis will put pressure on the governments in Arab states so that to think twice before they normalize their relations with Israel because they certainly don't seem to be on the same page when it comes to what action to take to to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza for example as we saw in yes now we are on the same phase of course we are on the same page and uh so we all ask for a ceasefire in Gaza now uh this is in the interest of the region in the interest of the Gaza people and um well I think one thing is that uh Israelis have lost their rationality and they are committing mistakes after mistakes and certainly as the war continues that will be in the interest of the Arab world and the Muslim world because the more the conscience the more more the public opinion of the people in the Islamic world will understand the reality and the essence and the nature of the Israeli regime then it would be better to really from then on to come up with all kinds of uh uh reasoning as to why resistance should exist and should expand because they are occupiers they have to leave the Palestinian land we have all these uh un uh resolutions which says so and we have the the Arab people and the Muslim people that would like to see so so we hope uh that at the end of the day and we are sure about this that at the end of the day it is the people who wins not the governments it is the now the burden of the conflict is on the shoulders of the people and not on the shoulders of the government no Arab government government is involved now in this crisis it is the people who are carrying out this the pressure of this crisis and people never lose Mr SEI thank you so very much for joining us on aler thank you for sharing your views with us Ali Akbar SEI is the former Iranian foreign minister joining us here on the newsour on aler thank you very much for your time we appreciate it
