is once again accusing Israel of blocking Aid deliveries to Northern Gaza Israel has rejected some 95% of all Fuel and Medicine supplies entering that area well let's speak to our correspondent on the ground honey mwood he joins me now from Rafa in southern Gaza honey we know the bombardment particularly in the South has been incredibly intense has there been any let up yes well there hasn't been any lit up in the intense bombings across the Gaza Strip but it all looks like it's all started all over again in Gaza and the northern part where more residential buildings have been targeted within the past uh two days and then appears to be a surge in the intensity and the scale of the bombings where uh the remaining buildings within the vicinity of chifa hospital and western part of Gaza City and jabalia and be lahia City the all the western side of these are being targeted heavily by artillery Shing and massive air strikes and there are more people are ordered to evacuate Gaza City as of yesterday late hours of yesterday's evening for evacuation zones and when we refer to evacuation Zone we're talking specifically about uh um Ona United Nations for Palestine refugees schools honorable schools designated uh in as shelters for this place how Palestinians but four of these evacuation centers uh uh were ordered to evacuate immediately and take the uh Rashid Road the coastal road all the way to the central area now there was a bit of risk in fact a high risk of people leaving during nighttime taking the coastal road all the way the central area and due to the ongoing blackout and no communic ation hasn't been has been very difficult to to confirm whether people have been able to evacuate these zones or not but overnight air strikes in khun is particularly very concentrated within the vicinity of Naser hospital but samin area that's at the southern part of of kanun city and it has a main road leading to uh the main gate of Naser hospital and theor Daniel field Hospital came under heavy air strikes and artillery Shilling and reports about extreme confrontation uh with by with within the uh uh the Palestinians fighting group with the palestin fighting groups on the ground and the Israeli invading forces but maybe the the heartbreaking part of what happened is the entire family Abdul gaur family in eastern part of kanun in Aban and for almost a month it has been disconnected their remaining family members in ra unun were unable to get hold of them but we're talking about the entire family their in-laws some of their relatives approximately 30 people were found deceased inside their homes their destroyed homes from under the rebels they were removed as of early hours of yesterday's evening or reported to Naser hospitals the ongoing blackout just makes it very difficult uh to uh uh uh to know exactly what happened particularly with this example of the family just knowing a month later of their uh family members being killed and trapped under the rubbles and deceased as they were pulled from under the rubble now despite the restoration of the signal communication signals as of last night still major part of the goic experiencing a a blackout as of this moment massive anxiety as we're hearing there from hanim Mahmud from Rafa in southern Gaza thank you honey
