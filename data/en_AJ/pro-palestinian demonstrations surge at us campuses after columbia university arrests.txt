if you do not leave you will be arrested Yale University in Connecticut has become another flasho in the conflict between Pro Palestinian demonstrators and University administrators up with OCC down down with occupation police let away 47 protesters at Yale on Monday morning the demonstrators have been camped at a University Plaza since Friday protesting Yale's refusal to divest from military weapons manufacturers the protesters claim that makes Yale complicit in Israel's genocide in [Applause] Gaza meanwhile administrators at Columbia University in New York City cancelled in-person classes on Monday citing some Jewish students complaints that they felt unsafe after more than a hundred Pro Palestinian demonstrators were arrested last week it's time for us to to show that yes we we we want to be visible the university should do something about what we're asking about the genocide that's happening that's happening in Gaza they should be they should stop investing in this in this genocide that our people is uh now uh suffering from some of the anti-israel protesters at Colombia are Jewish themselves but a school affiliated Rabbi over the weekend urged Jewish students to return home for their own safety videos on social media like this one apparently show a protester calling on the armed wing of Hamas to Target Jewish students but New York City Police tried to Tamp down the fear there's been no credible threats to any particular group or individual um coming from this protest or or or any other Columbia's President says the university is adding more than a 100 additional safety personnel as protesters have returned to campus President Biden addressed the continuing University protest on Monday do you condemn the anti-semitic protests on college campuses I condemn the anti-semitic protest that's why I've set up a program to deal with that I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians student protest leaders denied charges of anti-Semitism and said the demonstrators have been peaceful now protests are spreading to still more schools with students at NYU and MIT being the latest to join the pro Palestinian movement Heidi Joe Castro Al jazer Washington and in the last few hours police officers have cleared out the New York University protest after hundreds of demonstrators defied warnings and refused to leave and were getting reports students and faculty were detained a New York police spokesperson said arrests were made after the university asked police to enforce trespassing violations let's bring in Helga thewi Suri an associate professor at the department of Middle East and Islamic Studies at New York University and she's joining us live from New York thank you very much for your time I understand that you're actually somewhere outside a police station waiting for one of your colleagues to be released can you tell us what happened to the protest sure yeah thanks for having us um I'm waiting actually for many colleagues and many students to be released and I am outside of the police station um so as of this morning is about 4 4:30 a.m. um a number of students started their encampment uh in protest of what's been happening in Palestine but also in support of sort of pro Palestine rights and freedom of speech freedom of expression as well as in solidarity with um other students at Colombia and elsewhere across the country and so they set up uh tents and encampment and as soon as they started uh campus security tried to uh block that off already and also called in the NYPD and then um eventually the NYPD kind of backed away and the students remain there all day uh peacefully protesting sort of chanting and so on and uh you know supporters came at this point there was a barricade that was set up between the students and um uh and sort of a space kind of outside of Campus if you want but NYU is a very Urban campus there was no inside and outside but in any case the students were there all day um uh those that were in kind of in the encampments and then those that were also sort of protesting um from across the street and uh it was peaceful there was no one was hurt nothing happened but um you know I think both the uh New York um the New York University campus uh security guards uh just would not sort of allow for a lot of movement and would not back down and eventually uh brought in the NYPD yeah the um NYU has said that following a breach in the barrier set up at Gold FAA the head of nyu's global campus safety said that you know the one safety requirement we made was that no additional protesters could enter gold Plaza so was the problem that the university had that they just didn't want people from outside the university to join those protesting I mean what what what did they tell you about um why they've arrested students and faculty yeah I mean they didn't want anybody not not just people from outside of the University but they wouldn't allow extra students for extra faculty to actually come onto the plaza as well so I think you know they were telling us that it the concern was for people that were Beyond NYU but they wouldn't even let people from NYU kind of join uh the peaceful protesters on the Plaza and So eventually when the police uh when they finally brought the police in uh later in the evening around um I'm going to say like 7:30 8:00 P.M or so um they charged us with trespassing even though we are NYU faculty members and NYU students um I don't know how we trespass on our own campus but that was the sort of charge against us and they brought in hundreds of of policemen and riot gear uh to uh to to stop the encampment yeah it certainly seems like a very bizarre charge for the reason that you just mentioned I I I wonder if there are other you know protests against other issues at NYU if there's a similar response um to the one that we've seen what's been and what's been your experience in American universities of showing solidarity with Palestinians um so I've been at NYU for almost 20 years and I can you know I've seen a number of protests happening I don't think I have ever seen anything of a Crackdown of this nature um and such kind of you know um over-the-top if you want uh sort of response on the part of of campus security and then on the part of NYPD and I think it's just reflective of attempt across the country to sort of crack down on what is being called you know Pro Palestine speech right so yes this is pro Palestine this is also obviously kind of trying to raise awareness about what's happening in Palestine but it's also a question of academic freedom and freeding of expression as well as the freedom to ga uh particularly on one's own campus so I think what we've seen over the last weeks the last few months is really very very harsh crackdowns on on students and and in this case also students and faculty who who are doing who are leading these T again peaceful protests Helga the sui of uh New York University thank you so much for joining us uh on this important issue we really appreciate it make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest
