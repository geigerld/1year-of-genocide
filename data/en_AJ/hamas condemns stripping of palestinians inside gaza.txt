let's now bring in Alan Fischer he's joining us from occupied East Jerusalem because Alan we've seen really shocking footage of Israeli forces stripping Palestinian men detaining them what more are you hearing from your end about this well Hamas just in the last hour has condemned what has happened to the men calling on international human rights organizations to inquire and investigate and essentially to condemn what has happened of course there are Echo from history where you see men that are being stripped and led off to locations unknown the Israelis say that the men were apprehended in around betalia many of them gave themselves up they are suspected of terrorism and they're being taken to a facility uh in Israel to be interrogated also at the same time around a hundred other men were detained and they have been taken to a special interrogation facility that has been set up in Gaza to find out what they know and to see if it can can help the Israeli war effort of course uh there is criticism of the Israelis for doing this because many people recognize very familiar faces in the group some saying that one was a student one ran the local store another one had no connection with terrorism as he lived in an apartment block and a number of people identifying a local journalist among those who were arrested now John Kirby who is America's National Security Council spokesman was asked about the arrest of a journalist and others during the briefing in the White House in Thursday this is what he had to say I'm not going to respond to every event on the ground and and every occurrence I haven't seen those images it would be imprudent for me to comment on that we don't just as a just as a general statement that we don't support any targeting of journalists one way or another anywhere in the world they have a a right and a responsibility to be there reporting on this we believe that they should be allowed to do their jobs and we certainly don't uh would never condone any inhumane uh or violation of law treatment uh of any innocent civilian but I can't speak to those specific reports of course it would be a violation of international law for prisoners of War to be treated this way for pictures to be taken of them and then published Daniel hagari who is the Israeli military spokesman was asked about the video but didn't address it directly another spokesman said that they had no idea where the video came from but if you look at the video it is filmed from on the ground and it is clear there is someone who's within the area that the Israelis are operating so it points to either someone from the shinb the Israeli intelligence service or an Israeli soldier himself who has recorded it and released it the big worry for many International Aid organizations for human rights organizations is that it's entirely unclear where these men have been taken or what may actually happen to them okay thank you Alan fiser reporting from occupied East Jerusalem let's now speak to Shawan jabarin who's the director of the West Bank based Palestinian human rights organiz organization El hak he's joining us from Morocco's Capital rabbat welcome to Al jazer thanks for your time can you first comment on these images that uh I'm sure you've seen of about a 100 Palestinian men who have been stripped made to knel on the street in Northern Gaza when I saw this first time you know I was but in the same time um I said this you know this practice with the one who killed the children and killed civilians uh with the thousands uh can make something like that but the first thing jumped in my mind when I saw the pictures the second world war to be honest with you how they treated you know uh uh detes and those they were arrested or prisoners of War uh that's the case I think the uh this any human uh this is a torture it's amount to torture and uh more than that uh it's a war crime and the crimes against the humanity right and there a lot of questions now about where these men will be taken to what will happen to them and Israel being an occupying power has certain obligations what are these obligations that would prevent Israel from treating these Palestinians in this way uh look Israel is occupying power first uh Gaza is still occupied uh and Israel they have no right to do this even if they are occupation or occupied occupying power or not uh this is something it's the minimum minimum level of a Humanity to treat uh people you know in a human way that's uh the case even if they are occupation if they are not that's this is not the problem but the main thing is what they are where they taking them this is also another question the other question jump to our mind is how they treated those they were captured or they were uh arrested uh in October 7th and October 8th how the Israeli treated them how many of them they are still alive right when they captured them for instance did they kill them this is an issue where they are now uh who who who's still alive there are many many questions so how is your organization uh how is your organization which defends human rights how is it scaling up its response to these violations in Gaza as well as violations we see in the occupied West Bank practically what can you do look what we do you know we try to document these things and also uh to uh write and to call uh for legal uh actions against the uh Israelis and we are asking also the international criminal court to act this is not the first time and even uh to be honest with you we are uh concerned about all the Israeli prisoners and the tenes and you yourself uh you documented some of the cases from the people they were released from bris lately uh in the exchange uh they are treated badly they torture them they took their belongings they leave them with nothing uh they reduce even the uh the food the quantity quality and everything water uh for the showers or bathroom or all of these things this is how they are treating this is part of the revenge against also the Palestinian prisoners we concern about the lives of the Palestinian prisoners six of them they were died uh in detention some of them they were ared just two days before they passed away uh here there's a big question about uh how they treated them right uh this is part of the torture this is the thing we are concerned uh and I think Israel they have no right to move them to uh Israel uh we don't know where they took them uh now in from Gaza all right we'll leave it there Shawan Javari and thank you for speaking to us from Rabat thank you
