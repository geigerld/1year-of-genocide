joining me now in the studio is most of ab Botti the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative party thank you very much indeed for being with us um as we've just mentioned there are two there's a ruling from the United Nations security Council saying there must be an immediate ceesar for Ramadan the international court of justice says there must be more humanitarian aid but our correspondent hany was telling us earlier on about the Litany of attacks and Strikes and and the devastation that's been happening in Gaza just in the last several hours was there ever a point at which Palestinians do you think had any faith that the UN Security Council and the r rulings by the icj would actually make a difference unfortunately we have great doubts not only about the ability of the United Nations but about uh the international uh International Community in general and especially Western Community because Israel is allowed to act with complete impunity it is behaving as if it is above the law above international law above International humanitarian law it is committing genocide in front of the whole world uh we're talking about 39,000 people killed not 32 39,000 if we count the 7,000 under the Abel including almost 15,000 children and now forgive me for interrupting these are numbers that are coming from the Gaza Authority yes but but they are correct we have the names the names of these children the names of these people uh nobody negates them them even the United States of America which did in the the beginning but this is the reality genocide Collective punishment uh terrible acts against the population and also terrible Siege and ter terrible ethnic cleansing we're talking about no less than 700,000 people are starving now in the north of Gaza including 350,000 children and many of them have started to die but in addition the viciousness of the Israeli attacks I have uh our medical teams in the north of Gaza and they they reported to us horrible things how the Israeli Army in the near shifa hospital and in shifa hospital has ex executed people uh have burned families like abua family they burned them to death by burning their house while they were inside them by killing so many other families 22 23 25 by bombarding all the whole neighborhood around the shifa hospital and it goes on there are reports that 200 people were executed from the people who were hiding or trying to take uh to take shelter from the civilians who were taking shelter in the shifa hospital and it goes on the big question here is for how long Israel would be allowed to be imp punitive and the other big question why the International Community and especially the Western countries imposed on Russia 11,000 sanctions in the first two months of the war with Ukraine and no single sanction has been imposed on Israel I do not think Netanyahu will stop and his fascist government will not stop unless there are sanctions and threats of boycott divestment and sanctions the closest that the U us has got so far to expressing its concern with the situation in Gaza is to abstain from the UN vote which allowed that UN resolution to go through given what you said and then the to order it down by claiming that it was not obligatory which was a strange phrase which has got a lot of the Diplomatic Community um in some consternation people are still trying to work out uh what that meant because of course un Security Council resolutions are legally binding of course they are binding of course in that Cas by the way the language of that resolution is 10 times stronger than the language of the resolution 242 and 338 which are used as the Bible for peace processes given what you said and given that it seems to be done to the US uh to be able if at all to be able to have some leverage against Israel how concerned are you as we now look towards uh this situation in NFA the Israeli threats to move into Rafa do you regard that given the fact that Netanyahu has now said that he will send a delegation back to talks for a ceasefire how much of that do you think is is leverage as far as those talks are concerned and how much of that is a genuine threat of the remaining towards the remaining people in Rafa it's very dangerous situation because the United States is not saying that Israel must not attack Rafa they are saying they have to attack it to attack it in a certain way to reduce the number of people killed but you're talking about 1.4 million people stuck in an area that is no more than 40 squ kilometers of course if you throw stones on people they will die what and they are sending Israel more bombs and more jet fighters F35 jet fighters and they're sending contradictive messages from one side they say they care about the civilian population from the other side they are encouraging Israel to attack by giving them the weapons and by not saying that Israel should should not attack Rafa why should Israel attack Rafa what do they want to achieve to have a huge Massacre the greatest maybe in in in the in the the whole human history in in modern times or to try to actually achieve what natany has been trying to achieve which is to try to EV people from Gaza creating the worst kind of ethnic cleansing that is these these These are the realities and the world Community must stop an attack on Rafa because it would mean a horrible horrible Massacre I want to ask you about the the potential involvement of uh Palestinians in the the governing of Gaza when the the war eventually ends given the structure of the Palestinian Authority as you see it at the moment given the the the lack of trust that there is exists on so many different sides what role or what shape do you think a Palestinian a Palestinian Authority should take in order to have a role in running Gaza look the west and United States in particular talks about democracy everywhere except in Palestine they speak about Democratic elections in Serbia maybe in China but not in Palestine we have to rule ourselves as people we don't need anybody to rule us from outside and definitely we don't want an reactivation of the Israeli occupation of Gaza but uh Mr Abbas went on and formed a government by his own I mean on his own without consulting with other political forces in our opinion the best solution is a national consensus temporary government that would be acceptable to everybody and that would of course unify Gaza and West Bank and prevent a continuation of Israeli occupation but it should be temporary because it has to organize free Democratic elections something we didn't have since 2006 and it is our right as people to elect our leaders democratically M we appreciate it thank you very very much indeed thank you
