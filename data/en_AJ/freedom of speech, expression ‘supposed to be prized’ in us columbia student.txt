claim that non students outside agitators are working with the students in the building and that is why they called in the police the police department and the mayor of New York Eric Adams held a press conference earlier today where they talked about this as well uh they said that they believed that people involved were not students and could be Danger to the people in on campus and because they are not uh affiliated with the campus are breaking the law and they listed numerous charges that they were going to uh attempt to charge them with if they were there they appealed to the parents of the students actually asking them to call their students and talk to the students who are on the campus warning that they could be criminally charged uh no longer just with trespassing but with uh breaking and entering and other charges like that this is what they say they wanted to get the students out of the way but when you talk to people on the sidelines here that ran into some teachers who were huddled around a radio listening to a live broadcast from students inside the campus and the teachers the professors were horrified that the students uh that the that the administration had called the police in they are not buying that they say these are our students those are the students they're going after uh so they were very concerned and came out specifically to Bear witness to What's Happening Here along with a lot of uh young people that we see here um but also it's interesting a lot of people are really afraid to talk to us you notice a lot of young people and the demonstrators are wearing masks we don't know how many are students there's a lot of student housing around here and even people who go to school at Columbia aren't being allowed back on the campus right now because of the lockdown situation and the students who are on campus were advised to stay in their dormitories and not come out uh in the runup to this clearly the University was prepping everyone for this Mass takeover by the police Kristen do stay with us as we update our viewers who might just be joining us on what's been happening these really important developments at Columbia University in New York this is Al daer and you are watching live pictures from Columbia University where in the past uh 45 minutes we have seen police officers moving into climbing up and entering through a window at the historic Hamilton Hall in Columbia University that's where a group of students we don't know how many exactly but a group of students barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall on Monday evening to continue to protest against Israel's war on Gaza they said that they had renamed Hamilton Hall hind Hall after the six-year-old Palestinian girl in Gaza who was killed by Israeli forces while on the phone with emergency paramedics begging them to come and save her and whose phone call went viral around the world there is a heavy police presence at Columbia University after University authorities called police uh saying that they were agitated who had infiltrated this protest let's bring our correspondent Kristen salumi back in she is one of two correspondents that we have outside Columbia University at different points um outside the university covering this ongoing situation for us and Kristen you know you were telling us about the university statement saying that there that there are agitators and our correspondent today a boy was telling earlier that you know she's been speaking to many protesters over the course of days of reporting as you have for you it's been weeks now uh covering these protests in Colombia and they say you know that these claims of infiltrators is simply not true and what's been really interesting not just at Colombia but other universities Across America is that students themselves are being charged students and professors themselves are being charged with trespassing which they say is an absolutely bizarre charge uh trespassing somewhere where you go or you work yeah that's right and Columbia University of course has this long history of student demonstrations in the very same Hall where the students uh are being arrested where they uh took over the building in 1968 demonstrators did the same thing there uh so they see this as continuing a tradition and happened again with the apartheid in South Africa they were demonstrations at the same spot so and and Columbia University has a law school it's the home to the night First Amendment Institute uh and the faculty from the law school and the night First Amendment Institute have all come out on the side of the demonstrators saying that you know they've been peaceful especially when the first arrest came along uh it was you know a peaceful encampment where people were up and by the police department's own statements they themselves said that the demonstrators had not done anything violent per se so uh from within the campus you have on the one hand the administration and the Board of Trustees who uh clearly are under pressure uh from leaders of the city and the state and the federal government to clamp down on this and get it under control but within the Colombia community I'm not saying all faculty members support the demonstrators but certainly there has been a majority of uh just by the Senate vote that was taken this uh faculty Senate vote uh was very critical of the fact that police were used to handle a situation the University faculty see this as their Community as their students this is a teachable moment many of them will say uh when they can uh you know encourage disc discussions and debate and the expression of free speech yeah and yet it was just a blanket shutdown so ABS a lot of feeling that the negotiations haven't been in good faith but you know Kristen I think we've seen since the war on Gaza began certainly before but it's been heightened since the war on Gaza began that the exception to free speech even at universities seems to be on Palestine well I don't recall any arrests during the South African apartheid devest movement uh there you know it this really uh this really seemed to trigger a response not only here at Colombia but elsewhere and uh there's a lot of sympathy for uh the Israel and for uh what happened there there's a lot of um you know strong feelings when Israel is threatened uh people here have family there there's a lot of connections between Israel and New York in particular so there is sympathy there um but there's also growing awareness of what's happening in Gaza and the pictures that have been coming from that conflict and uh again this is a an educational setting where people are learning about what's happening in the world and if you're being taught about human rights if you're being taught about Free Speech uh people are saying why can't we talk about this why can't we use our voices to to protest and that's what we've been seeing happening and and Kristen you know to your point about a part A our correspondent Rob McBride who's been covering the protests at the University of California Los Angeles he interviewed a history Professor a few hours ago live in one of our bulletins and he was talking about how in all of his years of being part of protests in America including against aparted he hasn't seen something like this so that that was really interesting you've covered the protests in America since the war on Gaza began and especially um the ones at universities Kristen Ju Just lastly how would you characterize what you're seeing tonight at Colombia in the context of what's been happening over the last few weeks you know it's a great question because the demonstrations in New York started from not long after October 7th uh there has actually been weekly in some cases multi uh many days a week there have been protests where people have come to the streets but they weren't getting covered they weren't getting a lot of attention unless they were a big one where they shut down Grand Central and people were arrested Ed there um or they shut down the Brooklyn Bridge when those things would happen they would get some attention they would get some coverage but people were coming out almost daily as the the the longer the war has continued the more frequent those demonstrations became but again the the media sort of lost interest it wasn't until the campus the college students got involved that uh that they started paying attention again so while people can be critical of the students and their methods and I've heard that actually from some of the Jewish students I spoke to here at Colombia actually had some sympathy for the plight of Gins in this conflict but they felt that the students were going about it wrong or they didn't like the chant of inata or from the river to the Sea because they felt like it was directed at them and it was uh it was anti-semitic in nature yeah even though the from the river to the sea is actually from Benjamin start happening here it wasn't getting right the different different sides of this debate see it differently but here in some circles any if you say inata if you say from the river to the sea that is seen as anti-zionist um and not more than anti-zionist it's it's anti- Semitic by by some people here and I've seen some really great debates on the sidelines here of people debating that yeah uh but but clearly that uh got attention and got the media back uh back to covering the story when the college campuses got involved yeah Kristen thank you so much for that for now that's Kristen salumi joining us live from Columbia University in New York we're going to go back to our other correspondent who's live at a different location at Colombia TOA Bo um is joining us and TOA can you if you can just you know uh bring us up to dat with what's been happening there over the past hour and you know we're watching the live shot of that window of the historic Hamilton Hall with police inside students have barricaded themselves inside and we don't know what's happening there you talk to over this all right they call back in talk well certainly we're right here across from where the window where at least 50 police officers went inside Hamilton Hall it's not clear what is happening there right now but uh student protesters have been outside uh in a way protecting those who are inside who have barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall they rename that Hall after a Palestinian girl the six-year-old Palestinian girl that was killed by the military and then uh just about an hour ago we started seeing massive police freshen they started coming towards where we are from the northern side of the Avenue and from the southern part of the Avenue and then just dozens and dozens of police officers came here let me bring you in and we're going to talk to one of the students that has been outside showing support for those who are inside uh and he does not want his name disclosed but he's been here all day he's been following what's been happening happen with the students all day so what can you tell us is happening inside what have you heard from your your your classmates your other students who are inside right so like you said a lot of the students went in uh to Hamilton Hall yesterday de occupied and reoccupied it as hin Hall uh they were there all day long all of us were hoping that the administration would behave like adults and negotiate in good faith with the students and find a compromise Find A Way Forward um to get these students safely back to their classes where they belong um but a lot of us were very disappointed obviously and shocked to see the police return to our campus an American institution where freedom of speech and freedom of expression are supposed to be prized um earlier today you know via social networks we all told that they expected the police to come so we came out here um to to demonstrate our support uh for for me personally for the American values that I believe in um and when we arrived there were students kind of massing around the gates behind me you see um eventually the police arrived and started pushing people back about 40 or 50 students uh went arm in- arm and tried to block the gate the police then came some of them behaved like professionals others were pushing and shoving and escalating the situation they took a lot of those students away in zip ties um and then eventually they pushed the red out of the way so they could bring in the vehicle that you see um to my right uh that vehicle moved forward to where it is now they used the ladder system they probably could use a normal ladder but decided that instead to use that vehicle to breach the window um into Hamilton Hall or hind Hall and from there they moved in um what we're told from inside there reports that they used tear gas in an enclosed space which doesn't seem tactically sound or responsible when dealing with unarmed student protesters have have you heard from inside what is happening inside because we cannot see anything from here from where we are right now but maybe you are in touch with other students inside have you do do you know what is going on right so from what we heard from inside there were students who were knocked on there was at least one student who was knocked unconscious by the police again that's the reporting that we're getting from inside and there was tear gas deployed a lot of the students apparently are being brought out um and in zip ties via buses to the south of the campus um but it sounds like the students were sitting there they were probably expecting to be arrested and were willing to be arrested for what they believe in um which is something that again we should applaud here in America that's true courage and there are those students who decided they wanted to stand for what they believed in and all these police officers with all their equipment knocking down the door to take them away what of things that the New York Police Department is saying is that the students inside were infiltrated by Outsiders that this is something extremely dangerous is this true I mean is this something that has happened is just students in there what can you tell us about who is inside I want to go those students who were sitting in classes like the rest of us the people who were in there right now to the best of my knowledge are all students who decided that they wanted to take a stand and actually demonstrate leadership um for the rest of the country and for students around the world um I haven't heard of any infiltration into the camps the only thing that happened was sometimes there would be some outside people who would come and try to you know change a narrative like there's a proud boy that came in other people trying to uh spread a different narrative but the students were very responsible and be and they behaved like very professionally and de escalating those situations and refocusing the narrative on Gaza as they were attempting to any of these narratives that are trying to spread fear about who the students are I recommend you speak to one of the students if you get a chance the Palestinian students or the Jewish students who are arrested uh last week the Jewish students are probably being arrested right now and you can hear from them what kind of motivation uh what kind of movement they are which is peaceful and there was no infiltration from my understanding of any kind of outside organization you as a students you're being part of this movement of this protest to shed light of what is happening in Gaza to the war on Gaza to the killing in Gaza what would you what would you like to say to the American public what would you like to say to American politicians what would you like to tell uh President Biden about what is happening here right now right I I want to start by saying I don't want to distract attention away from Gaza which is the real focus of all these students here but personally as a student as an American I'm horrified by the decision-making process here this isn't Moscow this isn't teron this is New York City we should be able to protest peacefully in order to talk to people about what we have you know what the issues we have with what's going on on our campus around the world without fear of our campus being militarized by police and occupied and being pushed away from our classes for no reason the students there they demonstrated incredible courage and they motivated people around the country to do the same and I was hoping that the administration here would follow their lead and do something constructive Unfortunately they started bringing cops last week the rest of the country followed their lead brought in cops they were negotiating constructively earlier in the week and gave up on that I was hoping they would move back to the negotiating table but instead they decided to do this so for everyone that grew up in America in elementary school mle school and learned about American values and history of the American Revolution or any other thing that you prize as American our values I would say hopefully in the future this doesn't happen again hopefully we remember who we are and we stand up for people who want to protest peacefully in order to address something they see going on in the world thank you very much so we remain here right outside of Colombia University just right in front of the door we around 50 police officers enter Hamilton Hall it's not clear what went on there we just heard some of the information that students outside are getting from what is happening inside but we are remaining here monitoring the situation seeing the dozens and dozens of police officers that have showed up here watching how at least 50 of them entered through that window probably to evict the students that are currently signed students have been facing the risks of suspension of expulsion now they're facing arrest so we're going to have to see what happens next but we'll be here and we'll we'll keep you updated with the latest of what's going on here outside Columbia University yeah no doubt today is a than
