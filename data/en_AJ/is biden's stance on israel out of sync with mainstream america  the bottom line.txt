hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a couple of questions what does Israel's war on Gaza say about US foreign policy and what are the long-term consequences for the region and the world let's get to the bottom line October 7th and its aftermath will definitely go down in history as a turning point for the Middle East hamas's attack and Israel's allout war on Gaza have forced countries around the world to rethink their priorities for Israel the plans to leaf frog over the Palestinians and integrate itself into the region are now on hold for the US its plans to Pivot to Asia to focus on China and avoid getting dragged back into the Middle East are also gone with the wi so what are the far-reaching implications of the Gaza War not only for the Palestinians and Israelis and what happens next today I'm talking with John alterman the director of the Middle East program at the center for strategic and International Studies John thank you so much for joining us today thank you let me just start out you written a very powerful ful interesting article I want to have everyone go look at it it's on the csis website called Israel could lose the implication is Hamas could win so tell us how Hamas could win hamas's goal is not to defeat Israel on the battlefield in any near term hamas's goal is to arrest Israel's integration in the world Israel's integration into the Middle East to make Israel more isolated uh to continue to put Israelis Under Pressure to to over the long term create a situation where Palestinians are united around Hamas the Palestinian Authority collapses and Hamas can bring Regional support other support to eventually conquer Jerusalem um what they did on October 7th was was much more successful than they ever thought but I think we we have to consider just how long the high from that is likely to last Egypt broke through the the supposedly impregnable bar Lev line in 1973 they used water cannons to break through a sand burn that the Israelis thought the Egyptians never could cross recaptured the Sinai briefly the Egyptians pushed back over I'm sorry the Israelis pushed back over over and were 100 km outside of Cairo and yet the Egyptian Military continues 50 years later to treat 1973 as their great achievement Armed Forces Day is O is October 6th every year in Egypt for 50 years break merely breaking through a defense was was a victory Hamas broke through the impenetrable Israeli fence in 29 places with using techniques the Israelis never Conta contemplated the Israelis thought we have this figured out we have it figured out technologically we have Hamas figured out we know how to play with work permits we know how to do all these things Palestine is not on anybody's radar screen we have one and we're going to be doing not only the Abraham records will do things with the Saudis we're doing things with the Indians we're in a different place and hamas's argument is you're not going to be able to do that we're going to drag you right back to this conflict we're going to tear you apart from all of these alliances you've been building for the last 50 years and you will suffer as we suffer and we're ultimately going to win because we have more resolved than you do that's what Hamas wants to do they changed the the the parameters of this conflict and Israel is committed to eradicating Hamas but it's not really clear what that means or how you do that I think when you kind of look at the question of eliminating Hamas and almost everyone I would say in the Western World kind of agrees with that after the horror of what they saw on October 7th everybody all the governments in the Arab world want to eliminate Hamas of only a small number because here you have an armed group that Embraces political Islam that's backed by the Iranians right and for virtually all of the Arab governments that makes them anathema they would love to see Hamas gone but I think at the same time when you look at the horror of what they Unleashed on October 7th and the Subterranean tectonics that of of essentially Injustice and keeping a population in a vice in a very very high pressure Vice for a long time some in some places of the world but I would also say the West Bank and among a lot of Palestinians what Hamas did nonetheless feels good to them feels legitimate to them is that a problem because if this becomes an IDE ideology that's deeper how do you separate Hamas from Palestine and in part that's what uh Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying is he's in a sense saying all Palestinians are Hamas right um so you know there's an argument in Israel and I think there's some validity to it that that Netanyahu wanted to have both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority he wanted Hamas to to to demonstrate that you couldn't make peace with the Palestinians but he wanted a relatively uh uh flexible Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to deal with and and sort of keep both both tracks going and say well I can't really make a Palestinian do because the Palestinians themselves aren't United um I think to my mind the the brutality of Hamas delegitimizes the movement in a really profound way I don't think there's an excuse for it I don't I I I you know I spoke to to somebody from my podcast uh earlier this week a podcast called Babel translating in the Middle East and I spoke to somebody who grew up in Gaza who will tell you all about the horrors of Gaza it doesn't justify what Hamas did I think some of the guys were high on Capon it's all kinds of issues involving what so are are Gins angry at what Hamas did now for triggering this hell and the destruction of their city and some say as far as I can tell some say just that the to show that we won't be trampled that we have dignity that we can fight back is important one of the important things though and this guy who I spoke to um KH SE was talking about when he was in Gaza he never met in Israeli the only Israeli he ever saw was in a jet flying overhead dropping bombs that Gins systematically never see Israelis and so there's a whole world inside Gaza and Hamas since it took power in in in Gaza uh in 2005 has has been creating its own reality teaching its own narrative about Israel its own its own theology about what Society should be like also distorting of of gazen society where do you see John the big Powers around this crisis Saudi Arabia Iran the United States Egypt because it seems to me when you kind of look at this one of the you know truth you've been talking about for decades is you can't just ignore this conflict they will come screaming back and get you and the Abraham Accords were sort of as you wrote uh kind of trying to ignore the Palestine equation palestine's come right back but it it but it seems to me that this conflict could go a number of directions that either enhance or trct from Big Powers around the conflict how do you see the geopolitical context of this crisis so let let me start with sort of Russia and China I think China has had deepening relations with Israel for a long time China without question has decided we're going to play the global South card we're going to play the the Injustice card uh China is very sympathetic to the Palestinian narrative and playing this as China plays many of its International engagements by thinking how does this affect the United States if we can get an edge over the United States with with audiences we care about let's play it that way and I think that's what China is doing uh but I do think that China expects and will push to be included in whenever peace deal comes about they're looking for Prestige they're looking for people to recognize China's role so I think they'll be subtly Pro Palestinian not necessarily pramas but which is strange in a way because what about China and sjan what about China and yeah uh you know I mean what about its populations that it has in advice and and realistically Chinese diplomats come to Middle Eastern states and they say do not talk about it and they say okay and and they and they say quiet the clerks down ab and they do so China is an interesting uh demonstration case for just how much power Middle Eastern governments have over both public opinion and over um clerical opinion about things in the world they've often said oh we can't do that you know it's we have we have our public opinion when they want to steer it they do and they certainly steer it on on Shen Jang um so I think China is is going to capitalize they want to use this as a way to be recognized as a great power without doing the kinds of things that a great power would be expected to do right Russia once again a bottom feeder they look at fragile places they look for small advantages I don't think they're playing any any constructive role here um Saudi Arabia realistically the government is trying to Tamp down some of the pro Palestinian uh sentiment they're trying to guide it when I look at Saudi papers the Saudi papers are not over the moon hostile to Israel that they're a little more deliberate I think my understanding is their effort is that costing Saudi leadership anything with their own Arab Street I mean in a way of course the Saudis have long been opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood you know Hamas is looked at as a an appendage or you know fellow traveler with the Muslim Brotherhood so you can understand that but if your choice and partnership is that oh we're going to become pro-israel over um Arabs is that a problem for them well they're not pro Israel I think their their argument is let's find a let's find a way to be sort of pro Palestinian they've halted things with Israel I think that're they're not they've told people on the one hand we're not ready to talk about postc conflict environment helping the PA and all those kinds of things uh but they've also told some Americans who've been in the kingdom are strategic orientation toward uh having some sort of understanding with Israel remains in place it's just suspended for now the amadis as well I think trying to use ways to to to Tamp down some of the sentiment without squashing it right um you know and both Saudi Arabia and and the UAE are uh pretty sophisticated pretty sophisticated in the way they uh engage with social media and public sentiment and I think they're trying to keep it within boundaries Egypt and Jordan are two places that have I think a lot more uh public anger and probably the the government is less sophisticated in ways to to shape it I think they are worried Egypt has a big role to play you know Jordan has this historic connection with Palestine I interview the the Jordanian foreign minister um a couple of weeks ago at csis he almost never used the word Hamas and would only do it when directly pressed it was all about Palestine and his point was we have to use this as a way to push toward two-state solution I think ultimately Egypt is going to have to be the Keystone of whatever happens next in Gaza in terms of logistics for reconstruction in terms of governance the Egyptians have their tentacles into Gaza through their their link their intelligence links things that dat back to when they controlled Gaza until 1967 um but Egypt is a country with a whole bunch of problems and uh financial and otherwise and uh I think Egypt is is going to be careful what it does is going to be trying to get things but also serve its National interest let me just say one more thing what I think a lot of this all highlights is the the sustained centrality of the United States um there is clearly no country or collection of countries that can begin to do what the United States can do Tony blinken's been running around the world I think he's been trying to to bridge an increasingly large gap between the Israelis and and the rest of the world certainly between the Israelis and the Arab I mean how would you greatest I mean I see him running all around the world too and trying it and I see him not getting as much traction as I would have thought the Secretary of state of the president United States getting the second side of it is where the American people do they think that this Global engagement is somehow paying off for them or they getting exhausted by it I am amazed at just how much attention sustained attention the Gaza war is attracting the conventional wisdom in the Middle East among other places was that the world has has washed its hands of this young people especially they're interested in entertainment they're interested in in jobs that you know Arab youth are are over Palestine that's an old issue um and I think this is one of a tiny number of issues in the world that can get billions of people exercised you know frankly another issue and it's it's strange a strange parallel I think LGBT issues are another issue that get billions of people exercised I'm not sure there's another those are the only two I can think of they're not similar at all but I think they they somehow speak deeply to something it's sort of ingrained in people it it elicits this emotional reaction I'm frankly surprised because everything I have been hearing in the Middle East for more than 10 years on every side of this equation on the Israeli side on the Arab side Gulf Arabs levantine Arabs you know were it's there but it's not it's not a motivating issue um and I think in Americans too it's Americans have gotten interested whether this translates to American interest in foreign policy American interest in the world whether people think about the US role in the world I'm having a much harder time understanding that I can't tell you I keep running across Americans who tell me this is a three 3,000 year old problem it's not a 3,000 year old problem uh you know it's it's a it's a a relative well to that point I used to talk to Senator George Mitchell who was our on Envoy on this got so frustrated and he said his response was hey call us in 400 years when you get over these religious you know fanatic Wars but you know and and he was basically saying there's nothing that can be done I know you don't share that view but this is a problem of nationalisms right and nationalism is a relatively recent phenomenon in the world um the the issue of of Jewish immigration to Palestine is is quite recent obviously um uh influenced by by the Holocaust uh but this is a relatively recent problem which I think has no perfect solution but certainly ways to improve the situation um again whether whether Americans say they've been fighting for 3,000 years will'll be fighting in around 3,000 I don't care or whether Americans say you know this does affect our security or whether Americans say the US can do things that nobody else can do I don't know where where people come out on this I don't think the president knows but I don't think the president is thinking in those terms and certainly one of the interesting things and you know this much better than I do I think um within the government the the the position Joe Biden is taking is a position that used to be the standard US Government position for decades right very conventional and for he's been you know in the 50 years ago he joined the Senate this was a sort of mainstream position it's not a mainstream position anymore you have an increasing number of younger and more diverse government employees who say what's happening in my name um I don't know where that breaks I think certainly in the US communities of color and younger people are in a very different position from where the president is how that shapes us for this begs the question of what happens after you have Tony blinkin saying Gaza cannot be occupied again Gaza cannot be shrunk again you have prime minister Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu coming out and saying you know we're going to determine every security aspect uh of the future of Gaza what is as you begin looking at a place where the schools have been bombed the roads have been bombed the infrastructure has been bombed I mean what's going to happen to this 140 square miles which you wrote so eloquently about afterward which is you twice the size of the District of Columbia 2.3 3 million people um there will have to be reconstruction but frankly people don't want to reconstruct things only have Israelis bomb them again I mean there's going to have to be some sort of understanding with the Israelis again this is why I think there needs to be an Arab role to partly to do some financing but part and partly to do some policing and partly do some governance support and partly to legitimate that this is not a foreign imposed solution but an Arab solution there's going to have to be a role for the Palestinian Authority but the Palestinian Authority can't effectively govern the West Bank it can't take over a hostile conflict affected region in Gaza right now there's going to have to be a lot of people coming together the US can't do it but the us can help coordinate again this is where I think we're we're going to see this sort of this stained unique ability of the United States to do these kinds of hard things I think that there's going to be a whole set of transitions in Israel I think there's going to be a political transition a lot of the people who responsible for security before October 7th are going to be sacked there's going to be commissions of inquiry looking at all the failures that went into it I think Beni Netanyahu is not going to be the Prime Minister when all the dust settles I'm not sure who will be I would like to think that uh you're going to have an Israeli government that says we have to rethink how we're approaching this uh but I'll tell you when I speak to both Israelis and Palestinians people tell me after what we've seen the last month the people who are arguing for coexistence haven't been empowered by the last month of hostility the people who argue for coexistence are both both sides right are saying look at who these people really are right and so we have a we all have a journey ahead of us let me just ask you finally did Joe Biden make a big strategic mistake when he came in he sort of largely ignored uh the Palestinian side of this he said we're going to focus on Asia the pivot to Asia at the time which you know hadn't anticipated what had happened with Ukraine but you know I think more deeply you'd seen the Trump Administration lay the groundwork for the Abraham cords you saw Jared Kushner run this and it largely ignored the pales question just sort of shoved it to the side and a lot of people thought of all people Joe Biden former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a kind of rival if you will to uh Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu over time they didn't like each other that he would come in and reset things in a way that would include a horizon for Israel and Palestine again and a lot of people think that was an opportunity Miss so did Joe Biden make a mistake at the beginning of his administration that in part contributed to this environment I don't think so because you can't make a peace agreement unless both sides feel some urgency and necessity to make a deal when Joe Biden came in neither side felt either an urgency or necessity to make an agreement Mahmud Abbas wasn't interested bin Netanyahu wasn't interested and I think you know the US can can sort of push and push and push should try to but this conditions did not lead either side to say this is really unacceptable and so I think you try to prevent doors from closing certainly nobody wanted a a a catastrophe like October 7th to happen um but if you don't have Partners you know one of the things that that uh us officials have said a lot in the past is the US can't want want peace more than the parties themselves and I just don't think it was a it was a good environment I think now people do see the possibility of environment but there's a lot of building that's going to have to go on to get there and part of it is you have a profound leadership vacuum on both the Palestinian and Israeli side and we're going to have to go through political transitions on both the Palestinian and Israeli side to have an agreement working toward agreement can help be part of that process but but there are no leaders now maybe this conflict will help create some leaders who can take us to a better place is Hamas going to survive in this future plan or do you think Hamas will be decimated I think the Flames of Hamas will go away the Embers of Hamas will remain and the only way to extinguish the Embers is to have an alternative um an alternative that gives dignity and some self of of some sense of self-determination to Palestinians and Gaza and the Israelis have up to now been very reluctant to do that I think it's in their profound interest to to change that view well John alterman BF brazinski chair in Global Security and geost strategy at the center for strategic and International Studies here in Washington thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with us today thank you Steve so what's the bottom line the battle over a Homeland has been going on for a century and with the support of the West Israel has been the dominant power setting the agenda and dictating the terms of Engagement now the world needs to figure out a path where Israel feels secure and the Palestinians well they need something to look forward to that means Nations around the world in the Middle East Asia Europe and of course the United States are making commitments for the so-called day after what we are seeing unfold now with the deaths of so many who do not deserve their lives being snuffed out won't just matter to Israelis and Palestinians but will have major long-term consequences for America's place in the world as well and that's [Music] line
