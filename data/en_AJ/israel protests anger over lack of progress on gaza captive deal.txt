ly Israel anti-government protesters say the killing of Hamas and hisbah leaders could further delay the release of captives in Gaza thousands gathered in Tel Aviv in hia on Saturday demanding the government secure a deal a report by the Israeli newspaper hared says there is a major Rift between prime minister Netanyahu and his defense Chiefs It quotes a senior Israeli negotiator saying Netanyahu is not interested in a ceasefire deal we're calling President Biden to to help us and continue helping us in the in achieving the release of the hostages put more pressure on our prime minister benjam Nan is the only one at fault and is the only reason that the hostages are not back at home I don't care about Iran I don't care about theas the only one who is preventing a deal is prime minister Mr Benjamin n well joining me now for more on this this my r on China senior Israeli Analyst at the international crisis group she joins us from Tel Aviv thanks very much for being with us here on elazer we'll get to those protests and their concerns uh in just a moment but I first want to get uh the reaction to the latest attack and holl on and what impact that this will have on the Public's trust in the government which as we've said before is already at an all-time low two elderly people killed in that stabbing attack hi well I mean unfortunately this is something that is ises are used to it it doesn't necessarily happen that often but it happens often enough and there's been an uptick in the last couple of years in attack specifically inside Israel uh this is just part of a greater issue of constant crisis and conflict in which there's no political Vision or or any kind of idea of how to get out of this mess uh and no matter how strong Israel's military and security are they'll never be able to prevent all of these types of um infiltrations and attacks and so this is just a daily reality for Israelis now as I'm sure you're aware Al jaer has been banned from reporting from inside Israel so can you just give us an idea of what the mood what the feeling is like there as as we see the rhetoric ramp up uh in Iran about how they will uh respond to the assassination yeah well as the previous interview from Israel spoke I mean people want the hostages back they' want but they the majority want Netanyahu to resign they've wanted this to stop for quite a while now they understand that obviously they don't want Hamas empowering Gaza but you know if you ask people who understand this issue they understand it's it's not you can't just make Hamas disappear but Israelis have as you said no confidence in the government no confidence in the military or very little and also not much confidence in the police uh you know we could get into a whole segment just on what national security minister fire right settler itamar benir has done uh with the police police basically politicizing it uh the police is nowhere to be found in certain instances when they're needed but all of a sudden when a few protesters are in front of the knesset they're they're there uh using Force um so it's really just a a horrible situation of the total lack of Law and Order and rule of law as Israelis have understood it until now yeah well there's been a report in uh haret as we mentioned a few moments ago basically saying uh a major Rift between Netanyahu and his defense Chief saying that Nyo was not actually interested in a ceasefire deal is that how you see it yeah I think that's how a lot of people see it and we've we've been hearing the most senior security officials the head of the shinb the head of mad the IDF Chief of Staff all question undermine or criticize netanyahu's approach both to the war in Gaza and to the ceasefire uh negotiations so um I think it's pretty clear that you know if anyone thought that Netanyahu wanted to get a deal after taking out much of let's say hamas's leadership uh in Gaza and outside um and kind of restoring this image of Israel as a powerful uh uh you know the superpower in the region that can kill anywhere in Teran and Beirut then I think it would have made sense for him now after these assassinations with a threat of regional War to come out and say I don't want a regional war and I want to reach a deal right now and I'm accepting the deal that Biden laid out on May 31st if that you know if he was interested in a deal he would have done that but he's not done that um and so I think it's clear and it's not even my opinion it's the opinion of the top security in Israel that Netanyahu is not interested in a deal and it seems like he's going even further than that now in a a press statement I believe on Wednesday he said since the beginning of the war I have made it clear that we are in a fight against Iran's Access of Evil I mean what's been the response to that basically going from saying that we're going to fight Hamas and Gaza to a much wider existential War now well I think he's at the weakest Point that he's been as a prime minister he understands that his you know everybody wants him out and so he's using this to kind of rally support at home and abroad again I mean I don't know how far and how long this can go uh but certainly when you have the threat of you know possibly thousands of rockets and drones coming at you from many different Arenas then you know Israelis are going to hunker down and they're not going to go out and protest in the same way uh I think at this point what you need is major major major changes both from the security establishment to completely put their foot down in a very serious way um and for Biden and the Biden Administration to put serious pressure and leverage not just rhetoric that's the only way to stop this at this point I don't think there's any other way okay thank you so much for your analysis uh we really do appreciate it that is my onshine for us in Tel Aviv make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news
