Israeli air strikes have killed at least 66 people across Gaza since Saturday inan yunas an Israeli attack on a home killed 10 Palestinians and in al- maasi which the Israeli military has declared a safe Zone at least five people were killed in a strike on a tent Sheltering displaced people well many Palestinians say they are fearful after Israeli authorities ordered them to evacuate the alur camp in der Al Bala the head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees is warning 86% of people in the Gaza Strip have been told to leave the Palestinians said they've been forced to flee several times and that there's nowhere left to go I swear I don't know where to go in 1948 they were displaced once but this is the 10th time for us I swear to God I don't know where to go find a solution for us enough where do we go they destroyed our homes they've killed our children they placed our women and our men where do we go enough of this where do we go let's bring in our correspondent hanim mm he's joining us live from De albala in central Gaza 86% of 2.3 million people hany that's nearly 2 million people currently under orders to leave wherever they are well there is literally nowhere to go and there is no safety place across the Gaza rer from further northern part of the city of the stri in B hanon City going through Gaza City to the central area and far further southern part of the strip everywhere has evolved across the G strip into a killing box where people either uh experiencing a daily struggle of finding basic necessities or enduring an intense bombing campaign and between the first one and the second one there is mass murder Mass killing of civilians everywhere in evacuation centers in in their residential homes as they are ordered to evacuate their homes they're being chased by Sky Predators the surveillance drones the quadcopter that keep shooting at them and intimidating uh their Journey from uh their homes that really traumatizing Journey the fact that you're leaving your homes and not knowing where to go whether the road you're taking is safe or not whether the house next to you is going to be bombed as you walking by or driving by all of this intimidation is created by by uh the Israeli military and causing a great deal of a trauma the vast majority of people are now concentrated in the central area and when we speak of the humanitarian Zone we're talking about only 14% of the total Gaza stri area that is not under direct Israeli evacuation orders but they're definitely under Relentless attacks these humanitarian zones locations are have been repeatedly targeted either by land or or by by air or sea and we've seen within the past few weeks how masasi evacuation Zone relentlessly targeted leaving some 80 Palestinians killed majority women and and the children were Sheltering inside the tents that they they were Sheltering uh inside seeking protection and just as of yesterday a tent that was targeted in the the in western part of kanun is very close to Al maasi where close to eight people were killed a whole family among the casualties but this been going on for for the past n nine months almost 10 months right now since the beginning of this genocidal War the recent evacuation orders are affecting people in Alor and no refug Camp pushing the vast majority of the residents into further internal enforce displacement people pouring into the city of darah and we definitely seeing more people are coming to the hospital already a small midsize Hospital still already packed with people who've been displaced for the past months and more recently from Kan un from other parts of the Gaza a St including gra but now more people here definitely making it very difficult for uh the uh the kind of services provided here if there are any of the services but also much of the pressure is on the medical facility that is already struggling and already on a brink of collapse and doesn't have the capacity to provide any of the basic a medical intervention to save life this place families are are talking about horrific experience that they had to leave eastern part of alage refugee came under heavy artilleries the the fear and the worry the the the state of panic that they experienced taking uh the the the road from their homes all the way to the central area here to the hospital uh fearing for their Liv for the life of their loved ones the children that they're uh taken with them and this have been going on for for the past n nine months and increasing the trauma at all at all levels here from uh the uh the senior citizen here or elderly the women the children the vulnerable group here as well but people uh right now the they speak of of of of the lack of safety there is there's shattered sense of safety absolutely there is no safety whatsoever to talk about or to think about also the Le leaving their homes and not taking enough of their belongings and stuff because this recurrent displacement been going on for a lot of time and every time they're losing much of their energy much of their physical belongings inab now just seeking uh to survive only survival the dominating uh scene right now among the displaced population hny thank you very much for that that is hanim Mahmud with all the latest live in there Al Bala in central Gaza make sure to subscribe to
