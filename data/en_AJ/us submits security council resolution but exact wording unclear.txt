United States has submitted a draft resolution to the UN Security Council which appears to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says the resolution is linked to the release of captives he made the comments following a visit to Saudi Arabia it's part of a wider trip to the Middle East where blinkin is holding talks on ending the war on Gaza the US has previously vetoed attempts at the security Council to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza for more on this let's bring in our diplomatic editor James spay tell us more first James about what's in this draft us resolution that's circulating at the UN well comments have come from secretary of state blinkin who's in the region and we have the resolution that is in New York let me first tell you what the US Secretary of State said in an interview with an Arabic TV channel before he left Saudi Arabia he's just now arriving in uh Egypt we're pressing for an immediate ceasefire tied to the release of the hostages in fact we've actually put forward a resolution right now before the UN Security Council that does call for an immediate Ceasar tied to the release of hostages well a couple of hours ago Al jazer obtained this which is a copy We Believe of the latest us resolution I think the language is important so let me read you the key point of the resolution it says the security Council determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians on all sides allow for the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance and alleviate humanitarian suffering and towards that end unequivocally supports ongoing International diplomatic efforts to secure such a ceasefire in connection with the release of all the remaining hostages I think that's important because normally when you get a ceasefire and the other ceasefire resolutions that have come from other parties other than the US they demand a Ceasar this one the security Council deter determines the imperative I.E it says it's important that there is a Ceasar it doesn't seem to be demanding one and it's also linking this Ceasar directly with the release of the maining remaining captives being held by Hamas and other groups in Gaza so it's a little bit more complicated than the Secretary of State made it sound in that TV interview so so what blinkin is saying is somewhat different to what's in the draft resolution uh that's circulating at the UN but this is still significant all of this given the previous us vetos at the security Council on Gaza and I think things are changing I think things are changing in two ways one we have those very important talks in Doha um secretary blinkin also says he believes the Gap is being narrowed it may well be that the US is planning to put this res ution forward after they've got a deal uh here in Doha the other thing is that this is not the only resolution floating around the security Council uh the elected members of the security Council the 10 members who aren't permanent that just sered two years they've had enough they've got together they've drawn up a resolution they're close I believe to putting that one to a vote demanding an immediate ceasefire with no complication in the language uh whatsoever uh two of those permanent uh sorry elected 10 members Japan and South Korea I think a little bit hesitant because they're very close us allies and they don't want to further um antagonize the US and France is also working on a resolution we understand it uh and my understanding also is the US I think is very hesitant about the idea of yet again given what they've heard about famine coming to Gaza what we've heard from the international court of justice very very worried that it might have to use its veto again so I think that's why this us resolution which has been in the works for some weeks now now has tougher Lang language language Israel won't like but is it language that would force an immediate ceasefire I think we need to ask some more questions today while the secretary of state is in Cairo right diplomacy then at the UN but also in the region Cairo the Secretary of State meeting a number of regional leaders there and there is hope cautious hope it would seem about a ceasefire deal being achieved in the coming days ceasefire talks the technical talks on the ceasefire continue they're going ahead here in Doha but it is both Qatar and Egypt who've been the key media here and the Secretary of State in two hours time is meeting President CeCe uh in Cairo to get an update I think on the talks and the regional situation but he's also going to be meeting during his time in Ciro with representatives of Egypt Jordan Saudi Arabia UAE cutter and the Palestinian Authority so further meetings I think with all the key players in the Arab world including the Palestinian Authority those won't just talk about the seasar I think they are also looking at the Palestinian Authority how that can be uh reorganized revitalized now it has a new prime minister and then how you potentially look at the governance of Gaza after a war and then this seems a long way off but trying to get political talks back on track for that two-state solution that the US always talks about and always worth reminding people that Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government they don't even agree with that idea indeed thank you very much James James SP is our diplomatic editor let's get the viar from occupied East Jerusalem in in Imran Khan who's there for us so Imran this draft resolution and and the reaction comments from the US Secretary of State in Saudi Arabia how's that all likely to go down with the Israelis will they be paying any attention well we've spoken to the prime minister's office they've issued us a very tur no comment on this we've also reached out to Benny Gant who's the former prime minister and a key member of the war cabinet the same response from him as well reached out to others within the government they're likely to all follow suit this is going to be certainly an official no comment Day by the looks of things however they will be pouring over the language that James was just uh referencing there they'll be looking at what this actually means for them but remember the UN Security Council the United Nations in general is treated with disdain by uh the Israelis they say that this is a organization that has a lopsided attitude towards Israel when it comes to Israel since 2015 they say there have been about 140 resolutions against uh Israel and it's something that they've often dismissed the Israelis are incredibly good at ignoring uh United Nations uh resolutions however this one is going to be incredibly difficult to ignore given that it will is coming from their key Ally right so let's see what happens officially I think we are going to get a no comment but people will be talking about this it's going to be a big talking point so we'll get further reaction I think as the day goes on and what about Hamas sran this draft resolution also relies on them agreeing to free hostages will they well it's all about the language Hamas will be looking at this they've made their position incredibly clear they want a permanent ceasefire this resolution doesn't call for a poning ceasefire what it does say is it wants an immediate ceas fire but the interesting word there and maybe this does give some wiggle room is sustained ceasefire does that mean that every hostage that is released for every set of hostages released the ceasefire gets extended well that's what we saw during the last ceasefire which Hamas actually accepted but Hamas have also been very critical in the past of United Nations resolutions take a look at the one on December 22nd that was calling for Aid coming into Gaza Hamas said it didn't go far enough so the language for mass is going to be very key they're going to be looking at this uh it is likely that they will reject it given their previous positions but this idea that it's an immediate but sustained ceasefire May well be something that Hamas might And I stress the word might uh be able to work with Imran thank you very much for that that's Imran Khan life for say in occupied East Jerusalem
