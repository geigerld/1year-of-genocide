time in months a trickle of Aid has arrived in Northern Gaza without incident 13 trucks delivered supplies including flour to jabalia and to Gaza City volunteers and Community leaders coordinated with the UN to secure the entry of the Convoy eight organizations say this delivery is a test to see if they can conduct more on Sunday a growing number of Palestinians are dying of hunger in the north where the UN says famine is taking hold one in three children in Northern Gaza one in three children under the age of two is acutely malnourished that's according to the United Nations some food Parcels have been delivered but it's nowhere near enough to meet the needs of millions of Palestinians as Michael Appo reports 200 tons of Aid is brought asore this represents only a fraction of what's needed to stop people starving in Gaza the situation is so bad that no one can imagine it and the ship even if it helps will be a drop in the ocean because the entire region is in need of Aid and people are competing to take aid from the shore air drops have caused chaos with several people killed by Falling pallets when parachutes failed to open we keep waiting for Aid this is not a solution whether by ship or by plane we saw planes dropping Aid and people fighting over it there are some children who drowned in the sea for aid aid agencies are warning nearly 600,000 people are on the brink of famine the living situation is very bad we cannot eat or drink and Aid is very scarce they told us there is Aid in the South but it is very scarce the ship Open Arms arrived from Cyprus on Friday the US charity behind the delivery acknowledges that the best way to get desperately needed Aid in is for Israel to open the land Corridor our first boat arrived there and we are ready to continue scaling up this and what we see and we Invision is having a highway of Aid going to gasa but of course we need to keep opening the L Crossing and having more accents because not enough a there is not enough Aid right now arriving gasa with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu approving plans for an assault on the southern city of Rafa which is Sheltering more than a million displaced people any Aid deliveries may be too late Mike leppel Al jazer Federico Desi is the Middle East director at the aid group humanity and inclusion sir you're joining us from Aman this hour thank you for your time it's been months as we reported since a trucks were able to reach Northern Gaza without any incident we know how many of them have been shot at uh in the in the past few weeks this one reached Northern Gaza without incident I wanted to start with your take on that well I think it's a it's a positive sign but it's still drop in the ocean of needs in Northern Gaza um what we need is really a much larger access for hundreds of trucks every day in 200 and Northern Gaza uh the accesses are there I uh we have the possibility to bring trucks from Egypt we have possibility to bring trucks from Israel it's a matter of approvals U it's a matter of approvals and it's a matter of coordination with the humanitarian system with United Nations with the community on the grounds to make sure that this happen safely yeah as you say the aid is there the trucks are standing by at the border have been for weeks if not months Israel controls how much Aid goes into Gaza how much where when how Etc we also know the Palestinians have died of malnutrition in Northern Gaza none of that is a surprise because eight agencies had been warning of famine and starvation for months when you connect all those dots is it fair to say that Israel has deliberately starved Northern Gaza well I think Israel is putting up a lot of uh unnecessary harders and constraints and and this might amount to the use of starvation as weapon of War as you as you mentioned um there's been an order by the international C of justice that requires Israel to ensure unimpeded uh Aid to hold the Gaza Strip uh and I think this has not been fully respected in the in the past months and a half um we we really need to see the International Community putting more pressure and we need Israel to abide by its obligation open all the borders open all the potential Crossing points and allow a much larger flow of access to a as you say okay so you you speak of international pressure this uh this Convoy that we saw reach Northern Gaza without incident for the first time in months what is your what is your read on why Israel then allowed that to happen do you think it's International pressure do you think it's a bandaid do you think this is for public consumption because it plays better on the news to allow some Aid in how do you look at it well it's hard to know it's not up to me to judge uh on on the exact reasons but I think that could happen tens of times every day we could have literally hundred of trucks going from Southern G to Northern Gaza we could have hundred of trucks going from Jerusalem and from the Israeli Coast into Northern Gaza directly uh it's all in Israel's power to to facilitate that we also need uh the bombing to stop we need an immediate safe fire because part of the insecurity and part of the reason convoys have not been able to uh to operate safely and to move safely is also the fact that the conflict is continuing that Earth strikes are happening everywhere they nowhere is safe in Gaza and this is also hampering the ability of International organizations to to deliver Aid it's forcing to cancel uh some convoys to postpone shipments to withdraw stuff from some exposed areas so anyy fire is also a key PR condition to make sure that we can scale up Aid all over Gaza can you talk about the long-term impact uh the long-term effects of the last five months of War on Gaza I mean when a territory and a population have been of course killed in great numbers and when there's been this level of Destruction dismantling of social structures the health care etc etc can Gaza ever get back on its feet to what it was before what would that look like well I think the impact has been massive catastrophic I mean we lack the words to describe it uh there have been you know more than 30,000 people killed more than 70,000 people injured thousands of people have lost limbs uh and uh somewhere between a third and a half of buildings and houses in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed uh I think Gaza can be brought back and life can return as normal but it takes an imire it takes full access and it will take years of effort uh by the Palestinians and by the International Community to to rebuild and the only way to rebuild in a sustainable way is also to address the root causes of this conflict and make sure that that this is the last war and there is some form of agreement and sustainable peace and dignity for the Palestinians for the Israelis as well and stability across the region right Federico Desi Middle East director of the aid group humanity and inclusion thank you for your time this hour
