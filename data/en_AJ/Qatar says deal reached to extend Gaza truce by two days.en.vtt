00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.669 align:start position:0%
I think they've nailed down the exact um

numbers and names of those that are
 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
numbers and names of those that are
going<00:00:30.880><c> to</c><00:00:31.000><c> be</c><00:00:31.160><c> exchanged</c><00:00:31.640><c> in</c><00:00:31.759><c> the</c><00:00:31.880><c> coming</c>

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
hours that was taking some time but it
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
hours that was taking some time but it

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
seems that both of these things have
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.510 align:start position:0%
seems that both of these things have

to be released in the coming hours we
 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.869 align:start position:0%
to be released in the coming hours we
think<00:00:47.239><c> 33</c><00:00:48.199><c> Palestinians</c><00:00:49.199><c> so</c><00:00:49.440><c> that's</c><00:00:49.680><c> the</c>

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 align:start position:0%
think 33 Palestinians so that's the
 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.430 align:start position:0%
think 33 Palestinians so that's the
completion<00:00:50.480><c> of</c><00:00:50.600><c> the</c><00:00:51.000><c> 4day</c><00:00:52.000><c> agreement</c><00:00:52.960><c> and</c><00:00:53.160><c> now</c>

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
completion of the 4day agreement and now
 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.270 align:start position:0%
completion of the 4day agreement and now
we<00:00:53.640><c> have</c><00:00:54.079><c> two</c><00:00:54.280><c> more</c><00:00:54.600><c> days</c><00:00:55.280><c> so</c><00:00:55.520><c> we</c><00:00:55.760><c> potentially</c>

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
we have two more days so we potentially
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.270 align:start position:0%
we have two more days so we potentially
I<00:00:56.440><c> think</c><00:00:56.640><c> we</c><00:00:56.800><c> don't</c><00:00:57.000><c> know</c><00:00:57.199><c> the</c><00:00:57.359><c> numbers</c><00:00:57.960><c> but</c><00:00:58.120><c> we</c>

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
I think we don't know the numbers but we
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.509 align:start position:0%
I think we don't know the numbers but we
potentially<00:00:58.800><c> have</c><00:00:59.239><c> about</c><00:00:59.559><c> 10</c>

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 align:start position:0%
potentially have about 10
 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.470 align:start position:0%
potentially have about 10

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
um captives Israeli captives each day
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.229 align:start position:0%
um captives Israeli captives each day
released<00:01:03.960><c> and</c><00:01:04.159><c> probably</c><00:01:04.519><c> potentially</c><00:01:04.920><c> about</c>

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 align:start position:0%

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
30 Palestinians on either side so an
 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.789 align:start position:0%
30 Palestinians on either side so an

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
important development and this of course
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.789 align:start position:0%

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
means that the bombardment in Gaza does
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.030 align:start position:0%
