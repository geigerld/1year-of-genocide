Israel's war on Gaza continues to expand as it's not been able to find the captives being held by Fighters and we now share this video this according to the Israeli Army is proof that two captives were at gaza's ala Hospital seen here in CCTV footage gunmen are entering another hostage from those countries I mentioned into the vicinity the terrorists are guarding the room we have not yet located both of these hostages and rescued them we have not yet located them security cameras have been obstructed all of the security cameras are earlier Israeli soldiers claimed that all security cameras in alifa were obstructed near the hospital they found a body of a soldier Israel admits the captured Soldier was hit in an Israeli strike and claims she was then killed by Hamas Fighters another Army video claims this is an entrance to a tunnel days after attacking gaza's largest hospital Israeli bulldozers unearth dis shaft Palestinian Engineers say this concrete structure could not have been constructed in secret and it's unlike most tunnels which are built with prefabricated concrete slabs these videos are part of Israeli military's attempt to prove the hospital was being used by Hamas as a command center and not protected under International humanitarian law a war crime say Palestinians in Gaza who accuse Israel of lying about the hospital being under the control of Fighters claimed that this hospital was a command center where is that there's nothing of the sort not because we HIIT it but because the truth is the occupation is lying whether the occupation finds a hole here or there enters the tunnel here or there it does not mean much we don't deny tunnels extend along the roads and streets in Gaza for hundreds of kilometers we've never hidden that this is a grab bag more doubt on who placed an arrange what Israeli military has presented as evidence this is what the military video showed before selected journalist equipment there is a an AK-47 the number of guns in the MRI room increased they can be seen as being arranged differently these are explosives in other places what's claimed as evidence found location has been neatly arranged for cameras this video was also deleted and uploaded again the earlier version showed what appeared to be an Israeli soldier on a laptop presented as evidence they thought would be and the claim that the video was unedited was also seemingly untrue because here inside you can see the video was stitched together and the Israeli Army has also deleted an earlier post which admitted that it sees ambulances and hospitals as legitimate targets but despite the word War crime now being used more frequently by analysts and Aid groups Israel's war on Gaza continues to have support from Western governments the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters their military hidden under Hospital the doctors and nurses and personnel and opportunity to get out of Harm's Way so this is a different story than I believe what was occurring before indiscriminate bombing and that indiscriminate bombing has consequences as this doctor says he wants the world to hear not just screams of feminine children as they die but also see the Spectre of death as death itself is make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
