Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have responded to a us back proposal for ceasefire in Gaza US Secretary of State Anthony blink's IND DOA to discuss the response with katerie mediators a senior political anal he's joining us by Skype uh from Paris as AMA was just explaining there uh we don't have a lot of details about what's uh at the center of these uh proposals Hamas has made its response essentially restating a position that it's held right from the start we seem to have a lack of enthusiasm within uh Israel as well the only people that seem to be really pushing this are the US are we any closer to where we are say several months ago with regard to these negotiations well Rob the US is pushing its own proposal it's not pushing for an immediate and permanent ceasefire the US is pushing its own proposal which has been contrary to what the International Community wanted for 8 months but was forced to accept the American dictates because otherwise the war would have continued to grind on and kill hundreds of Palestinians every week if not every day so the US is basically pushing its own PX Americana and that's normal that's what America does America advances its interest and this proposal is in the interest of the United States is the interest of the Biden admin Administration in an election year and it's pushing it because as you said and I I won't say reluctant I think the Israelis want war they've been saying it nonstop I'm not sure why the rest of us can't understand what the Israeli government wants the Israeli government wants War it wants to destroy Hamas I'm not sure what I mean the Americans give it excuses I don't think the rest of us need to give the Israelis excuses the Israeli government want to continue the war and Destroy Hamas period new paragraph right now the Americans try to say look let's get some of the hostages out over 6 weeks and then we will see and why do I say we will see and why Hamas continues to hammer on this point and why the Palestinians are worried about this point which is called moving from phase one to phase two this is the most important part and the biggest problem with this American proposal come un Security Council resolution 735 and that's anything that will happen in Phase 2 including Israeli withdrawal from Gaza will only happen upon agreement of the parties upon agreement of the parties which means in simple English Israel has a veto over phase two which means we could end up just with phase one because if Israel doesn't like what Hamas is doing towards phase two Israel will can continue with the war and that's why yesterday Israeli High officials told Reuters that this proposal this resolution will allow Israel or could allow Israel to achieve its War objectives part of the problem is if I understand it correctly Maran is that we are back to talking about something that we were really talking about several months ago as well which is the vager of what those objectives actually are we still don't know what Israel would would consider as being a in quotes Victory the the the thing that they would be able to say right that's it we're done we have eradicated Hamas and whilst one would imagine that remains vague that allows an awful lot of maneuverability for Israel in terms of how it deals with these negotiations look I certainly agree with you on that uh and I think within Israel itself there is a b of a Nuance about what victory means and by the way for all practical purpose uh General Gant and general Eisen card left the the government or the war cabinet because they did not agree on the end game right what constitutes an Israeli Victory they did not agree with Netanyahu on that I think the United States and Israel and the Netanyahu government don't agree about what the end game is what constitutes an Israeli Victory or at least how to achieve it for example for the Americans let's wind down the war we can achieve our objective Israeli American objective of finishing off Hamas and taking control of Gaza away from Hamas without necessarily killing 30,000 more Palestinians that's what the Americans think they continue to agree with the Israelis that Hamas can no longer control Gaza they could they agree with the Israelis that if possible Gaza must be demilitarized they agree with the Israelis that Israel is defending its own security and will continue to defend its own Security in Gaza not that Israel is defending its occupation and its racist system while part from The River To The Sea no the Americans and the Israelis could think and argue that Israel is merely defending itself in Gaza and the Westbank and is Jerusalem not that it's defending its occupation and there's a huge between the two now the Israelis at this point in time this very narrow government or security cabinet that includes the likes of the radical Fanatics uh B and SMR as well as some real fascists from the leud party and Netanyahu The Godfather of all this want to defeat Hamas want the end of Hamas in Gaza like they Tred to achieve the end of Hamas in the West Bank they want to make sure that they all end up either dead or in jail or outside Gaza and they don't want any trace of Hamas in Gaza and they would like to take control of a of a security uh zone or Corridor of a mile long throughout from the north to the South if possible for years to come they would like that they would like to maintain control over all Crossings and borders that Gaza has with the rest of the world just as they do in the West Bank so they want to maintain basically overall control of Gaza without Hamas they will control they will consider that achieving the war objectives and one of the things that that I in find interesting about all of this that Hamas is focusing on or appears to be focusing on with regard to the ceasefire the immediate problem of stopping the war within Gaza but what it does not do is ultimately lead to what it had originally hoped for for Palestinians which was something akin to a two-state solution talk to us about what you think hamas's thinking is at the moment with regard to the priorities that it has well certainly uh there has been a Devolution in the Palestinian cause in the Homeland uh for the past 30 years we have gone from the idea of a two-state solution to the idea of a limited autonomy around ramala in the west bank and then we ended up with a split between Gaza and the West Bank and of course Jerusalem was annexed by the Israelis and blessed by the United States including unfortunately by this Administration the Democratic Administration not just by the Trump Administration and now what the Palestinians are doing is no more than defending themselves believe it or not neither Hamas nor the fat nor the nor the Palestinian Authority nor any Palestinian party at this point in time is doing anything to liberate Palestine or to free Palestine from the Israeli occupation what they've been doing now at least since 2002 is merely defending themselves in Gaza and in ramala in the West Bank the Palestinians have been in a mod of self-defense now for over two decades the idea that they would struggle and towards the freedom of the rest of the Homeland I think that has not been in the books for at least at least two decades because they have been busy defending themselves Israel has been busy maintaining its occupation and they have been busy defending themselves we have gone through as you remember Rob and you and I have spoke about this over the years Israel has launched four Wars in on Gaza Hamas and Jihad and other groups within Gaza have been in a mode of self-defense basically one war after another trying to reconstruct whatever Authority whatever lives whatever infrastructure they have for 20 years that's what the Israelis called mowing the loan continuously destroying Palestinian infr infrastructure continuously putting the Palestinians on defense the price for the Palestinians have been so heavy it's really culminated in this latest war of eight months because Israel has basically run with total impunity one war after another leading us to this war where the Israeli said you know what if the world doesn't care if the Arab world doesn't give a damn and if the United States is going to protect us no matter what we do no matter what war crimes we carry no matter what genocide we we we affect in in in Gaza or in Palestine well we you going to do it and and that's the result of impunity Israel is taking its uh its revenge it's its wrath on Gaza and the result I mean you know I know we've been covering it but why not just repeat again and again tens of thousands of Palestinian women and children and adults have been killed more than 100,000 casualties the entire Gaza Strip now is basically destroyed schools and hospitals and universities and Clinics and and bakeries and residential buildings that's the result of this and after all of that after all of that when the Palestinians were dying for a ceasefire for the past so many months dying for a ceasefire literally and figuratively now comes blink into the region and lectures lectures the Palestinians about a ceasefire how surrealistic and absurd is this picture of the Emissary of the United States the Imperial power that has been protecting financing and arming Israel to carry its genocide in Gaz is lecturing the Palestinians and and the Arabs out of the Dead Sea in Jordan about the importance of ceasefire when the United States has been blocking the ceasefire for months now when the Russians and the Chinese and even the French have been demanding a ceasefire when the Arabs and the Palestinians have been demanding a ceasefire and the United States has been blocking a ceasefire now they're going for a partial ceasefire a pause for 6 weeks and they're lecturing the the rest of the region and certainly the Palestinians about the importance of a ceasefire I want to ask you about that uh issue of impunity that you brought up there we're reporting that an independent un investigation is now finding that Israel has committed crimes against humanity and war crimes this is the first time that there has been an in-depth report into the war on Gaza it is also accusing Palestinian arm groups of war crimes particularly on October the 7th with regard to the issue of impunity are we now seeing do you think the first stages that will eventually lead to some sort of accountability for what's been happening well certainly uh uh the building blocks of accountability have been um have been coming together right and clearly the pressure has has really been building up whether it's from the icj the ICC the UN Human Rights Council the human rights organization and so on so forth so there's clearly a momentum there and I think it's important to note that legally speaking yes and and I'm no legal scholar but I can certainly you know with with the simplest of logic and rational understand why the Human Rights Council and other groups such as the ICC would say both Hamas and Israel are carrying war crimes hamas's uh kidnapping of of hostage of of civilians is not uh illegal despite hamas's claim that it is it is not it is not to the spirit or letter of international humanitarian law you cannot simply uh kidnap uh uh hold hostages civilians uh and then basically stuff them in in in in civilian population of course the Palestinians say under the circumstances of what we gone through and so on so forth occupation we are defending themselves ourselves and we have a right to resist all that is true but that does not justify a war CRI now having said that that both Israel and Hamas are probably carrying uh or arguably carrying war crimes this a politically politically there's a big difference between the two legally both to the definition AR caric war crimes politically Hamas Jihad and other Islamic and other Palestinian groups are trying to liberate themselves and their land from decades long occupation and dispossession Israel is scanning war crimes in order to maintain its illegal occupation and racist system of aparted from The River To The Sea the second difference politically speaking is while Hamas is carries those uh crimes war crimes they are I'm sorry to use the Expression retail violence retail Bloodshed against the Israelis Israel's violence illegal violence against the Palestinians is definitely wholesale definitely genocidal definitely on on a great scale of a war crimes that ends up once again with a destruction of an entire infrastructure for an entire people where even the international court of justice says there's a plausible case for genocide whereby Israel is destroying a people as a whole or in part in Gaza certainly uh starving them certainly creating famine certainly cutting Aid certainly destroying their water and and and other civilian infrastructure certainly destroying their schools and universities and their homes their bakeries their clinics their kindergartens and so on and so forth well we're waiting to be bringing coverage of a press conference that's going to be held by US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin who's in Qatar as I mentioned he'll be joined by Prime Minister and foreign minister of Qatar Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman bin jasim Alani and of course when that happens Maran we're going to come back to you for your views on that thank you very much indeed make sure to subscribe to our channel to get
