Mustafa bouti is Secretary General at the Palestinian national initiative and joins us here on set in Doha good to speak to you um would you agree first of all that this was indeed an intentional targeted attack against Aid workers at World Central Kitchen in Gaza absolutely because the facts are clear you are talking about uh conoy of Aid workers who had coordinated with Israelis and the Israelis knew that they were passing through that area it was three separate cars and each of them was hit by a different air strike so clearly this was intentional and even it was planned and uh the arrogance in which Netanyahu commented on this on this matter is very clear he was talking about the death of these innocent people smiling and at the same time saying things like that happen in the war and at the same time denying that it was intentional without even investigating the matter so in reality I think this was an intentional attack which has very clear aim which is to dismiss uh International Aid workers to force them to to frighten them so that they would not come to Gaza and his main goal is to prevent aid from reaching the people in Gaza because his original and continuous goal is still the same to try to ethnically CL cleanse all the people of Gaza but maybe the death of six Internationals will bring some attention now by many countries to the fact that 1796 Aid workers Palestinian Aid workers were killed many of whom worked for international organizations 340 medical doctors nurses and health professionals of our colleagues were also killed and 40,000 Palestinians killed if we count those under the rebel M this is absolutely absolutely unacceptable it is an act of genocide what do you make of the world reaction to it so far do you feel that there this is a point this is a turning point no no no and I'm I'm so shocked that countries like Australia with all due respect Australia Britain Poland did not even condemn the attack for God's sake these are their citizens they didn't dare to condemn the attack of Israel and United States Representatives Mr blinkin he had the guts to say when he was discussing this matter that we must make sure that Israel has the ability to defend itself Israel is not defending itself Israel is attacking Palestinians and attacking Internationals and uh the spokesperson of the National Security Council also had the the American had the guts to say that we don't have proofs that it was intentional so they're already taking sides and they are already try trying to cover up for Israel and what we see here is a horrible double standard compare that with their behavior when Israel claimed without proving that some horaa workers cooperated with Hamas and immediately all these countries shut off funding of onoa come on this is the most Clear Proof of a very bad double standard that is followed by many Western governments and by doing so they are encouraging Israel to commit these crimes and encouraging Israel to be above the law and above international law this is on the same day or around the same 24-hour period that we also saw Israel targeting a diplomatic mission in Syria Iran's diplomatic Mission also taking moves to ban Al jazer within Israel stifling Free Speech a Cornerstone of democracy it seems that it is ramping up these efforts to push the International Community and yet we're still not hearing anything to stop it what is the dangers of it acting with such impunity the very big danger and immediate danger is that they will conduct this terrible massacre in RAF and they can do it and they will do it unless something happens immediately to impose sanctions on Israel and that would mean the largest massacre in modern history the other thing is that they will continue to try to push Palestinians out of Gaza into Sinai and this would be the worst First Act of ethnic cleansing there has to be immediate action and the only thing that will stop Israel is is sanctions sanctions have to be imposed on Israel including preventing supplies of military equipment and Military like Canada did and uh and uh and also taking other sanctions on isra look Israel is now not only killing people but also it is violating the United Nations security Council resolution it is violating the rules rulings of the international court of justice they don't care I think somebody should check the sanity of people like nanaho and his crowd I mean they're going uh totally out of control and uh I trust the people I so appreciate the people who are demonstrating every day pressuring their governments and that's what we need more pressure on governments to immediately take actions to sanction Israel to force it to stop this atrocity and this genocide as we have you here Mr bichi I wanted to ask you or take this opportunity to ask you about the Palestinians request for full un membership they are now asking for an April vote on that do you think first of all they'll get it and if so will it make any difference at this time uh it's good to get it because it's good to have a a recognition of Palestine as a state by the United Nations security Council of course because we had that in the general assembly already the question is what whether the security Council will will approve it and will the united states allow that or not but it wouldn't make a big difference actually and I am worried that this could be used as a substitute to stop this atrocity in Gaza that should not be acceptable this is not enough and uh that's why I say the most important thing now is to impose ceasefire to force Israel to have ceasefire to stop the genocide that is happening in Gaza and then enforce a real true process uh when they speak about a state they should say which state on which borders you can't have a state with all these settlements in the in the West Bank so that that's why I think when people speak about recognition or two-state solution I I don't take it as serious unless it is associated with demanding Israeli end of occupation since 1967 of all territories second demanding Israeli Seas of s activities and removal of settlements from occupied territories without these three conditions there will never be a Palestinian State stti very good to speak to you thank you for taking the time to come into the studio here in Doha now hundreds of Israelis have stormed barriers in West Jerusalem whilst protesting against prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's handling of the war on Gaza fighting broke out between demonstrators and police officers who had blocked entrances to the government headquarters and nyah's home families of captives being held in Gaza were amongst large crowds of people demanding early elections and a prisoner exchange deal it marks the fourth consecutive night of protests for 6 months we're fighting a war and losing it and I think the only way we can win the war is to have elections and to give the people the opportunity to choose again and to bring the hostages home and to bring the soldiers home and that's why I'm here let's bring in Rory Chalin now he's an occupied East Jerusalem so Rory we saw the mood turned somewhat ugly amongst demonstrators there on during this night of protests yeah we've just seen some of the footage there haven't we that shown on Israeli TV and shared on social media of protesters scuffling with police trying to break down barricades other pictures showing the uh groups of police trying to detain protesters and other protesters coming to defend them and scuffles breaking out there too now the protests themselves uh started on uh Sunday night uh and have been planned for four nights uh perhaps going on longer than that there is now a tent encampment uh in uh Western Jerusalem outside the knesset outside Benjamin nessah who's residence as well what do these people want well they hate Benjamin Netanyahu they want him out of office they want him to call uh early elections they also want to stop parliamentarians going on Passover recess in about a week's time saying that this is no time for parli Parliament to to be going on holiday essentially and the feelings are running very very high indeed I can read you a quote now from ANA zala who's the mother of Mata who was captured by Hamas on October 7th and taken into Gaza she says that Benjamin Netanyahu is a pharaoh who inflicts a plague upon us a Biblical reference there we will continue to pursue you we will burn the country we will shake the Earth you will not have a day and you will not have a night as long as my son has no day and no night you will not have it either a sign of how much hatred there is for Benjamin Netanyahu amongst those protesters indeed Rory but is there any sign that the government is feeling this pressure well it's certainly feeling the pressure because these protests are growing and they're getting bigger uh remember that there were big protests last year as well about these judicial reforms that Benjamin netanyahu's government pushed through and protests went on and royed the country for month after month after month the protesters are trying to reignite uh some of that momentum and pick up where that left off but Benjamin Netanyahu knows that if uh elections were called early he would most likely lose them he's deeply unpopular all the polls are saying that it's looking like a defeat for Benjamin Netanyahu at the next election people hold him responsible for the security failures that led to October the 7th so understandably from his perspective he said no way I'm not going to call early elections I'm staying where I am at the moment he says that it would be wrong to call Early elections at a time of War so it's difficult to see what the mechanism is at the moment by which protesters can force him out he doesn't feel I think under threat enough from the size of these protests to step down because of them the only other way that he might leave office right now is if his Coalition collapse if parts of uh the governing coalition from other parties uh left it and said that they're abandoning it they don't want him anymore and at the moment that Coalition is holding together okay Rory talin bring us the latest there from occupied East Jerusalem thanks thanks Rory
