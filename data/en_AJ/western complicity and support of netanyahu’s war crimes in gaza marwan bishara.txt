you're watching our reminder of our top stories this hour France has called for an immediate and doable truce in Gaza following the killing of one of its staff members in the strip he was killed in an air strike in the southern city of Rafa where Israeli attacks have intensified Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing more pressure from the families of those still being held captive in Gaza it follows The Accidental killing of three captives by the Israeli military and crowds have scrambled to get Aid at the Rafa Crossing between Gaza and Egypt the UN says hunger has spiraled across the strip in recent days going to bring in Maran Bashar Al jaz's senior political analyst let's talk about the situation that Benjamin Netanyahu is finding himself in at the moment it it would be easy to assume that there is growing pressure inside and out on Benjamin Netanyahu but the question of course is how much is he actually willing to respond to that we are hearing there is a possibility of negotiations or an exploration of possible negotiations by the the the head of mosad what's your your take on all of this what's your assessment of what's going on well let's start with the beginning that we have a prime minister the longest serving prime minister in Israel Benjamin Netanyahu he was indicted on a number of corruption charges he's basically a political Criminal come war criminal but he's certainly persistent uh he's a seasoned politician a political animal of sort and he's not easily swayed he's also supported by uh the most fanatical and the most fascistic uh Coalition in Israel's history and him and his uh fascist Coalition remain persistent about this war and its goals which is basically destroying Gaza and defeating Hamas because from the outset the Prime Minister and his president Mr Herzog and his defense minister Mr Galant made it clear that there is intent behind the war crimes behind the genocide the intent was that there are no Innocents in Gaza that the people in Gaza are Political Animals that should be slapped with Collective punishment to be starved to be denied electricity to be denied fuel to be denied medicine and so on so forth and for the past 10 weeks Natan who led the war against Gaza decimating it and now he is insistent that it will probably take two three months more of the same of the same basically rendering it unlivable the Americans as well as the British and the Germans are urging him not to take three months two months but you take two weeks three weeks of more of the same so let's not be mistaken about the Western position here the German British and American position has been for the past 10 weeks complicit in the war crimes in Gaza totally unconditionally supportive of Netanyahu and now the change of heart is not a change of position they're simply asking him not to make that genocide look so vulgar not to make it so embarrassing to their public opinion they wanted to be tidier a bit more attractive to their public opinion hence they asking him to phase out this intensive bombing of Gaza to something a bit more discriminate which begs the question why were they supporting 10 weeks of indiscriminate bombing in the wordss of the American president indiscriminate bombing why would Western leaders until today and moving forward continue to support Netanyahu in the indiscriminate decimation of Gaza hence Netanyahu while coming under some acrobatic verbal pressure of some sort but he's not coming under any real pressure whatsoever because and I just finish with that the Americans continue to supply him with weapons they compl to supp to supply him with money and they continue to supply him with political cheat including at the United Nations I want to ask you about the pictures we've seen of of Aid trucks going into Gaza through the the the Rafa Crossing um we've been talking for a long time about the the the incredible pressures and frustrations um and risks to to health that people in Gaza are facing because of the bombardment but also because of the decimation of the infrastructure and there's an argument for saying that the pictures that we're seeing where people have been rushing towards these trucks desperate to get hold of that a is is an indication of just the kind of of desperation that people are facing it is incredible unprecedented in recent modern times for people to be subjective to the kind of uh war crimes to the to the collective punishment that Gaza has been subjected to we've read in Western reports comparison been made with Second World War Allied bombing of German cities over two years with German Nazi bombings of British cities over two years and that doesn't even begin to compare with the Israeli bombing of Gaza and the result has been the total Destruction of the Civil infrastructure for 2.2 2.3 million Palestinians which means we're not just talking about starvation now we're not just talking about the lack of medical treatment we're starting to talk about diseases and when you start talking about disease in a people that crammed into the most intolerable density in refugee camps with no infrastructure whatsoever we are talking about mass murder now and if this is going to continue for another whether two weeks or two months this is going to mean the inhalation of gazans and until and unless they run for their life either to the Mediterranean Sea or across the border with Sinai to to Egypt which means ethnic cleansing which was the original objective of this Netanyahu government the ethnically cleansing of Gaza so now we are between basically two nightmares one nightmare is the utter breakdown of the entire possibility of life in Gaza or mass ethnic cleansing and once again the nany government is doing the evil work but it is today and moving forward supported by Major Western Powers this is a dark moment in modern history because those are democracies they answer to their people that means their people are just as responsible CU let's all remember this whole thing started by the Israeli leaders saying that all Gaza is responsible what Hamas did in October 7 which means the other side of the coin is that Israel and Israelis are responsible for what happened since October 7th meaning the war crimes and the genocide which also means that Western public opinion that Western populations that that their governments are supporting this genocide are also complicit in the war crimes in Gaza M bashara thank you very much indeed
