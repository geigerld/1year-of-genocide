we begin in Gaza where homeless grieving and terrified Palestinians are hoping that the latest International efforts will bring about a ceasefire the political leader of Hamas ishah is expected in the Egyptian Capital KIRO to review a proposal that was put forward in Paris over the weekend a temporary halt in fighting could allow for more Aid deliveries into Gaza while more Israeli captives could be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners on the ground though there's been no letup in fighting rescue efforts are on going after another night of Israeli bombardments across the strip in a moment we'll go to Rory Chalin he's an occupied East Jerusalem for us to get Israeli reaction on proposals for a ceasefire first let's go live to hany Mahmud he's in Rafa in southern Gaza hany has news of possible ceasefire agreement reached where you are what are people saying about yes melan well people are uh looking forward to hearing more constructive reports about The a possible ceasefire and a possible end to the ongoing war on on the Gaza Strip they're looking into an end all hostilities and and into the masing of Palestinians as it's happening right now now despite the ongoing bombing campaigns within the past two days that has intensified across the G STP mainly in KH Unis and the northern part of the Gaza Strip people are still hopeful that those emerging reports started to come out within the past two days are going in fact to lead into an agreement between the Palestinians particularly fighting groups and Hamas mainly and the Israeli side that will include not only in the war and an immediate ceasefire increase in the humanitarian uh aid but also release of all Palestinian prisoners including those who were detained from Gaza the the northern part as the war was as the war still continuing including miners in exchange of course for the release of the Israeli captives inside the the Gaza STP people are hopeful they're looking forward to having that in fact here all day long we get more questions from people who are passing by our sites and and just judging from the the number of questions and the level of of of questionings that we get is that they are eager as they are growing tired exhausted they traumatized and they want an end to their displacement they don't want it to be permanent they want to be able to go back to their homes in the northern part in Gaza c as they have been displaced for four months right now and it's it's about time they said as we hear from them to go back and to look after their family mainly provide them with with the most secret thing they have been entrusted on providing them which is protection and safety as so far they are lacking any sense of security and safety as they are squeezed in the overcrowded part of the gas STP in in Rafa City yeah it's no surprise that they are desperate for a ceasefire because there's been again more overnight Israeli raids across Gaza at talk us through the situation on the ground the aftermath particularly at the hospitals which have been under siege yes well that's exactly the torture before death and that's what have people have been frustrated about despite the the talks and the emerging reports about a possible deal between the Palestinians and the the Israeli side is just the they seeing more intense bombing campaign and particularly around the city of Han unun and around vicinity of hospitals for the third time Hospital have been stormed by this really military the large deal of the facilities and the properties were severely damaged more people are being injured and more people killed inside the the facility including displaced Palestinians and and employed security guard employed by the Palestinian Rick Crescent the hospital in a statement said that they're dealing with a more than 10 critically injured displ Palestinians inside the the facility including since the past 12 hours almost 12 people were killed inside the facility the the the situations around Naser Hospital not are no different there is more fighting going on more bombing to the vicinity of the hospital and its facilities the courtyard is mainly taken over by attack drones quad capts that are preventing any movements inside the hospital in addition the the fact that it it's an intense finding most of the medical staff have have has already left the hospital so we're talking about large number of injuries of people inside the facility but a small and insufficient number of medical staff that is unable to provide any sufficient medical attention whatsoever in the Central Area also reports of more residential buildings being targeted in an and Al ra camp and this is the pattern we've been seeing since the beginning of the war we have refugee camps particularly in the central area and the northern part repeatedly attacks and with with large amount of Firepower and attack aggressively impact okay thank you for that hanim Mahmud there for us in southern Gaza let's go now to Rory challeng he's an occupied eism for us Rory so a lot of debate in the last 24 hours or so about a possible ceasefire deal would what are you hearing where you are yeah it's worth a recap isn't it because the humanitarian and the military aspects of this proposed deal are kind of overlaid by many tears of politics so let's go through them hamas's position is that they will only agree to a deal which ultimately sees an end to the War uh an Israeli military pull out of Gaza an enter the siege of Gaza and a serious uh prisoner exchange process Benjamin Netanyahu says that he won't agree to a deal that ends the war so the war from his perspective will go on the Israeli military will stay in Gaza and as he puts it they will not release thousands of terrorists but Netanyahu is under huge pressure from the far right flanks of his own governing Coalition and particularly it's Amar Ben gavier the national security minister does not trust Netanyahu over any deal thinks that he's trying to pull what he's calling a goat Clause kind of sneak his way to something that the far rights will not find acceptable and he says that he is willing to pull out of the governing Coalition if Netanyahu signs up to something that releases thousands and thousands of what Ben uh Ben Vehicles murderers essentially so into all of this Wades y laid the opposition leader main opposition leader who says that he is willing to offer Netanyahu a safety net not to save Netanyahu himself but to save the captives he believes that it's the captives that should be kept at the top of everyone's agenda here and that that's the most important thing getting those captives out of Gaza everyone here is setting their red lines everyone is is talking to their own particular audiences there is no easy solution uh and as we go forward if we get to a deal it's likely that many of these red lines are going to be quietly forgotten if this is anything like the previous deal back in uh the Autumn of last year then we might not find out the details of it until very late in the day possibly only once the actual exchanges and the ceasefire uh has begun because nothing is really written in stone yet indeed uh a slightly different uh matter there's been more Israeli criticism of unra the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency uh what does the Prime Minister had to say about it again yeah we know as we have done for a long time that Netanyahu is no fan of anra this relief agency that basically looks after the humanitarian Affairs of of many many hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza there has been uh this campaign against anra uh the uh release of information showing that anra employees as the Israeli say were uh members of or at least assisting in the Hamas attacks of October the 7th so Netanyahu most recently has been briefing ambassadors of the UN who have come here and he's basically mean telling them that unra needs to be disbanded says that the mission has to end anr's mission he says that anra is self-perpetuating I.E it keeps alive the the Palestinian refugee issue therefore meaning that the agency that looks after Palestinian refugees is essential he says that anra has helped South Africa in its case against Israel at the international court of justice and as we hear now from Netanyahu in this particular sound bite he's also saying that anat self has been riddled essentially with there are other agencies in the UN there are other agencies in the world they have to replace onra onra is totally infiltrated with Kamas it has been in the service of Kamas in its schools and in many other things I say this with great regret because we hope that there would be uh an objective and constructive body to offer aid but is not just reserving criticism for unra he's also criticizing the entirety of the UN which he thinks has been unfair in its treatment of Israel he says that there are parts of the world he names Iran and Yemen where there is as he puts it savagery and aggression and that therefore the un's dealing with Israel and its issues with the Palestinian territories is biased okay thank you for that Rory challenge there for us and occupy the East Jerusalem
