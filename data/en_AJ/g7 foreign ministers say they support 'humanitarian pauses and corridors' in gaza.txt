you're watching Al we're going to take you to Tokyo for US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is speaking at the G7 fign ministers meeting Minister for Japan's leadership during this hisor year from G7 the G7 has strengthened its role as the steering committee of the world's Advanced democracies demonstrating unprecedented Unity of purpose and unity of action on the issues that are defining the 21st century and at another moment of intense challenge for the Free World our security and our values um G7 Unity is stronger and more important than ever our first Focus here in Tokyo was the crisis in the Middle East uh yesterday evening I had an opportunity to brief my colleagues on my travel through the region as well as extensive engagements by President Biden and our entire National Security team uh the G7 ministers reaffirmed our staunch support for Israel's right and obligation to to defend itself and seek to ensure the attacks of October 7th can never happen again in accordance with International humanitarian law we had in-depth discussions about the steps that we are taking to address urgent needs on the ground we all agreed that humanitarian pauses would Advance key objectives to protect Palestinian civilians to increase the sustained flow of humanitarian assistance to allow our citizens and foreign Nationals to exit and to facilitate the release of hos ages I briefed my colleagues about my conversations with Israeli leaders on pauses and on concrete steps to minimize harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to stop extremist violence in the West Bank Israel has repeatedly told us that there is no going back to October 6th before the barbaric attacks by Hamas we fully agree as we work with Israel to ensure this we also are working in the region to deter broader threats to our partners and to our friends as the president has said to anyone seeking to take advantage of the crisis in Gaza and spread conflict to other theaters don't all of us want to end this conflict as soon as possible and meanwhile to minimize civilian suffering but as I discussed with my G7 colleagues those calling for an immediate ceasefire have an obligation to explain how to address the unacceptable result it would likely bring about Hamas left in place with more than 200 hostages with the capacity and stated intent to repeat October 7th again and again and again ultimately the only way to ensure that this crisis never happens again is to begin setting the conditions for durable peace and security and to frame our diplomatic efforts now with that in mind the United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians uh from Gaza not now not after the war no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends no attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza no reduction in the territory of Gaza we must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank we must also work on the affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace these must include the Palestinian people's voices and aspirations at the center of post crisis governance in Gaza it must include Palestinian Le governance uh and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority and it must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction in Gaza and a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in states of their own with equal measures of security Freedom opportunity and dignity even as we focus intensely on addressing these urgent challeng challenges we believe that the time is now to start the conversation about the future not tomorrow not after the war today because identifying the longer term objectives and a pathway to get there will help shape our approach to addressing immediate needs uh I know it's hard to look ahead in this moment it is the aim of terrorists to sew chaos to destroy hope to destroy lives and through human despair grow their ranks and hijack the political future of the Palestinians we cannot and we will not let them succeed today we also focused on our enduring support for Ukraine the G7 has led the world in galvanizing and sustaining that support and as we told foreign minister CBA today Ukraine can count on us to put Ukraine on a solid foundation for the next year we must help Ukraine do four things at once first keep fighting to win back its territory second build a world-class military force to ensure maximum deterrence for the long term and make clear to President Putin that he cannot and will not Outlast Ukraine and he cannot and will not Outlast all of Ukraine's supporters 28 countries have made concrete commitments to join us in this effort of building a Ukrainian fighting force for the future third Kickstart economic recovery and growth and bring more hope more opportunity to the Ukrainian people and fourth accelerate the reform process to speed Ukraine's path to the European Union and to attract investment all of these steps are designed to help Ukraine stands strongly on its own two feet we also discussed at length the indopacific and steps we're taking together to contend with challenges to our shared vision of a free open prosperous secure and resilient region uh we spoke about the PRC we agreed on the importance of working constructively on shared challenges but also being clear and direct with China on our different differences we'll continue to Der risk our economies to strengthen our resilience to push back on economic coercion we'll also continue to stand up to China over its actions in the South and East China Seas we of course oppose unilateral or coercive efforts to change the status quo with Taiwan our conversation today demonstrated an unprecedented degree of alignment among the G7 on our approach to China we also discussed the dprk's provocative actions and missile launches and dangerous dprk Russia military cooperation we're deeply concerned about what Russia is providing Pyongyang in return for the weapons and Munitions that it's getting from pongyang will continue to push for the full implementation of all relevant un Security Council resolutions and commitments to uphold the global non-proliferation order a major theme throughout our meetings was how we can leverage our full economic political and development strength to deepen ties with developing countries and deliver for people around the world through the partnership for Global infrastructure and investment we're mobilizing $600 billion in high quality transparent infrastructure projects worldwide by 2027 we're unlocking hundreds of billions of new lending capacity for the World Bank the international monetary fund for things like climate resilience public health and other key priorities we're also working to shape a more inclusive International System supporting reform of the UN Security Council making the International Financial system more responsive to the needs of low and middle- inome countries bringing more voices to the table here at the G7 as for example with today's meeting with Central Asian Partners uh later today I'll travel to the Republic of Korea and then on to India to our most important Partners in the indopacific even as we're engaged intensively on the Urgent challenges of this moment the United States remains focused on advancing the interest of the American people in every part of the world on issues that matter in their lives at this inflection point in the struggle to protect the international order we are standing strong for our vision of a more free secure open and prosperous world and we do not stand alone we built extraordinary coalitions with allies and partners who carry their share of the burden and we leave this G7 meeting stronger and more united in meeting the challenges of today thank you with that I'll take some questions first question goes to Courtney Courtney McBride with bloom thank you good evening Mr secretary um Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that his government would maintain security control of Gaza for quote an indefinite period end quote how do you reconcile th those comments to previous statements by both the US and Israeli governments posing a reoccupation of Gaza and then uh you addressed this a bit but um other G7 members have expressed support for a full ceasefire uh in the Israel Hamas War um while the US continues to support just these humanitarian pauses um and I'm just wondering did you convince the other members of the US position or is this uh joint statement language just the the sort of minimal consensus area thank you thanks Courtney so I think we've been very clear from day one that when it comes to postconflict governance in Gaza um a few things are are clear and necessary one uh Gaza cannot be uh continue to be run by Hamas um uh that simply invites a repid ition of October 7th uh and Gaza uses a place from which to launch terrorist attacks uh it's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza um now the reality is that there may be uh a need for some transition period uh at the end of the conflict but it is imperative that um the Palestinian people uh be Central to uh to governance uh in uh in Gaza and in the West Bank as well uh and that again uh we we don't see uh a reoccupation and what I've heard from Israeli leaders is that they have no intent to reoccupy Gaza and retake control of Gaza so the only question is uh are is there some transition period uh that might be necessary and what might be the mechanisms uh that you could put in place for that uh to make sure that there is security uh but we're very clear on no reoccupation just as we're very clear on uh no displacement of the Palestinian population uh and um as as we've said before uh we need to see and get to uh in effect Unity of governance when it comes to Gaza and the West Bank and ultimately to uh to a Palestinian State uh when it comes to the um the G7 statement um and um particularly with regard to the question of ceasefire uh actually we found real unity in the G7 on uh in this moment um on that question I think the communic very accurately reflects what we discussed and what G7 Partners believe for the next question Sasaki Akiko with TV Tokyo thank you for this opportunity and thank you for coming to Japan so you met with prime minister Kida yesterday and what Ro could Japan play in the conflict in the Middle East and what is the expectation of Japan in this conflict and also uh can uh these fire agreement be leged between Israel and Gaza and also what do you think is the final goal of this conflict good thank you first uh I was uh very appreciative of um being able to see prime minister kashida uh and of course to spend time extensive time with uh with the foreign minister uh and I can tell you first we very much appreciate Japan's engagement in helping to deal with the conflict between Israel and Hamas and the situation in Gaza I very much welcome the foreign Minister's trip to the region uh which was important as well as her unequivocal condemnation of Terror um the call for the release of hostages and the announcement by Japan of $75 million in humanitarian assistance uh we had uh a very productive discussion with uh the foreign minister and I um about um important uh vital issues like um what needs to be done to minimize civilian casualties to increase the flow even more of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and to prevent the spread of the conflict to to other places and I think the United States and Japan are very clearly aligned um on what needs to be done and what we're working to do uh do together uh as um as I said earlier in terms of the future I think there are a few very basic things that um everyone would want to achieve one is that there can't be a return to the situation the status quo before October 7th where uh Gaza can be used as a platform to launch the most horrific terrorist attacks that anyone can imagine um and at the same time it's vitally important that um Palestinian aspirations uh for governing themselves for uh being the ones to decide their own Futures are um are realized uh and so we have to work to both of those things at the same time and that's what we're trying to do for the next question Nik ching with boa good afternoon Mr secretary how is lunch do you enjoy love kushima Seafood we we did yes we had uh uh excellent um excellent Seafood here uh and um I can tell you not just at lunch I think last night as well uh and I commend it to everyone but I have more questions Oh I thought that was it no I thought but um regarding US President Joe Biden's pled meeting with the Chinese president cin ping next week is the United States heading towards a substantial change in its relationship with the People's Republic China where the US serve Fukushima seafoot during ape and separately if I may do you have anything on starting talks on a reliable arrangement with the Chinese government to prevent artificial intelligence involvement in the decision making for nuclear command and control as suggested by some China observers including Henry casing thank you so iy first much as I'd like to I really can't speak to the menu at Apec It is Well above my pay grade um so stay tuned uh we'll see uh first I should say this we are planning for a constructive meeting between the leaders we're still working on those plans um I think both sides have acknowledged the importance of of leader level channels um in managing the the relationship and uh we both agree that um we have an obligation the United States and China to responsibly manage the relationship and that really uh in in in many ways um starts and finishes with leader level engagement so we've been working toward this meeting since um my trip to Beijing this this past summer uh there are a number of areas and issues upon which we um hope to make progress uh as well as continuing to to manage the uh places where we have real differences uh as you know foreign minister wangi was just uh just in Washington uh we had detailed uh constructive conversations both about uh areas of potential cooperation but also about the the places where we have real uh disagreements and um I think uh we were able to speak very clearly very candidly uh with each other and that too uh is very important when it comes to um the discussions that uh that our leaders have um so beyond that I can't get into the specific issues that they would uh uh they would discuss in um in in any such meeting um I can say as a general principle uh for us that when it comes to artificial intelligence um that we believe that um there artificial intelligence should not be in the loop or making the decisions about um uh how and when a nuclear weapon is used uh that uh very much reflects our our strongly held view in our policy but as to what uh the the leaders would discuss I um not in a place where I can talk about that now uh we're still working on um on the meeting uh and working on the the agenda for any meeting thanks and the final question goes to fuchigami takayuki with Y Murray hi secretary good evening welcome to Japan thank you uh since the hamus attack on Israel uh the US has been required to respond on a three front as you mentioned the Indo Pacific Ukraine and the Middle East so you are traveling around the world uh to respond to these issues uh frankly how tough is it and even in the midst of all these uh please tell us again how important it is for us to focus on Indo Pacific well first of all thank you for reminding me where I am now in all seriousness I have to tell you um that um I I always welcome any opportunity to come to Japan um it's almost no matter the the situation for me it's a pleasure to be here to work with uh uh with my Japanese colleagues we um so value the relationship the partnership uh the allyship that we have with Japan and um it really is safe to say without contradiction that's never been stronger so in many ways it's um always reassuring to be here even and maybe even especially in times of challenge because of that of that strong partnership um more broadly look I can tell you that um we are determined and we are uh as we would say uh running and chewing gum at the same time um the indopacific is the critical region for our future uh as I mentioned just um a little over a week ago foreign minister wongi was uh was in Washington for extensive Ive uh discussions with with me with uh National Security advisor Jake Sullivan with uh with President Biden as well um and we're working uh as we just discussed on a meeting between the leaders uh at Apec um we of course will be spending the entire week next week with colleagues countries from uh from Apec again a demonstration of our intense focus on the on the Indo Pacific from here I'm going on to Korea and then going on to India again further evidence of the fact that we're very focused on the Indo Pacific and will remain so um couple of weeks ago I was testifying before our uh congress with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about the supplemental budget request that the president has made of Congress uh the extra funds that we need to um do very important things uh and an important component of that request are additional funds for our work in the Indo Pacific so all of this is um I I think very compelling and clear evidence of our Focus uh and it's uh vitally important that even as we're dealing with uh the a real crisis in in Gaza in the Middle East uh we're also not only um able but we're we're we're fully engaged in um all of the interests that we have in the Indo Pacific thank you very much thanks everyone you're watching ala we've been bringing you live coverage of a press conference that's been held by the US Secretary of State Antony blinkin it's in Tokyo and it's following a meeting of foreign ministers um from members of the G7 uh countries they've been covering a a a significant amount of ground he did say there had been an unprecedented Unity of purpose and unity of action amongst G7 members they were talking about a wide range of subjects predominantly the situation in the Middle East but also talking about the development of Ukraine the situation in Ukraine also the indopacific situ situation dealings with China but and the US and also in fact artificial intelligence and its impact possibly on nuclear weapons controls I want to bring in Katrina Yu who's our correspondent who's been following that from Tokyo um couple of things that that I noticed there was he would was stressing the fact that the G7 had agreed on demands for humanitarian pauses to allow in humanitarian Aid and the race of captives and no attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza what have you been picking up on Katrina well I think the most Salient point is that while the G7 has shown Unity here and there has been no agreement on a ceasefire but the group has managed to agree on a humanitarian pause which would allow for humanitarian corridors for much needed food water health services and access for humanitarian workers into the Gaza Strip so he also spoke about some concrete steps that the group group have agreed to to minimize harm of civilians although no details at all and no mention as to whether the G7 will be applying any pressure or urging Israel to minimize civilian casualties actually I was quite surprised at the the lack of mention of of of Israel At All by blinkin here he said that they would work towards stopping extremist violence on the West Bank uh and he said that he would warn that the G7 had had warning for any other countries any other groups that were looking to expand this conflict Beyond uh the Gaza Strip now very interestingly as you mentioned Lincoln mentioned that there were some bottom lines that the G7 agreed to let me just list them here no forcible displacement of the Palestinian people in Gaza uh which interesting we know is definitely happening there no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism and no blockade or Siege of Gaza and no reduction in the territory of Gaza now what was very interesting also he said that the G7 agreed that Gaza should be governed longterm by the Palestinian people there was some mention of the Palestinian Authority he made it very clear uh that this would not be a situation uh which would be an occupation by Israel now that seems to contradict what we've heard from Netanyahu who has been saying that there will be a security responsibility uh possibly by Israel once this conflict is over and blinkin was asked about that and he said that he wouldn't agree and that was not what the G7 agreed to but he did say that there could be a transition period so obviously that allows for possible uh temporary Presence by Israel there he said uh answering a question about whether the group had agreed to a ceasefire considering some of the members had raised a ceasefire and had voted for a ceasefire previously at the United Nations Anthony blinkin simply said that those calling for a ceasefire had the responsibility of explaining how a ceas fly could happen without allowing Hamas essentially to regroup and repeat the actions of October 7 Katrina thank you very much that's Katrina you bringing us up to date from Tokyo let's bring in tomamu he's a professor of public policy Doha Institute for Graduate Studies he's been with us over the last few hours or so uh let's come back to that point that Katrina was making where Secretary of State blinkin referred to um the Palestinian control essentially of both Gaza and the West Bank that it must be T the two must be tied together that obviously invites questions about the role of the Palestinian in authority and and what of any situation it could find itself in and even if Palestinians would be willing to allow that happen um Rob um how do I start I mean um for sure Palestinians were not present there at this conference uh nor what they think or their opinions are nor even what the palestin leadership wants this is blinkin uh and netanyahu's narrative uh being more or less circulated through this conference um uh the Palestinian president even the Palestinian president mmud Abbas we haven't he him personally talking about a rule for the PA in Gaza we have heard about some reports circulating but these were all reports coming out from different media agencies but the main thing here is that again it's it's and it's like history repeating itself it's the Americas and Palestinians deciding on on on on their behalf how how should Palestinian live what's work best and what doesn't work best for Palestinian you mean the Americans and and Israelis sorry yeah and Israelis and and and and and as if as if they're in control of of Palestinian lives and and and Inspirations and and whatever Palestinians want and it's again it's this colonial mentality it's it's and it's sad to see especially I mean the Americans are repeting the same mistake mistakes again Iraq Afghanistan and now they think they can subjugate an entire nation and also to decide what's good and what's bad for it without be without having any presence of a Palestinian in this conference or a Palestinian view in this conference a Legit View so again it's it's I'm I'm I'm just astonished I mean I understand also what's this G7 uh the context of this of this conference I mean and it's the US again disillusion unable to digest the fact that the world has moved Beyond G7 G7 is not controlling the world anymore uh there's a multipolar word an emergent one we have the bricks we have China we have Russia we have the three nations of the South and we have seen the UN the UN is the center of this it should not be the G the G7 that takes decision of this matters the UN we need an empowered un and this not the G G7 but again it's it's again the same Colonial mindset they're they cannot get Beyond it and just admit that the world has changed and they have to respect the other uh voices the other views of the world the other parties the Big World the very diverse world we live in which by large supports Palestine and Palestinian aspirations to be independent to live free side by side by Israel but again what we have seen is I mean I I this is not blink this is the Israeli foreign minister speaking not blinkin so blinkin has to really step aside and speaks on the American people behalf not on Israel's behalf because we think bigger of the US Us's Rule and engagement in this process it should not be an ambassador for Israel it should be an ambassador for all a mediator for all not for Israel and again another failure for blinkin and for the US diplomacy under this Administration it brings us also back to the this ongoing discussion that we've had over the last few hours about um the the Benjamin netanyahu's uh comment about the the security the maintenance of security within Gaza at the same time the US and is saying we have no intention of allowing Israel to be an occupying force in Gaza but it's difficult to understand how Israel could have a military presence inside Gaza to demilitarize the the the the strip without actually effectively occupying it Rob I think because yes they talk about it but they they really don't know how to implement it that's the thing I mean if you look at okay good news relatively I mean giving the the scale of the the crime here B news at least he's committed to no forceable displacement externally or internally we know internally yes it already happened there is uh forceable displacement internally massive one inside the Gaza Strip I hope they don't it doesn't become external to Egypt or other countries so let's see if if they're they're sincere about committing if the Americans are sincere about committing to this goal uh uh you know no blades find yes at least a recognition that part of this problem the real cause is the blockade Gaza has been under severe military Israeli blockade for the last 15 years so okay it's an indication that yes they might find a way to uh to to allow Gaza to live freely to to develop freely without any blades but I think again is is how the how I mean you need a partner you need the Palestinian and the Palestinian is fat and Hamas and the PLO and independent people Palestinians are not a tank or a building or an object you can move from X to Y they need to engage with Palestinians and so far again it's history repeating itself it's deification in Iraq they think they can demolish ham topple it down and and and get rid of Hamas you can't you can't so again I'm just saddened to hear these positions and I'm also and I understand that even most of G7 countries also they are uh supporting a Seas fire not a humanitarian POS it's only the Americans and Israelis who want these humanitarian poses which means that they want to prolong the war allow it to happen to come in but they they don't want a ceasefire they're not ready yet to engage in a ceasefire and then a political discussion on the on the future of Gaza tamarud we appreciate it thank you very much indeed
