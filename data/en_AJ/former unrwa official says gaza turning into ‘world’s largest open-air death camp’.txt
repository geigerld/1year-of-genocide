let's now speak to Chris gunis who's the former Chief spokesperson for the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine unra uh he's joining us from London thank you so much for being with us we heard gaza's Health Ministry say today that in just a few hours many hospitals across the strip will stop operating because fuel in their generators will have run out and this is coming at a crucial time when we're seeing so many more casualties from these Israeli air strikes you know this territory very well well how how much help is left really how much resources are left to help those who are in need right now well make no mistake Gaza is being transformed as we speak from what a former British prime minister once called the world's largest open air prison into the world's largest open air death camp and to answer your questions specifically Gaza is staring into an abyss fuel which is what what will keep the water plant the pumping station open that has run out so water the basic element of life is really not available to 2.2 million people as a question of as a matter of direct political Choice the Israeli defense minister made it very clear that the blockade of Gaza would be absolute we know that about 150 trucks have been Le in since the 21st of October it is not enough and what we're seeing now is not just a catastrophe but a catastrophe of choice why aren't more a trucks being led in I beg your pardon why aren't more Aid trucks being led in what's of course there's a bombing but well that that is a very good question and the real question is why isn't more pressure being put on Israel to allow more Aid trucks in at the moment the UN is saying that a 100 trucks a day is what they need actually before this present round of fighting unra was taking in 500 trucks a day now I've actually been through the raff of Crossing it's one single Lane in One Direction and one single Lane in another and Israel bombed it in the early days of this conflict what we need to do is open What's called the Kum Shalom crossing point which is like a huge industrial multi-lane trans shipment Point into Gaza and that would allow the necessary volumes of Aid to get through but unless and until that happens I'm afraid we're going to start seeing waterborne diseases we're going to start seeing communicable diseases we're going to start seeing forget you know not just the the women and the babies who need this um hospital care but we're going to see Ordinary People in the streets starting to die and that in my view is completely unconscionable we need to get 500 trucks a day as unra was doing before this violence into Gaza you talked about the Rafa Crossing uh Mr Gunners and there was a glimmer of hope earlier today when we saw some injured people leave Gaza uh through the Rafa Crossing to get into Egypt how how much relief does opening that b uh Crossing bring even if to a limited number of people I mean it's infinitely small and so so below what is actually needed we need complete and unhindered humanitarian access nothing short of that is going to avoid the looming catastrophe and let no world leader whoever they may be say they did not know the world has seen and and what we're seeing arguably is the start of a genocide I know there's been talked about genocide and I'm not saying there is necessarily a genocide but it's an obligation on all signatories to the genocide convention to prevent genocide and this kind of mass displacement which we may see is pre genocidal and we have to stop it we have to have full humanitarian access into and out of the Gaza Street Mr gnus thank you so much for talking to us Chris gnus is the former Chief spokesperson for unra the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine thank you for your time my pleasure
