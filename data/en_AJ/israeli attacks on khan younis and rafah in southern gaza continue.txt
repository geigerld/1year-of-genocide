overnight strikes injured Palestinians were taken to hospital KH Unice has become the focus of Israel's offensive where its ground forces have been battling Palestinian Fighters small children are among those killed in Israel's bombardment a Palestinian journalist saw a mother holding her daughter killed in an air strike at least 25,000 other Palestinians have died in three and a half months of Israel's war on Gaza nasal hospital is the largest health facility still functioning in southern Gaza IT Supplies though are running critically low we spoke to Dr Ahmed al- mrai he's the head of the plastic surge in Burns Department there as a surgeon here that the Israeli are fighting children and woman innocent people yeah all all all officials are civilians man most of them children women civilians they are killing you know families children you know civilians every day we I I told you um how many of us have to die really every day we have hundreds of these innocent people are passing away I don't know I don't know how many days do we have to go with this really situation everywhere patients is scattered here here at the hospital they need key they need care they they need proper food they need clean water they need uh how to say they need everything they were were they were bombing all over around the the hospital I I guess you already seen this bombing yes uh the situation here at NAS hospital now became very difficult as you know many of uh evacuated people already left the hospital and many of medical personnel now they couldn't attend the hospital and this put a a lot of pressure over our heads and over our shoulders since we have to compensate and work more more more and more and more on Friday I took my family to secure them and in ra I was trying to find one thing actually to put my family and come back to ner I couldn't find a place in Rafa I couldn't find a tent actually to put my family it is very populated area and can you imagine I brought my family back to Nas and I'm I'm staying at NAS to face my fate whatever it will cost I'll be here at NAS with my family there is no place to go to go there is no safe place and ra is populated area no clean water no food nothing there even I couldn't find a tent for my family there can you imagine that so I brought my family back to the hital let's go to Han Mahmud who was L For Us in Rafa in southern Gaza hany as that doctor described a pretty desperate situation in the South and in and around kanun tell us what's been happening yes indeed and perhaps the the most accurate uh way to describe what's going on in right now is more of death and Destruction for more than a month now kanun has been under heavy bombardment this particular city was described and designated the initial weeks of the uh of the war as a safe zone for evacuees and displace Palestinians from the northern part of Gaza City and they've been shouldering uh in uh the courtyard of Naser hospital and other parts of hunis including the eastern part the western part of the city uh since the beginning of the war is now the very particular City described as safe zone is now a scene of Devastation and and suffering and further civilian casualties and more displacement as the Israeli military pushed deeper into the City and within the vicinity of Naser hospital and the Doctor Who was speaking this is not the first time we hear doctors describing the situation inside the hospital and the situation of their families who are unable to provide a a a proper shelter for them and protect them from the horror of this ongoing War the vast majority of them have their families with them Sheltering inside the hospital they have a duty to do to keep providing the medical intervention necessary for injuries but as the Situation's getting worse and there's a surge in the the bombings and indeed there is an intense bombing campaign going on not only within the vicinity of the hospital but now further the western part of the city around hospital and within the vicinity of an academic institution the largest public university across the Gaza Street with the Ala University where thousand of Palestinian literally are sh have been Sheltering inside the buildings of the university and in the campus where they set up their tents for weeks now they found themselves now caught in the under this heavy a bombardment and they don't have a place to go to there is literally no safe place little no safe Corridor for them to leave the area uh the area is being bombed by land by air and by sea with attack drones everywhere hovering across Han Unis shooting at every moving object there so far 12 people have been killed as a result of these attacks by the uh by the drones by the quad capters drone in the area there people who have are trapped inside their buildings with family members who are have been injured or critically or critically injured have been killed inside the the hospital it's just the fact that the city is now is effectively separated from the remaining parts of the of the gri makes the conditions very difficult for people it's hard for people to evacuate now we're looking at very very dark days within the coming days as the situation gets worse by the hour hanim Mahmud there for us live in Rafa in southern Gaza
