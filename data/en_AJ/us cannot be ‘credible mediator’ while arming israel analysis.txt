talks have been held in Cairo to try and reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza Hamas has demanded that Israel be bound by the terms of the proposal put forth by Joe Biden on July the 2nd in a statement the group says we confirm our Readiness to implement what was agreed upon in order to achieve the interests of our people and stop the aggression against them we stressed in Cairo the necessity that any agreement include a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and must include the freedom for residents to return to their home for Relief and reconstruction and a captive prisoner exchange let's take this on with Ramy Cory who's a distinguished fellow at the American University of beut joins us now from Long Island in New York Ramy great deal to discuss here first up these talks the SE far our talks where now for them given that neither Hamas nor Israel have agreed to any compromises presented by mediators what next well Hamas agreed to the compromises that were put forth by Biden in July 2 and after that Netanyahu and Israel kept adding new conditions which most people now realize is a delaying tactic just to keep talking talking talking and the Arab world has gone through a really critical phase in the last couple of years uh which is to recognize that constantly going into meetings to discuss new ideas and new compromises and new ceasefires and things that it's getting the Arab world nowhere where and the epitome of this was the Oslo Accords of 1993 where the Palestinians made all kinds of sacrifices and concessions and got nothing in return so Hamas represents an aspect of this and his ba represents an aspect of this which is to stop playing games created by American mediators who are at the same time the the funders and the military providers and diplomatic Protectors of Israel which is carrying out the genocide so you can't be a credible negotiator mediator while you're also one party to the genocide so the Hamas is taking this stand now they agreed to the July two proposals and this is something that they're hoping the Israelis will also um come back to and say all right let's start with this and see what happens later of course the AL backdrop to this Remy is the the escalation and agression on the Lebanese Israeli border well this has been going on for years and it escalated obviously since October last year but this the stit forat attack process has been happening uh really since 2006 and the um important Point here is to see that both sides have pretty much played by those rules um and now it's escalated beyond that the scale of the attacks uh that Israel has carried out the assassination of fur in Beirut weeks ago this is qualitatively different sobah is responding and hisbah is doing the same thing Hamas is doing which is saying we're not going to play your game uh a game that is set by the colonial Powers uh and force expects us um the local people to play ball and they're not going to do that so I think we're going to probably continue to see U Mutual attacks but in limited areas as we have for for years actually because both sides realize that a war would be c a full War would be catastrophic even if it's just hisbah versus Israel forget about Iran and others uh so this is something that I think is likely to Prevail in the uh in in the shortterm but really the Breakthrough has to happen when serious International pressure that comes in and forces both sides to move ahead with a ceasefire an exchange of prisoners and hostages humanitarian Aid and then get the Israelis totally out of of Gaza that's not going to happen by both sides going to Cairo and Qatar every two weeks but how much genuine pressure is the US putting on Israel because the fact is it is in the administration's interest to get a ceasefire uh if the Democrats want to win the next election well that this is a new Factor um the the Americans are not putting serious pressure on the Israelis they they've talk uh in a new language about we've got to stop the civilian high level of Civilian suffering and things like that uh but they're not putting any serious pressure they're continuing to give Israel the money and the guns and the Diplomatic protection uh that it needs and this is one of the problems the United States cannot be a credible mediator while it is also the primary uh funer and U military provider and diplomatic uh shelter of the party that's conducting the genocide which is Israel this is totally uh bizarre and and no other place in the world would accept this and they think that the Arabs will accept it because they've gotten used to the Arabs being docile helpless vulnerable and willing to do anything that stops the shooting and hisbah and Hamas reflect the new mentality among many people in the region that is um is different it won't play it by this rule the fascinating thing is the link to the American election and you have in in the United States also a new generation of Arab American Muslim American black American Hispanic American other leaders who have spent the last 30 40 years working in local U electoral politics and getting into City councils and State assemblies we have a seasoned crop of Arab um Islamic and Arab American political activists in their 40s and and 50s some of them now and they are now involved heavily in Democratic politics we don't know yet if this pressure by these people on the Democratic party to demand and and force Israel to to make a ceas fire we don't know if that pressure is strong enough and can be and Ramy great to get
