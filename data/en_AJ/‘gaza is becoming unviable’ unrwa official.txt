our un Security Council envoys have traveled to the Rafa border region with Gaza they were briefed on the humanitarian situation by the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees before heading to the RAF crossing the UN says hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are starving and Aid isn't enough the main reason I will be going to Gaza is to tell my staff that the UN intention is to stay and to find way to scale up our operation you know that few days ago I have sent a letter to the president of the general assembly and I have warned about the risk that un might not be able to continue to operate because of the Civil order breakdown we hear for the first time that hunger is prevailing in Gaza more and more people haven't eaten for one day two days three days the last time I went was 2 weeks ago when I visited the vocational training center of ranun Hosting more than 35,000 people I could see already fir hand the level of Despair the level of dispossession people lack absolutely everything well that trip comes as the a situation in Gaza continues to get worse Palestinians who have not eaten for days have been looting Aid distribution centers and scrambling to secure supplies for themselves and their families only a small number of Aid trucks are Crossing into Rafa from Egypt each day Juliet tumer is the global communications director for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees H and she joins us now from am man thanks very much for for your time um Juliet so what's what's been the uh assessment then of the team that that just went through there well our commissioner General is currently on the ground he is in Gaza this is the third trip that he makes uh since the War Began and the purpose is to go first of all to be with our teams who have been doing heroic work in providing life-saving support to people under exceptional circumstances but also it's a a message of support to the people of Gaza who have been going through a very very brutal War and what is your colleague's assessment of the overall humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip going from very very bad to worse going from a humanitarian crisis that evolved very early on in this war to a humanitarian catastrophe and a humanitarian operation that is being severely challenged hence the the letter that our commissioner wrote to the general assembly and mass movement of people and exodus of people who continue to be shoved into what is just over a quarter of the Gaza Strip and no place is safe as we've been saying since early on in this war and people have nowhere to go do you have are you getting any sense at all that your um that your voices are being heard in all of this the general assembly has called for a meeting later in the week um what we've been calling for since early on and quite often our calls have gone unheeded is for a humanitarian ceasefire we saw that the pause was very welcome it allowed us to bring in much needed supplies and more importantly it brought some rest fite and calm to the people in Gaza after 50 days of a very very heavy Siege and also brutal bombardment and loss of life and grief and despair and we haven't seen any light if you wish since since then in fact what happened is the absolute opposite another evacuation order from the Israeli authorities and an intensification in the military operation and more loss of lives uh what do you fear for the people of Gaza the longer this goes on it's it's been mentioned that there is a very real fear you know we talked there about uh uh hunger and um you know people raiding distribution centers is there a very real fear that that more more of that could happen um and and that there could be more widespread hunger and starvation and even the spread of disease there Gaza is past becoming unlivable is becoming a place not for humans diseases are in indeed spreading including in our facilities where by the way we're hosting nine times more than what we had planned for so 1.3 million people are now in overcrowded unrest shelters that are themselves unprotected um people don't have enough food and yes they are getting hungry many of them are getting very understandably frustrated we have seen uh breakin into our warehouses and then some of our a trucks uh they've been stopped and people literally started taking food from those trucks and eating them eating food then and there so it's a desperate situation and that shows that if the war continues Gaza is going to see sink further into the abies uh we mentioned earlier that there is a a flow of of Aid going into Gaza from uh Rafa from Egypt uh but it's just a trickle at the moment it's not nearly enough just from from a practical sense what is it that is stopping more Aid getting in through through that point from Egypt is there more that um that Egypt could be doing uh to to to get more trucks in there the aid that has been allowed in is not at all enough and it's also Rafa is not a place not a crossing point that is equipped to receive a massive number of trucks this is precisely why we've been calling on the Israeli authorities to open the other Crossing that we've been using before the war this is Kim Shalom and to use that for the trucks you see before the war that Crossing was able to process 5 00 trucks both for humanitarian use and also for commercial use and right now there are there are no markets in Gaza I mean when I was there just a couple of weeks ago every single shop that we drove past was closed every pharmacy was closed apart from a few vegetable stalls here and there and a couple of bakeries open with very long lines there's nothing there's no market so what needs to happen is more openings including those crossings that is well controls so that there's a more regular flow of humanitarian supplies and also of commercial Goods good to talk to you Juliet tumer thanks very much for being with us thank you
