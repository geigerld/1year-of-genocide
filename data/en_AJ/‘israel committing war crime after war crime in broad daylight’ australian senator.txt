one Australian citizen was among those killed in that attack prime minister Anthony albanesi says his government wants answers expects full accountability for the deaths of Aid workers uh which is completely unacceptable uh Aid workers and those doing humanitarian work and indeed all innocent civilians need to be provided with protection Australia has had a very clear position of supporting a sustainable ceasefire of calling for it for some period of time uh we certainly have already contacted uh the Israeli government directly uh we are contacting the Israeli Ambassador uh to uh ask uh for uh accountability here uh the truth is that that this is beyond uh Beyond any reason able circumstances someone going about providing Aid and humanitarian assistance uh should lose their life joining us now on Al jazer is Marine faruki who's Deputy leader of the Australian greens and a senator for New South Wales she's joining us from Sydney very good to have you with us miss faruki what do you make of this incident and how would you like to see the Australian government respond good to be with you I mean Israel is is committing War Crime After War crime in broad daylight and is getting away with it we know that Aid workers and civilians are protected under law yet nearly 200 humanitarian workers have been killed over the past few months more than 30,000 Palestinians have been massacred by Israel and now Zumi who is an Australian Aid worker like other Aid workers who are putting their lives on the line to feed the children that are being starved by Israel are being killed this is completely heartbreaking and devastating no one literally no one and nowhere is safe in Gaza under Israel's genocidal attacks um and yet and yet we have seen Western governments call Israel a friend and we have seen Western governments continue on business as usual with Israel while these war crimes and War atrocities are going ahead so it's not enough for the prime minister to say that we are demanding accountability of course that's the bare minimum but the Australian government still uses terms like human tragedy and humanitarian catastrophe as if this is happening in a vacuum as if Israel isn't attacking and murdering these people I think these weasel words have to end Australia has to take strong and concrete action what specific actions precisely would you like to see the Australian government take as you said the Prime Minister has demanded accountability what should accountability look look like and what specific actions would you like to see your government take well as a start a permanent ceasefire again no weel words a permanent ceasefire and Australia should back South Africa's case in the international court of justice um Australia should put sanctions on prime minister Netanyahu and his War cabinet these are things that we do when other war crimes happen um and Australia should stop all arms trade with Israel arms trade on the arms trade with Israel uh the the Australian uh Deputy uh prime minister said that uh these armed tra insist that there were no exports of weapons from Australia to Israel and that they haven't been for for many years are these armed trades still going on because the government seems to be denying this well between 2016 and 2023 the Australian government approved more than 300 export permits to Israel for military and dual use equipment and that's on like we know that $15.5 Million worth of uh that uh arms and ammunitions were traded between those years and that's on the department of Foreign Affairs And Trades website also it is beyond any doubt that uh components of F35 fighter jets are being manufactured in Australia so I think again using um words to describe arms trades as something else is just it's just immoral by the Australian government to do so if if the Australian government as you say is manufacturing components of some of the weapons that are being used in Gaza right now do you believe Australia is complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza absolutely the Australian government is complicit in the ongoing genocide um in Gaza and that's why they have to take strong action not just talk about accountability but actually act to get that accountability from Israel and acting does mean putting sanctions on Israel it does mean ending military trade to Israel it does mean actually forcing Israel to open up the channels so that um you know the road blocks so that Aid can get into every corner of Gaza Marine faruki thank you very much for speaking to us and sharing your views Marine faruki is Deputy leader of Australia's greens and a senator for New South Wales we appreciate your time on aler thank you for having me
