un Security Council has failed to pass a draft resolution calling for a humanitarian Pauls in Gaza Brazil had sponsored that draft the killing of nearly 500 people in an Israeli air strike on Tuesday is also high on the agenda Brazil's president Luis anaso Luda Silva called the attack an unjustifiable tragedy let's go over to Kristen salumi joins us now from the UN headquarters in New York so Kristen what happened the expectations were that this text had been waled down and waled down it would pass yeah the security Council had been negotiating on this draft for since Friday uh when Brazil first started working on it uh it got 12 votes but the United States vetoed it uh the only vote against it came from the United States there were two extensions Russia and the United Kingdom uh but again again 12 votes in favor it would have passed had the United States not wielded its veto and uh the United States is just about to speak and give its explanation but we've heard from Brazil which holds the presidency of the council saying that this uh lack of action by the security Council in their words does nothing for the International Community uh they said that they had worked to try to come up with a compromise to all right sorry Christ now I've got to jump and interrupt you we've got the US ambassador to the United Nations speaking let's listen into what she's saying is disappointed this resolution made no mention of Israel's rights of self-defense like every nation in the world Israel has the inherent right of self-defense as reflected in article 51 of the UN Charter following previous terrorist attacks by groups such as Al-Qaeda and Isis this Council reaffirmed that right this text should have done the same though we could not support this resolution going forward we will continue to work closely with all council members on this pressing issue just as we will continue to reiterate the need to protect civilians including members of the media humanitarian workers and un officials and when I talk about the protection of C civilians I mean all civilians the United States is horrified and saddened by yesterday's explosion at the Ali Arab Hospital in Gaza we mourn this tragic tragic loss of life on the humanitarian front we are working with Israel its neighbors the United Nations and other partners to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza it is critical that food medicine water and fuel be began flowing into Gaza as soon as possible families the elderly and children are in dire need let's be clear hamas's own actions have brought this on this severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Hamas has caused so much needless suffering death and destruction every member State Should condemn hamas's terrorism and cruelty and every member State should call on Hamas to cease its inless barrage of rockets against Israel this is not complicated it's not controversial this is the bare minimum colleagues at this difficult moment let us all call for the protection of civilians and unequivocally condemn Hamas let us all affirm Israel's right of self-defense and support the Urgent diplomatic efforts underway let us stand with the UN and other partners as they work to alleviate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians in Gaza and let us all support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike thank you Mr President I thank the representative of the United States and I give the floor to the representative of Malta thank you president Malta voted in favor of the draft resolution tabled by Brazil Malta has also abstained on the two amendments proposed by the Russian Federation although we have no issue with the substance we saw no reason to alter a well-crafted resolution that rests on a delicate balance and that sought Council Unity on this critical matter we deeply regret that that the I'm sorry I am yes I'm sorry we deeply regret that the draft resolution was not adopted and remain Gravely concerned at the highly volatized are hearing right now from Security Council Members Malta speaking about their perspective that there was no need to torpedo the Brazilian draft resolution we heard before that from the US ambassador to the UN condemning Hamas but calling for a humanitarian solution to the situation in Gaza let's go live to Kristen salumi joins us once again live from those un headquarters in New York so sorry Kristen I had to jump in and interrupt you but you were explaining to us what went wrong basically there was expectations that this was going to pass in at least some form to begin some action to address the humanitarian need in this yeah so we just heard from the US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas Greenfield uh she said that the US vetoed this resolution because it had no mention of Israel's right to self-defense now on earlier versions of this the US objected uh to the fact that it didn't uh to to earlier uh versions of this resolution and to a resolution that was put forward by Russia uh the United States said any resolution would have to condemn Hamas and call for the freeing of hostages and that was added to this um the US subjected to a humanitarian ceasefire a blanket humanitarian ceasefire so this resolution went from calling for a humanitarian ceasefire to calling for humanitarian pauses we heard from the Brazilian uh ambassador to the UN that did the negotiating and the drafting of this resolution that multiple attempts were made to uh work with member states work with members of the security Council to get an appropriate draft that would pass uh we just heard from Malta saying that they didn't vote in favor of Russia's amendments even though they didn't strongly object to them in an effort to have a consensus and something that would pass uh with the United States the implication being there uh and yet it didn't pass uh so we are hearing from members of the security Council about their concern for the humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza uh and decrying the fact that the International Community represented by the security Council was unable to come together and make a statement given the gravity of the situation and the rapidly deteriorating situation of the people in Gaza now I should say that the United States also said that they were horrified by the explosion at the hospital uh that left hundreds of Palestinians Dead uh they said that they were against the needless suffering of the people of Gaza the innocent civilians in Gaza but they put the blame squarely on Hamas and uh called for condemnation again of Hamas uh going forward uh we are now hearing from many members of the council who are expressing their disappointment in the fact uh China next China also voted in favor uh of this resolution so I clearly a big anticlimax here after several days of intense negotiations to try to come up with something which the UN said was needed in order to get these supplies into Gaza uh and alas no no resolution no resolution but Christen then what happens now now to all of this diplomatic momentum yeah it's a great question we know that the United Nations has Aid positioned uh in Israel in the West Bank in Egypt they have been saying that they need the bombs to stop in order to get that Aid in there's no uh Safe Way for humanitarians to do their work if the bombs are falling the Secretary General himself has called for an immediate ceasefire uh he had hesitated to use those words ceasefire he had been calling for Access and so for so forth after the hospital bombing he said it very plainly we need a an immediate ceasefire in order to get Aid in and to get Israeli hostages out uh so the pressure is still there the concern is still there uh but now the pressure turns to Israel and the United States to find another way to allow this Aid in since they are the United States are responsible for blocking this resolution all right we'll leave it there thanks so much uh for that update Kristen salumi watching the situation in the UN Security Council Let's uh bring in some pictures coming in from Gaza as you can see there quite an eerie sight another huge plume of smoke over Gaza as Sun uh as it heads towards Sunset there a very disturbing image of continuing strikes and suffering Sultan Barakat is director of the global Institute for strategic research at the hammed bin Khalifa University here in qar so distilling what we just saw there there it it does look like there is AB absolutely no progress in trying to establish a date a mechanism un backing for any kind of call it a seize fire call it a humanitarian pause for any kind of break in this fighting yes it's uh very disappointing it's clear that the US is looking to buy more time to allow ask to allow the Israelis to carry out their objective because you don't uh veto a resolution based on a right that's already PR implicit you know to say that there is no reference for Israel to have the right to defend itself this is ridiculous every state has the right to defend itself so that is already implicit and this is the rule the rules that the Nations work on so clearly this has been taken as an excuse and I I fear that it's going to have a greater impact Way Beyond Israel and Palestine this is going to be the last stro or even the last nail in the coffin of the modern uh sort of um order order that was created in after the second world war led by the United States already there's a lot of anger in the South countries like Brazil South Africa India Indonesia who do not agree with the way the Security Council is constructed and has been operating and I think this particular incident will go down in history now as the one that really erupted all their anger Sultan I I want to read to you a line that we're getting here this is coming in through Israeli media and I want to see your thoughts on whether this is tied to the delay as uh as you put it the US desire to to delay this resolution Israeli media channel 12 quoting is the Israeli Prime Minister's office is saying that the Council of ministers is decided that Israel will not allow any humanitarian Aid to enter the Gaza Strip unless the kidnapped Israelis are returned is there a is this is there a link here to why we've seen the US of course there is now they've seen Biden of the plane and they've gone back to where we started a week ago and what we fear is that now Hamas will retaliate Hamas a week ago also threatened to uh kill the kidna uh individuals or the hostages or the captives if Israel doesn't stop so we're going we're going back a full cycle and uh I think worse is to come how much pressure is building on Egypt and Jordan particularly from the US after they snub the meeting with Biden must be a huge pressure I mean Jordan in particular is a very in a very difficult position economically it is reliant on uh uh American Aid it receives almost 1.5 billion dollars a year uh and must find it very very difficult to say no to United States but at the same time it has its population to worry about and without stability internally no amount of Aid can help the jordanians so I think the position that was taken by King Abdullah his government is the right one uh as far as Egypt Egypt has sort of uh uh become less and less dependent on American aid over the last few years now they only received just under a billion dollar uh and um they they don't have the same pressures but geographically it's Egypt who's bordering Gaza and and uh again 100 million people who are angry upset about what's going on will be very very difficult to manage talking about people angry and upset how do you think audiences are going to particularly in this part of the world be viewing the statements that speech that we heard from Joe Biden he on the one hand he gave a very clear condemnation of the Hamas attacks which killed so many Israelis Israeli civilians um he went into great detail to share his unequivocal as he put it uh condemnation but on the other hand we didn't hear any kind of language directed at Israel for conducting attacks which international human rights groups have also said I'm quoting here the balam report of October the 10th where they call a criminal policy of Revenge in Gaza a policy of preferring damage over precision and they call it a war crime Human Rights Watch in their statement of October 15th saying the terrible deaths and injuries and destruction of homes and schools an indication that of the that the the laws of war are not being followed by the Israelis we're not seeing that kind of evenhanded yes approach in that speech from the US president how is that going to resonate I mean I must say for me it was a very odd speech it's very theatrical and the references and the way he delivered the speech is it's as if he's the father of Israel talking to him is a spoiled guilty child that uh you shouldn't do this we should stick to our rules our civilized actions Etc ET he's even quoted from the tah and made I think a couple of uh really bad references that he will regret maybe later on in terms of his political career the reference to to uh the uh the attack on the hospital as an a random explosion this is ertic rocket fire erant sorry erant rocket Fire by a ter I think this is very similar to his reference to the 40 babies being beheaded and again that the the proof will come out and he will be having to backtrack on this and also this quotation from Golden Mayer that we as Jewish people have nowhere else to go this kind of contradicts itself with what's going on at the moment they're flying in from all over the world to fight on behalf of Israel they're flying out from Israel on an Exodus everywhere in the world everybody has a dual nationality and so on so well the quote he didn't mention for example is by the Secretary General of Amnesty International October 13th when Agnes kalamar called for a halt of transfer of arms that could be used to commit unlawful attacks how do you think people will will see the images of these attacks in Gaza a lot of Civilian suffering a lot of human rights groups saying it's unlawful and it's associated with American weapons and resupplying of course when America supplied Saudi Arabia in its war in Yemen there were a lot of organizations and senators and others calling for accountability based on the fact that American weapons were used in Saudi Air Raids on Yemen now this is not just a suspicion he has actually actioned the the weapons uh they have supplied them in front of the rest of the world we all know where these uh ammunition the ammunition is coming from and he's just made another promise similar to the old days of Biden with the previous war when just at towards the end of uh of this conflict he then is going to ask for increase of the amount of money coming to Israel in Weaponry it's already stands on $3.8 billion I suspected we pushed up beyond that all right thank you so much Sultan Barakat for analyzing it for us thank you the eu's foreign policy Chief Joseph borell has said cutting off water supply in Gaza is illegal Wars also have their rules they are established in international law and we have said it on several occasions referring to other conflicts cutting off water and basic supplies to a population is not compatible with the law of War at this moment there is no more water in Gaza there are more than 3,000 dead and a quarter of them are children we can not hold all Gins responsible for the criminal actions of Hamas
