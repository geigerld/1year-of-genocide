Israel has one of the world's most powerful militaries with Advanced surveillance systems and weapons it also receives more than $3 billion dollar in US military aid every year Israel has developed its own mobile air defense system the Iron Dome with financing from the US there are more than 169,000 active Israeli military personnel and 465,000 reservists Israel has significant land power with more than 2,000 tanks and hundreds of artillery its Arsenal also includes 339 combat capable aircraft including fighter jets well to help us unpack a lot of this uh we're joined Now by Elias Hana who is in bayout he is a retired Lebanese General and a military analyst thank you very much for your time sir uh first of all when we run through that list of the capabilities the military capabilities of Israel how worried should Hamas and those living inside Gaza B right now I mean they have to be worried but they have chosen to go into the offense because this is the first time they made like they waged the uh offensive campaign inside occupied Palestine this is the first time because now they are measuring their success that they are going into occupied land and then fighting and they were preparing and planning to stay and fight uh uh in the near abroad of Gaza however they have really uh they have they have to calculate I mean the different scenario because when you go to war you plan for the worst case scenario and you hope for the best so they have they have had in their mind that uh at one time they have to withdraw to Gaza and uh waiting for maybe big operation Land The Invasion for uh Gaz so they have to be uh prepared for that as far as logistic is concerned as far as tactics is concerned and at bringing and pulling the the Israeli IDF into Gaza it's like something you know very dangerous for for Israel however uh when you have like this emergency cabinet and U calling like 300,000 troops and then massing these kind of you know tanks and uh you know armored vehicles around Gaza it means that there is something is coming just staying with Israel I mean they were clearly surprised by what happened on Saturday morning and we heard from Israel's military Chief of Staff just a short time ago he said we will learn we will investigate but now is the time for War what exactly do you think that Israel will be trying to achieve in in the days now before potential escalation into the next phase of this War I think that's there's must be some proportionality I mean this surprise and this losses for Israel uh you know intelligence failure they have to do something at least equal in order to erase all of that so maybe there is three main objectives dismantle Hamas or destroy Hamas then freeing the hostages and then maybe avoiding trying to avoid collateral damage which is not the case today so these three objectives are really contradictory with with each other you know what I mean so it's like a war and trying to really dismantle Hamas or paralyze Hamas in Gaza now as we've we've seen over the last few days there has been a huge buildup of uh troops along the border with Gaza from a military point of view what would happen if Israel was to send ground troops into Gaza what would play out from that moment on I think maybe we are we are witnessing now the first phase with is really softening the ground preparing the ground this is the first one hitting like the center of gravity of Hamas all infrastructure and pushing the people to go uh toward Egypt maybe to this Corridor human humanitarian Corridor this is the first phase the second phase is maybe going into Gaza but before going into Gaza they have to go uh by force then they have to bypass the mines so they have to uh uh bypass the anti-tank weapon and then maybe the tunnel so however I think that Israelis will choose maybe maybe According to some articles and Analysis that maybe they will try to go and divide Gaza in the middle because in Gaza if you want to do something you have to to look into three main things main pillars uh demography where is he in the demography it's in Gaza City I mean you have to look for topography and geography maybe in in the middle near D balah from the Gaza border into the the coast to the Mediterranean Sea that is like six kilometers According to some analyst maybe Israel will try to divide Gaza into two parts however going into Gaza can they stay inside uh what would be the theory of victory for Netanyahu Hamas what is after Hamas so this is the whole issue now maybe it's a little bit blurred yes and it certainly is now as we know Hamas is holding a number of Israeli captives I mean how does that affect what could happen from a military point of view I mean there will be a hindrance for you know for the Israelis to go inside and maybe the American are sending with more military uh means to Naim Airbase in in NE they are sending some troops of the Delta Force this kind of Delta Force they are specialized in uh uh freeing hostages would these guys participate I don't think so and maybe they are will be like advisory however Israel can I mean Hamas can use these hostages maybe as a human shield that put them and this distribute them in many many issue and it depends on Israel will'll go and hit these targets I mean there is an Israel like the protocol of Hannibal uh when a soldier is kidnapped and you see him uh it's better to kill him as well as the kidnapper because a Dead Soldier is better than a hostage okay well thank you so much for that it'll be fascinating to see exactly what plays out over the next few days and weeks thank you so much that is Elias Hana for us a retired Lebanese General and a military analyst
