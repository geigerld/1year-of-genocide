welcome to the program dozens of people are believed to be buried under Rubble after an Israeli attack on a school in Gaza emergency crews are searching for survivors after the building collapsed killing at least 12 Palestinians most of them women and children civil defense says 700 displaced people were Sheltering at the school West of Gaza City the Israeli Army says it targeted a Command Center used by Palestinian Fighters at the school Ibrahim alal reports now from the scene of the attack I am here standing inside Mustafa H's school and this is the after math of a brutal Air Attack targeted this is school Northwest Gaza City resulted in killing many civilians and dozens injured I managed to crawl from under the debris every time I have to run for my life for months I've been living in fear Israeli tanks were very close I have lived through a lot the moment we heard the explosion we ran for our lives my sister kept crying we did not know what to do I saw dead buddies Torn to Pieces we were sitting inside one of the classrooms when we heard the loud explosion it was so powerful that we fell to the ground I ran searching for my children who were playing in the schoolyard I did not find any of them all who were in this part of the school were killed the entire building collapsed on their heads they were all killed no one survived till when will the World stand watching in silence we are killed and our homes destroyed where do we go Civil Defense Forces are trying to rescue but unfortunately they have little to work with they are using the basic equipment to get the trapped civilians from under their the school building was flattened to the ground we together with a few Medical Teams are doing our best to recover the dead I regret to say we will not be able to recover all of them simply because we are using just our bare hands amid a total absence of equipment and other resources this has been the case for civil defense throughout this genocidal War families are grieving as they are asking themselves where do we have to go as this school we Sheltering more than 700 civilians who already got their houses destroyed due to the ongoing Israeli War on Gaza they are now left with no shelter maybe they will end up in a street due to the Relentless and discriminate air strikes targeting the shelters uh which Sheltering civilians here Northern Gaza City and and in the whole Gaza Strip uh families are grieving as their their loved ones are still trapped under the rubble of this school efforts are being exerted by Civil Defense Forces to get uh civilians and injured from under the ibraim AL KH Al jaaz Gaza City Palestine well that was Ibrahim let's join hin kudri our correspondent in Dar Bala in central Gaza um very difficult to know how to even begin sometimes talking about yet another school attack hind because we've talked about so many of them during the last 10 months and yet again August has been another bloody month for the numbers of deaths of children and women in what should be safe [Music] havens well yes this is the ninth school that has been targeted since August uh and and we have been counting those schools and and every school is a complete misery and catastrophe now Mustafa H school had had at least 700 civilians Sheltering there um they came from different areas across the Gaza City where there has been recent evacuation orders from the Northern parts of uh uh bah and B hanun and that's why Palestinians were Sheltering in this school so the Israeli forces targeted this school and at least 12 Palestinians were killed but according to the civil defense teams they're saying that there's a a lot more Palestinians still trapped under theable they say that the buildings completely collapsed uh once there was um the air strike targeted the school and the the the civil defense teams are trying their best to rescue as much people as possible now most of those who were killed were children and women and also there was among them uh the Palestinian journalist Hamza Mora now according to our colleagues in Gaza cities they said that they were very close to the school where there was an event for children they were covering and at the minute the explosion happened they start started covering uh the explosion and the target of the school now this is only one school that has been uh still targeted in the Gaza City there has been a couple of targets on schools in the past couple of weeks but this is not the only Target on the Gaza City today inun in Al area there was a Target on a residential area where at least a Palestinian were killed and others were injured among them is a Palestinian CH child and also here in there a group of Palestinian Palestinians were also targeted and they were transferred here to Al AA hospital and it was also a very intense uh deadly night for those Palestinians in kanun in the western parts of uh hunis in very close to Al maasi which this area is a humanitarian Zone and it's worth mentioning and reminding uh you that only 11 % of gaza's 365 kilomet is the humanitarian zone so no hospitals are safe no schools are safe even uh shelters and and makeshift camps are all Target and Palestinians are in a state of despair and frustration they do not know where to go especially those who were targeted in Mustafa hav School we're talking about 700 700 civilians that are now completely displaced not knowing where to go and believing that there is no safe and not only that their beloved ones are still trapped under the rubble H there for us
