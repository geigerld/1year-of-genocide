we are joined Now by Mark Owen Jones associate professor of Middle East studies at hammad bin Khalifa University thank you very much for your time this morning is it unusual for a US president to begin and really focus on foreign policy in a State of the Union Address I mean I don't think it's it is unusual I don't think it's unusual considering the situation we're in now which is an ongoing genocide in Gaza perpetrated by one of the US's closest allies perpetrated by an ally that has historically played a very important role in lobbying in the US and and whether you're Republican or Democrat uh trying to secure you know the APAC vote the Israel lobbies vote is important so I think Biden uh in particular knowing as well that Trump is incredibly pro-israel and his his Contender is is making sure that he puts that front and center not least because obviously the US want to demonstrate their commitment to Israel but also Biden is also aware that there is this backlash a growing backlash against the US's support for Israel yeah and yet despite beginning his State of the Union Address by talking about foreign policy and you know you mentioned the genocide in Gaza that's not what he began the address he he actually started talking about Russia and Ukraine when he did get to the point about what's happening in Gaza he mentions building a temporary port on gaza's Coast to allow more Aiden why is he making such an announcement when there are many trucks waiting at gaza's borders that Israel is impeding well it's a it's a it's a it's a very um I say bizarre State of Affairs but it's in a state of affairs that's hardly surprising now given what's happened over the past couple of weeks right Israel have refused uh and they've hindered the supply of Aid across the border the most efficient form of delivering Aid through trucks across Rafa this is part of their war on unra um and as a result we've seen us and some of its allies airdropping Aid into Gaza which is both inefficient and expensive and also it's a huge publicity stand it's designed to be a spectacle that attempts demonstrate that the US are trying their best to try and remedy this humanitarian crisis in in Gaza uh and and fundamentally it's about the fact that the US are un I would say unable I to to an extent unable to pressure Israel into uh allowing Aid I say unable but there's an element of an unwilling too and I when I say element of unwilling this goes back to the initial point I was saying about the US Biden Democrats and Republicans Al light are concerned about Israel uh Israel's support right and so if Biden is seen to be too harsh on Israel even if he feels that he's aware that he has a contender very you know popular Contender who might use you know Biden's perceived weakness uh in in maybe you know supporting Israel as as as a form of votes is he trying to get here because the majority of Democrats support a ceasefire in Gaza but the majority of Democrats and the majority of people in many countries who support Israel support the ceasefire and I think the case of whether it's the base is not necessarily relevant here because we know that us politics is so profoundly based on the power of lobbying so I think that's a really important consideration we can't just talk about how the the the popular demands of the people is actually reflected in not just us politics but I would say Democratic politics across Europe because it's not so are you saying then that the lobbies right now in America are more powerful than the people and what the people want I would say lobbying is incredibly important and big money whether through lobbies or other forms or super packs in US politics are really important defining policy but particularly foreign policy yeah we've got the CIA chief who's in DOA today after being in Egypt yesterday and this is being seen as a last ditch attempt for a ceasefire just finally how do you assess the prospects I mean of him getting anywhere well I think it's a I think it's a sign of of the the urgency that people feel about securing a ceasefire deal before Ramadan um but I I don't I think it's hard for us to fundamentally know we've had Hamas accus Netanyahu walking away we've had Israel also accuse Hamas of sabotaging the ceas fire this is normal politics this kind of sherad that we're seeing doesn't naturally suggest that there won't be a cease file before Ramadan but I think as Israel continue to hinder Aid and these kind of desperate attempts to to to have this kind of Port establishing Gaza reflect a level of exasperation and Desperation that suggests that we might be quite far from having ceas for security Marco and Jones thank you so much for your analysis we appreciate it
