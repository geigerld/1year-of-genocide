a letter signed by hundreds of international journalists says Western media coverage of the Gaza War has been biased in favor of Israel and against Palestine newsrooms were accused of dehumanizing Palestinians are the allegations fair this is Inside Story [Music] hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle the world's television screens newspapers and online media have been filled with pictures of Israel's war on Gaza which has killed nearly 12,000 Palestinians most of them women and children they've also featured the Hamas attacks of October the 7th which killed 1,200 Israelis modern technology means there's more media coverage than ever before but some of this coverage has been criticized by journalists themselves hundreds have signed a letter accusing Western media of biased reporting of the Gaza War they work for organizations such as Reuters The Washington Post the Los Angeles Times And The Guardian let's take a look at some of the main points in the letter we hold Western newsrooms accountable for dehumanizing rhetoric that has served to justify ethnic cleansing of pal Palestinians double standards inaccuracies and fallacies abound in American Publications and have been well documented newsrooms have instead undermined Palestinian Arab and Muslim perspectives dismissing them as unreliable and have evoked inflammatory language that reinforces islamophobic and racist tropes they have printed misinformation spread by Israeli officials and failed to scrutinize and discriminate killing of civilians in Gaza committed with the support of the US government this is our job to hold power to account otherwise we risk becoming accessories to genocide we are renewing the call for journalists to tell the full truth without fear or favor to use precise terms that are well defined by international human rights organizations including apartheid ethnic cleansing and genocide to recognize that contorting our words to hide evidence of war crimes or is Israel's oppression of Palestinians is journalistic malpractice and an abdication of moral clarity now there has of course been plenty of balanced and compelling reporting in Western media on the plight of Palestinians and the devastating impact of the Israeli War on Gaza but there's also been plenty of instances where Hardline pro-israeli government statements have gone unchallenged Israel is not engaged in genocide and then another thing we need to deal with is the whitewashing of the status of people in Gaza uh I'm sure there are plenty of people would love to be free from uh Hamas but the most radicalized people on the planet live in the Gaza Strip they've been taught since birth uh to kill and hate the Jews how do you teach math in Gaza if you had 10 Jews and you kill six how many would be left that's been in their school system us Republican presidential candidates have lined up to voice their support for Israel during a televised debate this week the result a platform for unchallenged and extreme views supporting the bombing of Gaza the first thing I said to him when it happened was I said finish them finish them and the reason is I worked on this every day when I was at the United Nations and we have to remember that they have to one eliminate Hamas two support Israel with whatever they need whenever they need it and three make sure we bring our hostages home and the Washington Post took a cartoon off its website after a backlash it was criticized as being racist and for its dehumanizing portrayal of the Palestinians let's bring in our guests now and in Toronto pent matar an independent journalist and 2022 nyman fellow at Harvard University she's also a former producer at CBC News in London ammed al- nauk had journalist and co-founder of we are not numbers that's a nonprofit organization that seeks to amplify voices and stories from Gaza and here in doar is Mark Owen Jones associate professor of Middle East studies at hammed bin Khalifa University his research focuses on disinformation and propaganda a very warm welcome to all of you perent this is a pretty powerful letter written and signed by journalists themselves to their employers you're one of the signaries why did you sign it quite frankly Laura I have been horrified and disappointed by the lack of Courage from our profession the lack of concern for our fellow journalists in Gazza who are not only risking their lives but their family's lives they are on the move they are trying to report on what's Happening as the only people bearing witness to the suffering of the people of razza and I'm quite frankly so alarmed that we are now looking at over 39 journalists who have been killed and at least in the west it seems like there is abject Silence about this uh and so when I saw the letter circulating I thought if we can't as a profession as journalists condemn the killing of our fellow journalists then what are we doing here uh it was just such a clear letter and it also got at the difficulty of reporting on this not just within which is the most immediate but the difficulty of talking about this and Reporting on this with Clarity uh in mainstream news organizations which has been challenging for a very long time and that's why I added my name to it there was a lot of fear in talking about this and I think there is power in Collective action and in journalists banding together to say we have an obligation to cover this fairly um and to call out the uh targeting of journalists like us it could be any one of us that are being targeted right now what instances have have you found challenging well I was a longtime producer at CBC the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and I can tell you that in my 10 years of working there I produced thousands of interviews I worked on a daily current affairs uh news show so thousands of interviews over 10 years but the one story of mine Laura that never saw the light of day an interview that I had produced um and in 10 years the one story that did not make it to air was an interview that I had produced with a Palestinian American journalist your former Al jazer colleague Ahmed shahabad Emy nominated journalist who was reporting on protest in Jerusalem in 2017 and ironically one of the things that we spoke to him about was the difficulty of covering this he had in the course of his reporting been stopped questioned uh jostled around by Israeli Security Forces on video by the way which is what Drew my attention to him and thought I should talk to him about this for our show and when we record Ed the interview with him uh uh I came back after editing it came coming back from a break and was told with no discussion by hires up that this interview would not air that they did not have time to explain it to me and it was unceremoniously yanked with no editorial discussion and it was the first and only time in my entire history at the CBC where an interview did not make it to air and I still to this day am not clear as to why and so that is just one Stark example of the difficulty of putting on Palestinian voices of talking about uh the view from Palestine specifically I would say from Arab Arab adjacent Muslim journalists Palestinians themselves are often silenced uh without a lot of due process editorially and it is just an opaque difficult thing and the only reason I was able to talk about it is because I wrote about it in an article that was fact checked and bulletproof in an independent magazine here and that was the way that I found that I could talk about this three years later in 2020 okay pres we'll suddenly look at the reasons perhaps why uh that interview wasn't air just a little later in the discussion first of all Mark I just want to get some uh examples from you because I know you've been looking at the UK media give us an idea of what you're seeing though and the way that you're seeing bias creeping in and the dehumanization of Palestinians becoming the norm well I think a key aspect of dehumanization is also marginalization if you can make a people invisible if you can make their suffering disappear then you're going to basically be controlling how much sympathy the public have for those people and I was for example examining the front pages of a number of the the the British press including the Daily Mail which is one of the most circulated newspapers in the UK and I found in the first 14 days of the the conflict or the war rather that they did not mention once on the front page uh the cumulative total of pales Ians killed in Raza okay and this is despite mentioning the number of Israelis who were killed on October the 7th and thereabouts several different times so I thought this to me was a really striking example of how for example uh Palestinians are removed from the picture they're removed from suffering it's almost as if you know the Israeli suffering was was the only kind of suffering that was worth mentioning on the front page of these newspapers and I think we shouldn't take that lightly I'm not saying that you know these figures weren't mentioned uh in the paper on a different page but I think we all know that the front page the headline is a really important positioning it it's what many people read it's the only thing some people read and it also gives us an insight into that editorial process what does that newspapers want us to think about what's going on in Gaza and this is just one example of a number and that doesn't even start to mention the use of language the dehumanizing nature of language and this is another thing I'd really like to mention what I've noticed even in sort of the more quality papers in the UK like the guardian often they will preface what Hamas did with terms like brutal and Massacre but when it comes to for example the Israeli bombing of of Gaza which has killed over 10,000 people in horrific brutal ways terms like brutal are never used it's always things like Precision strike or collateral damage right so there's this kind of you know double spe going on when reporting about Israeli atrocities that is not used when it comes to you know those perceived atrocities carried out by Palestinians and and this is not accidental you know this is you know how how writing is constructed to actually marginalize the suffering of Palestinians and this has been an ongoing uh issue in how Western media generally has portrayed what's going on in Palestine and it's unacceptable Ahmed you've been on the receiving end of this bias yourself your your own suffering has been uh belittled will you share with us your experience thank you thank you very much for having me actually what's going on here and the Western media bias in Palestine is not new we are used to it it has been ongoing for the past 75 years and uh recently in during the past three weeks I lost 21 family members and uh there were civilians they were sleeping in their home and Israel bombed them including 14 of my nieces and nephews who were kids they were killed and then the media invited me a lot of media Outlets invited me to talk and to speak about my family and what's going on but the problem with with that is it is always the media invite the Palestinians to speak in order to embarrass them in order to put them in a in a position where they have to defend themselves to prove the the worthiness to the to the Wern audience for example I L 21 family members in just one bomb and then in one of the interviews they said Ahmed lost 21 family members they did not say Israel killed 21 family members of Ahmed while they were asleep they said lost but when you talk about the Israelis and when they describe the Israelis they always say Israelis are brutally killed massacred terrorists killed them but the Palestinians they just lose their family me their family members the the Palestinians die all the time that's the problem and on many other cases they on many other TV appearances they ask me after knowing that I lost a 21 family members they asked me to condemn Hamas or what they what do I think of Hamas or if I were close to my brothers and sisters who I grew up in my entire life with so it's always our perception is countered with u disbelief they they want to make sure that I am correct that my my family means something to me U many of the big Publications also uh wrote interviews with wrote articles about me and every single information I tell them about my family they want proof they want to see my house on Google Maps they want to know the names of my brothers and sisters and their ages and what they were doing and these interviews went through a lot a lot of scity because they want to make sure that I'm not lying so they always have this impression that I might be lying that my family is Hamas that there's a justification whatsoever but when you compare that with what happened in isra in 7th of October the same mainstream uh media Outlets they were not reluctant to disseminate information and lies and fake news by the Israelis without any scrunity without any Factor checking without any U without any professional media work that's the problem I've been on many many TV appearances during the past one month and in every one of them it is almost that they want to ask ask me if I condemn Hamas or not because they think that condemning Hamas or the question is about Hamas is a l my that I have to do I have to undertake in order to prove that I'm worthy of being heard that's the problem we have been suffering with the mainstream media for 75 years is that always the Palestinians are less worthy our life are less important and then yesterday for example uh to TV did an interview with me and then I was I wanted to know what what the comments on their YouTube channel and every single comment on that interview was very very very negative everyone said that I do not deserve sympathy because I did not condemn Hamas I wasn't asked by the way to condemn Hamas on that interview but they said that I don't deserve sympathy some people think thought it was too weird that I have 20 20 family members and that I am lying because I have 20 family members think think there are too many and they shouldn't be uh I shouldn't have too many family members and I don't blame the people who say that but it is this is the outcome of Decades of Western media disinformation and lies about the Palestinian people and demonization of the Palestinian people just jump in there I just want to get an idea from percent who's just you know recently been with CBC is a very mainstream media there in in Canada do you understand do you do you accept that there's this reluctance to accept Palestinian suffering as equal to Israeli suffering uh that it needs to be scrutinized that the stories need to be fact checked do you see that happening in the newsrooms where you've been working absolutely and and even before getting to a stage of of factchecking or verifying the bar for getting Palestinian voices or stories about Palestine on the air is is so high it is almost uh it's an impossible bar to meet and when we do reach that threshold it is because there has been an attack on Israelis Israelis have been killed or injured and that then gives us the green light in Western media often to wait into it and it is often contextless uh Palestinians rarely get on to talk about their lives uh the daily injustices that they face the missing context that has been missing from coverage about Palestine and Israel for so long and you know what we see often is the a very limited window of conversation these days it is do you condemn Hamas do you condemn Hamas even when Palestinians do make it onto the air is often what I would call trauma porn tell us about your pain tell us about who you've lost but when we start to get into the context and holding Israel accountable um you know bringing it back to journalists you know Israel has deliberately targeted journalists and not just journalists who are in the field but journalists sleeping in their homes along with their families and so there is often a a missing context and a missing clarity about the violence and the death that Palestinians are experiencing and it seems to only be discussed when Israelis face violence first and then Palestinians are brought on to respond to this and uh the context piece has been very very hard to get at because then you're looking at words like occupation like you know international human rights groups talking about ethnic cleansing and genocide the United Nations um but there is such reluctance to talk about these things and then there are groups that you know have gone after and as a rule go after anyone in the media who talks about uh Palestinian Freedom Palestinian the occupation and they say that this is anti-Semitic they say that you know you're calling for the destruction of Israel and it gets so warped and so basically Newsroom managers do not want this headache a lot of it is just fear there's a chill because talking about this gets people riled up and the accusations of anti anti-Semitism fly there has been such a flattening of you know criticism of uh policies of the state of Israel the Israeli government is often just uh seen as anti-semitic and so therefore no one wants to touch it and no Newsroom managers want to deal with Ombudsman complaints so therefore we just don't wait into it and this has been going on for a very long time and I think we're seeing the results of this right now you brought up so many good points there that I want to look at I'm just going to pick up on that culture of fear that you mentioned Mark how risky is it for journalists like pent to speak out like this we've seen people in the past speaking up and then losing their jobs over it I mean I think you know we're seeing this uh ample evidence of this right now several journalists in the US have have lost their jobs for various reason including signing on a letter that was condemning you know the the the the sort of just the unbelievable level of violence enacted by Israel on Palestinians we saw someone fired from a position editing a magazine because he endorsed or he liked and praised a satirical onion article because he was saying that the onion which is this hcal American News Outlet was actually providing some of the most astute and critical coverage in the US of what was going on Palestine could you imagine what kind of state we're living in when people are lose their job a journalist will lose their job simply for appreciating satire which was happening within the bounds of the law I mean it's actually terrifying and I think you know these these kind of risks are everywhere even as an academic I faced it myself I got a a a an email from a journalist a British journalist uh going through my tweets trying to basically find any evidence that I was quote unquote anti-semitic and one of the tweets he used as an example to try and cite me as being anti-semitic in this article he wanted to write was one where I said why do people have a problem when you compare for example media coverage or coverage of Palestine with that of Ukraine how on Earth is that even remotely anti-Semitic how is it even remotely anti-israeli so I mean there's one thing where there's this attempt which is really common to basically accuse anyone who's remotely critical of Israel as being anti-semitic but then this this other level where you're accusing people who aren't even criticizing Israel of being anti-semitic you know it is this huge flattening that we see and it's hugely problematic and and I and I worry and this is this draws on the point that was just being made about context what happens and this is happened to many people including myself and other journalists who try to talk about the backstory right the thing is with of with news media and journalism it tries to create a beginning and a middle and an end to a story right this is where this whole do you condemn Hamas comes in what journalists are trying to do that is trying to say okay we want you to admit that Hamas started it and then once you admit that then we'll talk to you which is preposterous right um and it's always trying to ref frame any form of Israeli aggression as a response as a retaliation to what Hamas did none of this is about you know Decades of occupation and apartheid and brutalization being the reason for causing what happened on the the 7th of October you know that's that's not how it's framed so the whole do you condemn Hamas is a form of gaslighting it's a form of basically Palestinians trying to acknowledge that they are complicit somehow in their own suffering and this discourse continues throughout even the arguments that you know Hamas used human Shields right that you know Palestinians live in crowded areas all it's all designed in a way to make it sound like Palestinian deaths are somehow their own doing well this is the point that I wanted to actually bring ammed in on it's this idea of context again and because we keep seeing in many Western media Outlets pro-israeli government voices coming on saying this started on October the 7th we're missing aren't we ammed the context here there's little space in many Western media Outlets to talk about the situation before October the 7th using words like pent said of a partide of occupation this is what's missing of course this is uh Missing now it has always been missing uh I did my my my master's degree in uh in journalism and my desertation was about the W media coverage in Palestine and I can safely say that one of the main important uh topics that we're talking about the main problems that we're having with the Western media is the lack of context and also of what the Western media exclude rather than what they include for example if you uh took if if you uh work at a human right if you work at um a newspaper and if you say that the Palestinian people have been living under military occupation for the past uh 57 years it will make a huge difference if you talk about the settlements that are spreading in the West Bank where there is no Hamas in the West Bank it will make a huge difference to the reader there are many many if you took about the collective punishment of siege that has been uh ongoing in Gaza for the past 17 years people will have a context they will have an understanding of what's actually going on right now the media only focuses or tell the stories of the palestin or talk about about the conflict when there are Israelis killed for example since the beginning of this year more than 400 Palestinian people were killed in the west bank and then the media talked about it they only talk to us they only talk to the Palestinians when there are Israeli killed as if the Israelis are the only important people here the only lives that matter and the Palestinians life don't matter they don't talk about the OCC the military occupation they don't talk about the neba you never hear about theba or the catastrophe that happened to the Palestinian 75 years ago which displaced uh uh hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their home all of this context is never provided to the audience and that's why the audience will only know about Gaza or talk about Gaza when there are bombing when there are Israelis killed and this will give the the audience a negative perception about uh about about this conflict so this is one of the main problems that we are suffering from and it's only the Palestinians are portrayed in in a bad in a negative in a negative way they don't talk about success stories about talents about the the bright side of the Palestinians they only talk about the Palestinians when there are when there is a Bloodshed that's a problem and that's why we have a lot of misin a lot of stereotypes in the west about Palestine and about what's going on in in Palestine Mark I just want to bring you back to that point that you said about the the number of uh Palestinian deaths being missing from uh front page coverage uh when the number of Israeli deaths is is frequently reported do you think as an audience as a a consumer of news that we have a higher threat threshold for State violence over non-state violence do you think that plays into it um I don't know if we have a higher threshold uh but I think you know it depends how you want to play it I mean are you saying I mean Hamas are elected right are can we say that that's State violence too why are we treating Hamas as this terrorist organization whereas Israeli violence is somehow more legitimate you know Israel are constantly in violation of international law uh they're you know bombing with these kind of indiscriminate weapons densely populated area that are killing hundreds of people I don't think it should matter or not whether this violence is State violence or not I think what we're trying to see we're just trying to see this deliberate attempt to marginalized human suffering and and and the the 10 thousands of people killed I think if that was anywhere else if that was in Ukraine we would see a lot of attention P to that story so I don't think it's about State violence per say I mean Russia is a state and it's killing people but what I do think here is this really interesting politicization over the number of people killed the number of Palestinians killed is becoming a political problem for even Biden and Israel look what Biden did he went on the news to try and cast out on the number of Palestinians killed by using terms like hamus run Health Ministry we cannot trust these numbers and where was the source for this story Israeli intelligence it was some guy who used to be a bureau chief in Jerusalem who said that we can't trust Hamas as numbers right that was that was the source for that story and no one actually mentioned that the guy who the source for that story was was actually also working now for a PR firm I mean it's absurd and and one sorry just one second it's just today the Israelis even downgraded the number of their casualties right and I just think it's important it's it's not to say to undermine that that's a tragedy of the the amount of civilians that died but at the end of the day the Israelis have lowered downgraded the number of people killed there was never any 200 I just want to I just want to get the last word into you because we've only got a minute left on the discussion you've written you've signed this letter do you think it's going to have any impact on the way the Israeli GSA War is going to be covered from here on in I I I don't know Laura and the fact that I don't know if this will have any impact is is I think um is chilling but I have just been haunted by watching journalists um you know there was a a Palestine TV journalist who openly wept on TV uh Salman Al Bashir was crying about his colleague Muhammad abat just within the last week who was killed after finishing his coverage going home to sleep and I was haunted by this Palestine TV correspondent standing outside of a hospital seeing his colleague come in dead who had just been reporting before him and he took off his press vest he took off his helmet and said we are victims we are being targeted one by one and these things are not protecting us there is no International protection and uh I was haunted by that from Al the the Gaza bureau chief his he lost his whole family his wife his daughter his son his grandchild and was on the air the next day saying I'm committed to telling the story so that is what motivates me to sign and to to hopefully um you know have a conversation about if we can't even condemn the killing of our fellow journalists how can we condemn The Wider genocide that is taking place against uh Palestinian civilians in the tens of thou like over 10,000 now I'm haunted by it and if this letter is just a A Drop in the Ocean I hope it's one that creates a very necessary conversation about what's happening now at least in the journalistic Community okay well hopefully this is part of that conversation many thanks to all our guests for joining us here today pent mat Ahmed al- Na and Mark Owen James and thank you too for
