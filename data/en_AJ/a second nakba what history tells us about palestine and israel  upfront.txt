it's been 7 weeks since Israel began its bombardment of the Gaza Strip leaving more than 10,000 dead including thousands of children but the violence didn't just start in October it spans a 75e history from the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 in this week's upfront we'll take a look at this history and The crucial context that's needed to better understand what's happening today the state of Israel was established in 1948 when at least 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes many of them by Zionist militias and what became known as the NECA or catastrophe 75 years later as Israel's war on Gaza rages on the Palestinian struggle for self-determination continues so how does this history inform the current moment to answer that question we'll speak to Mustafa baruti he is co-founder of the Palestinian national initiative a political party in the occupied West Bank a party that is not affiliated with neither either F nor also joins us she is a physician and author and her latest book is titled one state the only Democratic future for Palestine Israel I want to thank you both for joining me on up front I'm going to start with you because you were born in Jerusalem and you were in fact among the more than 750,000 Palestinians who were forced to leave their homes can you talk about this time what you experienced having to leave your home uh and also what happened to your family yeah indeed I was born in Palestine before 1948 and before the NBA now I was a child when we were forced out of Jerusalem what I what I do remember of that time was that it was uh a real terror uh fear everywhere uh nobody sure uh if uh we could make it from the the the part of Jerusalem will lived in which was full of Zionist snipers um and militias um it's very important I think to remind people that at the time that that happened in 1948 really no one amongst the Palestinians who were either forced out or or fled no Palestinian actually believed there would never be allowed back so that was the second the other side of the naar first the Force displacement second the um the reality of not being allowed to return so there we were um forced into Exile and um in our case my family you could say was a bit luckier the most we didn't end up in a refugee camp we ended up in England instead because my father got a job uh here in London and so it it's a terrible thing to happen it's a terrible thing to do to a people to force them from their homes force them to go out of their country and try and find some kind of lives for themselves elsewhere I always remember my mother uh would say to us um when we you know when it became clear we had to buy some stuff for the house like a fridge or get some proper Heating in my mother would say no no we're not staying and this idea remained prevalent for I would say maybe up to 5 years before it finally sank in that nobody was coming to the rescue and we were not going to be allowed to go home Mustafa it's now been 75 years uh since the creation of Israel 75 years that Palestinians have been living in Exile holding on to keys of their former homes like the one you symbolically have when you're jacket uh lapel and 75 years of failed negotiations Israel continues to build settlements in the West Bank while blockading and now bombarding Gaza looking at the history of this occupation Mustafa uh has anything changed yeah things changed to the worse I never thought in my whole life that I didn't live the period of the nakba but of course I knew everything about it but I never thought in my whole life that we will see another nakba again or that people will be uh forced to be ethnically cleansed one more time uh I thought we live now in a more civilized world that there is a prevalence of international law and we've been receiving all this information from the West about the respect of Human Rights and democracy and all of the rest and we believe that but I must admit it was wrong because the reality today is that another ethnic cleansing is taking place in Gaza another Act of NBA another catastrophe we are attacked by the most advanced tanks of the West and uh the disaster is horrifying uh 1,200 families have been erased from the Civil record completely you're talking about no less than 15,000 people killed up till now including almost 7,000 children and more than 30 29 30,000 people injured that's about 2% of the total population of Gaza if that has happened in a country like the United States you would be talking about 6 million people injured or killed in less than six weeks so yes and life under occupation has been horrible because in 1967 as you know Israel occupied West Bank and Gaza and since then we've been living under the most terrible occupation all my adult life I spent it under Israeli occupation my father lived under occupation I am living under occupation my daughter is living under occupation it's one generation after the other deprived of our rights deprived of our basic human rights and it goes on and even getting worse because now people in the West Bank are so frightened that we could see also acts of ethnic cleansing here since the settlers who are now 750,000 people in the West Bank armed and already terrorizing Palestinians evicting up till this moment 35 communities from their land in the West Bank so you can imagine the level of fear and worry that people have that it's not just occupation but also another potential for another catastrophe another NBA another occup another another ethnic cleansing the state of Israel was pushed forward by the Zionist movement which emerged in the late 1800s and evolved to become a nation-building project uh in Palestine with of course the support of European countries uh you call the Zionist project quote unworkable namely to set up an ethnically defined Jewish only Collective existing on a land belonging to another people and to their exclusion however Zionist posit that the Jewish people have a right to self-determination and they have a right to statehood uh but is it necessary to even frame self-determination in those terms to frame it through the lens of uh of a nation state well look the only reason that Israel exists number one and uh is maintained to this day number two is entirely to do with Western support if you think about it uh the the the aim was to take take somebody else's country uh expel those people thus creating a space for a new set of people who were Jews coming from different parts of the world and and and declare that place uh a state for Jews uh these immigrants that are coming foreigners that are coming from all over the world in uh in a way in which uh uh the the only way that a state like that could have been created was by violence now that violence and the expulsions it it it it necessitated uh was going to make enemies immediately of the whole region uh so that's a very bad mistake to begin with secondly the only way such a state could survive because in the normal course of things you see when people do that in a particular area they're rejected they're rejected by their neighbors and they have to make do with whatever they can and they eventually tend to leave because it doesn't work the only way that Israel works is with in in unstinting and persistent outside support allow me to push back for a moment because what the Zionist argument would be is two things one that they were already vulnerable globally as a minority they have been subjected to pograms they've been subjected to violence and so they had to develop a state for safety and they needed the support of the West in order to make that happen and they would say the reason why it there is because they have an ancestral tie that there's a long-standing enduring Jewish presence uh in historic Palestine and therefore it's not an arbitrary choice but the place where they're supposed to be what do you say to that well I tell you what I say there was no there was never an objection to uh Jews there was no objection to people coming into Palestine in search of Refuge in search of somewhere where they could be free from persecution that's not the problem that was never the problem the problem was that they not only sought Refuge as they claim but they actually wanted to take the place over and they wanted to exclude the people who actually already lived there whatever they believe their ancestral ties uh were to that particular uh plot of land did not entitle them to to kick out the people living there uh uh at that moment and did not entitle them to set themselves up in the place of the people who lived there that's the problem Mustafa let me bring you in you look like you wanted to respond to that as well yes well we have to see the situation here is as follows first of all the Zionist project is about settler colonialism it's a settler Colonial project when Herzel came up with the idea that Jews have to be to establish a state in Palestine the the Jewish community in Austria sent a delegation it's an interesting story to dis to to to check the situation in Palestine uh and they came back he sent two people and when they came back they told him something very interesting they said you know the pride is beautiful but she's already married meaning there are people already there but the whole Zionist project was based on a very false notion of land without people for people without land uh of course the Israeli the Jewish people have suffered drastically because of the Holocaust it was the most terrible crime they also suffered from the bogams in Russia they suffered from anti-Semitism in Europe but none of that was practiced by Palestinians Palestinians were never responsible for such horrible behavor behavior on the contrary as said Palestinians and Jewish people lived together in in Harmony and no persecution but the problem started when the Zionist movement appeared and they said to Palestinians this is not your land you have to get out of here when Israel was established when when when balford declaration which gave the foundation for this establishment was declared the Palestinians being 90% of the population here own 98% of the land and the Jewish Community which was a minority 10% owned only 2% after Israel was established Palestinians were deprived from their land and now what remained of them in the so-called Israel is on only 3.5% and the rest went to the Israeli establishment so this idea of grabbing the land from others and then forcing them out by by shooting them and killing them is the problem and today this can repeat again the solution is neither to accept two-state solution which Palestinians accepted and and and although it wasn't fair because they were accepting a state in less than half of what the United Nations said they should have still Israel doesn't accept that the two-state solution and although Palestinians accepted that Israel didn't so the other solution would be one Democratic state where we would live in equality but they don't want two states and they don't want Democratic State what do they want they want ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and that is the policy of this government which has fascists in it like smotrich who says we should fill the West Bank with settlements and settlers so that Palestinians would lose any hope of having a state of their own and then they would have one of three options either to immigrate which is ethnic cleansing or to accept a life of subjugation to Israelis which is aparti or die that is the problem that we are living through not because we never refuse to live together with Jewish people in one land in one democratic system it is them who insisted especially after passing that law in the Israeli keset of Jewish state law which says that the right of self-determination in AIT Israel meaning all of Palestine is exclusive for Jewish people that is the problem racism here the Jewish racism is the problem that is preventing peace and preventing a solution in this land uh Mustafa just talked about different solutions one state two State you just wrote a book uh titled one state the only Democratic future for Palestine Israel uh and you have rejected the idea of a two-state solution as a realistic one why is a two-state solution unrealistic in your estimation well the two-state solution is impossible for two very important reasons first of all logistically if you look at the map uh you will see that the area which should form the Palestinian state is pockmarked by Israeli settlements until and unless uh western states or those people who support the two-state solution come forward and say those settlements will be removed therefore releasing a viable territory for the pales Palestinian State unless that happens we cannot talk about a Palestinian State because there's no territory on which to place it one two in terms of the Justice uh and the fairness of a solution like this what the two-state solution proposes is that four fifths of the land of Palestine should remain with Israel and 1th 20% 22% should go to the Palestinian State uh now the Palestinian people uh as Mustafa quite rightly points out are already in the area between the uh the the sea the river and the Sea are already in a majority 7.5 million uh as opposed to 7 million so they're already slightly more than half uh there are other pal Ians people like me in Exile 5 to six million uh Palestinian refugees living in un camps now those are also they also have rights they also have the right to live in their own state but it can't be done uh in a fifth of the original Palestine so in terms of equity Justice and Logistics it's not a possible solution so we really must stop talking about it because it's been used as a a soporific an anesthetic in which uh you know to lull people into a belief that something is being done or something will be done for the Palestinians don't worry there will be two states and it's going to be fine except that it's not happening and it's not going to happen therefore where are we going with this that was the the question in my book what what what what's the end of this the end of it it seems to me to be very clear we've got uh two communities living in that area between the river and the Sea um the Jewish Israelis Palestinian Arabs um what more sensible and logical and Humane and and fair than to for them to all live together in equal citizenship in one state which represents them fairly that is a Democratic state in a state like that all the Palestinians who were expelled uh due to the creation of Israel and who live in C is that not is that not a political non is is that not a political non-starter as well no Israeli is going to accept that because they would argue that that's demographic destruction and that is the de the destruction of the Jewish state which is the very premise of Israel is that a political non-starter as a practical matter of course you'd say that of course you'd say that everybody would say that but I'm putting it to you and I put it in the book very very clearly I think that first of all there is this idea do you I don't mean you personally obviously but do people support the idea of these two communities living together in equality in a democracy that's the first question and the second question is how are we going to get there so in a way what happens is one starts to talk about this and immediately the second question is thrown in one's face how is it going to happen Israelis will never accept it Etc let's just pause for a moment let's take the idea in itself isn't that the Natural end point to this whole tragedy isn't it the Natural end point the answer is of course yes it is so the only question we need to ask is how do we get there uh the the trajectory that Israel is bent on now is a complete dead end that's the trajectory of of maintaining uh its Presence by force of it trying to Chuck the Palestinians are trying to kill them trying to destroy their lives that is a trajectory which has to come to an end before you two go I have just uh one more question for you it doesn't appear that the International Community is reigning uh the Israeli government in or the Israeli military in uh what will happen if Israel is successful in its attempt to completely destroy Hamas and also what will the future of the region be uh I'll start with you uh look first of all there's there's an there's an assumption there which I don't think we're entitled to make which is that Israel might destroy Hamas now I'm not saying that for for any partisan reason at all I'm afraid the uh uh the record so far is not encouraging for Israel in terms of its victory over Hamas however the but still the the the question remains uh what is actually going to H how is this going to play out what is going to happen now I without answering you directly I tell you what I really do want to say it's that there are certain things that are hidden here in in in the discussions always about Israel Palestine about this conflict first that the Palestinians have been fighting and are still fighting not just Israel they're fighting Israel and the whole of the western world that is deeply unfair it's beyond the capacity of any one group let alone a small people to fight so many foes number one number two there is a consensus in the West on the necessity uh on the essential nature of maintaining Israel in the sort of position that it is in now in other words an Israel which is supremacist which is dominant which uh smites its enemies at the drop of a hat there is a consensus in the West on maintaining this kind of Israel why what does that mean what does that say about you what what is it that it takes that Israel is doing for these western states that they can't get in any other way except through this extreme cruelty uh against an innocent people the Palestinian people the time has come to talk about all this out into the open Mustafa well unfortunately nobody looks at the fact that Israel is conducting a war on hospitals on children on infants in in incubators nobody looks at the fact that so many Palestinians are killed and nobody looks at the fact that Israel is about to conduct the worst kind of catastrophe even worse than what happened in 1948 and they still for continue to support Israel I need to understand what makes a country like the United States of America or Britain or any other European country refuse ceasefire but by which law and let me tell you I came to the conclusion that those people this Criminal Mind that mindset that allowed the Holocaust against Jewish people the most horrible crime against Jewish people the same mindset that allowed persecution of Jewish people in a form of anti-Semitism because they were weak it's the same set of mind the same mindset that is allowing now a catastrophe and another Holocaust for the Palestinians it's the same kind of thinking and that should not be allowed and that has to stop that has to stop and and the way to achieve that is immediate ceasefire today in Gaza immediate stopping of these Israeli settlers from committing their crimes against Palestinians in the West Bank and facing Israel with reality I agree with what Gada said you want to State solution you have to take out all the settlers from the West Bank otherwise there cannot be a solution cannot be two-state solution you don't want two State solution let's have one state solution but to think that we the Palestinians will ever accept to be immigrants again to to to live another catastrophe again or live under a system of Oppression and aperti and be slaves of occupation and aparti this will never happen we will never accept to stop struggling for our freedom for our dignity and for our rights all right that's all we have time for Mustafa thank you both so much for joining me everyone that is our show upfront we'll be back next
