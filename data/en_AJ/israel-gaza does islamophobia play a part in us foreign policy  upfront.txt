as the death toll in Palestine continues to mount the United States maintains its staunch support of Israel's war on Gaza Washington's stance has come under heavy criticism and some question why Palestinian lives don't seem to be valued in the same way as those of victims of other conflicts so is there a double standard when it comes to Palestinian victims of war joining me to discuss this are the authors of a recent report on how islamophobia shapes US foreign policy Sahar aiz is the distinguished professor of Law and Middle East legal studies at Ruckers University and author of the racial Muslim when racism quashes religious freedom we're also joined by Mitchell plitnik president of rethinking foreign policy and co-director of Jewish voice for peace he's also the author of accept for Palestine the limits of progressive politics of which I am of course a co-author so good to see both of you Sahar I'm going to start with you uh in this report you two mentioned that islamophobia is a ubiquitous ingredient in US policy that's a provocative phrase what do you mean a ubiquitous ingredient essentially since 911 so over 22 years American foreign policy and national security policies has been have been centered around the vilification of Muslims and the Muslim body and the religion of Islam as terrorist violent anti-American illiberal misogynistic and also anti-Semitic and as a result the entire Society has been primed and socialized by the media by schools by politicians and their rhetoric to presume that Muslims are Outsiders they're a threat and part of that otherization of Muslims is this false teaching of Americans that Muslims are taught to hate Jews that Islam teaches Muslims to hate Jews and that is racist right and unfortunately then what happens is when a Muslim or an Arab wants to engage in human rights advocacy wants to engage in foreign policy dissent or critiques that in any way criticize the state of Israel's practices and policies or in any way defend the Palestinians human rights they're automatically placed in this islamophobic Trope that oh your motivations are anti-semitic they're not actually liberal values to support human rights for all people including Palestinians how does this play out in foreign policy Mitchell how does this notion that Muslims are naturally uh disposed toward homophobia illiberalism barbarity Etc how does this stuff play out in foreign policy well I think you know one we're we're seeing a really good example of it I think unfortunately right now with the uh bombardment of Gaza we the approach of American lawmakers has been that Israel is entitled to do what it uh what it is doing um even if it even if they say that it's causing a few too many civilian casualties which is uh you know frankly an important statement uh in its minimization of the devastation in Gaza um it it demonstrated how little uh value is placed on Palestinian lives and how easily is that because Palestinians are r as Muslim because obviously the Christians or Palestinian Jews yeah I mean this is one of the things we actually open the report by by saying we're we're using islamophobia very broadly and we're using it to include anti-arab uh uh uh bigotry as well as anti- Palestinian specifically anti- Palestinian bigotry with the understanding that uh it it's a particular Dynamic and the islamophobic tropes are applied to all Arabs but right now we're seeing how easily that uh um our political leaders are are just treating Palestinian lives as disposable and as worthless you know you can contrast it with the statements about the Hamas attack on uh on October 7th where there is correct in in my view and and absolutely Justified outrage at the atrocities and the mass murder that was committed on that day as there should be because people are people are valuing Israeli lives as all lives should be valued we're not seeing the same thing when it comes to the people of Gaza or the people of the West Bank not seeing anything like that and that is the result of um years and years and years of islamophobia anti-arab racism being pumped into our discourse into our media and into our policy discussions Sahar I've also noticed the language that's used to talk about Hamas versus the language that's been used to talk about the Israeli State people are very matter of factly using words like barbaric uncivilized to talk about Hamas and not just Hamas but also people who are living in Gaza so how does that kind of language how does that kind of framing help sort of normalize the Israeli response in other words if we to use Mitch language if we see them as not human does it make it easier to bomb them it does it make it easier to see them as collateral damage well history didn't start on October 7 and islamophobia didn't start even on in 2001 on 9911 so what the American government has always done to persuade its people to to support violence that actually contradicts the very values they're taught in schools which is equality human rights human dignity equal opportunity is to characterize the enemy as barbaric Savage un civilized and therefore this vilification of the Muslim and the Arab and the Palestinian must exist in order for Israel to Pro proceive the unconditional support because it's seen as an Outpost of White America an outpost of European civilization and the Palestinians are seen as the extension of this pre- 911 and pre even colonial era of the Clash of civilizations between the Christian West and the Muslim East so all of this is is unsurprising I think what is shocking to many of us who study this you know checkered history is this degree in which uh the Israelis are killing Palestinians the rate at which they're dying or being killed so the the war crimes are clear by the Israeli side and yes Hamas has committed war crimes too but in contrast we condemn Hamas we don't fund Hamas and we value the P the Israeli victims and the hostages and their lives but we treat the Palestinians as if in the words of one of the Israeli officials as human animals and shame on us for doing that the we and the US that you're referring to is the United States and this comes up in the report as well Mitchell because you talk about a radicalized double standard which is quote most acute for Muslim or Arab Americans when they exercise their free speech rights to criticize the US government's failure to hold uh Israel accountable for its actions uh could you elaborate on what you mean uh when you all say a radicalized double standard I think we saw a great example of that in Congress um yeah just a few weeks ago you know centuring a member of the house is a rare occurrence um outside uh six people six people and three of them were were um were people who supported the Confederacy right so outside of that issue there's Rashida Tali the only palestinian-american in Congress became only the third uh um uh person to be censured um and what was she censured for essentially Rashida was censured for standing up for Palestinian rights this is exact exactly what we're talking about when I and and Rashida is a Muslim um and she uh spoke up for her people um I think this is a an absolutely Sterling example of what we're talking about in the report that if you are Muslim you are you are going to be uh you're going to be censured for for speaking of for human rights and you're particularly going to be accused of anti-Semitism if you stand up for Palestinian rights this is the irony of the of what is being done the uh the accusation against Rashid Talib for um that that she is anti-Semitic because she stood up for Palestinian rights that is itself anti-Semitism because it presumes that that jewishness is aligned with the violence of the Israel St EXA and and and essentially stigmatizes anyone who stands up for Universal human rights because there is supposed to be as as as was put in our book um an exception for Palestine that and that again is anti-Semitic because you are you are somehow singling this is where you're singling out Jewish people for special treatment and while it looks like you're doing us a favor what you're actually doing is fomenting resentment we have seen this repeated throughout particularly European Jewish history where Jews get certain protections from the ruling class for a certain amount of time and when there's uh pressure on that ruling class and they want to shift blame to the Jews they say look how how they took advantage of you and look how much better they had it while you were suffering in your peasantry this is the same Dynamic repeating itself um and it's using Palestinian blood to do it which makes it I think a double crime so Sahar you say Muslims and Jews are often pitted against each other in what you call a zero sum game what do you mean well Jews and Muslims are not raised or taught to hate each other and in fact if we were to talk about the history of the experiences of the Jewish people people you would find that their treatment was much much better in Muslim majority countries than it was in Christian majority countries and in Europe but also they share many values either based on secular political ideological commitments or even religious commitments and when you uh when you define incorrectly anti-Semitism as opposition to a political ideology in this case political Zionism or if you define anti-Semitism incorrectly as an opposition to a state's practices and policies in this case the state of Israel what you do is you create a unnecessary false wedge between Muslims and Jews soah does does the recent house resolution make this even more complicated because I hear what you're saying I hear what both of you are saying right which is this isn't that hard anti-Semitism is the hatred and violence against Jews for being Jewish and then there are critiques of Israel there are questions about uh Zionism Etc which are different uh there is a very real rise in anti-Semitism that has occurred around the world uh both before October 7th and certainly afterward but then you have a house resolution house resolution 894 which explicitly states that the that anti-zionism is anti-Semitism uh is that dangerous and if so why this resolution reflects politics in America it reflects the one decided uh support for a particular country and our politicians opposition to the human rights human dignity of the Palestinian people if you look at the organizations that are tracking the amount of uh hate incidents and ciil rights discrimination cases and complaints by Muslim and Arab students in colleges and workplaces the Council on American Islamic relations for example the Arab American Anti-Defamation committee Muslim Advocates there are numerous nonprofit organizations that serve Muslim Arab South Asian communities and they have shown that the number of hate incidents and bias incidents has risen by almost by over 200% in the last eight months why isn't Congress concerned about that population of American citizens so I think it's telling that they have abs they seem to care about religious bigotry but only for one group and then they misde Define it and they don't care about religious bigotry against Muslims when it is rising at an equally startling level in the United States all right that'll have to be the last word there Sahar aiz Mitchell plitnik thanks so much for joining me on up front all right everyone that is our show up front we'll be back next
