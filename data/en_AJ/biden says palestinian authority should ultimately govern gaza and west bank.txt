Joe Biden says Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure as work continues towards a two State solution let's go to John hullman who's in Washington D DC with more on this and John President Biden calling for this reunited structure for governance what else did he have to say well I think he also had an answer for uh president Mahmud abas that we just heard in that sound bite asking for him to step in he actually said in this oped for the Washington Post that he rejected the idea of even a ceasefire he said that he did agree with and he was advocating for humanitarian pauses but he said that if there's a ceasefire then it will just be an opportunity that Hamas exploits to rebuild their stockpile of rockets and regroup uh regroup their their Fighters so it seems that that appeal uh from abass has fallen really on deaf ears he did also talk uh President Biden in his his oped about the plight of the Palestinian people um saying that he was sadden and I believe that his heart was breaking because of that situation uh he also talked very briefly about the fact that the US is trying to help increase the flow of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza but that was only a very brief mention really what he really wanted to get into was a long-term plan even as we're in the midst of this he was talking about reuniting as you say Neeve uh the occupied West Bank and the Gaza under the control of the Palestinian Authority he didn't mention how that would be done what the mechanism would be if there would be elections and that's a bit of a fny point because the Palestinian Authority hasn't had an election since 2006 even though uh it's controlling uh the occupied uh West Bank in the intervening uh period so we'll have to see how this all plays out first but he's getting quite ahead of himself in talking about an outcome uh well there's a situation that the United Nations says on the ground in Gaza a lot of people are in immediate danger of starvation and John there are these reports of concern disapproval perhaps in a number of government departments within Biden's Administration about what Biden's doing when it comes to Bringing about an end to these hostilities what more has been said yeah there's definitely different strains of thought there's been a letter uh this week by more than 500 members of government agencies anonymously saying protesting basically against President Biden's support of Israel but there's also been a letter from more than a 100 former members of his administration and uh President Obama's administration saying that they support it so I think there's definitely two camps here in the United States and that's not just the government it's also obviously public opinion there's been a poll this week by reuter and nipo uh in which uh uh just under a third of people uh say that the United States shouldn't be supporting uh Israel and that 68% of people uh agree that there with a statement that there should be a ceasefire in negotiations that Israel should do that so I think public opinion uh is going to only get more important as we get closer to the presidential elections we're still a year away from that at the moment right John many thanks for that public opinion and uh foreign policy seem to be going in different directions thank you
