the heads of the American and Israeli intelligence agencies have met in Cairo for Talks brokered by Egyptian andq officials the discussions are aimed at reaching a deal to end the war on Gaza but the meeting is ended without a clear breakthrough israelian media is reporting that serious disagreements remain we're going to bring in Hassan barari he's professor of international Affairs at Kut University he's also researcher at the center for strategic studies at the University of Jordan he's joining us here in Doha good to have you with I want to ask you about those talks in a moment but first of all I want to talk to you about the Drone strike that uh that hit our aler journalists our correspondents um and the cameraman now we know that there's a large number of journalists Palestinian journalists particularly who have been uh targeted in Israel's war on Gaza why do you think it appears this is the fifth time that Al jaer journalists have been targeted why do you think Al jazer is being singled out I think they're trying to Target Jer correspondent simply because they want to silence them uh they're very annoyed by the Jer cavage they know that Jer enjoy a wide world uh kind of audience and they wanted just to make sure that you know uh El jaaz probably they want them to behave uh and this is one thing secondly they want to kill the eyewitness you know because what aler is doing is is documenting all the atrocities and the the genocidal attacks against the Palestinians and third they want to I think they want to put on Qatar and Qatar is is mediating the whatever truth going to going to take place in in days to come or weeks to come I don't know when and they quite often the Israelis the karite to put a lot of pressures on Hamas to give in and to kind of be flexible when it comes to the uh to the terms of of uh of the truth and they want the the ter of the truth to be uh to the like of Netanyahu and serve his own interest because um he wanted to have a kind of Victory internally he wanted he want to tell the Israeli that my leadership has been uh uh good has paid off and uh and he wants the katari to do and help him realize uh what he failed to realize in the Battleground and that's jaer is being targeted all these cameramen and correspondents I think this is a clear message to Qatar that Kat should step and and do think that would be in line with Israeli interest as we were just mentioning I mean k playing a key role in the the talks to try to find some sort of root map towards a ceasefire uh in Gaza there that brings us of course to the talks that are going on in Cairo at the moment there had been some sense of a cautious optimism prior to these talks in Cairo very cautious but now we understand that at least this initial this latest round um has really ended in in nothing and the Israeli delegation I understand um has gone back to Tel Aviv is the optimism still Justified do you think I think it is but uh probably not soon you know we're not going to see like impact in probably 10 days or two weeks to come uh simply because Netanyahu um ordered his his team go to Karen just to listen not even to engage in any any discussion H he is not interested in the truth as being suggested by Egyptian katarian Dem Americans simply because he wanted the war to continue uh he knows that if uh things work out out for the truth and then maybe there would be a kind of ceasefire for I don't know 45 days two months you know because we heard different virgins H this will probably change the Dynamics within the Israeli society and Nan would be held accountable for the the wrongdoing that is committed um don't forget that only 16% of the Israelis U think that he fit the bill of leadership and the the vast majority say uh you know netan should step down or should be replaced in after after the war comes to an end so he knows you know once this comes to an end he would be also uh put on trial because of other issues mainly corruption uh so it's a kind of fake leap for him to continue the war simply because the war would give him the opportunity would give him probably a future chances to claim that he has led Israel into Victory and and this would probably improve his image and mitigate the whatever bad image about him about his his management of the War uh so the last thing that he want to see is ceas fire right now uh because Israel failed to realize the twin objectives um like you know destroying Hamas and release the the hostages uh and if this going to be through the uh the truth like you know the hostages think Hamas going to be be continuing like in in in Gaza and this would be against his interest and he then he cannot claim victory and as we know in the first truce remember the first month of the War uh it was seen in even in Israel as a victory for Hamas uh so his leadership is being at at tresk and he want the the continuation of the war for some sometimes another reason for that is that rightwing component of his government uh I I think this is a problem for him because they threaten that if he agrees uh to a ceas fire they will pull out and and this will bring down his government and this will probably open the door for a new Dynamic that will hurt Nano personally mhm I want to ask you about one of the other key players in the ne in these negotiations Egypt of course now um Egypt has said that it is growing concerned about the possibility that Palestinians are going to be forced to cross the border from Gaza into Northern Sinai and that would create a significant problem for them there had been concerns that the peace agreement that exists between Egypt and Israel might suffer as a result of that if if that happened Egypts come out and said no actually the agreement is going to be still in place but if Palestinians are forced AC cross the border from Gaza into Northern Sinai that is going to one would imagine make things very difficult for Egypt to remain as a a neutral player if you like in the negotiations how do you think Egypt is going to have to respond if that happens I I think Egypt right now is in limbo you know in the one hand they want the uh peace treaty with Israel to continue because they benefit from that and here I'm talking about the government they received a lot of uh economic AIDS from the Americans because of the uh Camp David agreement uh but on on the other hand uh a lot of statements coming from senior Egyptian officials say that uh the migration of the Palestinians into siai would pose a threat to their National Security and they're willing to send up to the Israelis uh this is what we understand but lately also they deploy some tanks uh on the um northern border of uh of uh uh of Sinai uh sorry in the southern border of Sai and because they want to prevent the any any probably uh Force migration into their own land I don't know how this going to play out because if naano pushed them to go and then the Egyptian interfered like militarily speaking especially probably we're going to witness kind of Israeli Egyptian clash and this would be an escalation I think the Americans will not tolerate that and they probably will put a lot of pressures on on Netanyahu but we know that Netanyahu is in in defi so he might do anything he's like really a risky man is dangerous man he might probably cause uh an escalation with with Egypt and this would be um I think this would be a game changer for the whole conflict Hass Bahar we really appreciate you giving us the benefit of your analysis on that thank you so much indeed
