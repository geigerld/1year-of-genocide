the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah says it's carried out several attacks on towns in northern Israel Israel has responded by launching a wave of air strikes on the group's positions in Lebanese border towns the Army says it targeted military buildings and rocket launcher sits let's get more on this from Ali Hashim he's in Aura in southern Lebanon Ali I understand just the last hour or so there's been new strikes take us through that oh yes Sami it's not a calm day today in South Lebanon several Israeli bombardments uh on the uh borderline with Lebanon also a couple of attacks by heah on Israeli positions heah announced uh yesterday that one of its Fighters has been killed also just few minutes from now another statement by hasah uh said that another fighter was killed in an Israeli air strike today on jab the areas that were hit where here where we are in nakura the vicinity of this Village has been hid by artillery also towards the uh the East M jabal maraba uh also on the other side the Israeli side the uh town of matat hasah said that its own fighters launched an um anti-missile uh towards um a military position inat of course till the moment there are no um reports of casualties however this is just the beginning of the day n how are the Israeli objectives in this conflict in the north shaping up so far well the uh conflict over here started being at the beginning it was intertwined with with the situation inaz was saying that it attacks mainly in solidarity and support but later on things started developing and that was actually expected Israel started um requesting that Hezbollah moves from the borderline uh as a a condition so that it wouldn't launch a military campaign on Lebanon and there's been several mediations going on in this regard Israel is um saying that it's people in the north there are thousands of Israelis who are right now displaced just the same like on the other side in Lebanon where also thousands of Lebanese are displaced well Israel is saying that the only condition for its people to get back to the border is that hasah gets away and hasah till the moment isn't giving a clear clear answer but they are linking the whole conversation over the presence on the on the border to the end of the war the complete end of the war in Gaza and then after that there there is going to be maybe uh a conversation about that but given even what we're hearing from hisbah officials or what they're hinting to they don't seem to have the intention to leave the Border Without Really without any any any any situation I mean they don't really think that an Israeli campaign could really get them out of of here because this happened in 2006 and they didn't leave the the Border despite the United Nations security Council resolution 1701 all right we'll leave it there thanks so much Ali Hashim
