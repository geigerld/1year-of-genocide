let's bring in Omar Shure uh you're a professor of security and Military studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies om uh as we look back at day one of this ceasefire and this prisoner swap agreement between Israel and Hamas what lessons do you draw from that well it's very difficult to draw lessons so far but yeah very early in this process very early but but there's good news it did not collapse so far because you saw the details yesterday there was so uh multi-dimensions going on from the Poli iCal to the communications to the logistics to the the military side to the repositioning so there was so many details and there are we're doing this by uh the Diplomatic efforts of Qatar and and the US and Egypt uh and from but from far you know it's by by Communications there are no peacekeepers there there's no Force to really monitor the mediator Qatar has nobody on the ground yeah yeah so and and actually no no media as well so no no the journalists are escorted but they're not free to uh monitor the situation in a in any free way so within this uh OPAC environment you know things can go wrong very simply so so far uh there are some violations clearly especially with shooting at the Palestinians who were trying to go back home uh however it's holding uh the the the first part of the exchange happened uh yesterday we're seeing now preparations for the second part so it seems to me that um it's happening and and it's not the the the it's not really the trust between the two sides that's making happen it's very clever mediation on one end and a lot of efforts put in that uh but on the other hand it seems to me that this is one of the Israeli operations objectives to to to release the the hostages and the captives uh and on the other end also I think Hamas does not want that that that size of especially on the civilians you saw women you saw children probably you think they don't want to hold as many captives as they have no they don't want to because it's a it's a major responsibility especially on the civilian side it's also very hard to it's it will be taking responsibility for a a larger number in a Warfare situ in a war situation uh where uh monitoring them providing security for them even feeding them is is probably U an issue so the Lesser they have uh I think the the more well it's very hard to use the word term control but the the the more that they H they will have control over them and therefore you know prolong they would if this deal goes through as it's currently structured it's it's it's 50 captives that Hamas would have to release over the course of four days which would leave them still with 170 to 190 captives I mean that's just an estimate right um so that's still a lot of captives for them to be to be handling especially if the war resumes um true uh but also it it can give give a chance for another uh truth another 4 days uh for of exchanges and so on I think I don't think the the that size was by Design uh but it happened and in a way it's a it's a a check for Hamas to be able to stop uh and have some pauses in the fighting while doing such exchanges uh whether the Israelis will agree to this this is another issue because now now they're thinking that the operation is going relatively well uh and therefore they want to advance more and and that that's why they were resisting U you know having this pause and it took some significant International pressures to do so I looked at the public statements from both Israel and Hamas and they're saying they're saying some very similar things on both sides they're saying that yes we would like actually and we are willing to continue the prisoner swap beyond the four days that are currently agreed and both sides are saying once this is done we will resume the war and we will fight even harder both sides have said that so if you look at the official statements it's hard to know really where this is going so let's let's disregard the official official statements from both Israel and Hamas for a moment and maybe consider what their incentives might be at the end of the 4-day ceasefire do you think they are more incentivized to continue the prisoner swap going continue the ceasefire going or to go back to fighting I think it will have to do with where are we on the fourth day uh on one end if there are no major uh violations uh and these exchanges are well reflected probably for the Netanyahu government on one end uh but also for Hamas on the other if this is going on well I think we may see some extension if things collapsed uh for one reason or the other or U the Israeli site particularly saw uh more opportunities in terms of the amount of ISR the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance they have the their positioning their defensive positioning if they saw more opportunity there to probably destroy and degrade Hamas I think they they may take this uh opportunity uh for the Hamas side I think it's it's probably the the idea of prolonging the truth is very useful uh for them uh on one end but also the idea of reducing the uh the number of uh of hostages taken I think also uh will help them in a in a way so overall it's interesting because they they agree on two things on on uh releasing some of the hostages at least and continuing War afterwards Omar sh thank you very much we'll talk to you again throughout the afternoon next
