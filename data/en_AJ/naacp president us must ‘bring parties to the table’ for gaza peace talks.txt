I'm pleased to say I'm joined by NAACP president and CEO Derek Johnson joins us live now from Washington DC Mr Johnson welcome to Al deser it's good to have you with us uh now the NAACP very well known as a Civil Rights group in the United States not known to for into foreign policy so what's Driven this well we are beginning to see the impact of the GL global conflict here domestically are we see the increase in racial attacks against African Americans increase in anti-semetic Behavior increase in anti-islamic uh uh presence and that is troubling it's also troubling when you we're leading into the November election where we need to truly focus in on what would be the state of democracy of moving forward for nacp we really are concerned with the quality of this democracy to ensure that we are leading democracy and wherever possible we can advocate for a peaceful agreements when conflicts are having a domestic impact yes because we have a situation here where you have the US Administration calling for the ceasefire on one hand on and on the other of course is sending in arms that perpetuate the conflict well our concern is in this moment we have so many civilians who've been impacted and we want to see the the death of young children uh no longer be the case the hostages must be released we have to get the parties to the table to begin to talk about a way forward that's peaceful so that we can heal from this moment it is unfortunate uh what we have seen uh none of this should have taken place but now we can have a solution and that solution is forcing the parties to the table to come up with a peaceful solution how much harder do you think Joe Biden has made it for himself to be reelected over this issue well I'm not going to go into his electability I am going to talk about the African-American communities and the concerns that's been expressed and those concerns are how do we get to a place where uh we can see peace in this conflict and our voters here could begin to focus on what's important the worst thing that can happen in the November election is we have someone with white supremacist sympathies and if that happens in that white house the African-American Community will be under attack the Jewish Community will be under attack uh the Islamic community be under attack uh we have a United reason to ensure that we stay focused on November so we can protect against a level of un lawlessness here in the United States that we can't avoid if we focus on what's important how much support do you think there is generally in the United States for your position well I can't speak to the United States I can say in the African-American Community there was Prof profound concern about what is being uh witnessed on social media and all of the images uh for many African-Americans we absolutely deplored what happened on October 7th that should have not have happened that was a killing of innocent Israeli lives and at the exact same time those same African-Americans are really upset about what they're seeing to Children uh in Gaza at the end of the day uh this nation need to lead a process of bringing people together to ensure a peaceful resolutions so we can get about the business of focusing on what's important here domestically the war has been going on for what eight months now what is it that has pushed you to this moment at this point what escalation of the harm and the civilian casualties the ongoing views of of civilians being harmed uh the religious community and the black community they are they are standing up very strong that's our base to say wait a minute we can do this differently we are the glow uh leading nation and we should uh do this differently we commend President Biden for calling for a ceasefire now we have to put some muscle behind that to ensure the parties get to the table and we can come up with an agreement Derek Johnson good to have you with us here in aleser I appreciate that thank you very much thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
