welcome back you're watching alra with me S Ram a reminder of our top stories Health authorities in Gaza say 50 people have been killed and dozens more injured in Israeli attacks across the strip on Thursday more than 200 have been killed in the past 24 hours Israel is intensifying its campaign in Central and Southern Gaza it says six of its soldiers have been killed in the latest battles with Palestinian Fighters 156 troops have died since the start of the ground offensive and the Israeli Army has conducted one of its largest raid across the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began at least one Palestinian has been killed in the confrontations and dozens injured let's bring in man bashara alaza senior political analyst there are so many moving parts to this story and it's been like this for weeks now but I just wondered whether you had noticed a change in tone when it comes to the nature of the war and the way people are talking now compared to what they've been or how they've been talking in the weeks previous absolutely there is change uh the change is slow coming but it is coming unfortunately it comes after uh you know tens of thousands of casualties in Gaza uh but clearly more and more analysts including uh among uh Israel's darling friends in the United States and and and the United Kingdom whereby uh more or less observers analysts academics beginning to talk about how Israel is not achieving objectives why these objectives are not achievable in the first place and why there should be some change of course at this point in time not just because President Biden would would like it not just because America insists on it but it's also because Israel apparently will need it uh otherwise it's going to get stuck with more of the same but we do have an Israeli government that's also being observed nowadays uh among various observers is that Netanyahu has has a separate agenda from that of Israel per se he has a Personal Agenda that involves prolonging the war in as much as possible because he wants to move in from being the political criminal he is to becoming a wartime hero that's not working very well for him now that more and more Israeli soldiers are dying that more and more Palestinian civilians are dying and the Israeli public is becoming more and more Restless a change of course as you say involves a change of dialogue even within the Israeli dispora which you just talked about it feels like there is a vying not just for position right now in the politique but also in the future in terms of an election we it only seems like yesterday when we had an Israeli election again and again and again I think four of them in the year but that's what it all ends up being or or heading towards doesn't it being in control and and setting the agenda for the future of the state of Israel well clearly um uh you you know when you look at the history Israel is like a political circus when it comes to its politics uh every politician is a political animal in that country and they really VI in every possible mean uh to get ahead and nanah is of course Infamous for it and that's why he's in indicted a number of uh uh uh corruption charges because it actually involves advancing his political career you know against the law in within the country but most Israelis do it now the difference here when it comes against the backdrop of the war is actually quite uh instructive we have two kinds of politicians today in Israel we have what you would like what we would call the disciplined warmongers and the undisciplined warmongers the disciplined warmongers are like guns and Galant who are running a military who would like it to be organized and they would like it to execute orders the way it should be executing orders even if that involves genocide but it is an army that is professional carrying out orders of a state where there's a political hierarchy and so and so forth and then there is the undisciplined warmongers the Rogue elements within the government itself like the BV and the SMR and others who encourage settlers violence against the Palestinians who would like to cut all Aid to the Palestinians in Gaza who would like to cut all fuel to the Palestinians in Gaza who would like to crack down on prisoners who would like to carry uh the ma the maximum punishment sentence including killing of prisoners and and so on so forth so you have two kinds right and they are vying today in a very populist way over the future of the country the the generals and the military disciplined individuals like guns and and Galant and the other Rogue elements and believe it or not the Rogue elements are actually gaining Traction in the country and they've been gaining Traction in country for a good number of years and that reminds me just quickly of the most famous sage in Israel's recent history by the name of yesah he said right after the 1967 war he said if we're going to occupy Gaza and the West Bank we are going to become our soldiers will become jidu nais we will become the occupiers the oppressors and eventually we will become genocides that's been predicted 55 years ago can imagine how this country really is moving quickly towards a more populist extreme uh kind of uh polit politics that will eventually lead to no place for reconciliation and peace negotiations with the Palestinians we'll continue to unpick this throughout the day for the moment M bashara thank you
