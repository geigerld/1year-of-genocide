well Israeli forces have fire tear gas at dozens of Palestinians trying to enter the old city in occupi Jerusalem they were attempting to reach alak a mosque for Friday prayers uh the Hamas group name its military operation against Israel alaxa flood as a response to Israeli attacks on worshippers at the mosque the Alexa mosque compound is one of the Hol sites for Muslims Jews and Christians it also symbolizes the daily injustices faced by the Palestinian in occupied East Jerusalem and its legal status has been well a constant flash point alexer is Islam's thirdd Hol site Jews refer to it as Temple Mount and believe that two biblical temples once stood there it's home to the Dome of the Rock where Muslims believe the prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven it's sometimes confused with the mosque but the mosque itself lies here at the southern end of the compound only Muslims are allowed to pray in its compound and then there's the Western Wall where Jews from around the world come to pray they believe it's the remains of an ancient Temple Sarah haret joins us live from Lion gate another gate gate in The Old City to occupied East Jerusalem so uh sah tell us about the security situation where you are yeah uh I just want to give you a backgrounder as to what lion gate is lion gate is one of seven Gates that allows you into Al AXA MOS compound it's an area that includes Al mosque now we came earlier it was very very quiet you can clearly see that security is stepped up though and initially we were being told by some uh of the Palestinian Muslim worshippers that they were uh not allowing certain ages in uh that number has varied however speaking to a lot of the locals they're saying that uh most of the youngsters uh certainly under the age of 35 haven't been allowed to the prayers because of the situation at the moment we ourselves witness some of the women being turned away some of the youngsters being turned away um some people including for example uh an older male he told me he was 66 from an area called silwan now silwan has been a hot spot for tensions between uh Palestinians uh as well as Israeli Security Forces here in Old Jerusalem but I actually want you to speak we want to speak to halem who's just come out from that Friday prayer um Halen can you tell us what's the situation for Palestinians certainly from Jerusalem that are wanting to pray here at ala mosque um this has happened before where they've prevented people of certain ages from entering I'm talking about the Israeli Security Forces is it any different today when you entered and what was your experience coming in it Tru you know today is Friday and we come here to to pray Friday praying and uh once I got from outside I faced three checkpoints actually and they just hosted you know they KT us um for half an hour then because we are you know above 50 years old they let us go inside and once we get you know the first checkpoint we go to the second checkpoint and then here they stop us here and they check my bag what I hold and so on and so forth so we get in inside the the mosque and un teally there there's no there only a few prayers inside the mosque because they didn't let you know prayers Muslim prayers to get and to pray freely in the I I spoke to a Palestinian uh in a wheelchair that had to uh pray just further down there um because it was difficult for him to enter um and he said that it's really quiet here uh today which is very unusual because of course AKA MOS is the third holiest site for Muslims um are you concern concerned about moving forward after the situation and and Israel declaring war as a as a jerus as someone who is from Jerusalem you were telling me what is the situation for you right now and in terms of movement are people staying at home can you tell me more about that experience absolutely you know the situation is so tense for example I have a boy he's like 16 years old I keep him all the time at home I don't let him go outside even to to buy anything from any Europe Supermarket or some something else because you know the Israeli police uh policemen the Israeli security uh I don't know they they check everybody they harass every every single every single Palestinian in Jerusalem and they don't hesitate even to shoot to shoot young Palestinians for nothing for for for I don't know maybe no no reason yeah okay well I just also um thank you very much halem for speaking to us um of course we were just down I just want to turn around here if Marina can show you just to give you an idea of where we are this is uh the old wall that surrounds the old uh City I'll just move out of the way there and further down on the left is actually the Greek Orthodox church and we spoke to them earlier of course tensions last week were high for them with Israeli settlers spitting at churches we've seen arise in those incidences and he said they're concerned in fact that church is um said to be the birthplace of Mary a mother of uh Jesus and it's a very considered a very holy site for Christians as well I'm just going to take you down this Lane over here because this is another area where the um secur Israeli security forces have were preventing um the youngsters from entering they've actually moved a lot of uh the barricades but you know uh there's a lot less that the moment Security Forces we did see some scuffles uh between them and if you move if you just turn this way to the left here up these stairs this is where a lot of the youngsters ended up taking the steps up there and had to just sort of pray on the side of course this is not the first time that we have been seeing this happening uh for Friday prayers when it comes to entry to Al AKA mosque but as I said and as you heard from Hal there it has been much quieter because a note was sent out to say that youngsters under a certain age should not be allowed uh to pray andos because of course there are fears of tensions Rising back to you Nick sah thanks for that sah heart there at Lion's gate The Old City at about what 11 minute walk from there is Damascus gate the other side of Old City The Old City m j
