well renewed diplomatic efforts to negotiate a truce in Gaza and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners with Israeli captives are moving forward Al jazer has learned that talks between katari mediators the mosad and the CIA in Warsaw were positive Hamas is pushing for a permanent ceasefire but Israel's far-right coalition government has publicly stated that they expect the war to continue Israel media are reporting that they want the next deal to include 30 to 40 captives from the 12 Who Remain inside Gaza they also wanted to include women the elderly and captives in need of medical attention well let's speak to our correspondent hasham albar it's your reporting that this is based on what more can you tell us so basically the the the there has been series of meetings between senior officials uh that paved the way to the trilateral meeting that took place on Monday in Wasau and it was positive and it has triggered new push to try to explore the potential for a new agreement this agreement is going to be based according to our sources on two aspects two key aspects which is the president exchange and a ceasefire why it's very important we we we'll talk to it about it later in detail in details on FR Friday last Friday there's been a meeting between qatar's prime minister and mad Chief in Europe so this buildup IS is is is a strong indication that we're likely to see uh some announcement in the upcoming days uh on on a deal the problem as we speak now is on the different interpretations of both the Israelis and Hamas Hamas insist this time it is not going to be an ex a prisoners exchange solely it is going to be based on a permanent ceasefire of course it will boil down on whether the qataris ultimately will be able to narrow down the differences between the Israelis and Hamas but we're getting strong indications that this time there is a push by all the parties to come up with with an agreement well I mean that position that permanent ceasefire position from Hamas is one that is entirely different from the Israeli position uh which is to continue Prosecuting this war although the Israeli government is under an enormous amount of pressure to get more of these captives back back does that pressure does a potential big price in terms of for the Israelis in terms of Palestinian prisoners in the opposite direction could that help narrow the Gap I mean how did those two very different positions get get these are extraordinary moments for all the parties Hamas understands in particular the uh the issues at stake for for for for the Israelis and for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in particular this explains why the head of the Hamas Bureau political Bureau is in Egypt uh today and he is going to talk to the Egyptians because you know there are different aspects to the to the agreement when you talk about the president's exchange this is where the Israel and the Egyptians will be pretty much involved because when it comes to the release and to their movement and to their route all the way from Gaza into Israel similar to what we saw during the previous agreement so there is this time a potential for an agreement it just remains to be seen what will be the new criteria last time it was based on one in exchange for three this time it's going to be different Hamas uh as far as we understand is yet to to tell us exactly its own demands the qataris they have them they're discussing them now with with all the parties but they are very tight Li when those very details because they are very sensitive but they have been saying in the past that when it comes to this final stage is going to be all for all something that has been brushed aside by the Israelis in the in the past are they likely to give some concessions I think the Israelis are also willing to move ahead with something much bigger more significant Harry ultimately when it comes to this deal there is absolutely no way I can see the qataris heavily involved without strong guarantees this time from the Americans in particular and the Israelis that if we have a deal this deal has to hold they cannot afford to see this collapsing every now and then because it's going to be the very final phase of what could perhaps be a long ceas fire fascinating stuff thank you very much hash alar thank
