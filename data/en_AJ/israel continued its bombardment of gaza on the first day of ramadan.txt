this year Palestinians will experience a Ramadan like no other the Muslim month of fasting is being observed in the face of famine Israel is restricting what food medicine and essential life-saving supplies can get into Gaza the number of people who have starved to death has risen to 25 and instead of spending time together with family in their homes Palestinians who have already been displaced multiple times are under constant attack explosions occurred in the southern city of Rafa shortly After Dawn but camps and shelters have been attacked across the entire strip more than 31,000 Palestinians have been killed since October jaled AER reports Ramadan is normally a time when Muslims come together to fast worship and reflect but after 5 months of unimaginable violence people here will instead have to endure the pain caused by Israel's Relentless war on Gaza want to get I came here to buy but I can't find anything to buy there's nothing no dates or milk or anything one can't find anything for their children all these canned goods are full of germs that infect the stomach we need vegetables and fruits to feed our children because they've weakened and died from Hunger more than 2 million people are being forced to live with little to no water or food Israel is refusing to let enough Aid in the supplies that do exist are unaffordable the holy month has added meaning here I think this Ramadan will add to the tragedies of the Palestinian people a new tragedy and a new torment the situation is very difficult and any person who says that they can endure the pain of this month financially spiritually mentally look over all of this Market in vain no one can afford to buy anything every single person in Gaza has lost a loved one or knows someone who has and friends and families are torn apart unable to celebrate together this year's Ramadan is different from previous years first of all we are far away from our loved ones our families relatives and friends in the north everything is different Israel's indiscriminate attacks have destroyed or damaged at least 184 mosques in aaza but faith is undiminished across the strip and Palestinians say they'll keep praying for the war to end Julie dger Al jazer honey mmud joins us now on the phone from Rafa and honey this Ramadan was always going to be completely different there in Gaza can can you just give us a sense of what it is like there this morning a good morning Tom and happy Ramadan for those who are observing it everywhere and definitely this year is completely different comparison to the past years and the fact that Palestinians across the Gaza Strip are starting this Ramadan as they continue to face food shortages and a famine that is spreading in the northern part in Gaza City and already causing the death of some 25 children and two elderly and a young woman it's just very difficult time as given that the markets here if we think of overcrowded Sou part of the mainly ra city where the market is completely almost depleted of basic supplies or either they are at a very high price not everyone is able to afford to buy the basic stuff that they need for for Ramadan but people are still grieving and the fact that their families are torn apart with some family members remaining in the northern part facing this acute famine just makes them live uh uh this excited about the this about this holy month or starting to to celebrate it and everyone almost we we talked to or we we've known so far within the the past five months of this genocidal War has at least lost a family member or a relative or a loved ones or someone that they know from their networks just make it very difficult for people to continue maybe the hardest part is the fact that people use to prepare and to start day one of Ramadan with festivities and decoration and lights and lanterns everywhere in the streets and and markets and mths that are the vast majority of them now are G or destroyed these little details are that what makes people uh celebrate and feel the spirit of Ramadan do not exist anymore and just yesterday a brief walk in the market and just the looks on people's uh face is just the depression and despair is just unmatched it's so difficult that they're starting uh this holy month of Ramadan with this feeling of being heartbroken basically okay thank you so much for for all of that honey honey mmud for us there in Rafa
