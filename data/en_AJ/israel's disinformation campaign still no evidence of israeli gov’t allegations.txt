thousands of Fighters broke out of Gaza and tore down the Israeli fence from multiple locations defenses worth billions of dollars including remote controlled machine guns and tank units failed to stop the onslaught intelligence failure is to blame Israeli officials as the scale coordination and intelligence operations of hamas's attack became evident in spite of a 16year Siege and blockade of Gaza some of the highest C uales were at this music festival now police reports say some were killed by Israeli Attack Helicopters Israeli media says a specific kill protocol was used which allows hostages to be taken out with their captors it's called the Hannibal even soldiers took cover among unarmed people here soldiers falling back among those with no weapons is not considered using them as human Shields between 6:30 to 10:00 a.m. hundreds of Fighters engaged with Israeli Security Forces this vehicle which seems to be entering kibuts ber was later seemed to be burned beyond recognition and many other vehicles were destroyed in the same way some with people inside Israeli officials now say hundreds of burnt bodies were those of Hamas Fighters as it's revised down the death toll from 1400 to about 1200 people some corpses were burned beyond recognition and the question remains who burned them journalists taken on tours of the kibuts showed exposed beams and torn down homes to inflict this damage Superior Firepower or equipment would be required one witness from kibuts Berry told Israeli public broadcaster Khan that a 12-year-old Israeli girl was was killed when an Israeli tank fired two rounds at the house they were being kept by Hamas Fighters some tank operators have admitted to opening Fire Within communities Israeli paper haret says netanyahu's remarks to US President Joe Biden were inaccurate disturbing reports such as dozens of beheaded babies or burnt babies or hanged babies are also unsubstantiated testimonies of people from zaka and United hatala search and rescue organization have been debunked by evidence from the kibuts another dubious claim made by the prime minister's wife Sarah Netanyahu in a letter to us first lady Jill Biden has also not been proven she said one of the pregnant women was abducted into Gaza where she gave birth since then the thigh woman has been released she was never pregnant nor gave birth Israel responded around 10:00 a.m. on October 7 as residential Towers like this were destroyed in Gaza and its Relentless campaign to eliminate Hamas continues Palestinians say the disproportionate response amounts to genocide Sama B Javi alera all right we're now joined by Mark Owen Jones he's an associate professor of Middle East studies at hammed bin Khalifa University joining us here on set thanks for speaking to us on Al jazer so as we just heard in the report a number of claims have been made in the aftermath of of October the 7th are we now getting a clearer picture of what exactly happened I think we are I think it's very clear what happened on October the 7th has been um you know it's been packaged rapidly and tried to be contributed to legitimize what Israel are doing in Gaza and as that report showed we've we've seen a number of key things that have demonstrated that some of the most outlandish claims have been false including for example the beheading of 40 babies um the revision of the death toll of Israelis which was initially 1,200 and then went down to 1,000 on accounts that some of the bodies were so badly burnt uh that that they actually recognized later that they were Hammer Fighters and I think there's a real interesting irony here I don't know if it was mentioned but Biden had casted out on the figur supplied by the Palestinian Ministry of Health early on in the conflict at the time we had covered that story yeah exactly and saying that oh we can't trust these figures uh and even though these figures have been historically accurate and have been corroborated by Human Rights Watch and amnesty and now we have a situation where Israel have actually acknowledged that their initial death toll was was too high yet that hasn't been questioned for example by Joe Biden and I think that's emblematic of the the notion of how us is supporting Israel in such a way um and you know believing everything they say that happened on October 7th because everything that happened October 7th has been the main justification for what we're seeing now which is essentially genocide look amid the fog of War Mark do we expect misinformation to spread of course we expect misinformation to spread that's very normal but I think the issue is not necessarily misinformation it's the problem of disinformation which is deliberately spreading false information and I think of course there was you know it was very hard to see what was going on for a lot of people but at the same time if you are the president of the United States for example you want to know for sure if a story about 40 beheaded babies or beheaded baby was true before saying it because often when we have information it filters through regular levels there's no way that the US President should say anything like that unless he's sure of it hetic question okay forgive the simplistic question but what would be the the intent behind spreading uh disinformation the spread of disinformation is trying to legitimize public support and US political support for a brutal response uh in in Gaza that's the only way and the the the beheaded B baby story is really important because killing children is seen as a massive moral transgression everywhere but not just killing them beheading them because beheading is fitting into this narrative that the Israelis have tried to push from day one which was Hamas is like Isis you know beheading is seen as somehow more barbaric than bombing thousand and killing thousands of of children which doesn't make it into the speeches of Biden uh look uh we also hear this assertion by Western governments and we heard it a lot during the first few weeks that Israel has the right to defend itself um but we see According to some polls and if you look at the United States for example uh a poll there a recent poll suggested that more than 60% of Americans actually want to see far and they want to see an end to this so to what extent do you think that Israel's Monopoly on the narrative has changed now and has been broken by uh by public opinion it's changed actually quite early on in the war and that's what's really interesting both in the US and the UK the majority of people from both different supporting different parties actually support a ceas fund they won an end to violence why because the violence is so egregious they are seeing the Mass Slaughter of civilians of course as Humane people they want an end to it so there's a massive disjuncture between what citizens in these Democratic countries want and what their politicians are doing and I think also this is contributing this sense of alienation that the people have with the political leaders who are supporting a cause for political reasons of geostrategic reasons and isolating their constituencies and remember these are democracies that are meant to be responsive to the needs of the people and we're not just talking about any needs we're talking about an goinging genocide and it's it's pretty phenomenal actually how you can have democratically elected leaders who are willing to ear a blind eye to to this level of violence all right Marco and Jones thank you so much for giving us your thoughts
