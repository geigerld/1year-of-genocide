world leaders and heads of Aid groups have met in Paris to discuss getting humanitarian Aid to people in Gaza the talks aimed at mobilizing funding and emergency assistance they're also dealing with how to set up supply lines for essential resources including water fuel and electricity Caroline janz is the Belgian minister of development cooperation in major cities you're joining me live from Brussels Minister I have a press statement in my hands that says uh Belgium is also increasing its a yes we will um provide us an additional Supply of2 million EUR and that brings our total Aid humanitarian Aid to the Palestinians this year 2023 at 22 million Euros so you're calling for a number of things again I'm reading from the statement here but you're calling for a number of things I'd like to take them um one by one one is Belgium is calling for the opening of other border crossings not just Rafa yes I think it's very clear you have mentioned the humanitarian catastrophe there is no water no supplies no uh medicines no food so it's uh very very critical that as much humanitarian Aid as possible can enter into Gaza and um I've been informed that on a usual day before October 7th there were 500 trucks necessary um to supply what gazans need and um now we have like we have seen like 600 trucks coming in by Rafa since October 7th so the catastrophe and and the suffering is is uh disproportionate and is inhuman so there are three border crossings into Gaza from Rafa the one that opens up once in a while from Egypt but there are two more from Israel um at Iris and Kim Shalom and we'd like to call also the Israeli government to open up these border crossings for extra humanitarian Aid because people are suffering inside the Gaza Strip it's uh it's Israeli hostages who are suffering but it's also um ordinary Palestinian citizens a lot of children that are suffering a lot and I think it's important that more humanitarian Aid gets into the Gaza Strip and there are many many people whether it's people countries or Aid agencies that would agree with that position but Israel isn't exactly listening is it so you know it's one thing to call for more humanitarian Aid call for more border crossings to be open what do you do if then Israel just says no which essentially it has been saying yeah I think the International Community has to mount the pressure that's uh that's very clear also the Americans the European Union other Arab states the Arab League we have to amount a pressure because it's essential well that will be uh that will be a dialogue at first s but also the Belgian government for instance is uh considering the recognition of the State of Palestine because I think we can only solve and end this violence um through negotiations um Palestinians and Israelis alike have the right to live in peace to live in security and that means that we also uh next to the state of Israel that has been recognized we have to recognize uh the exist of the State of Palestine and that's the only um tenable solution in the long term for peace and security for both peoples Minister Minister I'm going to have I'm going to have to run but you said something very important you are considering recognizing the state of Palestine as a way to put pressure on Israel what is the threshold that would bring Belgium to cross that Rubicon and recognize um recognize the state of Palestine sorry if I misspoke earlier recognize the state of Palestine well I think it's it's important that we given a signal with a lot of European member states um like bigger member states like Spain are considering the same and um what we will also do and I think that's important uh to tackle impunity we will fund an additional 5 million euros to the international criminal court because there has to be independent um there has to be independent um research on what is happening in Gaza right now there are atrocities being um being run by GA by H by Hamas in Gaza and by the Israeli uh Defense Forces so it's important that the international prosecutor of the IC gets his job done Minister Caroline janz thank you very much for joining us on the program here on ales today
