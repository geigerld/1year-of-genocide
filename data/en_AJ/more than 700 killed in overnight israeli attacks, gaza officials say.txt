there's still no relief in sight for the people of Gaza which remains under heavy Israeli bombardment hundreds more Palestinians have been killed in the past day Health officials say some hospitals can no longer treat the wounded because they're run out of medicine and fuel more humanitarian a trucks have been able to enter the strip but supplies are running dangerously low the health Ministry says close to 5,800 Palestinians have been killed since the strikes began on October the 7th following an attack by on Southern Israel that killed 1,400 Israelis Al jaz's Han abua is joining us live from K yunus and the Gaza Strip the hospitals continuing to struggle and supplies are running out of honey yes well hospitals uh are running out of essential supplies and the more air strikes are are taking in place from north to south only adding more pressure on Hos hospitals to accommodate more casualties now at this point uh we know there are more than uh 10 hospitals are out of service and the remaining hospitals and medical uh centers uh in support of those hospitals are suffering from extreme shortage of essential supplies let alone power generators fuel to run their power generator to sustain uh their services uh unfortunately we are talking about 18 ,000 casualties brought to hospital that's beyond uh the capacity of all the hospitals combined in the Gaza Strip uh for example the hospitals we're reporting from nazer hospitals uh it is started an emergency plan on top of the already implemented emergency plan which is evacuating the hospital from any non lifethreatening casualties and even though the case might need couple days or a week at the hospital but they are asked to leave because they just want to make room for more of the casualties coming in uh to the hospital the scenes are very horrific and it just it gives you a sense that there is there is a catastrophe uh coming in at any time uh in in the in the few the few coming hours well we're talking uh about Israeli air strikes continuing honey just talk us through what's been happening in the last few hours this will the past night has been very difficult and a bloody uh for Palestinians living particularly anywhere in the Gaza Strip the there there a a massive air strike campaign and heavy uh artillery Shilling is started as early as 9:00 of last night and I just give you an example of EXT stream of these uh attacks were in the city of khun near the uh the hospital Naser Hospital an entire block entire residential block have been destroyed completely uh 17 people were pronounced did right at the spot with so many still under the rubel that residential uh block is located in the western part of hanun it's It's called The Block G uh within the vicinity of Naser Hospital in a different location the Easter side of city of khun uh more residential homes and buildings have been the target of air strikes and artillery Shilling at 10 more people were pronounced did right away and tens more of casualties ra has been uh since early hours of this morning at 2: or 3: in the morning uh has been the sight of heavy uh and an extremely heavy artillery Shilling almost all the densely populated neighborhoods of the city of raav have been under heavy bombardment bombardment since last night more than 20 people have been reported killed and tens more of casualties and as on our way to the site of reporting uh we saw a a house uh being destroyed right at the spot uh the scene was horrific and and and hard breaking thinking of all the people inside the house who were not warned to leave before the air strike H thank you very much indeed that's Han Abu sha bringing us up to date from conun in the Gaza Strip Dr Hassan kalaf is a medical director at the alwafa hospital in Gaza and he says they're operating with a bare minimum of supplies I helped cha hospital and brought um about 30 uh wounded from shifa hospital just to give them you know space for some know new inured people and this is the situation my hospital my patients are elderly with chronic diseases with with big SS with pressure ancers and you know strokes and neurological diseases and I as I told you 30 out of them 30 patients brought from shifa hospital who have you know injured what this is the the minimal the minimal and uh they only available even the food we would have food you know the food we we would depend on bean cans and jams and cheese and can so dry food and there is not suitable feeding as well as you know deficiency in medications but the the great problem is the electricity and you know light and you know you know the other machines or equipment who need who depend completely on the electricity as well as lift and so other other parts of the hospital so are facing great great difficulties we have know small solar system using for lighting and we some we could the few the P few days work in the generator for two or three hour just to um to do the minimal work but all the time you know minimal light there is you know minimal electricity and we cannot you know be sure that how many days the the disaster will come and watch now all people here will die
