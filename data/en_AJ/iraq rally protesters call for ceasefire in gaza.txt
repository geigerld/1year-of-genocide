[Music] Iraqis rallying this afternoon say that they are in support of the Palestinian people that the suffering of the Palestinians is a pan Arab issue they want an immediate end to the Israeli occupation to the hostilities that are happening in Gaza now they want to ceasefire an end to the war and they say that their leaders as well as world leaders need to do much more we are Weeping for the people of Gaza we are willing to sacrifice our blood for them we're here today to tell the people of Gaza we are with them the Arab people are with them it's a shame Arab leaders are turning their backs we call on the neighboring countries and the government of Egypt to open the borders to offer humanitarian Aid and to help those who've been injured why do they have to close the Rafa border crossing to the people of Gaza why why does Israel have the right to import the most modern weapons yet there is no right for the Arab countries to send Aid food and medicine to the women and children Iraq is no stranger to war to instability to conflict and there is a fear that if the war in Gaza goes on much longer that the violence could escalate that it could spread throughout the region there have already been episodes here of attacks on us targets a close Ally of Israel by Pro Palestinian pro-iranian groups reprisals by US forces and worry is that this will continue to make Iraq a convergence point and an escalation of violence in the region will see Iraq become a flash point for violence if this war goes on much longer Zay aler bdad make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
