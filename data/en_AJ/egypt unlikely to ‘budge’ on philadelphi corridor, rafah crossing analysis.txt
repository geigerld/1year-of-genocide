now the buffer zone between Egypt and Gaza is known as the Philadelphia Corridor the 14 km long strip of land represents the entirity of the Border area between Gaza and Egypt Israel managed the area controlling the movement of goods and people until it withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005 since then Egyptian forces have taken over patrolling duties but Israel still inspects all of the deliveries into the territory both Egypt and Hamas strongly oppose Israel's control over the corridor Hussein hardi is a former Egyptian assistant foreign minister and Ambassador joins us now from the Egyptian Capital Cairo Mr Hari good to have you with us on Al jazer thank you for your time control of the Philadelphia Corridor and control of the Rafa border crossing are going to be a very tough discussion for the US with Egypt because these agreements were years in the making and enshrined in various peace deals well definitely uh one of the uh one of the topics uh that have been hampering reaching a ceire agreement in Gaza is of course the future of the Philadelphia Corridor as well as the Palestinian side of the Rafa uh Egypt has always maintained that it rejects it as Egypt as always rejected the uh permanent uh Israeli presence military presence in the Philadelphia Corridor as well as an Israeli control over the Palestinian side of the RAF cring and this this Remains the Egyptian position and this Egyptian position is part is part of the uh Egyptian vision of a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza St so I I I I expect the talks in Cairo or in egyp between Mr blink and Senior Egyptian officials will be quite Frank quite Frank and Egypt want budge from its position of course there is always can I just jump in there sir just obviously we know the diplomacy that will be required all of this happening obviously behind closed doors can I just ask you as a former Ambassador what sense do you get of The Strain between Cairo and Tel Aviv right now over the war in Gaza I I I I don't think that the relations between Egypt and and and Israel right now are in in in a better in a better shape uh I guess tension is very very very very high it's very high and and and and I I suspect that it it it would remain so for uh for a per of time until Israel until Mr natany and his ruling Coalition they changed their mind about a complete Israeli control over Gaza Strip including the the Philadelphia Philadelphia Corridor uh so I I let's go back to the uh American uh diplomacy and and the talks that Mr blinkin uh is having with Egyptian officials let's we if we can talk about that what influence does Egypt have with the US there's been lots of analysts on Al jazer talking about the influence that Israel has with the United States but what is that working relationship between Cairo and Washington when when when blinkin arrives because it is as you say the tension is very high in the region Egypt and Israel relations are very strained right now Egypt will want to express that surely to the Secretary of State well I guess I guess the American as nation is is well aware of the Egyptian position so uh I don't think that the talks in Mr blinkon talks with in in in in Egypt would would dwell on the the basis the the just of the Egyptian position I I would expect that the talks would would would try to find a compromise solution between the Egyptian and the Israeli Israeli position Vis particularly the Philadelphia Corridor and the ra Crossing we understand that the American the American Administration fully understand the Egyptian positions and and and and and I would go as as far as saying that it it it has done it's possible to accommodate this Egyptian position and that's what I expect from Mr blinkin in his talks with either president Cc or with his cont part today it'll be interesting to see what does happen it'll be great to get some analysis from you when we do have more uh concrete ideas of what's been agreed Hussein Hardy thanks for joining us sir from Cairo it's my pleasure sir make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
