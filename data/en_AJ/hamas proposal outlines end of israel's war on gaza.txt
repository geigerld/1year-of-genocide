Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed the latest ceasefire proposal by Hamas B's office says a delegation will visit Qatar to continue negotiations on the release of Israeli captives and Netanyahu has also approved the military's plan for a ground operation in Rafa in southern Gaza where around 1.5 million Palestinians have sought shelter now Hamas has proposed its plan by be implemented in three stages of 42 days each in the first stage the group demands the withdrawal of Israeli forces Beyond Salah Aline roads to enable people to return home Hamas says it's ready to release female Israeli reservists held captive in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners 50 inmates for each captive now in the second stage Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire to be announced before it releases any captured soldiers and in the final stage the group proposes the end of Israel's Siege and the beginning of reconstru efforts in Gaza okay for more on all of this let's go to hamda salute who joins us now from occupied East Jerusalem netanyahu's just responded to this Hamas proposal can you just go into a little bit more detail about what he had to say well the Israeli Prime Minister's office releasing a statement that was quite short saying that hamas's demands are still unrealistic but what we do know is that these negotiations are no longer at a stalemate remember that a couple of weeks ago the negotiations in Cairo were entirely stalled and the Israelis did not send a delegation there but this time it seems that the Israelis will be sending their own delegation to discuss with mediators about the potential of this deal but again the Israelis have said that no matter what the war is not going to end until all of their objectives for this war and how they want to prosecute it are met Hamas is demands remain the same they want to see a comprehensive ceasefire meaning an end to the war and the Israelis say that is simply a non-negotiable at the same time the war cabinet has also discussed its plan for this rougher offensive what more do we know about that that's right Israel's war cabinet convening about drawing up plans for Israel's Invasion Ina the Israeli Prime Minister is saying that they now do have plans for the evacuation of the nearly million and a half Palestinians who are seeking refuge in gaza's Southernmost city but remember that this anticipated ground Invasion into DEA is something that has received a lot of criticism a lot of condemnation from around the world especially from Israel's biggest Ally the United States who said that they simply wouldn't support an operation like this given how many civilians were in Raa so the Israelis have remained persistent saying that it is absolutely necessary in order to achieve their goal of eliminating Hamas they say they must go into ra so at this point theseis are saying that they are in the initial phases of approving plans they have approved the plans for the evacuation but how exactly it'll work we do not know just yet okay thanks so much for those updates that is ham salute for us in occupied East Jerusalem okay well let's talk to Honey mmud who's joining us on the phone now from Rafa and just in regards uh to this potential offensive Israel is talking about evacuation uh how realistic is that well well Tom just to start with people were quite uh looking forward to uh hearing something constructive and positive response to Hamas proposal for the uh the Seas Fire or the uh potential Seas fire deal and right now the news coming from uh uh a the Prime Minister office is just creating a state of of Mayhem and frustration among the among people here in ra City we're talking about overcrowded City really uh packed with displaced families already struggling uh day today to find basic supplies and and food and suffer largely from the false Narrative of of evacuation Fai zones that were ordered that they were ordered by the Israeli military to go to to avoid being bombed but they ended up being BM so now they talked about where is the next safe evacuation zone is going to be and how realistic is that going to be and what are the corridors that people are going to be taking we're looking at a very small short uh very small and and and is overcrowded area from every part the eastern part the central part of the city the western part of RA City already full of tents and displaced familyes so in terms of uh of ensuring that the safety and the safety of displaced individuals and and and families here it's not clear how it's going to to happen all eyes are at the central area that is is already under heavy bombardment and we seen in the past couple weeks how it it intensified the attacks the aerial attacks as well as the ground attack on the and area that's more very close to Gaza Shore it just shattered every sense of of Safety and Security for people something important to point out here like this this talk has been going on for quite some time now the threats of of coming to to to and expand the ground invasion is something that is used as a political pressure by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and right now in response to the proposal made by Hamas it looks more like of another way to uh leverage on the negotiations in Kyu as as the the wind is going to happen is not clear yet in in the statement or uh the plan has been improved but the wi is not a clear right now and all the while the humanitarian situation both in southern Gaza but particularly in the north just keeps getting worse it is getting worse right now with the with this statement uh coming out of of the approving the military plan and the evacuation plan things are going to get really very bad here in terms of of of how people are going to cope with the situations in terms of the ensuring the flow of a humanitarian Aid that are already very difficult and we're talking about not only difficult situations which people struggle daily basis to find Food Supplies and and other Basic Essentials but in terms of the flow of Entry an operation in ra would mean a complete blockade on ra Crossings which means uh no one should expect any an entry a single truck uh coming from R Crossing to overcrowded R City to provide a humanitarian Aid there's also the ongoing constant attacks on on on on eight Seekers across Gaza City we've seen within the past couple days and also the past 48 Hours three attacks uh just hours separated uh them where many Palestinians trying to get food supplies and essential to to their families there's also the the blockade on an essential medical supplies to hospitals and there was a a convoy of medical supplies that was blocked by the isra military could have medical scissor and medical shears necessarily needed for for sur and operation so it's likely to get really it worse in each topping day right now with this news uh going viral right now okay thanks so much for that honey honey mmud for us there on the phone and Rafa okay well for more on all of this uh joining us now from West Jerusalem is Gerson Baskin he's the founder of the Israel Palestine Center for research and information thank you very much for joining us here on El jazer first of all nyaho says that Hamas demands are unrealistic in what way what what's the main sticking point here do you think I think it's important to note that despite what NATO said about the demands of Hamas being unrealistic the war cabinet has decided to send a team to Doha to continue the negotiations this has to be taken in the context of the negotiations and understanding that Israel is trying to make a stronger position going into those negotiations it seems clear that Hamas has demonstrated some flexibility in their answers that they gave to the qataris and the Egyptians both in terms of the staging of the ceas fire without demanding an immediate Israeli declaration to end the war with regard to the withdrawal from Gaza which they are not demanding take place immediately but can be done in stages and there's also been some indication of a flex willingness for flexibility on the issue of prisoners I think that probably for the isel's the most difficult point in the Hamas answers as far as we know is that the 700 to 1,000 prisoners to be released include at least 100 prisoners who are serving life sentences meaning that they have murdered Israelis and that's going to be difficult for the cabinet to accept okay you've said that um there's been flexibility from Hamas do you think that we will see the same sort of flexibility from Israel well I think if there wasn't going to be flexibility on Israel they wouldn't have sent a team or decided to send a team to Doha as they didn't send a team last week to Cairo when there was a Hamas delegation there so the fact that the the team will be going to to is a sign that Israel is willing to negotiate the big question behind all of this is Mr natany and Mr are Mr natano and Mr senoir really interested in an agreement at this time um there are analysts who say that the hostages for sz's life insurance policy for nany the pro prolongation of the war is his political survival so the bottom line is do they really want an agreement here and we don't have an answer for that certainly the people of Gaza the people of Palestine the people of Israel want an agreement to be reached we want the hostages home the Palestinians must have a ceasefire in Gaza everyone needs a breaking a a point for for a having to be able to think more coherently more rationally about the situation on the ground when they're not being bombed yeah the operation in Rafa cannot be done immediately and I think this is also in the context of negotiations the fact that the war cabinet in nan have approved the battle plan s Rafa doesn't necessarily mean that the battle plans will be implemented if we do reach an agreement and there is a 45-day ceasefire well then it's put off and maybe can be put off permanently okay I mean is it just postering or or is Netanyahu really defying a clear call by the United States that going into ruer would be a red line for them is is there a ruer operation that Washington could actually support I think Washington has told Israel that before they do an operation in Rafa they have to evacuate the civilians there with a civilians between kanun and Rafa this is not something that happens overnight if Israel were to attack without a removing the civilians from the Rafa area it would be a breach uh a serious breach between Israel and the United States and I don't see it happening I do think that there's a lot of posturing in announcing today before sending a delegation to Doha that the cabinet has approved War plans okay we'll have to leave it there but we really do appreciate uh your time and your insight into all all of this let's go Sean ban for us in West Jerusalem thank you
