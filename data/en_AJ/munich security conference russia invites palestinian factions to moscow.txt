the Munich security conference wraps up on Sunday after three days of discussions on pressing Global issues Israel's war on Gaza and the war on Ukraine dominated the agenda world leaders have urged Israel to allow much needed humanitarian Aid to enter Gaza let's bring in our correspondent step vson who's joining us live from Munich so the final day of the Gathering step what's been achieved well a lot of talks here and of course the the main ISS issues are the war on Ukraine lots of talks on Russia of course the death of opposition leader naali has also over overshadowed the first part of the meetings and yesterday a lot of uh uh talk also on the war on Gaza and I'm joined here by one of the key players prime minister of the Palestinian Authority Mr Muhammad ster thank you so much for joining us in the program um there was a lot of talk on Ukraine dominating the talks here at the con conference right how much did you achieve to get the Gaza issue the Palestinian issue here on the agenda well uh of course today Palestine is also the center of gravity even though Palestine is not in Europe but still Europeans and Internationals are very much concerned of what Israeli crimes and Israeli genocide that is taking place in Palestine in particular in Gaza so uh we made our voice loud and clear whether through our bilateral negotiations talks or through the banel that I've just given uh to uh the audience here uh we have made it very clear that we want an immediate ceasefire and we want an entry to International Aid into Gaza not only limited to one entry point but through all the entry points because all what goes into Gaza now is only 8% of what the people need so the audience here which is very important audience they have he our voice as I said loud and clear and we have said also that sorry to interrupt but the the prime minister of Qatar yesterday said that there was some setback in the talks about an imminent ceasefire do you have a feeling that there is a a lack of of urgency here uh in in Munich among the leaders who have been Gathering the issue is that it's not anymore that any one of these people who are here can exert serious pressure on Israel to stop the war and not only that but we have seen the icj did not they cannnot or they don't want to both both but on top of which that the Israeli Prime Minister is not listening to anybody including his very close allies and therefore Israel obviously wanted to continue the genocide war that it is conducting in Gaza Netanyahu himself he has a visted interest to keep the war as long as possible because for his personal survival and that is what we have he quite a number of analysts quite a number of leaders who have been sharing the same analysis that we do and therefore Israel has to be forced ceasefire not only that but you force Israel by not simply continue providing Israel with machine guns with weapons with finances and so on those who are really concerned of putting an end to the atrocities that are taking place in Gaza they should take Serious measures not only lip service not only statements but the pressure on Israel could be much higher if there was more a unified response especially also from from European nations I just spoke to the foreign minister of Belgium for example she described it as being very frustrating to talk to her colleagues in Europe and and there there's still no Unity on their stands against Israel cor that's right there is no Unity there something you can do about it as as the prime minister of the Palestinian author yes there is no unity in Europe and not only that United States has continued to support Israel and United States very unfortunately is planning to use a veto on Tuesday to block an alerian proposal to call forces SE fire United States has not been calling for ceasefire and obviously United States wants to give Israel every Green Light to continue all these atrocities that Israel is committing against our people in in Gaza the Europeans I don't say that they are divided there are different point of views but I think everybody calls for an immediate Bose of fighting and so on we don't want only a Bose and for us is not only enough to bring food into Gaza it is and it is urgent to bring food but what is the point of providing somebody dinner and then killing him in the morning so we need International Aid that goes into Gaza should be hand inand with ending the genocide and the killing that Israel is conducting against our people but all key players have been here in the last three days right if this is the message you're going to take home without any real resolution for the people suffering in Gaza especially in Rafa right now what are you going to tell your people well we continue to fight and and we continue to struggle and we continue to hold our message and we continue to talk to people because at the end of the day it's not only the international public opinion who makes things it's these leaders who are here and as I said and they're not doing it well they have not been able to for the first time Israel is actually violating every Rules of Engagement every every international law every single article in international law every single article in international humanitarian law and it is a bity that the best ally for Israel that is United States has not been able to deliver Israel on one hand and also nanahu is not listening to his big boss President Biden he is not listening to anybody and that is where Israel the International Community should deal with Israel in a totally different way Israel should be put under sanctions in order for Israel to stop this aggression genocide against our people and end occupation that has been there quite a number of people who are here they only focus on October 7 yes October 7 is a major event but the Palestinian suffering did not start in October 7 Palestinians have been suffering for the last 75 years you got that message across at least loud and clear that's what we have been telling the people that we need an end to the struggle not only don't deal with the Cosmetics you should deal with the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem is Israeli occupation it's not our tanks that is surrounding T Aviv it's Israeli tanks that is occupying Gaza is Israeli tanks that's in the Heart of the City of ramala in every single refugee camp in every single Village and that should end the word frustration I mentioned it already what what what feeling are you going to bring home is it frustration as well or no we never get frustrated we are angry yes and our people they want a way out yes but this is the cycle of struggle palas have been in this for the last 75 years and it is time that the International Community help us to end the conflict Israel should not be given all the time the greenest of the green light that is what is encouraging Israel to continue committing these crimes is this the support by certain capitals this support should stop and these people should understand that Israel does not listen Israel needs to be heard through sanctions and that's the only way thank you so much for sharing your views here prime minister of the Palestinian Authority thank you for having me we are wrapping up this uh this talks here at the security conference in Munich in a few hours there will be the closing uh St statements and ceremony and yeah as we heard there is no breakthrough or any real uh news coming from the conference but at least people have been talking to each other here again right step thank you for that step vson live in Munich
