after attacking Gaza for nearly five months the Israeli Prime Minister is focusing on Rafa Benjamin Netanyahu says a ground offensive is vital to eliminating Hamas and any ceasefire would only delay the inevitable but what about the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped there this is Inside hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle Palestinians displaced by Israel's war on Gaza have crowded into Rafa in the south of the strip the Israeli military had previously described the city as a safe Zone but daily air strikes are intensifying and a ground offensive is planned putting 1.5 million people squarely in the line of fire there are also reports of a possible ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas however prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's assault on Rafa will go ahead no matter what is there any hope for Palestinians trapped in the city with nowhere to go and will anything stop Israel's ground operation we'll go to our panel in just a moment first fin Monahan has this report Israel's bombing of Gaza has forced more than 1 and a half million Palestinians to take refuge in Rafa their living conditions are dire there's no water or sanitation food and basic necessities are in short supply and diseases are spreading through the makeshift camps my son has contracted hepatitis virus because of the unhealthy and unclean conditions we are living in we are living in a tent that cannot protect us from cold or rain in addition the entire surroundings are dirty the the whole area is dirty and polluted hunger cold and disease are devouring our children but soon things may it even worse Israel is determined to launch a ground assault on the city while there's been talk of a potential ceasefire prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it would only delay the military offensive which he says is essential to defeating Hamas and ensuring Israeli security we cannot leave a quarter of hamas's terrorist Italians intact no one would do that in the case of fighting Isis you wouldn't leave a quarter of Isis intact in a defined territory you wouldn't even think about that and you didn't America finished the job with its allies we will finish the job here with our brave Soldiers the United Nations and Aid agencies have warned a ground incursion into Rafa would lead to civilian deaths even Israel's biggest Ally the United States has said now is not the time for an assault that no attacks on Rafa uh should uh should take place given current circumstances and we will keep pressing that uh we know we've heard what Israel has said they have not gone in to attack Rafa and we will keep engaging and urging and pushing in that direction to ensure that that does not happen as ceasefire would give Palestinians some reprieve after months of bombardment and de pration but if an Israeli ground offensive does come there may be no way for them to get out of Harm's Way vins and Monahan Al jazer for Inside [Music] Story well to unpack the significance of an attack on Rafa we've got a panel of guests with a range of political humanitarian and Military expertise for you here in qatar's capital Doha we have Akbar Shahed ammed he's a senior diplomatic correspondent at Huff poost he's covered US policy on Gaza since the Obama Administration in Cairo njla shawa is the country relations manager with the aid agency Oxfam she's also a resident of Gaza and in bath in the UK Patrick buy is a senior Lector in security at the University of bath specializing in Warfare and counterterrorism he's also served in the British army in Afghanistan a very warm welcome to all of you akar let's start with you why is it do you think the Netanyahu government is determined despite the outcry from all corners of the world to press ahead with a ground offensive in ra Rafa it's striking Laura it's it's a reality that reflects the failure of Israel's us P offensive in Gaza so far right we're approaching six months of this war and Israel has not been able to meet the kind of death blow to Hamas that they promised they would and that a lot of the Israeli public wants them to so that's why you see prime minister Netanyahu saying regardless of whether it as a ceasefire regardless of whether it as a truce he will eventually going into Rafa and that's because he's arguing that's where there's Hamas leadership that's where there is uh there are remaining hostages and that's why there's a huge strategic value to Israel right Israel is saying they want to control Gaza in a way that they never have before they especially want to control gaza's Southern border with Egypt all of that puts Israel at odd with the us as as your report mentioned because the US is saying look you can pursue Hamas you cannot go into a place that you call a safe Zone that will just worsen these this perception of ethnic cleansing of genocide as an icj case continues but for the Netanyahu Administration I think there's a clear impetus to defy the us on this and N asbar says this is being declared a so-called safe Zone therefore most of the G and population is crowded into this city that was only designed to sustain 300,000 people we now got 1.5 million people living there mostly in tents can you describe for us the humanitarian situation there in Rafa yeah I mean it's very obvious that we are now talking about uh just another level of extreme Devastation uh we have been already witnessing that we have been already warning of uh of this uh Devastation and the human suffering uh the the casualties but also the human suffering that it's that this uh this crisis has been uh unfolding unfortunately speaking now about these stages where things are extremely critical at all levels um humanitarian workers have not been able to operate um by maybe third of their capacity according to un reports in terms of the staff and that the team and the operations uh until this moment so you would imagine after such operation how how this would be impacted a lot of inos and uh non non-governmental organizations and Aid workers have been reestablishing semi kind of structures and and uh um stations to to operate from Rafa now all of this will be compromised uh again the the flow of uh uh of of people towards any place I mean first of all you started by saying this is a safe Zone while we we understand now by Israel terms what a safe zone mean it has always been uh uh violated and far from being safe civilians have been hit hospitals have been hit Aid agencies have been directly hit we know about two at least inos offices that were directly hit uh Aid convoys have been hit so you are already talking about at a very already as a fragile and and um violated situation so trying to imagine now 75% of the population of the Gaza Strip is in raah what what what could be uh any do you really need all these panelists to tell you what to imagine if Israel has an incursion what what is the implication I think it's very clear that we are going to see uh more uh more suffering of more people especially vulnerable uh uh people while everybody in Gaza Strip according to all kinds of studies and all the work that we've been doing tells you that they are in need every person let's let's bring na let's bring in Patrick at this stage because he's got direct experience of urban Warfare and and Patrick we're not even talking about Urban Warfare in the usual sense here are we we're talking about a tented City can you give us an idea of militarily what a ground invasion into Rafa would look like I can I mean you know the planning for this will be probably based around two options and you either have a conventional approach which is what Israel has mainly used so far both in the battle of the first third the battle for Gaza City and then the battle for can yunas which is Firepower heavy uh and reliant on taking territory and obviously the dentifying and destroying uh Hamas command Bonkers and positions and also as We Know you know uh hospitals Etc which the Israelis view as collateral damage and a huge amount of Civilian casualties as a result of that so that's the first one the second one and an interestingly a much more intelligence L more targeted approach of which we've actually seen a few few uh elements of start to develop in the second phase of the war around Clan unus when they started to hit Hamas leaders individually in different places uh is to get into a more more targeted intelligence base Special Forces uh and even in Touch of counterinsurgency approach Which is less forceful and much more targeted the Israelis actually pioneered this after the inada in 2006 and helped the or even earlier and helped the US pioneered against al-Qaeda in Iraq uh you know around that time too so they know how to do it uh but the question is the political imperative and these the goals it's like coming back to what n natu says he says that there's 25 conventional battalions or something a quarter of the conventional Italians left and so their Reckoning is we've got all this support after the attack internally let's just keep rolling I mean I I find that I understand the fear from the Israelis of course but from a from a western military perspective the inability to protect civilians that's such a scale of which the Israelis have demonstrated is really Beyond Comprehension to me as a former military officer and we've seen as n mentioned near daily bombing of Gaza despite it being a safe Zone just on Monday night we had eight civilians killed in a house near the Kuwait hospital that was targeted by an air strike do you think the possib the the reason for these air strikes could be that they are clearing the way for a ground Invasion I it's well you that's hard to say you know absolutely without the intelligence what they will obviously have some sort of intelligence which is fed to a targeting cell they'll do their collateral damage assessment and when the the military necessity of the target is balance versus the collateral damage say in the West for example when we were in Afghanistan we wouldn't be able to use this sort of weapon system if there was any hope that a civilian might be killed now Israel can say well we're going through this process but uh our actual weighing of how many civilians is uh acceptable for this military Target is different so that's what's going on now what you would expect to see if they launch an offensive is I would say some more bombardment some special forces raids some attempts to root clear and then they'll break down uh the uh the remaining territory around rapid intersections and probably sequentially go into them uh potentially akar we've had the US very clearly saying it will not support aafa Invasion until it sees a clear evacuation plan now one has been presented now to the Israeli War cabinet we don't know the details of that but can we imagine as the US imagining what the evacuation of 1.5 million civilians would look like it's unimaginable it's unprecedent it's unimaginable there's not a capacity in the US government much larger than the Israeli government and Military within the US Aid Machinery there isn't the capacity to imagine this evacuation so it's it's really tough to imagine the Israelis have a realistic plan for this and I think that's why you see us officials saying very openly in a way they haven't the rhetoric has certainly shifted right openly the I saying Israel you cannot do this you've seen them say this in Washington but also importantly in New York at the United Nations right where the US is now talking about a temporary ceasefire for the first time ever and I think that's because of the Strategic implications of AAA offensive the humanarian tool would be undoubtedly huge right but let's think about a region that's already on a knife's edge let's think about the fact that Ramadan is now less than 2 weeks away tensions are really high extremely high in the occupied West Bank as well extremely high in Jerusalem and the US is looking at that picture and thinking if Raa becomes this Blood B that it's almost certain to become whenever they go in when that happens what how do how does the region react right how do Iran and its proxies react the US has a feeling strategy towards the houis and Yemen right the US is concerned about hisbah and Lebanon how does everyone react to this right now Israel and the US don't have answers to that and I think what's critical there is is just when will the US decide to use its leverage in terms of actual military and intelligence support we know they're providing for this campaign when will that be called into question rather than just having a rhetorical shift absolutely because n at what point is Israel going to listen to World opinion anyway I mean it has the ability we've seen to stomach extraordinary collateral damage and it does just seem to be forging ahead with the most extreme right-wing views in the Netanyahu government who clear do want to go into Rafa who want to go in right and who who have a narrative that we've seen very very openly from this government saying not only do we want to you know punish Palestinians wholesale right for the actions of Hamas but we want to take full control of Gaza right you've seen them use this phrase from The River To The Sea which ironically uh Israel supporters don't want Israel critics using but they are saying that so that means they have to kind of have this huge f um I think what's what's critical to remember there is the US and Israel will be paying the price for this for months and years and decades to come right so while Israel can summer the criticism today and finish its operation and say you know what we're done what does this mean for Israel's ability to survive in the region for the next 5 10 15 20 years I think that's the really scary question well let's just put that to Patrick I mean say the US pulled the plug on its weapons delivery today how much longer could it continue actually you know what I want to pick up on is is the last contributor's Point first which is you know he's exactly right I think Israel is starting to lose sight of the Strategic situation here uh in favor of the operational yeah and it's alienating people in the west it is happening now that it needs yeah H it's alienating its Ally in in the US uh and if it goes into Rafa I don't think they really understand it I know where they're coming from they they think this is a bad neighborhood we have to show that we're tough and we have to deal with this head on or someone else will have to deal with it again and we'll take casualties again so I understand where they're coming from and I understand what how they've got un support it but I understand up to this point to would agree although I think the collateral damage problem is terrible uh I but here's my fear I fear for Israel if they go in for this in the longer run that's it and and uh if I was working in Israeli security be fearful too on your n just okay but just let NASA pick up on that and bring and bring her back into the discussion do you think the Israel is alienating the West fast enough because it doesn't seem to be paying any attention exactly it's not paying any attention and I think um the West doesn't really care or at least the United States is not making any um any pressure uh that that would really stop I mean again is just saying yeah make it lighter with uh with just don't kill too many people I I think this language and and so far the behavior of like supplying uh uh military assistance like uh like things are totally supported and and are totally uh normal uh tell us that unfortunately the US will not be uh getting uh putting the enough pressure that we are hoping for and Israel really doesn't care look at what's happening after the icj I think we have seen how the aid flow has decreased significantly after the icj everything I think everything that Israel is uh is doing simply contradicts with any uh any of these uh pressures or with the international humanitarian law or any of that so I wonder if we are now uh saying this level of of pressure talking about uh talking about it as if yes uh they are pressuring them and stopping them and um no I I think things will unfortunately uh be uh continue to be really uh bad and we are losing people by the minute people are suffering now going to Rafa where will people go I have uh friends and relatives there they they literally ask the question where are we going do we go up north where there is all destruction where there is no food where people are literally dying are actually dying from Hunger we are seeing reports of uh deaths of children out of hunger we know that 15% are uh at at this risk of famine I mean what what else is it uh is the world or the US waiting for I don't know what parameters are we use I think I think the whole international law and the the world system has totally failed and I think this is not this will be this will have its implications on any upcoming uh uh any upcoming situation like this while tolerate 30,000 people killed and more than 60,000 injured they are unable to find treatment you are talking about at best cases 200 trucks entering while in the past three weeks we have seen up to 40 or 30 trucks or none of of Aid why we know that the Gaza strips needs at least 500 in in the in the best say scenarios before this while it's under blockade for uh 17 years I mean we need bring in back now because I just want to pick up on that question of where people will go we come back to it time and time again Gaza has been decimated there is nowhere to go inside especially nowhere safe and the UN has said it is not going to be party to any movement of people Force displacement it called it Abba I want to ask you what you think of satellite pictures that we're seeing uh on the border with Egypt where we see them preparing a buffer zone where we see them preparing a walled Camp CYO is denied that anything is happening there but does Netanyahu perhaps does the US even see a route out for Palestinians via the Raffa Crossing into the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt Cairo has denied it unimportantly Laura that they don't want us talking about it they have uh actually gone after journalists who have been revealing the creation of this buffer zone within Egypt so that's an important thing to remember but it's undeniable that it is happening um it would be a disaster for Egypt which important to remember that Egypt is also a key us Ally right biggest Arab country very close to the American Military the US has said we will not let this happen but again we haven't seen the US use its levers to prevent any broadscale push into Sinai I still think it's unlikely um just because Egypt would be extremely opposed to it um and I think many Palestinians would be very opposed right it's important to remember something like 80% of gazans are themselves descendants of refugees of of displaced people they do not want to feel they are being pushed out of their land yet again into another foreign space with no guarantee of when they could return and I do just want to pick up on the point about Northern Gaza CU I think that's a really important Point as well in terms of the US levers to alleviate this if we zoom out a little bit the US wants us to be talking about trucks right 40 trucks 200 trucks 500 trucks and what eight experts and and even some people in government are saying is that is just a deranged measure we cannot be thinking in those terms let's think a bigger sense where there are pockets of famine in Northern Gaza and there are many entrances through Israel that could be used to bring in humanitarian Aid if the US and Israel chose to do that right now they're not choosing to do that so I think as looking at Rafa and we and we think oh can they do this in some kind of humane way that would take care of these civilians but allow them to meet their military objectives the record is very clear right and and the actual us leverage in terms of taking care of Palestinian civilians has not been used and we aren't seeing any statements from the US or any openness from the Israeli side to to let that shape the the operation and Raa Patrick we know that the Israeli Army is in the North in the in central G I mean it's across the whole of the strip it is still trying to hold on it's still fighting battles in the north and other parts of Gaza KH Unis how give us an idea of how difficult it is to hold on to an area on one front whilst launching another offensive on another does Israel have the resources to cover the whole of the STP in a word yes I think it does its big strategic worry was a Hezbollah attack from the north and we saw obviously some fighting but it never really got to the escalation level of of Iran activating a proxy in a major strategic way which would then have Israel fighting on two fronts that's its worst case scenario it hasn't had to do that it's it sent some of its reservist home and it does have the military uh Power as were to to take and hold ground in in in canun Gaza City and down in rappa the difference is of course there's going to be some battles this is now the pockets of resistance that are left are fighting like an Insurgency you know they can hide they can blend in with civilians they're not going to just stand and fight like they did in in the early phases and so they're going to take casualties there's going to be intermittent battles there's a whole tunnel Network that they're still fighting through so but this isn't at the scale that we saw in the in the in the initial uh fights of course you know if you look at actually the way the casualties have gone it's gone it was very fast to 15,000 very fast to 20 and then started to slow down you know in one way thankfully although it's all too much you know still I would say just coming back to the other contributor about the West you know there it is growing you've had a US Air Force person imilate themselves to death outside the Israeli Embassy yesterday you've had the BBC leading with stories of Gaz and families who've lost 103 relatives over the you know over on their website today and yesterday day um and you've had the Dutch refuse you know by law their courts order them to stop supplying the Israeli parts for the F35 jet so there is movement you can say yeah it's not good enough at the governmental level you've had Ireland and Spain table motions about trade deals and and supplies to Israel too so there's things happening um but maybe obviously not enough quick enough n you're a Gaza resident we've got Netanyahu saying from day one that he will not stop until he has total Victory into him total Victory is the elimination of Hamas I think there has been a a stepping back in that rhetoric over the few months and the acceptance that you simply cannot eliminate Hamas in Gaza so what do you think total Victory would look like for Netanyahu I mean that's a good question I'm not sure if I have a a very intelligent answer but as a Palestinian and as a gazen I think Israel simply uh wants to control back the Gaza Strip and wants to control as much as possible from the Palestinian land and doesn't really care about any any agreements in the past or uh or even any of the Palestinian Authority um you know channel of negotiation but that's that's my personal as a Palestinian unfortunately I'm I'm very worried that I will never be able to go back and uh and the same for those who are now uh uh in in Gaza or are going to seek Refuge I think that's that's a very it's a very troubling uh another 1948 kind of scenario in our heads since since that day uh we were uh ordered to leave in October 13th AKA how much is the US considering the day after the war in Gaza what is the plan for the the governance of the strip for the rebuilding of the strip is it focused enough on this the US plan uh I first broke the news of this in January the US plan is is very much focused on an Israel us Saudi Arabia deal that would allow Saudi funding to come in maybe some other Arab states to come in and help reconstruct Gaza under a Palestinian Authority that does not include Hamas uh that's that's what they want um that doesn't mean they can get there right I mean you've seen this week uh some reshuffling on the Palestinian political side that may towards a new Palestinian government for the West Bank in Gaza but all of that to say these are post-war plans and right now we still don't have a plan to end the war and to your question from Netanyahu total Victory I think that's just not a victory right that that Israel can claim and I think that's that's sort of the the issue here right now is Israeli Society is so fractured uh Netanyahu himself is so alienated angry right and desperate to cling on to power that I don't know when we can get get Israel turning around and saying okay we're done so while postwar conversations are happening I think you could get some sort of veneer of stability you've swn the seeds of huge instability to come and and this goal of eradicating Hamas as you mentioned even the Israelis have kind of drawn back from that right now they're saying we're not eradicating we're just degrading right and okay and and then what you do right sort of three years down the line when when they are resurging they've already been resurging amid the war when there are Israeli forces in Gaza and I don't think that planning is happening yet in Washington or Tel okay it's been a really interesting discussion today thank you very much everyone for joining us akar
