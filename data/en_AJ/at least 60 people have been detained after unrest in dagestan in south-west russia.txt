now at least 60 people have been detained in Russia's dagistan region and that's after hundreds stormed the main airport in machala on Sunday to protest against the arrival of a flight from Israel now they breached security with some reaching the runway Witnesses say they stopped passengers and checked their passports looking for Israeli citizens the government of the largely Muslim region has voiced support for Gaza let's get more of this from Daniel Hawkins who joins us live now from Moscow uh Daniel what more are the authorities saying about this incident at the airport well we are expecting Vladimir Putin the Russian president to hold a meeting in about two hours time on what took place in MCA that could see some sort of statement in the meantime other Russian officials have made their position very clear the head of the dagistan region Sergey mikov has said that this violence was unjustified uh that Swift uh punishment will follow for those involved but also said that he believes this incident was orchestrated provoked and encouraged by what he describes as the enemies of Russia claiming that it was quote Ukrainian nationalists that had encouraged uh this vience at the airport to take place that was a position echoed by Maria zakara the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign Ministry who claimed that it was quote uh the KF regime that had or orchestrated this violence in order to discredit Russia's POS position on the international Arena now Russian officials claim that it was in particular one telegram channel the utra dagana Dagan morning Channel which has tens of thousands of followers uh which had incited people to take to the streets and go uh on this Rampage in the airport they claim this is a channel linked to Ilia panov who's a former Russian State Deputy who fled the country to Ukraine back in 2014 and has since encouraged the violent opposition uh to the the Kremlin and its policies in Ukraine in particular he has since denied that he's had anything to do with this channel since last year that's not something Russian authorities have bought making their position very clear that this incident was provoked uh from abroad uh by this Ukrainian Trace that they say was behind uh this quite shocking unrest at Mahala airport even with whatever happened at the airport it's still going to focus back to Russia as far as is is is concerned and Russia's own foreign policy stance when it comes to what's been happening in Gaza well indeed Russia's sought very much play a balancing act here and not take a direct side in this conflict though it's very clear from statements we've heard from Moscow that it sees the root cause of the problem and indeed of this recent escalation as the uh Injustice suffered by the Palestinian people and the denial of the statehood uh they've had over over the decades uh Moscow has sought to play uh the role of a mediator uh in this conflict or at least be seen uh willing to do so through its un resolutions through its statements calling for a ceasefire it also wants to prevent an escalation of the conflict that could harm its Regional allies Syria and Iran Russia of course has ties to both sides the Soviet Union being among the first countries to recognize Israel when it was formed H yet having very close ties to the Arab world again ating back to the Soviet era and to pan Arab nationalism uh indeed to modern day um Middle East as well through the op cartel so Russia very much has been part of Middle Eastern peace efforts before being part of that uh peace quartet but its role compared to the US and EU was rather limited so this escalation of violence Russia has seen as an opportunity to cement itself as a mediator in the Arab Israeli conflict through uh what it sees is it's more nuanced position trying to understand the anger felt among the Muslim world the global Muslim Community the Russian Muslim Community at the violence in Gaza without justifying any sort of violence or unrest both on home soil and Beyond so very much an opportunity for Russia to present itself uh as a state that seeks a more balanced position in contrast to its Western counterparts Daniel Hawkins for us there in Moscow thank you
