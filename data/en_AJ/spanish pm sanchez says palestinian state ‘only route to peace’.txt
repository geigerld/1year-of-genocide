Welcome to our special coverage here on aler where as of Tuesday May the 28th Norway Ireland and Spain have all formally recognized Palestine as a state it's a historic move reflecting the growing calls for a peaceful resolution to a 76-year conflict and an end to Israel's occupation it also reasserts the Palestinian people's right to self-determination now more than 7 months into Israel's devastating war on Gaza the chorus of voices denouncing the violence and impu is growing louder Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is increasingly isolated he's facing various legal challenges before two of the world's top courts with accusations of genocide and war crimes Norway Spain and Ireland are in good company most of the world supports Palestinian statehood more than 140 of the 193 members of the UN General Assembly recognize it the momentum too is building Slovenia and Malta have also said that they're considering formal recognition and more countries could also follow suit Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has just spoken ahead of a cabinet meeting that will then formally recognize Palestine he says the decision is essential for peace in the Middle East this is a historic decision that has a single goal to contribute to achieving peace between Israelis and Palestines the recognition of the State of Palestine is not only a matter of historical Justice with the legitim aspirations of the Palestine people but it is also an imperative need to achieve peace it is uh the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace that of a Palestine state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace well prime minister Sanchez also spoke about the next steps that Spain will now take going forward I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we will focus all our efforts to implement the two State solution and make it a reality we will work on three main priorities first we must urgently put an end to the ongoing unprecedent crisis in Gaza I call once again for permanent ceasefire for the entry of humanitarian Aid and for the immediate release of all the Israeli hostages held by Hamas secondly we will support Palestine National Authority in the reform process initiated by its new government the Palestine Authority is our partner for peace and it will need all of our support and finally we will continue to Foster cooperation with our Arab Partners who are working and uh committed towards peace and prosperity in the region we will continue working with them with the aim of convening an International Peace conference to implement a two State solution all the latest there Paul a real statement this morning from from prime minister Sanchez indeed uh highly symbolic momentous frankly uh he gave the statement in the Palace of moncla which is behind me uh just a statement it wasn't a news conference uh Us Media have been kept outside here you can probably see it's the inauspicious surroundings of a car park outside the palace unfortunately but what he had to say inside uh really will uh you know have significance all around the world you you've already played some of the two I think most uh momentous Parts o of his speech but there were other parts as well that I would highlight for example where he said that all our resolutions all the Spanish resolutions Spain Norway and Ireland are in line with existing un resolutions as adopted by European Union member states and that I think is very important to emphasize that this isn't Spain Ireland and Norway going it alone somehow in some kind of Maverick way all of the statement the recognition of Palestine as a state is is totally in line uh with the membership of the UN and the membership of the uh European Union um I think the other thing that I've been detecting while I've been here in Madrid is is a sense that the idea that the United States as the kind of leader of this uh of negotiations with Israel is is is is starting to wne I think the Palestinians clearly have been uh doing their diplomatic homework with the Europeans in particular um you think of back to the 2020 Abraham Accords the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab states uh caused alarm for the Palestinians and as a result they've been talking uh in a very concerted way with Europeans to to Ghana support there fearing that the United States are not going to take the Palestinian cause seriously well this is the product of those kinds of diplomatic efforts uh by the Palestinians and if I can say just finally you know to reiterate what he said this recognition by Spain Ireland and Norway is um not just a a historical justice as he described it but necessary he believes uh for peace Paul Brennan there with all the very latest for us this morning from Madrid thank you Paul make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
