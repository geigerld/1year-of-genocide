we go to turn to a report by the Israeli newspaper haret they spoke to officials in the Israeli military about the thousands of so-call terrorists they claimed to have killed in Gaza and they talked of kill zones or combat zones these are invisible red lines in and around areas of fighting or Israeli military presence if anyone who's not from the Israeli military crosses those lines they get shot or killed that includes Palestinian civilians and they're branded as terrorists by Israeli forces even if they've never a gun in their Liv so it's not about what the person did but where he was killed according to the report their only crime they breached an invisible line drawn by the Israeli Army the revelations came after aler obtained a distressing video over a week ago which showed the moments four unarmed Palestinians were killed by an Israeli drone in car nunis the attack reportedly took place in early February a senior Israeli officer told heret they were unarmed and didn't po a danger to their forces in the area we saw similar scenes last week aler obtained video showing Israel forces shooting once again at two unarmed Palestinians at close range one of the men repeatedly waved what appears to be a piece of white fabric to show they're not a threat this is an international symbol of surrender the bodies of the two Palestinians were then buried by an Israeli bulldozer let's take this on with Anthony lonstein he's the author of The Palestine laboratory a book on Israel's arms and surveillance industry uh joins us now live from Sydney Anthony thanks for joining us here it's distressing to watch those videos but these so-called kill zones are a familiar mode of operating for the Israeli Army aren't they they are disturbingly so because I've been reporting on this issue around Gaza and Palestine for close to 20 years and if you look at pretty much every major Gaza War between Israel and Hamas since pretty much 2009 you see after those Wars Israeli soldiers speak to W from the group of bling the silence which is an Israeli NGO talking about what they did and they regularly said that Rules of Engagement were loose beyond belief that killing civilians was normal and this I think really doesn't just go to the Rules of Engagement but also to the permissive culture within the Israeli military where over years so few soldiers ever get prosecuted for any kind of serious crimes this Al applies to the West Bank so obviously this current situation is on a scale that we've never seen before in Palestine but what we're seeing in this haret report and I've been hearing also from my sources a sadly familiar tale yeah the Israeli argument is that in war lines are blurred that you enter these zones and you will get killed but the point is people just don't know where the lines are do they they don't and I mean this is exactly what the US was saying in Iraq and Afghanistan after 911 when the us was killing huge amounts of civilians and again these invisible lines that civilians don't know where they are and Israel has a long track record long before this current post October 7 environment of killing huge amounts of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank and again this I think goes to the heart of why the international criminal court in the icj are looking very seriously at these kinds of examples because these kinds of Courts can intervene when domestic courts do not or cannot and it's pretty clear that over years the Israeli courts have no interest frankly in addressing these and order the Israeli political establishment or the media it's important to note that this kind of culture in Israel I spent years living in Palestine that the culture within Israel the Israeli media is not just permissive but dehumanizes Palestinians so as we've seen since October 7 huge amounts of Israeli soldiers proudly posting on the internet Tik Tok and Instagram themselves dehumanizing Palestinians blowing up Palestinian homes that I think is directly connected to these kinds of cases where so many Palestinian civilians including those who are literally waving White flags are killed in Cold Blood are there rules of operation in uh of Engagement Rules of Engagement I should say in Israeli operations or are they just open to interpretation by whoever's commanding that patch of land all the Israeli military of course said is that um there are in that harat report they claim that they have very strict rules of engagement and whenever there is a case for example the recent one of the icj Israel says very clearly that they their soldiers must abide by certain rules but what matters really is the reality on the ground and not just these Israeli soldiers talking to harats in the last day or so but over years years and years you have Israeli soldiers talking about the idea that because they realize that there's no real punishment for killing Palestinians or injuring them this is not just in Gaza but the West Bank and East Jerusalem and in fact military culture is one that is Led from the top I mean you had the Israeli defense minister and indeed many in the Israeli military establishments since October 7 Distributing literally leaflets talking about how Israel is going in there to cleanse their words Palestinians I mean this is the culture that allows that kind of inhumane killing and it's tragic that over you know we're thinking now about what 35 40,000 Palestinians killed since October 7 a vast vast majority of them are not terrorists they're Palestinian civilians and yet Israel keeps on claiming that about 9 to 10 thousand of those numbers are terrorists when that figure is clearly massively inflated you would think that anybody uh walking in open land if they may well be suspects as far as the Israelis are concerned could just be arrested rather than just blown up well potentially I mean that of course would be the logic iCal Humane outcome but in the cases that alir has screened in the last couple of weeks and there have been many others that other media Outlets have obtained we see cases of Palestinian civilians just going to try to retrieve items from their destroyed homes or trying to get food we've seen the various cases of Israel targeting individuals who are trying to get either food that's been dropped by the Americans or others or food trucks that are being brought in Via Rafa on the Egyptian side so that would be the logical outome but again there is no accountability for these kinds of killings and whether it's by drone or quadcopter or simply Israel's opening fire this is why International attention and international prosecution is so important now we cannot simply wait and hope that the Israeli military or establishment will investigate this because history shows they will not right it was that widespread condemnation but nothing ever seems to change anony I just want to bring you back to our story about Al shiffer the Israelis pulling out of Israeli Army pulling out of the alifer hospital complex where they have been for two weeks as you know uh leaving Dreadful destruction behind it's a second time they've assaulted the area targeting hospitals of course prohibited under international law but again it is the way the Israeli Army operates and it's important to not that the first time they went in there the whole coverage was that they were discovering a Hamas command and control center which was not found at all the second time in the last weeks they claiming that huge amounts of Hamas and Islamic Jihad Fighters were in there I haven't seen much evidence for that frankly but again as you rightly say it is il legal to essentially bombard destroy and attack a hospital where there are thousands and thousands of Palestinian civilians where the hospitals in Gaza have already been completely destroyed in the last months and it seems yet again without International intervention and the US and Germany the two biggest arms dealers that are selling weapons and giving weapons to Israel until that stops until that stops I fear that this war will continue now Palestinian officials have said that hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in an round out shifer in over the past couple of weeks what would account for that high rate of casualties do you think or the fact that so many Palestinians are Sheltering in the hospitals I mean this has been the case since October 7 there although the hospitals have been targeted extensively by the Israelis many civilians have nowhere else to go because their homes have been destroyed it's also not forget it's winter still very cold and many Palestinians need intense Medical Care and hospitals are and there's nowhere safe in Gaza but it's somewhere to go and after these rallies pulled out of aifer a few months ago the Hope was obviously a false hope that alifer would remain to be a safe place but clearly it's not and again the idea that Israel is not just bombing but air striking areas around these hospitals it's not just a breach of international law I mean I saw this before medicine on Frontier msf routinely saying that their own teams are being targeted I mean this is kind of the actions of a rogue State not of a so-called democracy which receives huge amounts of support from the Western Elites to this day Anthony I appreciate that thanks for your knowledge anony larstein uh speaking to us there from syney thank you
