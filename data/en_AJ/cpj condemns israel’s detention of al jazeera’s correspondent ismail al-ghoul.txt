let's speak now to jod Ginsburg she's the president of the committee to protect journalists she joins us now live from New York thank you for your time your reaction uh to this news that's coming through to us in the last hour or so so that Israeli forces during the process of raiding alifa Hospital have severely beaten Al jazer journalist is Gul well first let me say that we condemn unequivocally this assault and arrest of Ishmael Al and uh the Detention of his colleagues journalists play an essential role in a war they are the eyes and the ears that we need to document what's happening and with every journalist killed with every journalist arrested our ability to understand what's happening in Gaza diminishes significantly I mean you you heard there our colleague Patti cohain in Washington saying that America still has the narrative that there is no evidence that journalists have been targeted by Israelis or the Israeli Army in Gaza I mean what more evidence really is is needed well it's not simply not credible I mean we've had a number of instances where we know journalist have been targeted we've had several reports for example into the killing of reuter's reporter Isam ABD we know because the Israelis said so that uh Hamza D mustafaa who were killed in their car as they were traveling were targeted by Israel Israel claimed that they were terrorists we've still seen no absolutely no credible evidence this is the worst Conflict for journalists that the committee to protect journalists has ever documented and the situation is simply getting worse I mean in this case uh what we're hearing is that Israeli forces destroyed uh a number of br broadcasting vehicles of the press Crews that were at Aliva Hospital you can't get more blatant than that can you it looks like a deliberate attempt to prevent the The Assault on the hospital being documented there is a history of uh Israel uh targeting media facilities for example in previous conflicts we've seen that and and attacking media facilities is not acceptable attacking journalists um preventing journalists from reporting is not acceptable and and certainly the deliberate targeting of journalists and the destruction of their Communications equipment um is a criminal act and j i I know you're in a rush to go but I just want to squeeze in one more question we heard there from Mansour Shuman he was on on on the show in the studio he's just returned uh he's just entered uh Doha from Gaza and he was he basically mentioned you the committee to protect journalists and said more needs to be done by International bodies like yourself to prevent these kinds of things from happening what do you say to that I hear that and we have been doing everything in our power to raise these issues at the highest levels we have been systematically documenting these attacks so that we have the evidence that we need to present to Future investigative bodies for example we bring this consistently to the highest levels of government unfortunately the way that we're seeing this war unfold is that International organizations like the committee to protect journalists and others do not seem to be being listened to by governments like the United States who have the power to bring this to a stop to bring this to an end so we continue to raise our voices consistently and loudly to encourage International bodies International governments to use the evidence that we are bringing to them to help bring this to an end okay thank you for your time Jody Ginsburg president of the committee to protect journalists thank you
