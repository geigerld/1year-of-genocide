hello we begin in KH Yunis in southern Gaza where Israeli forces have stormed the largest medical facility in the strip nasad hospital has been under siege for weeks these are scenes moments after it was shelled overnight Israeli soldiers then launched their raid forcing everyone out including patients in intensive care and families Sheltering from Israeli attacks I left with my husband he is blind I was doing kidney dialysis they destroyed the wall surrounding us as well as Dr rit's room they ordered us to leave and fired at us they fired bombs and Rockets on our heads from the top they demolished the building we left from the door and we walked through sewage along with my husband the Israelis then took my husband and I lost my two bags I cannot find them last night was very difficult the air strikes were so tense and hit a room of patience two people were killed and one of them is unidentified he was hit by rocket fire and split in half his lower part was inside the hospital and the other half outside the building people were hurt people who'd already been injured the orthopedic department has been completely destroyed the entire complex was in chaos the displaced and the patients were ordered to evacuate the hospital immediately there were snipers and they head above our heads we couldn't move from building to building there were many bodies by the hospital entrance it was worse than what happened at alifa hospital I'm injured and I was forced to walk an hour because there were no ambulances no medical staff and no red cison there was no one to help us Escape no one let's get an update from T abum who's joining us from ra City in southern Gaza I mean t these are harrowing stories coming out of a nasad hospital not the first time that Israelis conduct a raid on a hospital where they intensive care patients what are you hearing about the situation right now and what's happened to the patients well it was clearly quite predictable during that the Israeli forces were planning to storm uh the NASA medical facility as they have been putting the entire facility of the place under a Israeli military Siege where they were preventing anyone from moving their on the ground and uh today they have stormed the vicinity of the hospital as Israeli forces had uh entered and stormed different Departments of the of the hospital as they were forcing people to flee and to get out from this medical facility now also the Israeli fighs have targeted the orthopedic department where a number of medical teams have been injured inside this medical uh facility but we need to clearly understand that there are still patients alongside with Medical Teams there inside the hospital where the Israeli forces are informing and require requesting from people to get out from the hospital while there are some patients who are in a very desperate need for assistance by somebody else they have refused their demands to afford them help as they are forced to flee along there and it's a clear black out of communication there where nobody can know more information about what is happening in terms of the situation inside the hospital because the Israeli forces are are informing everyone to get out from this medical facility while some people by the way get arrested at as they were fleeing uh the hospital by the Israeli military forces throughout the military checkpoints that they were established on all ways that leading to an nasar hospital now the Israeli forces as well had stormed the uh the yards of the hospital where there are mass Graves and cemeteries being established for people who did not manage to be buried outside of the medical facility the also the graves had been ruined and destroyed by the Israeli forces there as a part of the ongoing genocidal military campaign in that area Okay uh T just uh uh hang on there for just a moment cuz I'll get reaction from hamda and then come back to you and get an update on the Gaza Strip ham who joining us from occupied East Jerusalem to tell us what's being said by the Israelis on this because they're putting forward claims that Hamas had previously held hostages at that hospital and that the bodies of deceased captives may be present I mean have they provided any credible evidence to support these claims hamda no sort of evidence provided by the Israeli military about the claims they're making the captives were being held in the unwed hospital and that there are bodies of captives in the hospital as well the Israeli Army spokesperson Daniel hagad speaking at length and releasing multiple statements saying that the Israelis had what they called credible intelligence that the captives were being held there that there were bodies of captives and additionally that Hamas was using the medic medical facility for military purposes all of these claims for which they have not provided that proof to the public but this is just the latest in a series of claims that they've made around hospitals the arantis hospital Al hospital and most notedly the AL shifa Hospital remember they said that Hamas was using it as some sort of military headquarters for their military operations but that was not true and there was no sort of information to B up those claims there have also been cemeteries and graveyards that have been desecrated bodies that have been dug up and taken from those grave sites because they also believed there were the bodies of captives there based on intelligence but again there was no result there and the intelligence that they said they had to back up those claims was simply not provided the Israeli Army says that they're working at length to protect civilians but at least 10,000 Palestinians are Sheltering in an around the unid medical complex and at least one person has died as the hospital continues to be under siege so the israelies have been making these claims but again no proof to back them up yet again Dar okay hamda thank you uh for that update from occupied East Jerusalem
