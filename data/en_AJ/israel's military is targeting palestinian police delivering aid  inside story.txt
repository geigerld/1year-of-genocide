Palestinian police escorting Aid trucks in Gaza are being regularly attacked by Israel's military and that's as tens of thousands of people are starving in the strip and civil order is breaking down so is Benjamin netanyahu's government creating a security vacuum in Gaza and if so hello and welcome to the program I'm D abuga the Biden Administration says Palestinian police trying to help deliver Aid to Gaza are being targeted by Israel's military and they're among others in positions of authority like journalists doctors and ambulance workers who've all been repeatedly attacked along with civilians and this comes on top top of the destruction of infrastructure from the north to the South including hospitals schools roads communication networks and the water system it's part of a deepening humanitarian catastrophe as tens of thousands of people are starving and heavy fighting is continuing to take lives so why is Israel systematically targeting all arms of Palestinian Authority in Gaza and what does this mean for the future governance of the strip we have plenty to to discuss with our guests but first this report US officials are urging Israel to stop attacking Palestinian police trying to ensure the safety of Aid trucks Israeli air strikes on officers have hindered the delivery of essential supplies and the US says that's allowing armed groups to seize control in the strip especially in the north this has caused the number of a trucks entering Gaza to reduce significantly and has led to more Palestinians being forced from their homes or shelters and widespread starvation the situation is tough rough and difficult anywhere in Gaza Strip the whole Palestinian people suffer too much we all suffer the world mocks us and gives us a can of beans the Palestinian people can't afford to buy anything one onion costs three shekels we have never seen that before some families have been all killed in one go and their names will never be there in the records this is not fair I am 73 years old and I have never been in such a miserable situation I've seen so many wars but this is the worst I've never witnessed anything like this starvation we used to suffer a lot but not like this on Thursday Israeli aircraft bombed buildings belonging to Palestinian police in the middle of a crowded Market in the ja refugee camp in the North US officials say at least 11 police officers in Rafa have been killed in Israeli air strikes in recent weeks vital infrastructure including hospitals schools roads and the water system have also been hit worsening the humanitarian crisis Israeli officials say they have drafted plans to enable Aid to get into Gaza such as by cooperating with local groups that oppose Hamas but it's unclear whether these proposals that include the opening of a new Crossing in Northern Gaza will be implemented in the near future and any role for the International Community in the future governance of the territory is also uncertain Felix Nara Inside [Music] Story okay let's bring in our panel of guests to unpack the situation which has Cru crucial consequences for the people of Gaza as well as global politics joining us from London is Chris gannis who is a spokesman for unwa during previous Israeli attacks on the strip and he's now the director of the Myanmar accountability project in ramala and the occupied West Bank W habas is a researcher at the Palestinian forum for Israeli studies his work focuses on Colonial structures placed by Israel on the occupied territories and joining us from the he is Sultan Barakat who's a professor of public policy at hammed bin Khalifa University here in Qatar gentlemen welcome to the program thanks so much for your time if I may start with you is Israel Israel deliberately targeting um the aidid workers the the police in the Gaza Strip as well as um other POS people in positions of authority yes for sure uh intentionally Israel is targeting everything I want wanted to say that the the day after plan which netan introduced days before includes what Israel doesn't want from Gaza and does not include what it wants exactly and therefore if I may analyze the situation isra I do let me just stop you right there for just a moment well because we're going to talk about the plan that Netanyahu has submitted to security cabinet when it comes to the day after but first let's just look at these attacks why do you say that Israel is deliberately targeting uh these people what do you base that on because Israel wants to deive Hamas from three things three important things for first the administration of the civilian Affairs including of course later on the education and the healthare but currently the any type of administration inside Gaza Strip the second thing is the Reconstruction process and the third thing is the humanitarian AIDS and money and by the way this is why also owna is targeting in a way or another so showing like having Israel civilian police by Hamas controlling the AIDS that coming inside Gaza is one of the targets that Israel have been like in the last two weeks Israel have reduced decreased the number of trucks entering Gaza very sharply and the one of the reasons is that that there is no h a official party inside Gaza to receive these AIDS and to distribute them if we want to connect this uh to the current negotiations in Paris Israel uses this as a strategic tool ER to impose pressure on on Hamas of course because in this way Israel aims at making a Chasm if I may say so between the isra the the gazan population and the government of Hamas or the Hamas in general this Chasm will create like a humanitarian crisis because nobody's governing administrating the population in Gaza and this is exactly what Israel wants to do to to to to to increase its pressure on Hamas okay God thank you so much W for that analysis from rala Chris gunnis um in London look you were the spokes spokesman for unoa during previous Israeli attack so you've seen what happens during Israel's Wars on Gaza have you you seen this before and do you share W's assessment that these are in fact deliberate attacks by Israel yes and yes I have seen these before and I absolutely do agree with W's analysis isn't it interesting though that Joe Biden who gave a green light to Mr Netanyahu for his War aim to completely destroy Hamas is now realizing what we all knew in the first place which is that ultimately Hamas will be necessary Hamas will be necessary in the short term for the delivery of humanitarian Aid Hamas is more than just a vicious organization that kills Israelis which is how it's portrayed in the west Hamas is a political movement and it's very clear that in order to deliver Aid in the short term the structures the social structures the the medical structures the other structures the education structures are going to be necessary in the shortterm in the medium term and in the long term when it comes to discussing the reconstruction of Gaza the idea that Hamas should be completely destroyed is absolutely self-defeating if ultimately what you're interested in is rebuilding Gaza and preparing the people there for participation in a two-state solution or whatever kind of state solution and isn't it also interesting that as well as Biden giving a green light for destroying Hamas the Americans are also giving a green light to destroying anra now if you destroy the Hamas political structures as well as unr's humanitarian Aid structures you are left with pretty much nothing so I think we all need to wake up and I think the American Administration is waking up to the fact that this policy of underwriting netanyahu's erroneous war war aims are entirely self-defeating the world should go back and remember what it was doing in 2005 2006 at that time the moderates the technocrats the businessmen within Hamas were being empowered to stand in elections and guess what they did stand in elections the moderates in Hamas did very well but what did the world do led by Israel led by the Americans in the quartet who took of course unr's sorry the un's political office and all of the UN and the Russians and the Europeans as part of G with them they decided to isolate and effectively to destroy Hamas we heard this place before it leads nowhere we need to sense empowering them give us a sense Chris gunnis of what this means for the risk for the civilian population in Gaza as a result of all of this it's a very good question you rais and the risks are immeasurable here we have 2.3 million people actually experiencing the beginnings of starvation starvation is a longterm slow motion Massacre and it has started so the UN has already said the senior most humanitarian the UN has said that 400,000 people are actually starving now so if this policy is allowed to continue attacking Hamas destroying the Hamas Aid workers destroying anra the consequences will be absolutely apocalyptic and the his and history will judge these Western leaders very harshly which is why I say unra needs to be refunded immediately destroying Hamas destroying unra will lead to Absolute catastrophe it will backfire on the west Gaza is being radicalized Gaza is being bombed back to the Stone Age the people there have suffered enough it's time for a complete policy rethink and I hope that what we're seeing from the Biden Administration in these latest comments is the beginning of that policy rethink and certainly the realization that allowing Netanyahu to press on with this war aim of defeating Hamas is absolutely erroneous it's self-defeating it must be rethought IM immediately because the people of Gaza have suffered enough okay let's bring in Sultan Barakat um speaking of Biden Chris gunnis was just mentioning President Biden Sultan so his administration has reportedly asked Israel to stop targeting members of the civilian police force who escort a trucks in Gaza and apparently warning that a total breakdown of Law and Order is significantly exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in The Enclave um it it what do you make of this this response by by the American Administration I mean do they have to come out and say something at this point while at the same time continuing to arm Israelis how does this make sense they've been coming out and saying all sorts of things over the last few weeks while continuing to arm the Israelis and clearly Israel does not take much of what they say into consideration uh the idea I think the Americans are putting forward is Central around revital revitalized uh Palestinian Authority and uh they have now called again for for the two State as the ultimate solution for the conflict between Israel and Palestine as did many nations I think Netanyahu is mistaken to think that now he can dictate on the Palestinians and the rest of the world what the future of Gaza would look like he has it's a big miscalculation because of the mobilization that has happened in opinions in court courts all over the world uh people are not I I think will find it very difficult to accept what he's putting forward his idea is to continue occupation but without calling it occupation without being accountable for it as an occupation he's calling for Israel continuing to have full security control not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank so he's reversing whatever small achievements have have been made with the oso agreement he's talking about full control from The River To The Sea and within that he would like the Palestinians to go back to the tribal days where he would selectively appoint uh civil leaders tribal leaders who will then uh carry the Aid on behalf of the population manage the their daily Affairs and so on and that is totally unrealistic and in fact it could backfire big way because the absence of order uh as was explained earlier by Chris and W is actually actually not a threat only for the Palestinians but it's also a threat for the very security of Israel so the best way I think moving forward is is we isra Israel has got to accept that occupation must come to an end a two-state solution is not is not something that they can reject unilaterally uh and they don't have the right to deprive the Palestinians of self-determination if they don't want to occupy according to the international law then they have to step back a little bit and allow the International Community to take on its responsibility and from that point I think the International Community has really run out of options short of international protection and given the number of people that have been killed we're now edging on 30,000 people directly killed through this war International protection is the only way forward and it has to come under chapter 7 where Palestinians are protected not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank to allow them the space to come up with this revitalized uh government or state and this will take time it could be a two or three or fouryear uh break but it cannot be done under the administration of the military administration of the Israelis because Israel has shown long enough history uh of very aggressive occupation which many nations if you were following I'm now speaking to you from the he have Illustrated it one after the other over the last few days in the heg if you refer to the Qatari statement for example they've very clearly pointed out the nature of this occupation it's not it's not an an ideal form of occupation that follows the law this occupation is determined to depopulate the area and push the Palestinian Palestinians out and before okay I I hear what you're saying about about um the occupation because of course that is the context for for everything that is happening here but wed raised a point earlier on and he said that uh for Israel to destroy sort of the the Civil Society and civil Administration in Gaza this is a strategic tool to pressure Hamas when it comes to any sorts of negotiations taking place and we know now uh there have been negotiations of course in Paris we wait to hear what comes out of those um do you think that Israel first of all do you agree with that statement and do you think that Israel is succeeding in pressuring Hamas in that way I mean what can they do more than killing 30,000 people destroying the Hall of Gaza I don't think it's about just pressuring Hamas although it may have some impact it's really about making sure that the whole population is mobile they want the Palestinians to be uh in a mobile form where they can be pushed anywhere at any time they pushed them from North to the middle of Gaza to now to the south of Gaza there talks about Arrangement between them and Egypt to temporarily push them into SI and then allow them back after Israel has secured the area all these scenarios I think are obviously are illegal and unrealistic and if anything they're going to generate a create a generation that will be full of more hatred to Israel than the one that has just passed uh Israel without changing fundamentally the way they address the Palestinian question they can never have security and they must get that into their minds no way for the 2.5 million people to love the Israelis and live with them uh you know as neighbors under the current circumstances no one will do it and we have seen much lesser sort of intens intensity conflicts around the world and and they were not able to reverse the level of hatred uh by simply allowing small amount of Aid here and there okay W uh we started out the the the show and you you said that you wanted to address this uh netanyahu's post-war Gaza plan now part of the document states that and I'm quoting here that local elements with management experience will be responsible for civilian management and public order in Gaza right this is what Netanyahu is saying that he plans to do and then we see this destruction of the Civil Society and civil Administration in Gaza is there a link between the two and talk to us about uh about netanyahu's plan and what you make of it yes of course and if you allow me I want to summarize a little bit the history since 1967 and I want to refer you to Momo Gaz which he was the second governor of the colonial Administration in the west back Gaza Strip he he he put his book titled the carrot and the stick and he says that Israel can only prevent the Palestinians from self-determination only if Israel administrates or controls or manage the Palestinian population it manages the Palestinian population through an indirect colonial rule whether it was like The Villages leagues the Palestinian Authority through International agreements or whe whether with Clans or families inside Gaza this is the plan n is talking about regardless it is an indirect colonial rule in which a colonial bureaucracy which is the military Council led by the Israeli occupation forces H lead the third component is the carrot and the stick which means that the parties which Israel wants to collaborate with are to be rewarded empowered if they adhire to Israeli security policy and Israeli agenda and they are punished uh and violence could be used against the population and these uh parties that controls or manages the Palestinians Affairs inside Gaza or West Bank wherever okay this is the carot and the stick and we never saw like a much more violent stick than the genocidal war that we witness today but if we talk about the day after Gaza Netanyahu mentioned what he doesn't want in Gaza but he never said what he really do want in Gaza and the reason is that he left this intentionally he wants to make a vacuum in order to re-engineer this colonial administration of the Gaza Strip of course preserve the split between the Gaza and the West Bank H this discussion is a little bit different from discussing the occupation from the international law perspective we if we look at the colonial management of the Palestinian population we see that netanyahu's day after plan is part and parcel of a long Doctrine started in 1967 okay let's bring in Chris GIS um Chris the Israeli military when asked whether they were targeting uh police uh who are guard ing Aid convoys had this response the Israeli forces said uh we the the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities elements involved in military activity may be targeted what do you make of that response well I living proof of the disinformation and frankly the lies which the IDF have put out I could write my PhD thesis about this those comments are simply not to be trusted reality the number of civilians women and children who have been killed lie that frankly insulting statement but can I pick up on something which Sultan I think was saying quite rightly earlier and that is about the right of the occupying power to have a role and a say in the political dispensation of what comes next the so-call day after what we have right now which Sultan alluded to is more than a quarter of the UN member states in the he right now at the icj asking for an urgent determination that the occupation is illegal twofold first of all in the the way it's applied the apartate system the arrest the torture of children in the middle of the night the blockade of Gaza and now this genocide but also existentially that the occupation is illegal because it denies the Palestinians the right which All Peoples have to self-determination so the idea that the occupying power can determine who in Gaza decides on self-determination is a clear absurdity and the other I think very valid point that sulan made it's about International protection when you look at Rua when you look at 1.5 and growing number of people in a place which was intended to support life for a quarter of a million people that's six times more than is there clearly the protection of those people and the whole of Gaza needs to be taken out of the hands of the Israelis and put under International protection now what does that mean precisely we need to look back at what President Obama did after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 he signed an executive order and within days 20,000 US service and civilian Personnel were on the ground there were warships off the coast of Haiti there were floating hospitals there were aircraft carriers with helicopters fing people backwards and forwards we need to establish 75,000 latrines you know one latrine for 20 people that's what the UN calculates 1.5 million people do the math that's 75,000 thein t for people um you know how many TS is that we need a huge mobilization of a global humanitarian effort probably led by America um but others need to join in and that needs to be mobilized immediately such that the plight of 1,5 1.5 million people does not deteriorate to the point where a catastrophe turns into an apocalypse okay let's get Sultan to elaborate on this point of international protection Sultan how do you get there and you know Chris gunnis is saying that you need America to kind of spearhead this that's one would say highly unlikely isn't it well at the moment is probably difficult given that the United States is in elections here and that's something that natano understands very well but I feel that the issue has now gone beyond the hands of the United States and even the permanent five although there is an attempt by the United Kingdom and others to circumvent the discussion in the ha to bring back the issue of the Palestinian uh the occupation of Palestine to the security Council knowing 100% that it's been there for 75 years and nothing happened uh the rest of the world is waking up and I think Gaza coming so close to Ukraine and the contrast it has uh developed when you compare the two cases has given the rest of the world particularly the global South and an incredible amount of energy to stand up to all sort of injustices what we saw South Africa doing in the heg is is not uh an it's not an easy task for a country like South Africa to take Israel knowing exactly who's behind it uh to take them to court but it has really started to worken up the the humanity of the majority of the population including large numbers of the populations within those dominating countries so I would be uh really uh surprised I don't think we can really go back to the before seven of October Arrangement that the Israelis can simply assume they will dictate on the rest of the world what can happen uh and particularly I mean they need to look at it from their security perspective not only the security of Israel but the security of all of us from a a wave that we dread to think about in terms of of terrorism what the Israelis have fed through the killing the Relentless killing of the Palestinians they have fed a huge you know anger around the world that can easily translate into uh terrorist movements that will probably be much much worse than we saw around the 911 and the years after so it is in the interest of everyone to start thinking collectively as to how to diffuse the situation on humanitarian basis but also in security basis and also on developmental basis you know when we talk about the Reconstruction jump pardon I do apologize but just for the sake of time we just have one minute remaining and I see that wed wants to jump in there W final thoughts for you yes I wanted to say that regardless of our position from Hamas and I everybody all the Palestinians think that it is the right to use revolutionary violence against the occupation power but regardless of the position of Hamas it is the ethically the the the the the the role of Hamas to govern Gaza Strip in the day after because he it was the government responsible of the of 2,00 2.5 million Palestinians and she holds all the fs and and she holds all everything in Gaza so it is part of destroying the the the the the gazan population if you want to move this Administration like suddenly to any other party and it is also the role of the the the the Arab countries the Arab regimes that surrounding Gaza to contribute once and forever to end this humanitarian er um well in in in Gaza Strip okay thank you so much we'll have to leave it there thank you for joining us thanks to all my guests Chris gunnis W
