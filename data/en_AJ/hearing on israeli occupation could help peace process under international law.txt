okay I'm going back I'm going back this is an Israeli checkpoint in the occupied West Bank a sign of Israel's military control over the territory since 1967 more than 3 million Palestinians here face about 700 different obstacles to their freedom of movement including checkpoints roadblocks and Gates there's no other way to call it Bart it's not only a human rights organization I mean anyone who looks at the situation on the ground knows it is aparte rights organizations say Palestinians are denied basic civil rights including that of freedom of assembly Association and expression the Oslo Accords signed in Washington DC in 1993 were supposed to bring about Palestinian self-determination the Accords divided the West Bank into areas a b and c C area C exclusively for Israelis constitutes about 60% of the West Bank and that figure is growing there are up to 34 of a million Israeli settlers living in about 250 settlements in violation of international law they openly carry weapons often intimidating attacking and harassing Palestinians to displace them from their lands children in the occupied West Bank are also targeted Israel is the only country in the world to prosecute children in military courts meanwhile UNICEF says 2023 was the worst year on record in which soldiers killed 124 children the UN special rorer an independent expert responsible for monitoring human rights in the occupied territories was recently barred from entering is Israel franches albeni says that's been happening for the last 16 years by refusing me entry Israel is abusing of its powers as an occupying power so as long as it Remains the occupying power in the West Bank the Gaza Strip and is Jerusalem Israel needs to conform with the rules of the United Nations recent comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu point to a doubling down on its continued military occupation I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River my insistance is what has prevented over the years the establishment of a Palestinian State Israeli raids happen nightly now nearly 400 Palestinians including more than a 100 children have been killed in the occupied West Bank since Israel's war on Gaza began in October Mike leppel El jazer Daniel Le is president of the US Middle East project and he's a former Israeli negotiator he's joining us live from London thank you very much indeed for being with us uh we've all all that we've heard uh for the first three hours of the uh hearings in the international court of justice in the he has been the Palestinian delegation putting forward its case how is Israel likely to respond well Rob as you probably know Israel has chosen not to turn up itself uh at these oral hearings this is quite unprecedented the the the magnitude of this hearing people will know that 20 years ago there was an advisory opinion offered regarding the wall uh that Israel has constructed illegally inside the occupied Palestinian territories at that hearing 20 years ago you had 15 states show up for the oral uh arguments which is what is happening this week and next Monday this time around it's more than 50 States this is the the most that have ever been at any hearing of any case before the international court of justice in the ha in history but Israel is not going there now we saw the uh shellacking the quite significant crushing defeat Israel took uh in its case uh when South Africa brought Israel to the court still being considered with regard to plausible violations of the genocide convention so Israel will have others make its case for it of the 50 who are going to be there less than 10 are going to be siding with Israeli kind of arguments the US uh primarily amongst them what they will be arguing I imagine and we've seen this in their written submissions is the court should keep its nose out of this it's not admissible it's not justiciable and crucially that this is an issue that should be decided in negotiations it's political it's not legal why is that so important because the question here is whether the peace process 30 years of agreements under which Israel has just entrenched its occupation its control its apartheid is the peace process something that should be Untouched by International legality international law and the peace process are two things that should never meet this is the Israel argument that allows you then to have a peace process and we're hearing now a lot of talk especially from the US and from others that there's going to be a new attempt to revive Oslo to revive this peace process and I think what they're telling us is the peace process should be an action of asymmetry where a powerful party can bully another party with its external allies can force it to accept things that are illegal under international law and what this case is doing is trying to ring fence and suggest that any peace effort has to run according to international law and should not be an effort in simply recrystallizing and formalizing the existing apartheid reality in the cases that we heard this morning the the rulings of excuse me the the representations that were made this morning at the icg uh Israel was being referred to as an occupying power now I just I want to ask you about that but I just think it's worth running through the obligations that an occupying power uh has under certain circumstances in this case it says the occupied territory must be administered for the benefit of the local population in this case Palestinians but Israel enforces discriminatory laws and policies subjecting Palestinians even children to military rather than civilian courts the laws state public order and safety must be ensured however armed settler attacks are at record levels Israel must not displace the local population or move its own civilians into the territory but an estimated 750,000 Israeli settlers inhabit about 300 settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem the occupying power is also forbidden from enforcing Collective punishment on the local population but Israel routinely destroys infrastructure it demolishes homes and it digs up roads So Daniel I want to come back to you given all of that um over the years that has been this intensification of int Israeli control in uh particularly occupied West Bank and also in uh occupied East Jerusalem um why has there been that intensification over the years when from from a from somebody from the point of view of somebody looking at it from outside it would seem that uh removing a lot of those obstacles making things actually easier for Palestinians would have provided some sort of roote to some sort if not a two-state solution then at least some sort of calming of the situation well indeed you just offered us the list of things that Israel is in violation of every single one of them that was the argument made uh this morning in the court by the Palestinian representation it's an argument you will have in various guises repeated by many of the states that will make uh oral presentations over the coming days and it's there in their written submissions the court will hear all the major structural issues self-determination annexation illegal occupation settlement status of Jerusalem and crucially discrimination uh because 22 of the states there 24 or if you include the regional groupings have referenced apartheid either in terms of the violations of the convention uh against all forms of racial discrimination or the apartheid convention itself so it's precisely the fact that international law has not been applied that Israel has been treated with impunity and no accountability which has allowed us to get to this horrific reality which has been described which you described and which we see every day on the ground for Palestinians now here's where the difficulty comes in Rob because as we both know this is an advisory opinion it's not enforceable it's not self-enforcing so what does it mean the idea I think is that not only do you ring fence questions of international legality but you also then dial up the squirm Factor the embarrassment Factor but also the legal complications for third parties in terms of their responsibilities and the consequences of being complicit in this violation of international law and in guaranteeing impunity for the violating party namely Israel now sometimes that may mean things go to local courts we already saw what happened after the South Africa genocide initial provisional measures ruling in the Netherlands and the court there with regard to the provision of arms other things I think whether it's personal Criminal criminal liability whether it's the relations they conduct with Israel they the relations that third States conduct with Israel's illegal actions in the territories the provision of arms to enact these illegal policies I don't want to give a polanish uh optimistic statement to anyone that when in several months the court makes its ruling Everything Changes overnight but this gives important tools potentially new tools for what we all know is going to be a long walk to freedom to dismantling a parthe but one that will pass through by necessity important moments of legal iteration and around those crucial mobilization of Civil Society actors of consumers of legal bodies and ultimately of State actors including the impressive submissions and arguments that I think we will hear from very important States notably those in the global South and notably those who have lived on under aparte and colonization in the past Daniel Levy we appreciate you being with us in Al thank you very much indeed
