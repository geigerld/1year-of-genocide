here's a quick Gaza update for you there is a ceasefire deal on the table but there's a whole load of uncertainty around it first of all we don't actually know who came up with it the US says the proposal came from Israel but Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't agreed to it yet there are three stages to this deal leading to a permanent end of the war and the Reconstruction of Gaza tap and hold your screen if you want to read all the details so who's saying what about the deal the US has said that Israel is ready to go ahead with the deal and that Hamas is the only thing standing in the way Hamas has neither accepted nor rejected the deal but says it views the offer positively and a senior official told the BBC that Hamas would go for the deal if Israel does meanwhile in Israel relatives of the hostages still being held in Gaza are putting pressure on Netanyahu to accept the deal but there's a lot of politics at play two far-right members of Israel's cabinet have threatened to pull their parties out of the ruling Coalition if Netanyahu goes for the deal so for Benjamin Netanyahu it's basically a question of political survival
