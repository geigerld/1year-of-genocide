well US President Joe Biden is said to be extremely concerned about Israel's next phase of its war in Gaza quoting two official sources the news website axio says Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that an offensive in southern Gaza could worsen the humanitarian crisis let's go to William Lawrence he's professor of international relations at the American University and a former US Diplomat he joins us now live from Washington DC so I want to ask about these ongoing negotiations we have two hours under two hours now until that ceasefire is due to expire one would expect that with the experience of two rounds of negotiations it would actually be easier to reach some sort of agreement uh or or on an expansion of of a deal yet that doesn't seem to be the case no it's the opposite for a couple of reasons one is that over already 40% of the hostages have been released by all the the best accounts uh and now we're getting into the trickier cases probably some injured hostages men IDF soldiers people not held by Hamas uh and officially the um truths already expired the the Israelis uh extended it from Midnight to 7 a.m. uh is Israel Palestine time uh because uh they didn't like the list they were given now I didn't see anything in the deal as articulated internationally uh that said the is Israel gets to start the war again because they don't like the 10 names um so I suspect there's uh incredible amounts of pressure coming from the Americans and others onto the Israelis to say take the list and uh uh some officials are saying uh there could be an extension of one two three or four days more but there's a point at which the formulas change you may remember some years ago one Israeli soldier was traded for a thousand Palestinians a soldier Israeli soldier held by Hamas and uh I think the IDF soldiers as Palestinian Representatives keep saying are worth more uh and so there's a bigger deal and a different deal that needs to be made and and what do you think that could be because I mean what do you think could be the reasons for this apparent reluctance of both Israel and Hamas to uh prolong the truce so Hamas is a bunch of conditions that they've been articulating at various times as well as have uh Palestinian officials in the West Bank but you know one of the big on since they want to save the last hostages for the end of the occupation as you know right now uh Israel is occupying about 10% of gazen territory uh and has you know duur control of the whole thing uh and we're facing the the the possibility of a bombing campaign in the South which would really anger Biden given the the way he's articulated red lines about how Israel can't continue the bombardment the way it did before uh and so you know we're at this point where even some Israelis are saying quietly or analysts and stuff uh that they should just release all of the Palestinian prisoners uh over 2,000 of which are being held without charges another 5,000 in Palestinian jails for all of the rest of the hostages I don't think that's what'll happen I think it's going to be more of this drip drip drip and hopefully with a lot of uh qari Ingenuity and American pressure um the ceasefire can extend for as long as possible as Biden said he prefers the US Secretary of State in Israel he arrived in the last few hours uh the US have made it clear they do want the ceasefire extended at least will it make it harder for Israel to resume the fighting absolutely I've never seen so much disagreement between the Americans andeles publicly and privately as with this war and it's a relationship I've been studying for decades uh and and so the pressure is on uh and yet there's this you know various types of bear hugging going on saying look Israel we're not doing this because we don't like you we're doing this because it's in your best interest to stop killing people it's in your best interest to get the hostages out etc etc uh it's in your best interest not to create a bigger more angrier Hamas by by creating a lot more moders and and death and destruction so uh the negotiations are ongoing they're very comp at I think one of the interesting wrinkles is part of the discussions already what will the after War Gaza look like because Netanyahu laid out unreachable objectives here and yet there's going to be have to kind of a sort of rejiggering of the objectives for Israel to exit at some point declare some sort of Victory and then whoever is governing in Gaza to be accepted by all parties really good to get your perspective William Lawrence professor of international relations at the American University thank you
