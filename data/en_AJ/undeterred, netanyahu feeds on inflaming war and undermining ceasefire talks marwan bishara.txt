and Maran Bashar is alzer's senior political analyst he joins us now by Skype from London and Maran I suppose there is a concern about whether uh Israel and Hezbollah will um orchestrate this sort of controlled escalation or whether or not we're at the point where that might change actually uh judging from statements on both sides they seem I hate to use the word Rel but they do seem a bit relieved that this was the end of that for the day a bit like Zena has reported in the sense that uh something was coming it came um and I think we're sort of back to business as usual or back to our as someone said back to our regular War back to our regular programming with the war on Gaza and the war on Lebanon being limited but of course the war on Gaza or the genocide continues to unravel in fact if anything uh reports from Israel uh speak of Netanyahu being relieved in a way where he doesn't really feel if this is the regionalization if this is what hisbah has in mind then he can go on and and and continue to obstruct um the ceasefire negotiations in Cairo that he is uh you know feels more uh assured that Israel can continue to procrastinate without having to pay much of a price and so does that then give him that much more confidence in terms of pursuing uh open-ended deepening occupation of Gaza I think that's what it seems to be at least this afternoon um you know we are 24 news CH 24hour News Channel right so we're talking about now post uh the uh preemptive strike and strike on Israel there's a sense that uh first of all the delegation uh the Israeli delegation in KIRO doesn't have much of a mandate it seems to actually um negotiate a serious deal or seriously negotiate the deal although there is a you know high ranking American Egyptian and certainly Kari presence now in Cairo but the Israeli delegation has not been given enough Authority by Netanyahu and it seems like they might actually come get back to Israel today tomorrow and but but according to the Israeli reports there isn't much of a breakthrough because na just is not is not allowing it he's not allowing any serious discussion why do I say serious discussion because apparently for example the Israeli delegation presented something like uh we will allow a certain number of Hamas Fighters injured ones to leave Gaza if Hamas agrees to Israeli military presence in middle of Gaza in narim and in the south of Gaza in the phel corridor something that is so ridiculous and beneath uh you know discussion by any serious mediator let alone by Hamas so I think it seems that the the what's happened the north is not really influencing much of what's happening in the south in fact it might be the opposite in the sense that Nathan feels emboldened with the support of the United States to go on with his genocide in Gaza taken all together though Maran you know we're reporting today on fears about whether the only functioning Hospital in central Gaza will be able to keep treating patients because it's it's in an area that has been issued with an evacuation order combined with the deepening repression in the west bank and then also a choreograph Telegraph kind of escalation in the North in southern Lebanon where people are also losing their lives how how sustainable is this does netan feel embold emboldened enough to continue this for the foreseeable future even if it endangers Israel's own security well you could say that again judging from today's events that what netan is trying to do is um see if Hamas will blink first so I'm not sure they're thinking too long term because clearly netan doesn't have an exit strategy from Gaza except a ceasefire there is no other exit strategy you cannot occupy Gaza indefinitely it's not going to work but certainly not without Hamas and quickly if you notice the last few days even weeks uh Israel is killing civilians but Hamas is actually killing and injuring Israeli soldiers so there's a real resistance against the Israel military presence in Gaza so the idea that Israel can just you know stay there in Gaza indefinitely is not possible that's one two I think this the slow death the the the hidden death is even worse than uh what we report in terms of you know the bombing of this residential building and and that school and so on so forth It's that death from disease and famine and and just the slow death in hospitals and in home people would don't get much of a treatment they can't get much of a treatment for whatever uh ails them I think that slow death is also very hard to report that's the thing that's really most painful to any Observer who's looking at what's happening in Gaza and can only you know empathize with the people of Gaza who continue to suffer under this genocide while the in complicity between the United States and Israel continue unabated and any attempt at derailing that from Lebanon from Iran from various parts of the Arab world trying to mediate is just not helping the people of Gaza as genocide continues to unravel okay thank you very much Al jazer senior political analyst Maran Bashar is speaking to us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
