well we can speak now to Margaret Harris she is from the World Health Organization she joins us live from Geneva many thanks for joining the program as an organization have you ever seen destruction of Health Facilities on this scale before as you've seen in Gaza good evening malen we are seeing more and more concerning uh attacks on health actually around the world we've actually seen it for instance in Sudan and Ukraine but certainly the speed the intensity the complete destruction of a health system as you said 30 out of 36 hospitals damaged very very few hospitals left in uh the strip able to provide even the most basic Services uh at a time when you've got millions of people who are desperately in need of of care because of not just their physical injuries due to bombardment but their their infection there Rising levels of infection due to overcrowding and also starvation and malnutrition 685 healthcare workers that have been killed and injured 902 those are your numbers doesn't that sound incredibly High it is it is and this is it is also shocking that since we began documenting attacks on health the numbers have become so have have ra risen so rapidly it's very very clear in international humanitarian law and this was one of the first of the agreements around the rules of war that Health Care must be neutral must be protected because Health Care is something for everyone doesn't matter whether you're fighting or not Health Care is something that all societies need it's a basic human right do you think Israel is deliberately destroying gaza's health system and infrastructure so that is really something for the analysts what we are simply seeing is that there is destruction and this is making it harder and harder for those who are simply providing trying to provide life-saving care to a large population of people not only the people who are injured but people who've got ongoing illness we're now seeing so many people who are no longer getting their cancer treatment who are no longer getting their diabetes treatment who are dying of things that they would normally be able to overcome or or who would be able to live a normal life but they no longer have access to the care that's a basic human R and it's the healthcare workers as well isn't it you've released a report today saying that health workers are dealing themselves with starvation and malnutrition which is making it incredibly hard for them to do their jobs tell us more about your findings they're desperately hungry and hungry and lacking water I me most people only have this much a day that uh and that's everybody and just imagine you are working incredibly hard incredibly physically hard running from Patient to Patient dealing with things that you've got to be mentally alert for but also physically alert for and you have very very little food now we are mounting missions as often as we are permitted uh and when we come one of the things that we're asked for first by the healthare workers is food and we do our best to bring some we're also increasingly bringing um nutritional supplements for children uh refeeding food because that is now the great need starvation is stalking every doorway in Gaza when was the last time who was able to distribute Fuel and other life-saving health supplies to Major hospitals in Northern Gaza we have regular missions and as said it is dependent on them being facilitated or agreed to we have been uh the most recent I've got details of was just a couple of days ago and we were able to get to the Pediatric Hospital prior to the hostilities around alifa we were able to get to that hospital last week and it was beginning to get off its knees beginning to provide at least basic services but I'm sadly we are now seeing because of the hostil fa ities there that that that that has been interrupted and as I said and what we're doing much more in the north now is looking at how we can set up nutritional stabilization centers for the many many children but also adults who are now at a serious stage of severe acute malnutrition we have been struggling to communicate with doctors and healthcare workers in Northern Gaza we have an ongoing situ ation at shifa hospital what is your understanding of the level of health care now available in the north it's minimal we know that there there were I mean before the hostilities around our Shea six hospitals that were doing what they could but most of them lack Fuel and whenever we go to the north we one of the things we bring is fuel so that they can get their generators going in some hospitals we have to rep the generator or bring a new generator because that's been destroyed um it's a lot of the staff The Specialist staff you need remember the injuries they're seeing are horrific Burns and blast injuries and you need to be a very experienced uh and skilled surgeon to be able to deal with that so one of the other problems is the staff themselves don't have those skills and don't have the support of the experts because they've either left or died or um they have been displaced so they do their best they're doing their best but maintaining just basic hygiene is a struggle Margaret Harris from the World Health Organization speaking to us there from Geneva thank you so much for your time thank you for having me marene
