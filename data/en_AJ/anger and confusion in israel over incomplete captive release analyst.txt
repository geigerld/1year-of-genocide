we're receiving reports that several people have been injured in southern Israel in the city of ashalon following rocket attacks video shows damage to parts of residential buildings Israeli emergency services are responding to the scene Imran Khan has more from Tel Aviv just after 3 p.m. local time loud sirens were head where I am in central Tel Aviv I counted at least eight explosions local media uh saying that 10 explosions in total took place in the South and uh east of uh Central Tel Aviv uh then there was a message from the Israelis via loudspeaker telling people to remain in their shelter also we've seen a rocket being fired from Gaza into ashalon where two people were lightly injured now where I am is actually nicknamed hostage swear it's worth showing you around uh this is effectively the headquarters of the bring them back campaign now their meeting uh with the Israeli War cabinet that's a meeting they've been asking for almost since the War Began 60 days ago um what they want from this meeting is to find out exactly what the Israeli War cabinet is doing to bring the remaining captives back home however the slogan of this campaign is not bring them back but bring them back now they want this to be done as quickly as possible and given the intense pressure uh that the Israeli War cabinet is under to fight this war from the more far right elements of the of uh the liid party which is the party of both the defense minister and the Prime Minister and the pressure that they're under from the Americans to allow humanitarian Aid in getting the captives out is although a priority not possibly a priority right this minute and that's what these uh captives families want they want these captives to be released as quickly as possible Imran Khan Al jazer Tel Aviv all right now mayor zon is a senior Israeli Analyst at the international crisis group joins us now live from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so first of all let me start with a line that's just been dropping about the Israeli government saying to families of the captives that they are unlikely to be able to release all of the captives how are families receiving this or likely to receive this kind of this kind of statement well I think the families of the hostages that are still there are absolutely up in arms about the what seems like a decision by the Israeli government uh when the truce fell apart uh to go into Gaza uh and continue its operation with full force and intensity without providing any information on how or when it will get back these hostages and as the families have said the hostages are the priority because they are the ones whose lives are at stake whereas the operation is something that can happen after they are securely brought back home so I think that there is uh extreme pressure and extreme anger amongst the families of the hostages and the Israeli public at large that the government doesn't really seem to be providing a clear plan not only on how to bring home the hostages but on how to secure a victory uh what we're seeing I mean the people who do see the images from Gaza are seeing death and destruction and we're not really seeing so much of the achievement of the military objective to bring down Hamas so I think Israelis are very upset and very confused how um does the resumption of Israeli strikes how does it impact netanyahu's position well netanyahu's position right now seems quite secure uh he has the full backing of the us to continue with this war he has a far-right government that some of them have been calling for uh reoccupying Gaza for settling Gaza now Israel claims that that's not uh its objective but uh despite the fact that most of the Israeli public is not happy with Netanyahu and doesn't trust him even before October 7th there doesn't seem to be any kind of way to get him out of office and so for now he's in office and people are still in trauma and in shock and and were at War and so the situation is that the longer that this uh operation continues it seems like he'll be able to continue to remain in his seat at the same time if Israel isn't able to provide um achievements in this operation I think Israelis will will lose uh more and more of their patience and there's also hundreds of thousands of reservists uh who are you know currently in the Army they're in the North or in the South uh the economy is being hurt so there is even an internal time limit I think to this and and there are more and more calls for Netanyahu to step down this is something that was going on a lot all of the last all of this last year um I think that will gain momentum but for the time being netanyahu's position is is quite strong and there is consensus in Israel that he that it's it's the right objective that it we need to topple Hamas so in that sense um he's in a pretty secure place we know that Israel withdrew its negotiating teams from qat do you think negotiations are going to have to resume at some point or how do you read the the mind set right now amongst Israeli decision makers do they just plan to go ahead and continue this bombing campaign endlessly well I think uh the reason for bringing back the uh negotiating team and whether or not some form of negotiation is still going on you know it's hard to tell it's hard to know exactly what's happening I assume that the actors Qatar Egypt the US and to an extent Israel as well is is and Hamas are they're interested in negotiating forther releases but uh Israel is very very adamant about uh a ground operation to um to get to Hamas uh senior officials I think they are very clearly interested in trying to take out senoir and they are determined to do that and they they don't think that anything less uh than toppling Hamas both militarily and as far as its governing capabilities will bring them security that's their line now I don't I don't necessarily think that that's an effective approach but that's the approach that they've chosen so it seems like they will continue to do this until uh the US uh steps up its pressure which does not currently seem likely to make them stop or the in general the humanitarian disaster which we're seeing unfold in Gaza starts to create more and more pressure um but so far that doesn't seem to be the case and if Israel is able to both allow and ramp up humanitarian Aid into the strip it seems like that will be enough uh for the US to stand down on that point we've heard from people like 35 un experts on October this 16th referred to a genocide in the making as to what Israel's military operation was doing how much awareness of the Carnage is there amongst Israeli public opinion how much focus is on that there really isn't that much focus on that because Israelis are completely focused inwards uh they're focused everybody has somebody that was either taken captive or a victim of the October 7th attack and as it is as I'm sure your audience knows uh the Palestinian issue was sidelined and has been sidelined for for decades really in Israeli Society uh Israel has not had to pay a price for its policies of occupation and segregation uh and what some human rights organizations of course call apartheid so these are not the issues that consume Israelis but of course the October 7th attack changed that so now Israelis are forced to deal with the Palestinian issue on some level but they're not dealing with it by you know by seeing images of what's happening in Gaza that's not that's not what's happening in Israeli mainstream media what we're seeing is just that Hamas is a terrorist organization that it's evil um and that it needs to be wiped out um that's what Israelis understand and and they are legitimately uh you know their security was shattered the government itself failed to secure and protect Israelis on October 7th so um Israelis are really just focused inward but I think what they're going to have to understand at some point is that it's not just about trying to Decap you know to incapacitate Hamas it's also about changing an Israeli government and making it so that Israel Israel and its leadership can actually provide stability and security something that we still don't see after 60 days in Gaza thanks so much mov on sign
