now joined here in our Doha Studio by veteran Palestinian activist and politician and former member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee Hannan asrawi Dr ashrawi really great to have you with us here in thank you it's good to be with you H given what we're seeing now already on the ground and Rafa let me start by asking you what your greatest fears are in the coming days and weeks well it's not that I'm worried about a a disaster a human catastrophe and so on because it's happening yeah it's already happened we are in the midst of a genocide and Israel is H bent on taking it a notch up uh in the sense that it once having treated the Palestinians with total dehumanization like herds of cattle where they shift them from one place to the other carrying out demographic engineering thinning out the population as Netanyahu says they forced them into the South they they shelled them and bombed them and sniped them on the way and now they're saying no now you have to move somewhere else because we're going to destroy the last Refuge that you had so everybody of course is worried and everybody knows that there are no limits to Israeli depravity to Israeli blood thirst to the use of of massacres and Carnage and so on to achieve we don't know what ends because they don't know what ends they cannot destroy Hamas and they cannot achieve absolute Victory as he says so in a sense that is a will full infliction of pain death and destruction without any accountability and uh buying time and and uh using all sorts of procrastinations and uh diversionary tactics to say they are engaged in talks and their primary objective is to release the hostages where their primary objective is to destroy uh not just the Palestinians of Gaza but all of Palestine you talked about moving people yes from place to place and now wanting to move move them somewhere else Egypt has said that a red line for them would be the forced Mass displacement of Palestinian refugees over that border yeah How likely is that regardless it is likely because they have been carrying out forc displacement they've been carrying out and the uh um International court of justice indicated that there are certainly uh genocidal acts being committed but at the same time this is rather disingenuous because you have totally closed them in uh with nowhere to go now they are in ra which was told they were told safe area yeah 1.4 million tightly if you throw a stone you will hit 10 people there so the tightly closed in with nowhere to go and they are selling them and they're using sniper fire to kill them and you've seen footage of children of women with their own babies being shot in Cold Blood being sniped so they sniped s they killed they shot a doctor in the middle of an operation they're doing these things to a helpless captive population saying they are looking for captives or they are looking for Hamas leaders so what is disingenuous is that they have nowhere to go and they are going to be shot at and so on and then they say uh they cannot be hered out or or the Egypt doesn't want them to go to Egypt we don't want them to leave they don't want to leave but in order for them to stay stop the Carnage nobody addresses the real issue which is Israel's genocidal policies Israel's massacres Israel's Carnage Israel's impunity and of course the the blatant support by the US and the West in order to give it more room more space more blessings to continue with this want vicious destruction so don't tell me you don't go anywhere stop killing them first stop the massacres well let me ask you then about the possibility of the ceas fire we just heard Charles there talk about how Israel is going going to Cairo with no idea of a potential ceasefire on the table but obviously that's what Hamas has been offering well and calling for yeah this is a deal primarily at the beginning of it to release captives given that that might result in at least pauses in the fighting How likely is that that that change in momentum to lead to a lasting ceasefire if a deal is indeed made I doubt first of all I doubt whether a deal will be made first first of all the Americans don't want one they gave Israel time and space to do it right they said provided you take you know you can do this but you take measures to protect innocent lives well have they protected have they taken measures have they listened no so in a sense they gave them a green light to continue number one number two the focus is always on releasing the hostages or the captives or whatever without totally decontextualized without looking at the real issues that real issues is that there is a genocide taking place we as Palestinians have over 10,000 11,000 captives in Israel we have 3 4,000 uh uh administrative detes without trial without charges and so on and every day they keep arresting them Israel wants to focus and the us only on releasing captives what about a whole Palestinian population held captive what about thousands and thousands of Palestinians detained and held captive than Israeli jails well then how how do you change the narrative we've spoken a lot about the United States right now yeah and I've been wondering as we've seen the Palestinian Authority president mud Abbas he he's been in in Doha in recent days as well there's been a lot of speculation around a potential broker reconciliation between Hamas and fata do you think that that some kind of unified Palestinian front would that give Palestinians more agency here and an ability to change a narrative absolutely it's not just to change the narrative but it should enable the Palestinians empower the Palestinians to take a unified stance now one of the strategies of Israel and the US is to isolate Hamas totally demonize Hamas as you know and to label everybody as a terrorist Hamas and all the Palestinians and therefore give themselves a free hand to carry out this Carnage and death and destruction but the moment we repair internally our own political system the moment we have a democratic inclusive uh healthy political system the more empowered we are not just to withstand Israeli onslaughts and and efforts but also in order to repair our decisionmaking process in order to gain legitimacy and support also by the public you speak there about a democratic and inclusive functioning government absolutely when you yourself resigned from the PLO in in 2020 I believe it was you were very critical of how it was being run at the time right what's your assessment of the state of the PLO now unfortunately the trajectory has continued which is the the weakening of the PLO entirely taking over decision making by not even the PA but the presidency and a few people around him and the PLO has been sidelined undermined and and uh in a sense it weakened the uh body politic it weakened the representational body of all pal Ians everywhere not just in the West Bank Jerusalem and Gaza but also in throughout the world because this is as yat used to this is the national home of all the Palestinians this is the inclusive representative body and it is in bad need of repair and reform and revitalization not all Americans but the way the Palestinians when I resigned I said very openly first of all we have to make room for the young people for women we have to uh have a genuinely Democratic representative body and at the same time the total immobilization and disregard and sidelining of the PLO has to stop because the the PA is representative only of part of the people on part of the land and is an outcome of a signed agreement which is essentially flawed the PLO is a national body and it needs serious repair and and reform and restructuring and there has been a lot of discussion about what that reform might look like Before I Let You Go Dr asrawi yeah I do want to ask you about one specific thing you were very very critical of Abu Dhabi when they normalized ties with Israel yeah there's been a lot of talk about normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia yeah the US seems to be wanting to use that as some kind of a carrot here to try to to end the conflict would you be against that now if if it actually brought an end to the offensive in Gaza it won't bring an end to an offensive because when the US it was during the days of trump brought several Arab countries not just the the Emirates and others to normalize with Israel they told us this is only in order to stop the annexation but they were increasing the annexation and they continued don't do us favors like that please so they normalized the occupation they undermined the Arab peace initiative they created fragmentations within the Arab body body politics both vertical and horizontal the people and their leadership the Arab people don't like normalization but let me say this the Americans the Americans This is a lynchpin of their policy in the region uh normalization why they want to integrate as they say Israel in the region they want to reposition it as a major political economic military security intelligence power in order to run the show it is not just the Palestinians of course there's sidelining the Palestinians and they're giving Israel a fre hand to destroy it the way you're seeing it but they are re re warding Israel because American policy from Trump and on is just to be able to reposition Israel in such a prominent place in the region to redefine enemies and friends only Iran is your enemy Israel is your ally and so on and to weaken the Palestinian cause and the whole Arab system and structure in the region this is extremely dangerous Dr Hanan asrawi veteran politician and Palestinian activist thank you so much for joining us here in thank you Anastasia it's a good to be with you
