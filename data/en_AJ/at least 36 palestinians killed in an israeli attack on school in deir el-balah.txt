children used to study here this school for girls in derl Bella became a makeshift field hospital and a shelter during the war Israeli military aircraft bummed it twice killing dozens of people this man narly scaped destruction is everywhere me my father and my daughters were outside for treatment but we had just been right here in this room God bestowed his Mercy on us thank God my family is okay others were not as lucky derella is one of the most densely populated areas in Gaza crammed with despl Palestinians ambulances took the wed to the city's Al AA Hospital Israel says its attack targeted Hamas command and control center but doctors say most of the victims are civilians in fact most of the injured are children and women who are in very serious and critical condition many of these injured women and children came with amputated limbs Israeli troops have destroyed more than 300 schools and universities since October the 7th even those used as shelters by families with nowhere else to go everyone in the hospital is suffering from critical injuries that are receiving a treatment on the floor there is a very clear surge of air strikes and evacuation censors on these areas that must be at least considered and classified to be humanitarian safe zones alaz paltin William Schamberg is head of the international Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza he joins us from Gaza City Welcome to the program can you firstly describe to us the reality of the healthcare catastrophe that you've witnessed in Gaza good morning and thank you very much for having me on the show um it's difficult to find the words to accurately describe the scenes that you see in Gaza City and in the north the healthc care sector has been particularly impacted uh by the hostilities which have devastated uh hospitals and Healthcare facilities uh we were able to visit Three uh different hospitals uh in the past days and we saw there that there are very few functional facilities left within Gaza that there were patients dealing with uh horrific wounds and injuries as a result of the hostilities the elderly uh many children with amputations in very difficult conditions and at the same time hospitals themselves are overstretched healthcare workers after months of of conflict are exhausted and all the facilities are running alarmingly low on supplies and in addition to all of that what can you say about the spread of disease in such dire conditions I mean just driving through the streets uh particularly of uh the north of the Gaza Strip the level of Devastation and destruction is immense uh whole neighborhoods have been reduced to Rubble areas that used to provide people with homes and schools are now devoid of life and there's clear problems when it comes to access to food and sanitation including clean drinking water all of these conditions are of course not conducive to uh healthy living and indeed uh risk just compounding already very serious public health issues uh that people are starting to face when we spoke with doctors uh and indeed with civilians they were mentioning an increased prevalence particularly in diarrhea in Hepatitis A and of course we learned recently that uh polio had been found in samples of uh of water within the sewage system within Gaza which is yet another uh risk factor that really could just push the healthcare system over the edge what are you then as head of the in Gaza calling for right now civilians must be able to safely Access healthcare healthcare workers must be able to do their job the medical supplies that are required to enable these facilities to function must be able uh to enter freely and uh humanitarians should be able to have unimpeded access in order to ensure that civilians who so desperately require the support that they need are able to access it with our help even if there were sufficient humanitarian supplies I mean how challenging is it to get these supplies to people in need with such a smash infrastructure of course uh there are huge logistical issues uh there are big challenges when it comes to of the prevailing insecurity which uh complicates the capacity for humanitarian actors and and all individuals to be able to move safely given the conditions um more than anything else what civilians lack today is protection and and here it is the responsibilities the parties of the conflict under International humanitarian law to ensure that civilians are protected as our hospitals healthcare workers and humanitarians so that we can meet the acute and growing needs this is of course horrendously distressing I mean how do you feel just as a human being to witness such scenes the situation is heartbreaking and it's gone on for too long to see uh the levels of Destruction and Desperation uh to know that it is going to be extremely difficult for communities to rebuild their shattered lives and that despite all of this people continue however under the most difficult of circumstances is on a human level of course extremely distressing but all the more reason why we must do everything that we can to limit the humanitarian consequences of this horrendous conflict
