we're learning some more information about the contents of this deal here it is that the ceasefire proposal includes three phases each of them lasting 42 days so about six weeks the first phase of the deal includes providing passage for displaced Palestinians to return to their homes the second phase of the deal includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops and cessation of military operations in the third stage of the deal there's also a provision on ending the blockade on the Gaza Strip which has been in place for 17 years Al jazir is political analyst Marwan Bashar joins us in the studio Marwan we we're in the middle of something that we can't Define yet because we have one side to this agreement that has accepted it the other side hasn't well I'll tell you something uh certainly we've been here for the first time over the past seven months and clearly hamas's positive response to the mediators proposal for a ceasefire has shocked and has took Everyone by surprise especially those in Israel but perhaps also in the United States and that's why they are climing now to understand what exactly is the response how positive is it and what does it really mean uh towards moving forward will there be then a pickup negotiations if you will over the agreement of the agreement in Cairo and then when you start the phases and so on so forth but clearly it's a huge positive step in the in the right direction towards a ceasefire that there is no doubt about and I think from my understanding probably in paragraph five that's where you find the key to the change of heart or mind right I'm talking about technicality now they talk about sustained quiet it's a euphemism for a permanent ceasefire so Israel does not want to hear the word ceasefire because clearly nanyu cannot sell it to his cabinet Hamas apparently because of the various pressures and mediations accepted finally to sustained quiet as the alternative to a permanent ceasefire this is I want your thoughts on this I'm listening keenly you say sustained quiet and the words that they're having to choose so that they could they might get agreement on both sides two sides that don't really want the same thing because one wants to end the war the other one as far as we can tell from their public pronouncements wants to continue the war and that's Israel um with these major diplomatic deals often in my career reporting on deals like this one they're all different but that's kind of how you get to a deal is you fudge the language a little bit not not fudged but you have a gray area where both sides can kind of understand what they want and then that's why so often implementing the deal becomes complicated because they each have their own interpretation of it you you're well you're right 100% about that but as in every negotiations it's the mediator that steps in and presumably gives it gives their understanding of what those phrases mean and that's why what was a bit revealing is what you and I spoke about yesterday if you remember yesterday I said it's it's incredibly paradoxical it's surprising shocking almost the fact that it's Hamas and the United States that want a ceasefire and that it's the nany government that does not want a ceasefire the United States have provided all the guarantees it could provide apparently and that's why uh director burns the director of the CIA stayed overnight and then stayed again extended his uh stay in Doha in order apparently to arrive at these understandings between the United States and the mediators or Hamas about the phrases or the phraseology if you will about moving forward now what's important in this is is there a will on the part of the United States to make sure that the parties respect whatever they reach to and that they arrive at the Spirit and the letter of the agreement I think that's what's important now what happened over the past two weeks that you and I and others have spoken about what happened over the past two weeks it has become clear that the continuation of this war means the end of the Biden presidency stopping this war means the end of netanyahu's Premiership that's where we're at Biden has every incentive to reach a ceasefire because things are starting to boil up in his domestic scene in an election year so now I'm going to go out Lim and analytically from a historical perspective tell you that what happened at the universities in the United States was a major factor a major factor for where why we are there here now in the sense of putting huge psychological pressure and some political pressure on the Biden Administration to move more willfully more determinately on the question of trying to get the both parties together on the question of Hamas there was the election is in six months I'm not interrupting I'm just adding this the election the US election is in six months almost to the day absolutely now there was also pressure on Hamas and we have to be clearheaded about that yesterday Lloyd today I'm not sure Lloyd Austin the US Secretary of Defense was basically basically justifying Israel's horrific land invasion of r if it takes place by saying Hamas left Israel no option but to invade RAF that's a I don't want to say criminal I don't want to I don't want to use any vocabulary that's you know above and beyond but that was definitely uh unconventional declaration from an American Secretary of Defense to basically justify an Israel Invasion that is to the uh disliking of the Biden Administration itself they just said they can't support this absolutely so the fact that Lloyd that Lloyd Austin would say Hamas has given Israel no other option but to invade Rafa that's a that's a that's a that's a terrible anyway be there as it may I think the pressure on Hamas has been huge over the past 72 hours that Netanyahu made it clear that if nothing's going to happen soon on the captives that he was going to invade Galant said today nothing is happening on the captives we are going in right I'm I'm trying to describe an atmosphere or a dynamic where we find where why why we're finding ourselves today in the sense of the par is arriving at terminology that is perhaps acceptable to the United States and Hamas and maybe tomorrow to Israel because Israel was going to find itself the odd man out if it does not agree to this because you're going to hear in the next several hours take my word for it European leaders American leaders Middle Eastern leaders all of them comeing out and say yes to this mediator's proposal for a ceasefire and it's going to be Israel it's going to be the AL man out and we'll see what that happens then following your earlier train of thought on Galant and Israeli officials saying we're we're moving into Rafa we have no choice but to do it because Hamas is left with no choice right this has been their messaging uh and then this morning Israeli military ordered more than 100, Palestinians to leave parts of Rafa I've been wondering is that the ultimate bargaining tool for them to say we're serious look we're moving in we're starting with this little slice of Rafa 100,000 people there are one and a half million people you know 1.4 million to go if you don't stop a nownow you know I've been saying for the past 15 years on Al jazer as we go from one NE one diplomatic debuck to another uh over different fronts of whether it's Iran and Egypt Syria turkey and so on so forth in the end of the day negotiations SL diplomacy are a reflection of the balance of power or the imbalance they are not the production they are not the the the end product of some clever people trying to reach some clever terminology that comes later in the end of the day there is a balance of power Hamas has proven that it's unbe beatable you can destroy Gaza apparently you can't destroy Hamas one two Israel has proven that it can destroy Gaza and it can continue to destroy whatever it wants to destroy and no one is going to stop it the United States has proven that there is no third party capable as the United States to do something if it's actually willing to do something whether towards war or towards peace in this part of the world that it in the end of the day it does have leverage with the Troublemaker in as far as I'm concerned analytically speaking which is Israel the powerful country which is Israel so we have arrived after 7 months of destruction of Gaza without being able to achieve the ultimate objectives of the netan government of October 8 October 9 right and the United States in an election year has having an Administration in a bind whereby you have President Biden who basically sitting on a successful economy basically uccessful foreign policy is down in the pools against a man who has about zillion trials happening at the same time right for everything from I don't know whatever you I'm not going to go into the prostitution bits whatever it is right so Biden understands that the war in Gaza has hurt him a lot he thought he can somehow uh what's the word in English he can get you know um can escape the storm right you can wither the storm right but apparently not something happened in the psyche of the American public because of what happened on the campuses of several hundred American universities the virus of Revolt started spreading even to European universities the young people the Z generation has revolted in a way that is so moral so ethical so clear about its call for justice that I think Biden feels the need to push further towards a ceasefire that what changed over the past couple of weeks Marwan we will be coming back to you very regularly throughout the course of the evening Maran bishar aljaz senior political editor thank you very much make sure
