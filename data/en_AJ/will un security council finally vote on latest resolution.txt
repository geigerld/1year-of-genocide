the United Nations Security Council is convening to vote on a draft resolution calling for the scaling up of humanitarian Aid deliveries in the besieged Gaza Strip the proposal by the United Arab Emirates is also calling for an urgent and sustained end of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza now this vote has been delayed multiple times after requests by the United States the US Deputy ambassador to the United Nations says that they will only support the draft resolution if specific changes are made morning still working it still hoping to get to uh you know to be able to support it so we're not there are you looking for changes in the text well there need to be some things in the text that would make it worthy of our support right now we're still working it so Gabriel alzando joins us from the United Nations Headquarters Gabriel help us wrap our heads around this is this primarily a draft resolution about stopping the fighting whatever the language might be around that whether it's a ceasefire I I think think it won't be or pause in fighting or humanitarian pause is it about stopping the fighting or is it about mostly increasing the level of Aid that goes to Gaza the second part of that this is a resolution that was uh basically supported and drafted by the United Arab Emirates with the support of other member states but uh it is a resolution that solely really focuses on humanitarian Aid it's not a political uh resolution at all uh the UAE Ambassador has been repeating that over and over and over again that this is about scaling up Aid into Gaza quickly and immediately and distributing it quickly and immediately to those that need it now there whole part about ceasefire there's no ceasefire in this resolution but in order to do this it's got to be safe for on the ground there and that is why they initially called for a cessation of hostilities the US said we won't go for that so they changed to suspension of hostilities because you cannot have bombardment and also try to get the massive amounts of Aid out so but this is about humanitarian efforts and that's why uh the us if it's a big if of course vetos this like they have in two other Security Council resolution since October 7th it would look quite bad on the United States quite frankly and so uh but specifically answer your question this is a humanitarian resolution that is being considered so what is the US supposed to in the language if it's all humanitarian and the US has been calling for increasing humanitarian Aid they said you know as as all the way to the top uh Joe Biden has said that there needs to be more humanitarian Aid going into Gaza so what could the US be opposed to in this text who is organizing it is a simple answer right now all the aid going in is wholly or mostly controlled by Israel and so Aid organizations have insinuated that Israel could be slowing that Aid down and they're deciding how many trucks get in how quickly they inspect trucks to get in what gets in this resolution says no no no more of that this resolution says if passed uh it would be the United Nations that would be in charge of or a United Nations appointed uh body or persons in charge of getting that Aid in and the United Nations would probably do it a lot faster and at a lot bigger capacity than what Israel is doing it that's what uh people that support this resolution believe right and so that is what Israel is opposed to they would essentially lose power on how they can slow down or speed up Aid into Gaza it would be up to the United Nations and that is what Israel we think is opposed to and that is what we think the United States is is trying to change the language on how and who specifically uh monitors the aid coming in and who gets it into the country and decides how much and how quickly it gets into Gaza that is a simple answer to that question Gabriel just before I let you go it's 122 p.m. where you are it's 18:22 GMT any word on timing when we might see if we will see a vote on this today at the UN Security Council well I can tell you it was supposed to be about 2 and a half hours ago that's what we thought but and it was supposed to be on Wednesday then it was Tuesday then I'm sorry Monday Tuesday Wednesday now we're at Thursday short answer is we don't know we're hearing that they're going to go back into Clos consultations in about an hour and a half from now perhaps talking about Gaza will they come out of those negotiations with a deal that they can vote on will they have a new draft resolution simple answer is we don't know we're standing by but the things are changing literally by the minute all right thanks for that it was a little hard to follow but we get it now thank you very much Gabriel Alando reporting from the the UN headquarters in New York big question mark there about whether or not we'll see a vote today at the UN Security Council on this draft resolution thank you Gabe
