un Aid Chief Martin Griffith has said there are positive developments in talks to open the kamam shalom shalom border crossing in Israel to increase humanitarian Aid into Gaza bues once again expressed grave concern about the ongoing attacks in Gaza highlighting the lack of meaningful Aid distribution we do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name name anymore that the pace of the military assault in southern Gaza is a repeat of the assault in Northern Gaza that it has made no place safe for civilians in southern Gaza which had been a Cornerstone of the humanitarian plan to protect civilians and thus to provide Aid to them but without places of safety that plan is in tatters and so what we have at the moment in Gaza Northern Gaza even more difficult but in Gaza where we have trucks still crossing daily through the Rafa Crossing is at best humanitarian opportunism to try to reach through some roads which are still accessible which haven't been mined or destroyed to some people who can be found where some food or some water or some other Supply can be given but it's a program of opportunism it's erratic it's undependable and frankly it's not sustainable all right let's go to Kristen salumi there she joins us live from the United Nations Headquarters despite the hope for resumption of Aid which we heard uh from Martin Griffith there through Karam Shalom that the ba basic question is though to what extent will the US position formulate when it comes to those diplomatic moves going on where you are Christen to try and and get a more meaningful ceasefire in place well I should point out that the world food program today is saying that uh 87 to 93% of families in Gaza now don't have enough food to eat on a daily basis that's their latest estimate uh and given that and given the precarious situation that Martin griffit just described for Aid getting into the area and actually getting to the people who need it uh and the safety of Aid workers there with all of that as the backdrop drop that is what prompted the UN Secretary General to again raise the issue of a humanitarian ceasefire and invoke the strongest tool he has in his toolbox to put it on the agenda of the security Council but the security Council uh while it has been discussing a humanitarian ceasefire resolution still seems unable to act uh the United States uh has been opposed to council taking further action there I asked the US Deputy Ambassador earlier today if that position had changed and this is what he said our position hasn't changed uh we again think that the best thing to try that we can do all of us uh for the situation on the ground is to let the quiet behind the scenes diplomacy that's ongoing continue and that's we think the best hope for trying to improve the situation on the ground uh with regard to humanitarian uh relief for getting hostages out and for trying to move you know forward on some toward some kind of process the Security Council is scheduled to meet on Friday uh however absent a resolution from the council the best hope at the United Nations now for getting more Aid in is the opening of a second border crossing at Kem Shalom and uh there has been positive developments on that front according to Martin griffi the UN relief Chief uh however the situation he said minus a ceasefire will remain very precarious for workers and for the civilians they're trying to help all right thanks so much Christen salumi
