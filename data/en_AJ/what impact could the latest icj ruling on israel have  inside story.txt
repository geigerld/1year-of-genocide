the un's top court rules Israel's decades long occupation of Palestinian territories is unlawful the international court of justice says it must end as rapidly as possible but what's the impact of this non-binding ruling and will it change anything on the ground this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm Muhammad Jim illegal Israeli settlements have been steadily expanding in Palestinian territories for years now the un's top Court says it's time for Israel to stop reverse course and repair the damages the international court of justice has ruled Israel's occupation is unlawful and is fueling a surge in violence however the Court's findings are not legally binding and the Israel government has ignored previous decisions so will the icj's advisory opinion have any practical implications will it increase pressure on Israel's allies we'll explore these issues with our guests in a moment but first this report by kacha Lopez hodan please be seated the un's top court has called on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territories as rapidly as possible it says Israel's policies violate international law and amount to annexation Israel has an obligation to put an end to those unlawful acts Israel also has an obligation to repeal all legislation and measures that create or maintain this unlawful situation most Israeli settlements are in the occupied West Bank the international court of justice says Israel should stop construction immediately and remove settlers from Palestinian land it also urges Israel to pay restitution to Pal alians all states must now fulfill their clear obligations no Aid no collusion no money no weapons no trade nothing with Israel but the Court's opinion is not binding and the Israeli government has ignored previous rulings in a statement posted on social media prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Jewish people cannot be occupiers in their own land many of the the ministers especially from the extreme very extreme right H believe that Israel can live without the world and that anything which is said about us about conquering about occupying and whatever is biased despite International criticism Israel has for years seiz more land to expand its illegal settlements an estimated 780,000 is Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank and their Palestinian neighbors live under military rules and regulations that limit their freedoms the initial requests asking the court to review Israel's actions in the occupied territories was submitted by the 's general assembly in 2022 well before the war on Gaza but the findings are now raising questions about Israel's 9month Onslaught on the Strip despite the ongoing attacks Israel's strongest allies the US says the ceasefire deal with Hamas is making progress I believe we're inside the 10 yard line and driving toward the goal line and getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire get the hostages home it's not the first time a court has condemned Israel's policies in the occupied territories now Palestinians are wondering if the Court's opinion will carry any weight on the ground Kia Lopez Alan Al jazer for ins story all right let's go ahead and bring in our guests wasam Ahmed is the head of the Center for Applied international law at alhak a Palestinian rights organization he joins us from rala in the occupied West Bank in the heag Adams is the legal council for the state of Palestine and author of the book The United Nations and the question of Palestine and in London is Yosi meckelberg an associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at chadam house warm welcome to you all and thanks so much for joining us today on Inside Story with Sam let me start with you today Palestinian officials have hailed this icj ruling as a watershed moment from your perspective do you agree how historic is this yeah we definitely agree that this is a significant milestone in the history of the Palestinian struggle and specifically through the use of international law as a tool for the realization of the right to self-determination for the Palestinian people um the international institutions that have developed uh since World War II have uh um unfortunately been slow uh to address the um the modern day colonization that is taking place in the Palestinian context but I think uh this recent decision uh puts in full view uh with strong authoritative uh uh legal content that uh Israel's practices within uh occupied Palestinian territory um whether they said it or not reflect a continuation of colonization that needs to be brought to an end wasam despite all that this advisory opinion is a non-binding ruling so in light of that will it have an impact on the ground and if so when might it start having an impact on the ground well the impact on the ground is very much dependent on uh third states and their willingness to take heed of this advisory opinion and uh and put the recommendations uh brought forward uh to action and this requires concrete steps to be taken uh by Third states by International organizations to challenge Israel's cost benefit calculus of this colonial project I mean historically colonial projects uh have continued until that cost benefit analysis changes and right now unfortunately Israel continues to enjoy the impunity that comes with its uh its unwavering support from its allies and that uh requires a change within the international communities dealing with Israel and changing that cost benefit calculus Ary uh we know that this isn't the first time that a court or International body has condemned territories from your Vantage Point how significant is this ruling from the icj and are you in any way surprised by it um it's a seismic event uh when one looks at the history of the icj when one looks at the history of international law and the question of Palestine it is seismic it offers the potential for great change if followup requisite followup is undertaken why well as you uh said in your leadup and as we Sam has reaffirmed the principal judicial organ of the United Nations has issued uh an authoritative legal opinion uh on Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory which it has deemed now to be and determined now to be illegal unlawful now the United Nations has over many decades indicated that many of Israel's actions in the occupied Palestinian territory have been illegal they have documented that chapter and verse but what they haven't done until today or until yesterday was determine the legality of the regime itself that gives rise to these other illegal actions and that means that everything the Israelis do in the occupied Palestinian territory because they're there unlawfully is Tainted with illegality this has a run-on effect with not only Israel's legal obligations under international law they're obliged to to end the occupation as rapidly as possible and Bas Ono's case that meant six months now in this case the modalities of when the occupation needs to be ended will be left to the general assembly uh but we surmise that that will be listed as 6 months because that will be the starting point um in addition there are obligations of Israel to make reparation not only pecuniary but also material return of refugees return of property return of cultural property that has been stolen you can imagine the extent of of the damages over 60 years almost of Israeli foreign military occupation colonization and annexation of Palestinian territory that that would entail um in addition there are third state obligations now that are triggered all states on earth have obligations first not to recognize Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory nor most importantly to not Aid or assist in the maintenance of that illegal act action and then finally the court has deted that Israel's uh presence in the territory is accompanied by a regime of racial discrimination racial segregation and apartheid those terms racial segregation and apart tide that must be brought to an end forth with by the International Community one thing I'd like to mention as well Muhammad you'd mentioned at the at the leadup that this is a non-binding opinion I beg to differ while technically advisory opinions are on their face non-binding to the extent that the principal judicial organ of the United Nations being the CJ makes a determination authoritative determination on how to interpret relevant International legal principles which are themselves already binding because they form part of customary international law those aspects of the ruling are binding and I can tell you hand on heart that every key finding of the of the international court of justice including those which I've set out now are binding on Israel and not just on Israel on the whole of the International Community you'll see in the aftermath of of the decision we heard Israeli Prime Minister MIM Netanyahu and other members of his government condemn this decision that of course is not a surprise that they've taken that stance but from your Vantage Point do you believe that any members of the government are taking a different stance privately is there any pocket of concern amongst Israeli government officials about how much pressure this might eventually put on Israel yeah it depends who you talk to in this government because again it's not it's not a completely monolithic government I think despite the strong response from prime minister Netanyahu or or foreign minister Israel cats they understand the severity as was so well described earlier of of of this decision yeah whether it's binding or not it depends how count actually and organization businesses are going to react to this and yes there are flows in in in the ability to enforce enforce such such decision but people like netan and some others understand the severity of of of this and what what imply I think here in the UK with a new government which the Prime Minister the Prime Minister here is is is a is a lawyer human rights lawyer I expect that he would take it very seriously I think the the secretary foreign secretary David Lamy visited and he talks about the the the need to end the occupation on the other hand you have elements with within the Israeli government definitely the very far right they will all argue that whatever the International Community is doing they're doing because they they they hate Israel they are anti-sites so one should not listen to to such such decision that's that's what brought all of this and settler violence for instance to to begin with there is no recognition as such they don't recognize many of those from the far right don't recognize the Israeli law let alone they don't recognize the international law but it's exactly that's is for the International Community to make discount it's not they will continue do what they have done for so many years that end with 160 settlements 700,000 settlers and the situation that the Discrimination the violence that we see the confiscation land would see every day wasam is there going to be pressure now on Palestinian leadership to try and utilize this ruling in a way that makes a difference for Palestinians what are the expectations going to be from Palestinians on the ground there well again I think the advisory opinion gives us another tool in the toolkit um in use for advocacy efforts by Civil Society um I think definitely the the Palestinian leadership can leverage this opinion to enhance diplomatic engagements um I mean it it provides a strong Legal Foundation uh to uh to make the case uh uh within the UN and various other International fors um and it is incumbent upon uh all Palestinians and all those uh struggling for the rights of the Palestinian people to make use of this decision and turn it into tangible action we've seen what happened with the previous advisory opinion issued uh 20 years ago uh that it had an impact in movement through Civil Society action uh but was not uh utilized uh to the greatest extent possible and I think we have to learn uh from the lessons of the past that simply having an advisory opinion having even any judicial ruling alone will not be enough it has to be converted into Tang action and this will only come through concrete pressure that is being exerted through civil society that will lead to a shift in the political will of those countries that are continuing to support Israel blindly odly I saw you reacting to what was Sam was saying so I'm going to give you a chance to jump in but I also want to ask you about another issue you know in the past few months we've seen the US the UK we've seen European sanctions being imposed on Israeli settlers and settler groups that support them does this ruling from the icj mean that we might see some of these governments applying sanctions uh to settlers that they might start applying sanctions to members of the Israeli government uh it's it's certainly possible and in fact it's it would be if you like required so up until now these states who've imposed limited sanctions on individual settlers those are sort of uh hiding behind fig Leaf really the settlements as are actions taken by the occupying power to acquire territory through the use of force they they butress if you like Israel's aggression Israel's annexation and the illegal occupation that it has had in the in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 so what that calls on is the duty of third States including these states that you'd mentioned to not recognize any action that Israel takes in the territory to maintain the illegal situation being their presence in the territory what is this mean for settlements not merely the imposition of sanctions on individual settlers one or two here or there but to ensure that trade relations with these states that are bilateral between Israel and them that uh extradition agreements that they have with Israel if they exist that that in their bilateral relations with Israel that they differentiate between Israel proper and the occupied Palestinian territory which is not Israel and this this will require far more action far more robust action domestically by these states um uh if they are to abide by their obligations under uh the The Advisory opinion and I have every confidence that this is going to serve as a tool if you like the opinion uh to change policy bilateral policy of third States in their relations with Israel uh touches on the status of Jerusalem touches on the status of the occupied Palestinian territory and and other relations that they have cultural relations economic relations and so on y see uh let me get your take on this um do you think we're going to start seeing sanctions being applied to Israeli ministers or institutions supporting the settlement Enterprise and and do you think that allies of Israel could find themselves at risk of perhaps future prosecution if they support Enterprises that are linked to Illegal settlements it's a definitely a possibility there is an accumulation of events here it's not only this although this this case started before the war in in in Gaza considering what is happened in the last nine months it's add today there is an accumulative criticism of the way Israel treats the Palestinians let let's remind ourselves that this opinion or the advisory opinion is not only about what's happening in the in in the West Bank but also in Gaza before the war and and and in this sense that Gaza was occupied even before the war and the fact that Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but control the borders the air space the the the sea borders mounted to to occupation so this is kind of an ongoing and I think again not much surprised Us in in in what we heard yesterday but it put it in in a legal language which every country would have to take very seriously especially countries that fashion themselves in supporting human rights and and and want to advance a a international law and this is this is a test for every country how to go about it it's different at the end of the day we will have to look also the political side no one expect all the settlements to to be removed and definitely not immediately but it should push Israel and its allies to rethink and how they go about when the is far in Gaza when we look at the day after also the future of the conflict in which everyone has the same right as the occupation comes to an end the right of Palestinians for self determination the the reparation and the rest of ity um you spoke earlier if yeah well go ahead I was gonna I was gonna get you with a followup but go ahead go ahead yeah um just with respect to what Yosi just mentioned he might he might have said this in passing that he said no one expect expects that the settlers will will be evacuated or all of the settle settlers will be evacuated or something to that effect I hope I uh got that correctly um actually with respect you're wrong Yosi uh the international court of justice has indicated just yesterday that every settler in the occupied Palestinian territory has to be removed by Israel from the occupied Palestinian territory as rapidly as possible now the questions of the modalities of when that takes place are up to the general assembly and as I said earlier based on the Cho's precedent you're looking at possibly 6 months a determination by the general assembly that this has to happen within 6 months it may or may not do but the point is it won't be up and this is the most important point I think that we take away from all of this uh that is happened in the ha yesterday it it won't be contingent none of this the end of the occupation will no longer be contingent on negotiation the occupation itself is unlawful it is an internationally wrong act and under the law of State responsibility as affirmed by the principal judicial organ of the UN Israel is under an obligation to end that internationally wrongful act unilaterally unconditionally that is not subject to negotiation so when it comes to third States for instance and the pressure that they may be brought bringing to bear on the parties to the conflict to negotiate the end of the occupation those days are long gone and and and the icj has made it so just yesterday wasam I do have a question for you but yes Yosi I'm going to let you go ahead and and respond to what AR was saying I I I agree with you that's you know the settlements project and settlers it's illegal but we are in situation that we are also to look at it in a realistic way it's not going to happen in six months whether whether we like it or not we definitely can look back said that you know we wish that the settlement project would have never started and and that end the result the situation that we are in but we know that in all all negotiation between the Israelis and the Palestinians there is an agreement that some settlements will stay and some settlements will go and there will be swap of land so I think what what I think the court decided yesterday or or pined yesterday it sets a very important Benchmark about the illegality of the settlements and the presence of the settlers how is going to translate into Political reality which will respect and it should respect this decision I think this has to be soon it it's bound to be so and take place so negotiation Witham um we've spoken already in this conversation about the potential role that the UN might play going forward the court ordered the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council to take whatever action necessary to end the legal occupation at the UN what do you expect to happen what are your expectations going forward well I mean the the UN is the composition of individual states uh and so uh um we expect those states that supported the advisory opinion in the first place uh to take a lead in uh pushing it forward through the general assembly but also uh push uh for Security Council action but at the same time not to be reliant on these un organs themselves to take action because each individual state has its own obligations uh to address its relationships with Israel the conduct of uh its businesses in their engagement with with Israel especially in occupied territory involvement of the settlement Enterprise because each individual state has a role to play in changing this cost benefit calculus of Israel's profitable settlement Enterprise and it is this that needs to be uh challenged and every state needs to reassess its relationships and how it can challenge and change that cost benefit calculus because until now Israel has developed the what I call a best business practice of colonialism which it has continued to exploit Palestinian land natural resources in addition to exploiting the Palestinian people themselves whether through Labor or using them as laborat for the development of technology that is then exported abroad all of this systemic uh uh issue needs to be addressed in a holistic manner but each individual state has role to play in addressing it um in its constituent Parts AR why do you think it took so long for the question of Israel's legitimacy over the occupied territories to be addressed in this particular way it has to do with the historical record of the treatment of the occupied Palestinian territory by the United Nations since 1967 um in that year uh there were differences of opinion between different blocks of States as to who was to blame for the the the onset of hostilities and their for the the resulting occupation the Arab states the Eastern block said that this was an aggression by Israel the western states said the opposite and there isn't a clear record within the UN system on who was to blame for 1967 despite what the record has since revealed um and so it took a while for the International Community through the UN system to determine that Israel's presence in the occupied territory was in and of itself unlawful you have some indications from the general assembly in the late 1970 s and early 1980s very Express references in general assembly resolutions that Israel's occupation is unlawful um and as well as in the economic and social Council in the 1990s but those references to Israel's illegal occupation um drop off after Oslo and I have not been able to determine why I surmise that it's because of the promise that Oslo held out to the International Community uh on on the end of the occupation and we now know that that was a false promise but all this to say it took a while and a lot of work um to to get the court uh to to arrive at this conclusion but it fundamentally was determined by the facts on the ground all of which are established in the UN record overwhelmingly clear annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and the desire to to to frustrate the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination while imposing a regime of racial segregation and apartheid on them that renders the occupation existentially unlawful you see we only have about a minute and a half left but I I just want to ask you um you know Israel immediately well government officials in Israel immediately rejected this conclusion from the icj um do you think that the opinions that have been stated by Netanyahu and and other ministers and members of his government reflect what public opinion is in Israel no and we and we know that Israelis would like to see a different government since since October 7 we we saw that opinion polls after isra want to see the end of n primip but it does prip but it doesn't mean that the Israeli Society is going to the left or becoming more pnic as a result of it and I think possibly at this advisory opinion came in different timing and not during war and not a society that suffers from from trauma maybe there will been more openness towards that right now I'm afraid that most Israel will see it again is an act against Israel in sense to going through what Israel needs to go in Israel Society so H soering think what is the occupation done to Israel to its democracy to its morality to its relations with the with the Palestinians and and and and the region but I I'm afraid on this issue it's not going to happen right now all right well we have run out of time so we're going to have to leave the conversation there today thanks so much to Our Guest wasam Ahmed and Yosi meckelberg and thanks so much for
