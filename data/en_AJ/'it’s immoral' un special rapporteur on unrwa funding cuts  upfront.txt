Gaza may be facing a collapse of its humanitarian system as donor countries pull funding from the United Nations relief and works agency or unua a crucial provider of Aid both before and after October 7th thus far at least 26,000 Gins have been killed and another 1.7 million have been displaced so why during a time of Crisis have countries pulled the funding and what will happen to civilians who depend on the agency for rival here to speak with us about this is the United Nations special repor on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 Franchesca Alban Franchesca thanks so much for joining me on upfront uh Israel has accused 12 unua employees of being involved in the October 7th attacks against Israel uh the UN has said that it's investigating these serious allegations but since then at least a dozen countries including the United States Germany Germany the UK have already stopped giving funding to the agency uh un officials have warned that the loss of the funding could lead to a collapse of the humanitarian system from your perspective what impact would this have on the people um thank you for having me Mark um first of all I think that we should unpack this uh suspension of of funds and to my knowledge the number of countries who have done so has reached 18 right now and this is absolutely shocking and it's not justifiable apparently I mean we have not seen the the evidence that there are allegations that um 12 staff members of anra have participated in the seventh of October attacks um ana without even ensuring due process has terminated the contracts of these uh of these people in the interest of the agency as the commissioner General said again the the the logic of suspending funds given the fact that the United Nations Andra has already taken measures taken very seriously these allegations makes no sense whatsoever and also because it's going to lead uh to a humanitarian catastrophe worse than what we are seeing already with the risk of famine looming on the Gaza stet and with the risk of diseases which are already spreading becoming even worse and killing more people the humanitarian Affairs and emergency relief coordinator of the un uh Martin griffit has uh has said withdrawing funds from manwa is perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gala with far-reaching humanitarian and human rights consequences not only in Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territory but also across the region because we shall not forget that ra operates in in Jordan in Syria in Lebanon and including in the in the West Bank and East Jerusalem um so bottom line is that Israel would have to take immediate responsibility for the 2.3 million survivors in in Gaza and this is not a reassuring Prospect given the reported level of violence against civilians but also in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory so in light of the picture you just painted The Gross humanitarian consequences the the the violence the displacement the disease the the the potential famine if all of that is going to happen as a consequence of the alleged crimes of 12 people in unua would that not amount to Collective punishment it does this was my first assessment when I when I heard this because first of all as I as I said it makes not no sense logically to punish the agency for something that has been allegedly done by a few members of the organization you know anra has a very thorough uh vetting process but it I mean what is expected to do it doesn't have policing tools and like no other agencies has so it's it's very unrealistic to expect that and could check in an environment as stands as that of the Gaza Strip which has been under blockade for 16 years and which has suffered five major wors before the 7th of October where there is a lot of tension and where Hamas is the facto the ruling Authority it's it's illogical but also actually could you say a little bit more about that vetting process though because there are people in the global Community who have accepted the logic and the narrative that under what actually is very indiscriminate in the Palestinians that they hire to work on the ground uh for unre particularly in the Gaza Strip uh and that it's just a breeding ground for for these types of things how would you respond to that what is what is it like what is the vetting process like um no look I think that there has been um okay these these allegations against anwa are part of an an attack against the agency that dates back the a and it has intensified as of the 7th of October there has been incre increasing smearing of the agency uh associating it to Hamas and including parliamentarians in the in Israel saying that the only way to ensure Victory would imply destroying anra as I said in general un humanitarian agencies cannot vet local Personnel for militancy but Anda does background checks uh when when it assume when it um recruits its staff and it has a 13,000 13,000 staff members in Gaza serving 1.7 million uh Palestinians so 75% of the Palestinians in Gaza are Andra beneficiaries of course Andra cannot monitoring staff actions outside the work at the same time um anra has a strong scrutin over the Personnel it hires and in fact every six months the names of both staff members and beneficiaries and vendors are circulated to all um host States including Israel and so if even Israel didn't have information concerning any possible wrongdoings committed by anra staff because had it had it it would have passed to the agency how can anra be blamed right now so it seemed to me an orchestrated campaign against against anra so the allegations against unro were made public on the same day that the icj ruled on provisional measures in South Africa's genocide case against Israel uh is that a coincidence do you want me to be honest or diplomatic honest I believe I'll take the honest yeah look I it it's of course it was striking it was striking in that the day after the um the icj ruling there was this new circulating and all of a sudden all of a sudden a number of member states the US first and foremost decided to suspend uh to suspend the aid to the agency so it can be read as a way to shift the attention away from the icj genocide interim order and again it could be also seen as part of a long-standing effort of Israel to annihilate the agency and this is something that dates back as I said to the post also agreement this is not something new but at the same time What shocks me is the it's not necessarily the maneuvering possible maneuvering from Israel what I find shocking is the response by member states because cutting funds to anra at a moment that is existential for millions of Palestinians in Gaza who are enduring catastrophic living help me help me understand that those member states because again if it were even just the United States or if Israel just made the call and no one responded to to to the request to cut underwar funds it would be less shocking but again we're talking about more than a dozen countries suspending the funding before the investigation is completed how do they how is that justified how do you make sense of that it makes again it cannot be justified it's so it's so immoral irresponsible but also it might have serious legal implications for this for these states uh and again on the one hand there is the fact that some of Israel's actions have been already found by the icj plausibly constituting genocide uh this implies legal responsibility for member states because basically the icj has alerted International community of the risk of genocide in Gaza and it has ordered immediate and effective action so they have to take all actions in their power to prevent Israel from continuing what might constitute genocide and the second is to um to ensure that they do not Aid and abet with with illegal acts and they might be seen as complicit with acts of genocide so instead of uring uring that humanitarian Aid is delivered is is even strengthened no what they do is they take action castigating the agency that provides critical support to millions of Palestinians in this threat how do you make sense of that I mean you you point out the Paradox and this huge contradiction how do these powerful Nations arrive at the conclusion that this makes sense I've seen a number of countries um announcing that that they will consider restating eight well it's not sufficient they shouldn't have done it in the first place now they should uh release the funds as soon as possible um I don't know what they are telling themselves I have no idea but I hope that civil society and the people of the people of this country will will take action themselves against the government this is not the time to be silent again um the international Community has proven unable unable to prevent genocides in in other occasions it has happened in Rwanda it has happened in Bosnia heroina but this is unique as the state of of South Africa has has said before the international court of justice because this is a genocide that is being televised and documented by the very the very victims and the lack of empathy the lack of empathy is toward these people shown by primarily but not only Western countries is abysmo and this represents such a this is such a watershed moment mark because it is um it's clear that there is a huge divide that is not so just symbolic between the west and the rest where there is also a gray area where in my view Arab countries have not done enough either to protect the Palestinians but again International law is being completely dismantled whatever the International International law-based System can do to protect uh the life of of people in danger and to ensure peace and stability for all is being completely dismantled and this is um this is shocking of course Franchesca Alban thank you so much for joining us in up front thank you all right everyone that is our show up front we'll be back next
