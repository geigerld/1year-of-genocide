Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are desperate to hear anything about an immediate ceasefire especially before Ramadan today we're in downtown and we're going to talk to people about what they think about this ceasefire agreement I hope and I wish for a ceasefire we've heard things during previous talks and negotiations that one might come but we've been disappointed every time the people will always be the victims the people are really suffering the people have no more energy Ramadan is approaching we ask God to make our life easier and better enough is enough every time they talk about a ceasefire it never happened but this time I have a feeling there will be a ceasefire my son my son-in-law and my brother-in-law are prisoners in Israeli jails and I hope they will be released we ask God to have this ceas far and to go back to our homes to our kids to our neighborhoods we left our lives in Gaza City and came here we pray for a truth so we can go back to our normal lives prices here are scary we can't afford to buy food for our kids I haven't seen my daughter for 100 days they are eating sand there we pray for a ceasefire so we come back to our homes some Palestinians are optimistic and others are pessimistic all they want and all they wish for is an immediate ceasefire especially before Ramadan this Al make sure to subscribe to to our channel to get the latest news from Al
