welcome back you're watching Al jazer let's take another quick look at where things now stand in Israel's war on Gaza Israeli air strikes have now killed more than 2,800 Palestinians since this latest conflict began 9 days ago one in three of them are children with more than a thousand killed in just N9 days the number of Israelis killed in hamas's military operation now stands at 1,400 including 291 Soldiers the Israeli Army says that 199 captain are being held by Hamas in Gaza Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Iran and Hezbollah not to quote test Israel in the north while the conflict between Israel and Gaza is featuring prominently at the United Nations let's speak to Christen salumi she joins us now live from un headquarters there in New York Kristen a flurry of activity there today I imagine amid some very dive humanitarian warnings that we're hearing yes and in the last 24 hours the call for unimpeded access to Gaza for humanitarian relief has gotten louder more frequent more urgent from un officials the Secretary General himself late on Sunday said that the Middle East is on the verge of of an abyss uh responding to the humanitarian agency's warning that Gaza is about to run out of food water uh electricity and that hospitals in fact could have no power in the next 24 hours uh making it very difficult to treat the many wounded people the thousands of wounded people that they're dealing with there uh the UN from the beginning has been pushing back against the idea that 1.1 million people could evacuate uh from northern Gaza as was demanded by Israel uh and they have been pushing the idea and reminding the world that under international law humanitarian access protection of civilians uh is required protection of the Wounded is something that is required so that is the message that is being uh repeated by un officials across the board here in New York and around the world the message specifically from the Secretary General was that Israel allow unimpeded access to Gaza saying that they have the supplies ready to go in and to help people but the Secretary General also called on Hamas as well to release all hostages immediately uh uh in in this as well well that Hamas should also uh do that without condition release the hostages so this is what we're hearing from the UN and the relief chief for the United Nations Martin Griffith also uh spoke uh earlier today he sounded a bit more optimistic he said he'd been engaging directly with Israel and Egypt uh that secretary blinken's visit had been very helpful and that he was optimistic that there was going to be an announcement sometime today uh he was hopeful that there would be an an announcement sometime today on Aid getting in but we haven't heard it yet well speaking of announcements Kristen I believe there is also a critical vote being scheduled in the coming hours at the security Council well there are actually two votes uh at least two votes scheduled now uh in the coming hours two dueling resolutions have been put forward to the security Council uh on the situation in the Middle East the first one was put forward by Russia calling for an immediate ceasefire uh and for uh basically an immediate ceasefire uh condemning all acts of terrorism and condemning all violence against civilians um pretty straightforward resolution uh but it was objected to right away from the United States the United Kingdom other countries who say that it is important for the security Council to condemn Hamas they want any resolution to uh include condemnation of Hamas uh since Russia put forward that resolution Brazil came out Brazil holds the presidency of the security Council right now they're working on another version uh on the situation in the Middle East their version condemns the October 7th attack by Hamas uh and The Taking of Civilian hostages but it also cause for a humanitarian pause a cessation of hostilities uh to allow for the aid to get in um Russia is pushing for amendments on that so there's still negotiations going on not clear how this is going to play out any resolution will need at least nine votes of the security council's 15 members and none of the permanent members can use their veto in order for it to go through so this is all being negotiated right down to the minute here um but clearly it's a top concern for the security Council the situation in the Middle East and many do feel that some action needs to be taken we'll be staying across that for you here on alaz Christen salumi there for us at un headquarters thank you Kristen well joining us now on on set is Aisha albastri she's a research fellow at the Arab Center for research and policy studies Aisha I'm really interested in the Dynamics of what's going on at the security Council at the moment so let's start with this resolution that's being pushed by Russia what's in it for Moscow what's their calculus here well there are right now two uh resolutions two draft resolutions one pushed from uh by Russia since Friday and then new one from Brazil which is the president of October sessions so uh Russia which was isolated for quite a long time since the invasion of of Ukraine uh is trying to come back to lead at least in this uh crisis um uh it it is of course you know focusing on the humanitary access it's calling on a ceasefire it's also condemning but condemning both sides uh the acts of violence is not talking about one side against the other it's also calling for theas release of of hostages so if you look at it is quite balanced uh but the problem is that it's Russia who's pushing it for it and that's probably the main reason why the US Washington London and Paris has has rejected it uh I don't think they would be willing to to give uh Russia a nice role in this uh in this moment and that's why uh Brazil came in probably with with the same idea the core idea is this the ceasefire the humanitarian ceas fire but they added the elements that they want to see which is condemning Hamas terrorism and acts of violence and also calling for the the release of hostages uh I think both resolutions right now um stand little chance of of of going through because of the Dynamics of the five permanent members of the security Council right now which are basically still fighting each other and they're bringing in the uh the the confrontation of of Ukraine uh in in this uh in this crisis yeah well as all of that takes place at the UN obviously the humanitarian situation is deteriorating even further and still we're I believe waiting for Aid to make it across the border and civilians are also not able to get out through ruer I mean there are humanitarian laws International humanitarian laws that are meant to stop this from happening what what kind of accountability can there be to try to break this kind of impass that we're seeing well I I think the you just touched on the main issue the core issue is the absence of any accountability when it comes to Israel and Israeli crimes uh since its establishment it's been committing horrendous crimes um you know the the Jewish Community uh and Jewish genocide Scholars have been recently voicing their concern and warning against genocide and genocide enement in in recent uh in the recent war in Gaza and and this this kind of blockades the intent of to destroy a group which is Hamas but but all gasms in in in Gaza to destroy them and inflicting upon them conditions of life that are calculated to destroy that group which is basically the definition of genocide so the when a state uh has been allowed by all International System by the international justice system to commit such crimes and go away with it with mass murder with crimes against humanity and with genocide uh you cannot talk about accountability and that's why we're here because no one is has been able to to hold uh the Israel to account well let me ask you then about any kind of path forward we've been talking for days now about any kind of mediation efforts we obviously know that there's Egypt has a huge part to play and we've not seen a huge amount of movement happen at the Crossing even though there there was talk of that in the last few days there is I believe meant to now be a Cairo Summit this weekend what do you make of regional mediation efforts it does feel like a lot of people have their own a lot of countries have a lot of their own interests at heart it's true a lot of con countries are concerned um you know Egypt I think in in the region will be the first country to be concerned of what's happening it's been voicing his concern from the beginning that it would not allow a a a a force displacement and a refugee problem in its country this is what Israel was was uh I mean at the beginning at least was was heading to was pushing the the uh the gazin towards South toward Egypt and Egypt refused that so Egypt has a lot at stake in this in this war but also we have Jordan Jordan also is is is very concerned if of for if the scenario if the scenario of transfer force transfer in Egypt works then they are next and then you have of course other countries in region but I'm afraid that the uh the who is calling the shot is the is is Washington and Washington is being align itself with Israel without any sort of distantiation or um you know kind of critical Voice or critical uh Insight in into into this position so the I I think that only Washington can can exert some some sort of influence right now over over Israel and it's not doing it it's been from day one uh associating the Hamas operation which is a resistance movement after all has been associating with dases with Isis crimes and uh to to to allow a sort in association with September 11th and uh addressing this situation as a terrorist situation and that's that's that's the main problem is that Washington has not uh distanced itself from Israel's role and from from Israel extremist extremist decision to uh to to uh impose a blockade on on entire population Aisha albastri research fellow at the Arab Center for research and policy studies great to talk to you here
