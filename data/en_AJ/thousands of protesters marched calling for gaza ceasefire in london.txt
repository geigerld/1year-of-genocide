it's a familiar chant heard in London for months but now aimed at a new government those marching here want Britain's incoming prime minister to know they want him to do more to help end the war in Gaza so what we want to see from Kama is pretty much the opposite of what he put in his Manifesto we want him to call and demand an immediate ceasefire we want him to stand up to Israel we want him to Halt all arm sales to Israel immediately but among the crowd there's skepticism I have very little hope we've got an international human rights lawyer who has actively tried to prevent a ceasefire vo in in government which I find horrific I don't really feel much hope that there's going to be much progress um but you know being here today that's what fills me with hope and um [Music] yeah and for some here Labor's Ascent to power makes little difference well many attending here today say that they have always traditionally backed labor but they are unhappy with the new prime minister sakir st's stance on Gaza because they say that his party's approach isn't all that different to the previous conservative government's approach and they also have a problem with the fact that while labor committed to recognizing the Palestinian State they have not said when they would do that and that approach has cost labor four seats in some of its traditional heartlands with even a shadow cabinet minister removed by an independent candidate supporting Palestine though Gaza was not all these challenges campaigned on I ran on a combination of foreign policy peace and Justice um no to genocide no to arm sales to Israel and also the uh deprivation in our community and trying to get investment um and opportunities for our children makes the new British government will have its work cut out on the economy and the High Cost of Living but people marching here want to make sure that with other pressing issues the war in Gaza is not forgotten millena vinovich Al jaer London make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
