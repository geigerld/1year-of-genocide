video has emerged showing Palestinians stripped and rounded up by Israeli forces at a sports stadium in Gaza the footage was released by the Palestinian KS news agency it comes as the UN sounds the alarm about Israel's treatment of detainees the Israeli Army has rejected criticism of that video in a statement it says the individuals detained were treated in accordance with international law and that it's often necessary for what it calls Terror suspects to hand over their clothes to be searched to ensure they aren't concealing explosive vests or other weapons the Army says the clothes are not immediately returned to the detainees in case they conceal something that could be used for hostile purposes it adds that the clothing is returned to the detainees when it's possible to do so well since the beginning of its war on Gaza the Israeli Army has detained hundreds of men and boys some Palestinians released by the military have been talking about their treatment at the hands of Israeli soldiers accusing them of torture and humiliation a warning viewers may find some of these firsthand accounts tristino mariniello is a professor of law at Liverpool John Moos University a specialist in international law and a member of the legal team representing Gaza victims before the international criminal court he joins me live now from Liverpool thank you so much for being on elera first of all we've seen this video uh that has uh been released in the last few hours over the last day or so uh showing boys Palestinian boys and men being stripped to their underwear in the uh Sports stadium in Gaza what is your initial reaction to that video well first of all many thanks for having me today I think the video clear clearly shows de humanization of Palestinians including children that we have seen in this we have seen in this video and this dehumanization reflects the rethoric of the Israeli Minister of Defense Gan that since the beginning of the war has said that Palestinians are human animals and have to be treated as such and this video really reflects this words uh de humanization means a violation of international law in particular of international humanitarian law that applies because this is an armed conflict and international human rights law because we have Assist to the commission of inum and deg grating treatment of Palestinians International humanitarian law provides protection which means in this case Humane treatment and this applies to everyone applies the human being treated humanly in the context of hared conflict applies to everyone so to civilians but also to members of armed groups if Israel were able to prove that there are members of Palestinian hmed groups among these these people and this protection is absolute absolute in legal terms means that there is no derogation in other words there is no military necessity or emergency that that issue that Israel can use in order to justify and human or degrading treatment on Palestinians yeah well what does this type of treatment do to the psyche of someone who has been detained especially uh the young boys that have faced this treatment well as I said I mean the protection provided under International humanitarian law international human rights law are clear in this regard being treating uh humanly means prohibition absolute prohibition of torture ill treatment and any form of degrading of degrading treatment we have seen that this is not this video does not show isolated act this may appear as a part of mass arrest campaign put in place by the IDF in by the Israel defenses forces in Gaza in relation to this mass arrest campaign human rights groups including Amnesty International have reported serious allegations of serious violation of international law including torture ill treatment enforced disappearances executions and even in the West Bank have been reporting including by the Israeli newspaper hars the death of some Palestinian deonis by the Israeli Security Forces it must be clear that these are not only violation of international law which entail the state responsibility all the responsibility of Israel as a state but this also amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity and as such they they demand an urgent investigation by independent institution independent means for sure not Israeli military system which has shown has reported by the UN that it's not uh willing and able to provide Justice to Palestinians in relation to this yeah from from a legal point of view given all of that what how you've what you've just explained there what can you and other a international groups actually do well uh what human rights groups in particular Palestinian Civil Society both in the West Bank and the Gaza Street do is presenting evidence submission to the office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court the international criminal court has jurisdiction over the alleged Commission of international crimes in this context as repeated by the prosecutor in these past few days it's it's frustrating for the Palestinian victims and also for human rights groups Palestinian Civil Society that the prosecutor has very uh firmly condemned Hamas attacks from the 7 of October and that's part of his Mandate of course but it's been very reluctant to put in place any effective investigation in relation to alleged International crimes committed against Palestinians I mean what we see is the repetition of double standards by the office of the prosecutor which are unacceptable particularly light of the unfolding genocide in Gaza indeed thank you so much we really do appreciate your time that is tristino Marini ELO thank you thank you
