more than 150 days into Israel's war on Gaza the airdropping of humanitarian Aid aimed at news Camas not the people who need it Palestinians have Washington to thank for that next door in LC's Egypt what's taking place in Gaza is testing the bounds of political descent and crimes against memory The Taking of a people's history and culture and erasing it you've seen the images in the media coverage the US airdropping Aid into Northern Gaza to feed hungry Palestinians headline news but also a textbook case of cognitive dissonance on Washington's part dropping food while continuing to provide Israel with bombs to pulverize Gaza what makes the starvation there different is that it's deliberate Israel is manufacturing the this famine it has systematically attacked what little Aid gets through last week more than a 100 Palestinians who lined up to get some flour to cook with were slaughtered by Israeli troops Israel's response to that atrocity was straight out of its misinformation Playbook deny then blame Palestinians then accept limited responsibility we've seen it so many times before what is unprecedented though is the scale of what is now unfolding in Gaza the hunger the mass killing the rewriting of the map and the gulf between what is happening on the ground and the obsolete narratives coming out of the White House and the mainstream news media has never been bigger the US Air drops into the Gaza Strip are pure theater US military planes making the first air drop to Gaza the US has been supplying thousands of tons of goods to the Gaza Strip but those have been high explosives and to then claim that somehow this is ameliorated by 38,000 meals ready to eat is quite obscene to put it politely but that is what it has come to the United States of America a superpower is unable or too afraid of the political consequences to force its relatively tiny Ally Israel to allow humanitarian Aid into Gaza to feed star Palestinians now resorting to airdrops that create the impression of urgency the illusion that the US is willing to go to extraordinary lengths to save Palestinian lives today the United States airlifted 24.5 metric tons or more than 54,000 lb of un humanitarian supplies to provide it was more performative than practical and had more to do with feeding news outlets imagery that suggests that America cares than getting Palestinians the food they need to survive when I saw the US airdrop food my first response was really anger it was horror that this is apparently the best the US can do who is the super power here is it the us or Israel there is no place that's safe there's no place where you can find Reliable food where people can get shelter garans are exhausted angry and scared and do not buy this argument that the US is suddenly caring about them by airdropping a handful of food people have have compared these scenes um uh to the Hunger Games and for good reason air drops is something you use in otherwise inaccessible Geographic locations a Mountaintop the middle of the Jungle what the US has done is provide less meals than would have fit into a single truck and the reason that these trucks aren't getting into the Gaza Strip is because there's a policy decision by Israel fully endorsed supported by the United States to starve these people into submission so the Biden Administration is essentially doing the least effective and most expensive method of getting Aid to people that need it because Israel simply won't concede to any American pressure on this one relatively simple point and there is something dystopian about these air drops and about the way that they pit people against each other I'm directing the US military as if the air drops aren't absurd or insulting enough the Biden Administration has now proposed building a port to deliver Aid by ship that would cost billions take months to construct while Aid trucks are already parked on Gaza doorstep currently on the rare occasion when a truckload of food actually makes it into Northern Gaza this happens the flower massacre in Gaza City in which at least 112 Palestinians lining up for food were killed by Israeli forces Israel then deployed its hasbara its disinformation machine to pump even more fog into the war zone a mob ambushed the a trucks bringing the Convoy to a halt it put out aerial images purporting to prove that Palestinians were to blame by charging at Israeli troops and edited out the parts that showed them being shot run over by Israeli tanks which is consistent with what has become a sickening pattern as one human rights NGO euromed monitor put it the Israeli shooting of starving Palestinian civilians receiving aid has become a regular practice a lot of Palestinian feared going there because they knew that the Israelis might just start shooting at them and that's exactly what happened and Reports say that this went on for about an hour and a half after it stopped Palestinians went back to the Atri and they started shooting again and this time they drove over uh the injured and dead bodies of Palestinians now what unfolded in the media how this was reported it was a chaotic incident a chaotic incident this is a word that is used for someone storming a football field not someone killing dozens of Palestinians who have not had food for days for weeks Israel claimed from the beginning that there was a mob it was a stampede and that choice of words is so interesting because what that really suggests is an unruly crowd these crazy Palestinians desperate for food who knows what they're going to do and we as Israeli soldiers are threatened and that framing which frankly too much of the media accepted too quickly it appears most who died were crushed by a crowd rushing the trucks or were run down as those trucks driven by gin began to flee the mob scene those the Israeli military seeing the damage that this massacre could cause offered a fairly ludicrous explanation to blame Palestinians for their own deaths and fairly quickly we saw this explanation unravel it may be it may have happened again as I said before it's a war zone if it happened I can say happened by mistake Guna WS didn't come from the aid trucks they came from the Israeli military but the US continued to go along with this very threadbear Israeli explanation and not to hold Israel to account for this massacre Israel is creating new facts on the ground cementing them into the landscape of Gaza you can see it in the creation of a new buffer zone inside the border wall that would Rob Goins of roughly 1/5th of their land and the paving of a new Israeli built Highway that slices the strip into and will allow Israel to control security the movement of people and goods these are familiar scenes now as hunger grips the entire population much of the western mainstream media is struggling to find the right way to describe what Israel is doing in Gaza to come up with suitable terminology framing it as a humanitarian crisis disguises what it really is and occupying power committing a genocide the Israelis are mapping out the strip they are effectively acting as if they own [Applause] they're trying to sell it as this place for Israelis and for zionists specifically to come and live in these are not stories we're hearing about we're still hearing about the genocide and there is nothing to be done when reality is the end is the annihilation of the Palestinians in Gaza if a ceasefire is not administered immediately that is where the Israeli authorities are struggling in the construction of the news narrative getting more Aid to the people that need it not to the Kamas Fighters we will work with our allies um but no one wants the food to go to Hamas not your allies not you but they do want it to go to starving babies as Adept as they have been over the years at manipulating news coverage misinforming audiences that has proved to be no match for the the evidence Palestinians have been posting and people around the world have been seeing on their feeds and targeting Palestinian journalists in Gaza killing them in record numbers has not been enough to stop the truth coming out images that are reminisent of another genocide that for Israelis hits close to home the World War II Holocaust social media has been a catastrophe for the Israelis yes on the one hand they can get their message out quite easily through Tik Tok Instagram whatever platform may be but there's so much content being pumped out from the Palestinian perspective that Israel doesn't know how to manage it you can obfuscate and try to convince people that all the gazans are terrorists or every child in Gaza of 5 years old is a potential Hamas fighter but who actually believes that Israel will until the end of its days be tainted by the accusation of genocide now that's bad for any state and the differ difference here in comparison with fairly recent genocides ironically despite Israel's best efforts to keep journalists out of the Gaza Strip no genocidal assault has been broadcast as extensively in real time as what we are seeing in the Gaza Strip over the past 5 months you have seen images of Palestinians and children in specific who have been so malnourished that they are dying and they're going to haunt not not just the reputation of Israel but the entire world we've seen these images from the Holocaust what does it say for us to see it again for it to be happening without anybody lifting a finger and contrary to the past these images are accessible these crimes are documented we need to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself that the Palestinians do not become the victims of a new Holocaust to Egypt now where journalists in the capital staged a daring protest over Gaza pointing fingers close to home and where the president's loyalists in the media have had to work overtime minak shiavi is here with the details ever since Israel launched its assault on Gaza the war has been a delicate subject for president Abdul fatah LCC and by extension the country's media the chasm between the public outrage against Israel and kaido's ambiguous approach to the war has led to censorship of news coverage and suppression of public protest the exception is the Egyption journalist Syndicate multiple demonstrations have taken place the latest last Saturday took aim at Arab governments not a single news Outlet in Egypt reported on the protest a sign of how sensitive this issue is for the CC government despite controlling at least in theory the Rafa Crossing into Southern Gaza kairo has remained largely passive as Israel has blocked Aid trucks and massacred Palestinian civilians seeking Refuge there it has also prevented journalists trying to get into Gaza to help its safe face the government has a host of supporters in the media it can count on here's how some of them described progress on the delivery of Aid last with the risk of an Israeli invasion of Rafa driving Palestinians over the Egyptian border we can expect to see the propaganda and the policing of descent go up a notch thanks mea for 5 months now the listening post has covered Israel's war on Gaza through the prism of the media including the unprecedented number of Palestinian journalists killed but what is taking place in Gaza is much bigger it is a genocidal assault on Palestinian history existence and culture most of gaza's museums universities and libraries now lie in Ruins too many cultural creators and custodians have been killed and when South Africa invoked the genocide convention at the international court of justice it noted that in Israel's destruction of gaza's archives and landmarks it is obliterating Palestinian personal lives private memories histories and Futures this is not the first time Palestinian culture has been the target of Israeli destruction and looting however what has happened since October 7th has eclipsed anything we have seen before including in the Noca of 1948 what happens when cultural heritage is erased who controls the historical narrative and to what effect to grasp the enormity of what's been lost and what it means we spoke to gazen writer and historian Jihad Abu Salim to understand the scale of Destruction in Gaza today one needs to understand the nature of the war Israel has launched against Palestinians we're not talking about conventional Warfare this is a war of annihilation that targets the foundations of society we've seen universities bombed libraries museums Israel is trying to prevent Palestinians from reclaiming and reestablishing life in Gaza as they knew it my name is Jihad Abu Salim I'm from the city of darl balah located in the middle of the Gaza Strip it's where I grew up and spent most of my life Gaza City was the only Palestinian coastal city that was not conquered by Zionist militias in 1948 and that gave Gaza uh huge significance and placed it as the Beating Heart of preserving Palestinian nationalism and furthering the Palestinian cause for Liberation and by destroying in universities museums libraries and archives Israel seeks to make our memory whether it's Collective institutional inaccessible it's an assault on continuity they want to force people out of Gaza but also they want to make sure that if people return to Gaza they find nothing and will for eternity in this limbo of nothingness in this void gaza's old city with its masks like or a church like the Church of St poriferous testifies to in's complex and multifaceted history alar mque is the second oldest mque in Palestine after AA MK and from the footage that we've seen it seems that the mosque was deliberately targeted because there are photos that show surrounding buildings standing intact while the mosque has been bombed to smithin so Israel is trying to impose a rupture between the present and the past and of course the future and destroying an iconic structure like musque is just part of that effort the goal of targeting uh gaza's archives is to make it impossible for people to rebuild and reclaim what has been lost we did not only lose historical documents but also land Deeds land registration infrastructure plans and schemes now we hear all these reports of people going back to their neighborhoods and being unable to recognize where the street that they lived on was located where their homes were and they think that by destroying institutions or uh archives or looting museums they can destroy Gaza as a place and therefore prevent people from returning there or reestablishing their lives Gaza and its District have suffered a lot in terms of the targeting and destruction of historic and Heritage sites after 1967 after Gaza became under Israeli occupation Israeli defense minister MOS Dean built an entire Infamous career in addition to being a war criminal of looting artifacts from different parts of Gaza and Palestine and storing them in his own home but also in the 1970s and 80s Israeli forces alongside Israeli archaeologists looted a 4,500 year old Canaanite Cemetery located in uh derl balah my hometown and they took anything they could carry to the Israel national museum and today I go on the internet and I see artifacts that were stolen and looted from this site being being sold around the world and that makes you wonder if Israel's practices today are a new phenomenon or just a continuation of a long-standing pattern of uh destruction and looting of Palestinian history and in this war alone Palestinians in Gaza have lost towering figures in in in their society who shaped and defined the cultural and scholarly life uh in Gaza and if there is one individual that captures the essence of this city and what it stands for it's if the Lions do not have their own historians the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunters will always glorify occupier was was killed while he was Sheltering with his sister and her children before he was killed he received a phone call from an Israeli officer warning him that uh they're after him he was killed his sister was killed the children were killed and his brother was also killed I am an academic I probably the toughest thing I have at at home is an expo marker but if the Israelis invade if the aret has charge at US Open Door too to Massacre us I'm going to use that marker throw it at the Israeli soldiers even if that is the last thing that I would be able to do he was an important professor and and a writer and a poet whose impact transcended his personal work to shaping and molding of a generation of English-speaking Palestinians in Gaza who mastered the art of telling their stories but we've also lost a large number of cultural and literary figures and of course many academics this is an assault on the people who create meaning in society and who create the language that helps people understand and and reflect on their reality Israel knew what it has been doing and continue to do by attacking and going after our cultural and literary and intellectual figures but triat like Gaza is an idea and ideas don't die buddies can perish cities can be destroyed but the ideas that they stand for the principles and the values these are things that uh do not just vanish Into Thin Air they continue to exist and to inspire people for many years to come back to where we began the crisis of Aid in Gaza a key factor in this the accusations the Israeli government made in January against the biggest source of Aid in Gaza the United Nations relief and works agency unra when Israel alleged unra was harboring Hamas Fighters too many Western news outlets foremost among them the Wall Street Journal simply bought the story the US and multiple other governments then pulled their funding despite the ridiculously scant evidence that Israel provided starving unra of the money it needs to help Palestinians the EU and Canada have now announced they will resume funding in Canada's case that will take time something the people of Gaza simply do not have of all the crimes against journalism since October 7th the way the unra episode was reported is one that will weigh heavily on the conscience of the journalists and news editors involved or at least it should we'll see you next time here at the listening
