well just to remind you of some reporting that we've been getting just in as I was saying a few minutes ago the CM brigades has released video footage showing the launch of its kamakazi drones into Israeli territory the military wing of Hamas said it targeted sites in Israel for the first time since it's offensive more than two weeks ago well let's bring in t kamu he's a professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies T how how much should we be making of This development drones being sent into Israeli territory uh it's it's important especially that the land Invasion has been uh delayed so far we don't see any movement on the front and this also uh could relate to this that the Israelis and Americans know that Hamas has um some tactical weapons I mean uh kamakazi drones are very important in these types of warfare so uh the fact that Hamas is releasing these images now on videos so it it says that I'm ready and I maybe I have more more uh more to show or to use if if if the war escalates so I I think we take it into this context but still I mean the Israeli Army is the Israeli Army it has a Lifeline support logistical support from the US the US has is fully committed to support Israel in its military operation be it a land Invasion or something limited so uh so I think they're doing their calculations uh carefully and probably the Americans also they don't want to see Israel getting into trouble I mean uh remember uh Anastasia the uh the Americans had a similar experience in falja but Gaza is 10 times bigger than fuja in Iraq so this could be Israel's nightmare as well and I think the last thing the Americans want to see is an embarrassment for Israel in any uh future invasion in Gaza so they don't want the Israelis to to to seem struggling and not able to achieving their military goal so I would I would assume that most of the deliberations and the discussions now uh revolve around these issues tactical issues what are the end goals of any uh future Invasion or military peration inside Gaza and I think my guess from following the media and even Israeli media is that the Israelis are still they don't have concrete goals they don't know exactly what they want and how do they want to achieve it and whether or not they have all the military capabilities they need to achieve a full Grand Invasion if that's a scenario well they keep talking about how they're willing for this war to go on for as long as it takes to get rid of Hamas but I've been wondering what are the options for Israel um in the in the event that that actually does happen we've also seen this this increased Crackdown in the occupied West Bank if Israel succeeds in getting rid of Hamas would they not need some kind of of Goodwill or some kind of relationship with the Palestinian leaders in in rala in order to try to to create some kind of government structure that's it's like that's like panadora book books I mean I mean it's like opening pador books uh first of all we don't know how will this war end and what's Israel's end end goals when it comes to I mean is it really uh getting rid of Hamas or weakening Hamas and making it Irrelevant in the future this could be another goal possible goal and the possibility of this evolving into a regional War as wellah entering also then this is a game changer as well and most importantly the willingness of Arab countries and governments to be a part of any future solution that involves let's say uh getting rid of Hamas rule in Gaza and then some inviting someone else be an Arab country an Arab force or the Palestinian Authority in ramala coming back and having uh a future in in Gaza after Hamas so these are all big questions but but I think it's too early to ask these questions yes these are rightful questions but so far we have been seeing things are moving slow now and seems the Israelis are recalculating their options in light of what they see they tried yesterday to invade Gaza there was a limited operation they lost a soldier and three wounded and now Hamas is showing its kamikazi drones so I think the Israelis are nervous Gaza is their nightmare I mean in the Israeli narrative psychology name it I mean Gaza has been the nightmare for since decades I mean there was a famous prime minister who said I think it was raban like I wish one day I wake up in the morning I see Gaza in the Mediterranean not non-existent so for them it is their nightmare so and it's not easy and I'm I'm and for me the the horrifying thing is the civilians who are stuck in this we have 2.3 milon Palestinians who have no say whatsoever in in in the military operation the military discourse you know they are civilian same like the Israeli civilians in Israel but these are protected they have shelters they have hospitals to go to but think about the 2.3 million civilians in Gaza who have nothing but massacring and all these kids who are dying and why for what I mean what's what's their I mean the Holocaust Survivors the Israelis why do they want to see what how is this good for them that these thousands of kids who die and being massacred by Israelis how is this good for the survivors of the Holocaust who also suffered a lot how I mean future will judge this so this has to stop I mean but again we hope we hope that there is an international will that the Americans at least wake up and become wiser because they have experienced similar similar scenarios in Afghanistan and Iraq and they they failed to achieve any military victory in these countries I don't think Gaza will be uh different than Iraq or Afghanistan although it's smaller yes and the its capabilities is much smaller but they left nothing to people there so it's going to be a tough War if they decide to go to achieve their full Target declared Target so far which is getting rid of Hamas and I don't know how so far how a tough war and and obviously as you're saying that the toughest for civilians corre Tam kamu professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies great to have you back in studio with us thank you so much
