FL Hassan Noms the deputy mayor of Jerusalem joins us live from West Jerusalem good to have you with us so today seven children members of the bakri family were killed by an Israeli air strike overnight do you condemn the killing of Palestinian children by Israeli forces I think um any child that dies in the process of war is tragic they didn't do anything but I feel very very grieved at the 200 hostages that Hamas have who are victims of a war crime one thing is war and things happen not purposefully the Israeli Army does not Target Palestinian children unfortunately Hamas uses them as human Shields and puts them in strategic places so that they can say look what the Israelis did but Hamas the terrorist genocidal group run by Iran they actually purposely Target children and women raping women beheading babies and let me tell you what uh that we found today an autic I do have to jump in I'm sorry I do I do need to jump in because you haven't answered the question I didn't ask you about what Hamas is doing let me repeat I'm not asking you whether it's tragic let let me just this is how an interview works let me pose the question to you please do you condemn the Israeli military's killing of seven children of the al-bakri family I'm not asking you if you think it's tragic I'm not asking you how you feel about hamas's attacks we have condemned and I've given very hard interviews on October the 8th to Hamas officials but I'm asking you to answer the question do you condemn the killing of seven children yes or no I think it's tragic that seven children died today it doesn't matter who they are whether they're Palestinian or Israeli are you viewers will will notice FL that you are not condemning the Israeli military killing of seven children how how would you respond to those who say well let me finish let me finish the question let me finish the question let me finish the the question how would you no I haven't finished the question please this is how a conversation Works how would you respond to those who will say that by failing to condemn what international let me read you a statement by Amnesty International concerning the killings of children it says on October the 19th it's saying okay we'll come to whether they're neutral or not they're saying quote they concern learned about violations of international humanitarian law by Israeli forces in Gaza they go on to reference air strikes pounding residential buildings killing children they are blaming Israeli forces not Hamas not human shields for killing Israeli children of Palestinian children by not recognizing that how do you respond to those who say you're not giving the same value to palestin babies and children as you are to Israelis that's not true and then let me tell you what the differen is when you condemning means that somebody went and purpose purposefully did something the Israeli Army does not purposely go to kill children unfortunately children and adults and all people can be the casualties of War there's a difference between being a casualty of War which is tragic and going and purposefully targeting children and that I would condemn whoever did that so what you're then telling viewers Flur is you've dismissed amnesty as not neutral yes let me finish please I didn't interrupt you I didn't interrupt you FL you must let me ask the question please so what you're saying to viewers is that what B selum an Israeli an Israeli human rights organization says when it talks about a criminal policy of Revenge is underway in its October the 10th statement by giving an order to prefer quote to prefer damage over Precision has been carried out and saying this constitutes quote war crimes openly ordered by top Israeli officials are you saying also bat selum are wrong and they don't know how to assess theic categorically they're wrong because we warn we warn people we we warn the people of Northern Gaza to move to Southern Gaza specifically and precisely because we know that the Hamas infrastructure there's a whole City Underground full of weapons full of Rocket full of rocket launchers and because we didn't want innocent civilians In Harm's Way We asked them to move out of the way so yes I condemn Amnesty International which everybody knows is biased and corrupt to it cor and betm who' lost their marbles okay we'll leave the viewers to judge that I'm wondering do you also then condemn as biased and lost their marbles 48 un experts who say quote in a statement we strongly condemn Israel's indiscriminate military attacks against the already exhausted Palestinian people of Gaza there is no justification for violence that indiscriminately targets innocent civilians whether by Hamas or Israeli forces this is absolutely prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime are you telling viewers amnesty is wrong B selem has lost its Marbles and the UN exp 48 un experts are also biased and wrong well all you have to do is look at the UN schools in Gaza and the West Bank to know you're not answering the question you're not answering the question you're not you're not answering the question please answer the question you're not letting me answer you're not letting me answer the question and get to my point what I'm saying is how can I hold un so-called experts to any type of expert opinion when they are managing a curriculum that teaches hatred and how to kill Jews anti-semitic and completely obsessed with the right of return which is the destruction of Israel these are the same un experts so your answer is that they are Fanatics because they believe in a right of return I never use the word Fanatics okay okay you're discrediting them for Palestinians perhaps the right of destruction of the state of isra let me ask you something do you believe in the right of existence of the state of Israel okay this is how an interview Works FLIR I ask you question why don't you answer the question believe what's the point what's the point of you interviewing me when you don't believe my right to exist I've never said that of course and everything if you go back I'm asking you the question do you very easily I believe you have a right to ex exist and that is not up for discussion I've answered your question very simply and clearly I haven't danced around it by referencing School curriculum you've got to let me speak this is how an interview Works would you also say Human Rights Watch is wrong when they said in their statement of October the 9th Israeli authorities cutting off electricity to Gaza amounts to unlawful Collective punishments which is a war crime are they wrong well first of all what you have to ask yourself is why doesn't Hamas have its own electricity grid why has it been 21 years since we left Gaza of you're still not answering the question is it a war crime why don't Egypt help them out is it a war crime it's not a war crime all right what do you make of the United Nations special raur who said quote Israel has imposed upon Palestine an aparti reality in a post-apartheid world is has he lost his marbles well let's talk about what aarte actually is because I think this word is kind of thrown around willy-nilly and it actually I think think insults the South African so the doesn't know what system yes I I the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank are autonomous to 94% of the people living in the West Bank in 2005 Israel left the Gaza Strip in the Hope in the hope that the Palestinians would have an autonomous region that they could build into a state and instead of building saying to viewers the UN doesn't know what a into they built it no aparte means different rules in in the same country we're not the same country Gaza is no longer Israeli territory the West Bank is not not Israeli territory it's under the Palestinian Authority and the only reason we have Security Forces around area a and area B is to protect ourselves from the terrorist hubs that exist in the autonomous Palestinian Authority territory that's a fact and that's the truth so you're saying the UN doesn't know what aarth this FLIR perhaps I could read to you what Amnesty International has said let let me okay let hang on let me finish the question October the 7th Amnesty International says that Israel has a horrific track record of committing war crimes the root causes of these repeated cycles of violence must be addressed it references the illegal 16-year illegal blockade on Gaza and quote all other aspects of Israel's system of apartheid imposed on Palestinians do you think that the apartheid the occupation The Siege there's no aparte stop throwing around a word that is inaccurate aparte is a specific word for for black and white people it's not an accurate It's a lazy term and you can ask a South African who lived through aparte whether he thinks what we have here as a part let me tell you what we have here 20% of the population of the state of Israel are Arab Israelis full citizens ask them if they live in an aparte State they don't what we then have is a Palestinian Authority that wanted to be autonomous that is in charge of 94% of its people that of course don't govern very well are extremely corrupt and then you have Gaza where we haven't been since 2005 with a genocidal terrorist regime they could have built Dubai they built Beirut that's what happened in Gaza and it's a shame for the people of Gaza and they're the porns not just of Hamas they're the porns of Iran and that's the tragedy here okay so we're going to end it there of course you still haven't answered the question of whether you condemn you're willing to condemn the Israeli strikes that are killing Israeli children but unfortunately we're going to have to leave it there we'll leave it for viewers we'll leave it for viewers to decide thank you very much for Hass n
