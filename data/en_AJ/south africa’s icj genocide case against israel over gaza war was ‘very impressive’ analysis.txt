uh let's join Thomas mcmanis director of international State Crime initiative at Queen Mary University joins us from London thank you for being so patient I know it's been a very long process this morning and and we've been dipping in and out of your uh comments as we've gone I wouldn't mind getting an overview of how you think the South Africans have presented their case in terms of How It's been very finely divided and presented peace meal not just for the court I think but also for the international audience yeah I think that's right that the the the lawyers are thinking about the court um and and they speak to the court but they're also thinking about who's watching and and and their presentation was frankly very impressive they they set out in a very concise way um some devastating uh accusations and and put strung together in such a uh a legally sound way uh an understandable way and also trying to make you know some predictions about what might come back tomorrow as a rebuttal um and the way they set it out with the conduct and then the intent those are the two elements of a criminal case and then going on to talk about jurisdiction the link between the rights under protection and the um the the measures required but also then going into the urgency and and that was one of the most devastating I think for Israel's point of you part of the presentation laying out why this is urgent why this needs to happen now these measures indeed um lawyer after lawyer had a particular part of the argument of the petition to present um and I was just wondering of those I mean initially adilla Hashim set the scene did she not when she just really told the court why they were here and what the main issues were behind the petition and and why it needed to be presented in this way by so many lawyers within their band yeah and and every lawyer had a very distinct um issue that they were dealing with so we saw first the conduct um where we have um and and interestingly looking at the conduct we only saw quotes from un uh off agencies and un officers you have to remember the international court of justice is a un body not like the IC which is independent of the United Nations so they're using only the evidence of the're basically you know reflecting back onto the court evidence of their own agencies their own officers um and then moving on to intent which in uh with genocide is usually the most difficult uh part to prove um but it has been made easy by the Declarations by members of the Israeli State um and not just you know talking about the intentions that we've seen from pronunciations and the rhetoric from the Israeli government but trying to link that to the behavior of soldiers on the ground this again is to preempt any rebuttal that might come tomorrow that say that you know there's no link between the idf's behavior and what might be said by government officials but we see the case when South Africa sets out how that actually they are intrinsically linked um and moving away from the conduct where we had the un uh being quoted we moved on to the intent where we have the the state of Israel being quoted and then we look at the foot soldiers looking at the videos and things and linking those twos together in a in a very succinct and um um a very impressive way one thing that was um quite evident was the way in the presentation the lawyers tried to separate the comments made by politicians and by the military in Israel to what is expected of a sovereign state when it comes to protecting the public and also recognizing the road leading to genocide and the checks and balances that need to be made before you get to the GW uh and yet many who are criticizing Israel right now are saying well in fact both of those angles have merged together it is the state making those comments so how can it stop itself yeah um and and that is you know an interesting question how are we going to get a state that denies the genocide is happening to stop the behavior which is genocidal in itself um but the the South African case lays out quite clearly how the pronouncements by members of the government creates this kind of policy uh that can be inferred by anybody else on the ground and by their own military that they've created an atmosphere and created a kind of a uh an environment in which those troops Now understand that it is government policy to destroy Gaza and and linking those two things together is shows the the genocidal intent uh and is going to be very difficult for Israel to say that that's not at least a plausible conclusion where of course are not at the Merit stage yet so we don't need to look at any evidence but to to to to argue that it's not plausible that these these this incitement of genocide which is not being punished by the Israeli state which is another uh element of genocide U to argue that this is not plausibly genocide is going to be extremely difficult one of the things that we did hear from Professor vau low was the argument around the debate that has happened over the last three months of Israel continually saying we are acting in self-defense that was completely you might say the the the rug was pulled from underneath the feet of that argument when you were an occupying State you have you don't have that right that's right you don't have that right now there there there might be some uh scope for arguing that Israel is no longer occupying that they they have withdrawn and are and are sieging instead but but that is something that you know on the face of it doesn't seem to be the truth of the case and and the the lawyer quoted the security Council which said that is certainly not the case but that is one of Israel's only kind of few legal arguments that they can make that they can say listen the the obligations under the genocide convention can't interfere with their obligation to self-defense but as you say that's a very weak argument at the moment self-defense is designed to defend yourself against other states not to defend yourself against your own territory so it's going to be very hard to argue that um the other argument they could make is maybe that there they have no genuine dispute with South Africa on this issue again the scope the scope for the the court is quite wide what are they understand as the dispute and simply saying that you think genocide has been carried out and Israel responding that it isn't uh is enough to establish a dispute so what they're left with then I think what we're going to see is Israel speaking to the world and trying to use graphic images trying to use videos to to blame the victim basically uh what Stanley con the great sociologist criminologist would call uh denial of the victim saying listen we're actually the victim uh we're the ones under attack and whatever we do is Justified um and that has no legal weight but but they want they want to speak to the world while they have this platform Thomas mcmanis the director of Queen Mary's University in London thanks very much for joining us
