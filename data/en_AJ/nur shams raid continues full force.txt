in the occupied West Bank the Israeli military is conducting a raid for a second day at least five people have been killed in the operation in the city of tul and mass arrests have been made at the Nur Shams refugee camp Israeli forces also raided several homes and used bulldozers to destroy home shops and other critical facilities n Ibrahim is our correspondent life for us in TM in the occupied uh West Bank and we've been keeping a very close eye on this Israeli military operation Nida it's day two and there seems to be no sign that it's about to end yes it's hard for Palestinians to even know when the Israeli forces are going to leave the refugee camp specifically that some people expected after the news emerged of the killing of one Palestinian who has been deemed as one of the most wanted here in the occupied West Bank as the head of the T Kim Battalion from this is like the armed group of Palestinian men fighting the Israeli occupation they thought maybe the Israeli uh raid will come to an end but as we've been hearing now it doesn't seem to be ending because we're not only hearing a sounds from the Israeli drone but also of bombs we're hearing from the Battalion in tarim they just released a statement saying that they will continue be engaging in armed confrontations with the Israeli forces because of the situation and how risky it is it's hard for us to go inside and for much of the media but we're seeing videos of Destruction that is looking like something we have not seen before and we've seen already a lot in to Karim and in N Shams refugee camps in terms of how much the Israeli forces are damaging the infrastructure so we are looking at a very large destruction and demolition I'm just going to move away from the picture to show you a little bit the refugee camp it's crowded did it has thousands and thousands of Palestinians who have been saying that the Israeli forces were going from one home to another this is something we've seen before also these Mass detentions of Palestinians homes being turned into detention centers uh they would be evicted out of the residents when the Israeli forces arrive they would stay there and sometimes they would do what we've been seeing a lot of lately which is like the field interrogations of Palestinians so anyone who lives in that refugee camp is enduring a lot and could be subjected to uh beating up arrests and already when we were reporting about the torture and the beating up in the occupied West Bank we've seen that in those large and long raids we see the Israeli forces going from one house to another in one incident one of the witnesses was telling us that the Israeli forces were torturing him asking him what he knows who he knows in the refugee camp so it's seen here as time of like as a way of intimidating Palestinians to get information out of them sometimes they this information simply does not exist with those people who are being tortured and arrested indeed it's an ongoing situation of course we'll join you through the day need there for us in to crme
