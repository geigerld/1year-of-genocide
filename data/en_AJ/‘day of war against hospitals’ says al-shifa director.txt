you for your time after the multiple strikes that have taken place on your hospital we've been hearing that snipers are also nearby what is the situation like there now and how is everyone holding there is no doubt this is yet another bloody day in the north of Gaza Strip today is can be called war on hospitals starting by a Rashid pediatric pediatric hospital then R hospital this morning our hospital was shed on the yard then the Outpatient Clinic after that deliver W was sh dozens of patients let alone victims were killed this is nothing but tragic catastrophe we cannot find a single bed to place victims on we cannot even find an another W to accommodate the victims people are dying between our hands and we cannot do anything Al Hospital the hospital we are head even the people who are taking Refuge within the hospitals complex where sheld we are now taking difficult decisions to compare between who to save and who to let die so at the Outpatient Clinic we we were forced to put patients and victims in this morning we received more than 40 cases with critical conditions as we speak the Israeli war planes are hovering of over our heads leadless to say we are totally out of medical supplies viels as I speak to you I'm standing in front of 100 dead bodies 100 dead bodies I cannot do anything and we cannot even bury our dead the situation in and around the hospital is catastrophe this is unprecedented in our history this is unprecedented following the shelling of the Baptist Hospital the whole world must have acted against the Israeli atrocities now other hospitals followed as we speak we are expecting the Israeli war planes May pound the hospital to commit yet another foolish act as we speak we are being threatened receiving warnings to evacuate but we cannot we cannot do anything to our patients let alone the incubators where dozens of baby borns are taking treatment I have to ask you because as you know I know the conditions there are are terrible and you're having to make impossible impossible decisions Israel is saying that they are targeting alifa because Hamas is using the space under the hospital as its command and Control Center and they've been showing satellite images which they claim are proof what is your answer to that this is false these are utter lies this is a civilian hospital we are catering to more than 1.5 million gazin the Israeli for occupation forces are fully aware that this is a totally safe area they are certain that there is no command centers or any tunnels underneath this hospitals we have more than 250 medical volunteers on from all over the world with different nationalities waiting on RAF Crossing to come and lend a helping hand if they know that this is a command center for Hamas they wouldn't have come here onor staff un staff uh International Organization staff have been in and around the hospital and they know for sure that this is a totally civilian Hospital catering to the victims and patients catering to more than 2 million people all across Gaza in addition to that more than uh two weeks ago we took the representatives of the media from all over the world in a tour in and around and under the hospital to prove that the Israelis are propagating mere lies false groundless allegations this is a totally civilian Hospital catering to patients and the victims the Israeli occupation forces are indiscriminately shelling our people they are turning they have turned the Blind Eye to the international law human rights law and continue to commit atrocities to to reiterate what you're saying so it's very very clear you are saying that Hamas is not using any part of alifa the hospital or the compound in or under the hospital for military purposes you've been very very clear about that I want to ask you because we we heard from the Gaza Health Ministry just yesterday that you were 36 hours away from having to stop critical Services what is the state of critical Services there now at the hospital this is what we reiterate today we are have only four section four units operating the Intensive Care Unit the incubator operation theater and dialysis these WS cannot function without electricity the remaining parts of the hospitals including the out patients clinics and all other wordss are now out of service out of operation we are in a dire need for fuel we need to continue to operate the generator in order to be able to keep these critical units functioning by no means we cannot save those lives thousands of patients and victims their their lives are hanging by a thread we need fuel we need to continue to operate the gener this is a war crime this is a war crime we do not know how long we can last we may endure for a couple of hours but after that it will be nothing but a catastrophe we call on all the parties to have a ceasefire established we lost more than 12,000 killed and 20,000 injured isn't it enough isn't this enough how long still have die for the war to stop Dr Dr Muhammad Abu Sal there the director of alifa Hospital thank you so much for joining us here on alzero we wish you and all of your staff all the best with your work well more is coming up
