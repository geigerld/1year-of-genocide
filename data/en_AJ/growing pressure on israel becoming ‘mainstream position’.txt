Let's uh discuss now all these developments with Hassan barari professor of international Affairs at qat University here in Doha good to have you with us again uh Hassan on aler let's start with this pressure coming from all sides on on Israel to increase Aid into Gaza for accountability of the killing of the world Central Kitchen staffers we've had this letter from congressional Democrats uh who are calling for uh a suspension of Aid uh of military aid transfer to Israel also in the UK growing calls for uh the suspension of arm sales to Israel do you think this pressure is genuine and and will these Western countries actually change their policy towards Israel if uh Israel doesn't change the conduct its conduct on the ground in Gaza oh well thanks F I think it is genuine pressure these days and given what Israel has been doing but at the same time we have to remember that the International Community has been complicit with all these Israeli massacres and genocide war against the gazan uh so by actually keep uh keep repeating the manra that Israel has the right to selfdefense Israel has been killing everyone including those workers so I mean those workers actually are are the the victims of the kind of the International Community complicit with Israeli policies this is one point second one uh there's a change in in American scene these days uh you know when Nazi poosi sign this letter uh she's not like left leaning U politicians in the Democratic party which mean that probably uh uh the whole political party is Democratic party is moving a little bit into uh adopting this position so it has become a a mainstream position it's not only left leaning uh uh groups in in the party so uh Mr Biden needs to take this into account simply because he's going to election in in a few months to come uh and another another development is the International Community now is saying out loud that they don't trust whatever Nan is going to do so all these investigation they prop into the uh into the accident will not be taken seriously as lacking credibility and transparency uh so they know that Netanyahu is not listening to to anyone particularly the American you know they tell him you know you need to do this and you need to do that you need to have to take care you need to take care of the humanitarian crisis uh and he's he's just not listening he's continue uh he continues doing what is it going to take you think to to make him listen I think what they wrote in the letter is very important that if they condition uh supplying Israel with weapons munition and uh with with its behavior in the Battleground I think this is the only thing that would probably push Nan to uh uh to change course H NATO understand only the cost benefit and formula uh so if he hears all people criticizing him and no one is uh uh placing a price tag in his policies he he will not he will not change yeah we have also uh today the CIA director William Burns uh reportedly heading back to Cairo along with the heads of mosad and shinb uh negotiators from Qatar uh Egypt to engage in another round of of ceasefire talks uh do you see any movement on that front with everything that's happened this week do you think it'll put more pressure on both sides not just the Israelis but also Hamas because we've heard Biden say that uh Hamas also needs to uh agree to the terms of the ceasefire is there more urgency now for for this to happen I think I think so I think I mean the first impression I would say same all same all because every time they meet they talk about you know changing position but they continue business as usual and then at the end of the day they don't sign a deal uh uh now there is an international pressure in particular from the United States on both Sid as you said correctly uh he asked the mediators the Egyptians and the qataris to put a lot of pressures in Hamas and he himself he talked to and he said there should be a need for ceasefire in order to allow for humanitarian Aid so the whole conflict now has become into a humanitarian crisis that everyone wants to solve yeah regardless of what Israel is talking about it's right to self defense and and the need to dismantle Hamas and they need to release the hostages no one is talking about these things now everyone everyone sees Gaz as on the brink of of a real real catastrophe yeah and everyone is also concerned about another front opening up with the fears that Iran will retaliate uh after the strike on its Consulate in Damascus earlier the week fears in Israel itself which has raised its alert level um the Iranians until now have manage to distance themselves from this conflict how do you think they might respond because they have to respond right how what will be the extent of the response well both both sides have been into a kind of a war between Wars I mean they targeting each other they using Proxes I mean the Iranians have been using andah in order to harass Israel and in order to annoy Israel they've been doing this even before October 7th I mean with hasah h the question here is that this is the first time that the Israelis attack a directly an Iranian uh I would say diplomatic premises and the Iranian leaders understand that they need to retaliate because if they fail to do that and this will POS a different questions for them they will have hard time to answer internally uh I really can't predict what they're going to do but if there should be an Iranian retaliation maybe it takes uh the proess to do something but this will not satisfy the Iranian the the public and I think in this time they will look for a target maybe they will uh uh Target Israel inside Israel okay Hassan always get good to get your analysis on the situation uh in Gaza and elsewhere thank you very much Hassan barari professor of international relations at Qatar University
