as Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza violence against Palestinians in the West Bank is escalating human rights groups say that settlers and military forces alike are using the cover of this war to step up their ongoing campaign of brutal attacks on Palestinian communities Israel is conducting raids and air strikes and what it says are attempts to root out possible militant groups as the territory buckles under military lockdown with us to discuss the situation in the West Bank is the Palestinian authorities ambassador to the United Kingdom husam zlet husam thank you for joining us on up front hello mark thank you for having me and good to see you absolutely uh violence towards Palestinians in the West Bank has surged since hamas's attack escalating what was already the deadliest year since the United Nations began tracking in 2005 uh settlers and Israeli forces have killed at least 155 Palestinians including 41 children they've also injured more than 2,200 more Israeli forces are carrying out raids and air strikes and have placed the West Bank under a military lockdown which makes it extremely difficult for residents to leave their cities and their towns uh help me understand a little bit more about what's going on on the ground well what is going on on the ground has been going on for a long time Mark you've seen the um expansion of this illegal Colonial settlements uh you have seen the checkpoints the walls the infrastructure built uh to allow these colonial cities now to actually be connected to Israel uh and encycle the uh the main Urban centers of the Palestinian people and now we are faced with a very organized settler militias who have been on the Rampage over the last uh couple of years but particularly uh since the aggression on Gaza began they took that not only from a militia point of view but from a political point of view because they have their masters and their masters are senior ministers in the government you know this Government is made of several illegal settlers including smotrich and Bing and nanyu himself as the big backer of the settlement exercise the world has seen Bing who is a con convicted terrorist in an Israeli Court not even in an international Court handing machine guns over the last few weeks since the war on Gaza began uh to settlers and to civilians and the results is what you just described uh uh a huge number unprecedented uh murders and killing of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank attacks all over Villages uh uh uh programs in every sense setting far on homes shops cars uh in including their shaff only a few days ago and many other uh towns and Villages around the West Bank and the and the plan is very clear the plan is to uh terrorize the population and to uh uh continue what they have begun in 1948 and here the link between the West Bank and Gaza and here is the mistake of anyone to discuss Gaza uh in isolation of the West Bank and the West Bank including of course Jerusalem in isolation of Gaza and let me just confirm that what Israel is doing now in Gaza Mark is a rerun of the 1948 nakba events are you worried that this could get even worse I mean according according to the UN daily settler taxs in the West Bank have doubled in the weeks following the October 7th uh events uh Ultra National settlers in the West Bank have driven out entire Villages they've killed at least eight Palestinians and human rights organizations are warning that the focus on Gaza is being used as a kind of pretext to drive people out of their Villages as you pointed out very similar to the neba of 1948 in fact people have received Arabic language leaflets that warn uh Palestinians that quote this is their last chance to flee to Jordan before quote we forcefully expel you from our holy lands saying you wanted a NECA like in 194 48 and we will bring down on you a big catastrophe soon this seems potentially worse than anything we've seen since 1948 is that an overstatement no it is not but the only thing that I would add it's not they're using Gaza to gas light or deflate no no they are just doing the same in the West Bank and Gaza the very same plan they're pushing the very same people the Palestinian people and since the very beginning uh of of the aggression we have been saying and warning everybody this isn't a war on Hamas this is war on the Palestinian people this is to finish off the unfinished business what they have been describing and today we have militias in the West Bank Distributing leaflets spreading fear attacking communities in the hope that these communities will have to be forced out of their homes and then the hope that these settlers illegally living in the occupied territory will actually take over their homes as and physically live in their homes as they did in 1948 so why is Israel doing this it is definitely to terrorize the entire nation the whole people of Gaza pushed them out towards Sinai H one of the ways that the Palestinian people now uh are supported in their efforts to resist is through the Palestinian Authority the PA's president Mahmud Abbas said that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people but there are many Palestinians as you know who are unhappy with President abas one Palestinian asked where are they when we need them when settlers attack Us in the fields on the roads earlier this year just 19% said they trusted fet and the majority said that the PA should actually be dissolved given the high level of mistrust and the fact that the PA has not had a presidential election since 2005 should the PA or should the PLO be the representative of all Palestinian people is it fair to say that you're the representative of all the Palestinian people you have to number one president Abbas is elected by his movement that is fat that was founded by him and and the late president Yas Arafat and many of their colleagues that's the national movement that has really turned us from refugees to Freedom Fighters snatched the recognition from the entire world when we were absolutely disappearing after the neba of 48 and enforce that Palestinians have one voice one flag one address one representation now this is a must this is the biggest achievement of the palan people that we have one voice and we will not allow anybody to undermine that this is different than individuals and personalities we there are many nations who have absolutely vanished from Earth because they were leaderless because they had no National institutions to represent them and don't let me start here listing you how many people history is full of people who have completely been enh heled so the most important thing that we speak in one voice yes there are concerns there are demands when we need to reform we need to to bring our representation to the most democratic values and standards that's all understood and we must do that however don't throw the baby with the bathtub the PLO remains there as the umbrella for every Palestinian organization and you know this is about making sure that at least you uh enable your people to stay and and and and steadfast however the issue of who lead the Palestinian people is a Palestinian Palestinian issue many of the Palestinian people are saying they're dissatisfied with the PA they're saying they want it to dissolve they're saying they don't trust fat obvious obvious obvious obviously they don't trust H either but but they're saying we don't trust things I mean I my question to you is only how strong can a mandate be if many people are saying hey we have skepticism we have distrust we want to change you know I've seen the I've seen the opinion polls about Netanyahu in Israel in the last few days I've seen the polls about Biden and he has scored the lowest among even his own his own party so this is not the discussion the Palestinian people are under the most horrific attack since 1948 and this is not now about Palestinian Palestinian differences this is about Palestinian Palestinian Unity we are united by our oppression by the fact of our oppression and we are united by a goal to liberate ourselves and get rid of this occupation we are united as a people and we do have a political system that represent all of us and Palestinians are united and we have an address and this address has committed to International consensus and resolutions for 30 years and this address has even recognized Israel 30 years ago and this address is uh committing to nonviolence and negotiations and this address is ready but once there is enough commit sufficient commitment uh that this is the the the the way forward however if this address believes that this is not possible that this is not on the card I believe you the PLO I I tell you the PLO has now a very important Crossroad Crossroad Crossroad we are at a fork to decide our next move how do we protect our people how do we protect part of part of his protecting people H and part of his protecting Gaza the reason why I was asking about leadership partly is because there's been a lot of speculation about who would govern Gaza if Hamas were defeated the US of course has been pushing for the PA to take on a leadership role uh it seems unlikely that Israel wants to hand over control to anybody much less the pa uh on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would control The Enclave for an indefinite period taking on quote the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it what some fear is that the Gaza Strip is going to be reoccupied and partly how it's going to be reoccupied is by people pointing to an ostensible leadership Gap what do you make of that you know many many say the day after and Israel is waiting who's going to take over who's going to control number number one no one should control no one can control only the one entity that can be in Gaza is an entity that can provide protection for its people not control of its people that's number one number two Israel is not interested in the Palestinian Authority coming back to Gaza I assure you 100% they are not interested you know why because they know the coming back of the national institutions would actually bring back to the four the state of Palestine the unity of the of the land the unity of the People Israel has been so adamant in maintaining the Palestinian Division and should I list to you examples Mark you know the examples over the last few years you know what netan has been doing to maintain the division this is not the time to talk about it this is the the time to say that all this talk all this discussion about the day after is used to create schisms and to create tension in Palestine among Palestinians we don't need it only only the state of Palestine can take over we have learned the lesson of Oslo first come the end of occupation including Gaza because Gaza has been under occupation since Oslo and since 16 years ago Israel just removed itself but controlled every single aspect of the people of Gaza their movement their drinking water their electricity and you know the rest the L and therefore this is a time when we focus on bringing a momentum to end Israel's occupation and then the Palestinian people have their institutions the Palestinian people have their state the Palestinian people have their legitimacy it's only the US and the UK and the West who has not come along that legitimacy and who would want to find partial solutions they have no partners for that they will not have a partner for that ham zlet thank you so much for joining us in up front all right everyone that is our show up front we'll be back next [Music]
