joining us here is in the studio is tamama kamut uh professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies thanks again for joining us let's just stick with Jake Sullivan's trip to to the region uh to begin with I mean the Americans have uh reiterated that they want Israel to lower the intensity of its war in Gaza but Israel has pushed back time and time again saying they're going to continue until they have quote This n netanyahu's quote absolute Victory it doesn't appear at this stage no matter what the US says that Israel is going to listen they're going to continue doing whatever they want is that how you see it yes Tom I mean obviously both Israel and the US are still United over the same goal which is toppling down Hamas um and that's a that's a big goal to achieve I mean in my perspective it's it's unrealistic goal I mean let's just imagine the scenario I mean militarily of course I mean Israel has the upper hand I mean it will it will take more time you know the the military conduct of is is might be softer in the next coming month but eventually they could end Hamas military but still Hamas is an idea Hamas is a political ideology so let's assume let's just assume this happens and a reformed PA takes over the Gaza Strip and then of course the US is the guardian of democracy in the world correct and then Palestinians organize uh elections again and Hamas wins I mean according to many reports I mean Hamas popularity in the West Bank is the PO was out yesterday show it's increasing in Gaza and in the occupied West so again what's going to happen next I mean if we see another Hamas coming back again through the elections door what they're going to do next so the question here is again the US is uh has helped Israel to commit to an unrealistic goal which is the eradication of Hamas instead of opening a political path for Israel to to engage with Hamas and by this I mean there is no way to bring peace to Palestine if a major political party like Hamas is not engaged with politically and the US instead of supporting Israel to commit to this unrealistic goal it should help Israel to get down the tree also help Hamas also to get involved in a political process by removing the veto in Hamas and labeling it as a terrorist organization The veto on Hamas over the Palestinian reconciliation meaning allow pales reconciliation to materialize and then you will have two legit solid Partners this should be the approach the US uh be advocating for instead of siding by Israel and helping Israel with with this unrealistic crazy plan I would say well Jake Sullivan is due to meet uh president Israeli president Herzog uh in the next few hours I mean they they're obviously going to be talking about some sort of political solution but that is seeming unlikely at this point in time because even the president is now pushing back against any idea of a two-state solution the the entire Israel political mainstream I mean it's they're pushing I mean I mean I mean not even pushing against this I mean now they say that o was a mistake so then then this brings us where to Nowhere exactly so then you have the US the International Community committed to creating a Palestinian State a free independent Palestinian state that lives in peace side by side to Israel but they're not doing anything when it comes to real mechanisms to influencing Israel pressuring Israel to engage in peace to for this to happen and that's the problem it's they just they're going around and around but the elephant in the room is you have a an Israeli rejection that is coming from a right-wing fanatic religious government that is not willing to engage even with Oso now they want to diminish Oso to kill Oso even and reoccupy Palestinian territories so it's it's it's it's it's the ugly truth now coming very blunt in the face of the Americans the International Community and sadly they have engaged with this they have created this this this this this status quo because they have engaged with Israeli policies that have avoided peace that you know have not have not committed to any any peace commitments so so the US is is I mean it's in a difficult position and I at the same time it's an elections year in the US yes and I'm aware that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are willing to take a risk to antagonize Israel so big questions and big decisions to come I guess on that point though President Biden will want this to be wrapped up as we've heard as soon as possible so that they can basically shift this issue in the United States to one side and focus on domestic issues is that is that basically the main reason that we've been hearing more and more that this war uh needs to end from from the US point of view yeah I think there are two things here I mean the US is is embarrassed by by the conduct of this war and the crazy way Israel has conducted this war you know inhumanely and there is a growing public pressure of course uh they're losing Arab American voters I mean the risk is Chicago is probably off the hook now so yes they're playing into this now so it's damage control now and containment that's the US position okay thank you so much T we really do appreciate your time we'll talk to you out throughout talk to you again throughout the day here pleas
