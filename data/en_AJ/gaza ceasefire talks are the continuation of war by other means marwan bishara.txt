well Maran Bashar is Al jaaz senior political analyst he joins us by Skype from Paris Maran is the purpose of these uh repeated rounds of talks more about maintaining the appearance of a process it was for many many months but by its nature uh Mariam negotiations are the continuation of War through diplomatic means by their very nature they are a continuation of War so whatever shapes the negotiations are the same factors that shape the war and whatever influences the war in terms of the humanitarian the balance of power or the imbalance of power the geography and so on so forth all of it influence the same thing diplomacy so what we see here is the continuation of War by other means and I think in a sense the question is will they reach a deal or not because this has been going on for six months now both the war and the negotiations the question is whether both parties understand and I'm here talking about both Israel and Hamas if both parties understand that they cannot achieve in diplomacy what they couldn't achieve in war in other words they're not going to the Israelis are not going to get the captives back free of charge and Hamas is not going to get Gaza free of Israeli CH soldiers free of charge I mean this is just the hard truth I'm not being you know in any which way soft or emotional about this I'm not in any which way trying to beautify this but this is exactly what it is everyone else who thinks otherwise is being delusional war is decided by power diplomacy is also decided through Power how are threats by Israel's adversaries uh Iran and Hezbollah to respond to recent developments affecting these talks this is this is absolutely the right question at the right time right so since diplomacy is the continuation of War by other means we have a whole new factor that entered the war sphere and that is a major Threat by two Regional Powers one could say Iran and hisbah in retaliation to a preemptive to a provocative act by the Israelis in the violation of Lebanese and Iranian sovereignty the threat of widening the war that is really bringing in the United unit States or drawing in the United States is definitely a factor in the negotiations for the Israelis it doesn't matter as much and I'm here Israelis I mean the Israeli government because they are crazy apocalyptical you know uh dangerous Reckless bunch of fascists and Fanatics for the United States it's different the United States after its own experience in Afghanistan and Iraq does not want to be drawn to another Regional War because of some uh you know Reckless politician in Israel decides that he wants a wider war and hence the United States is pushing for a deal because of the threat of war and I think that works in favor of a deal more than it doesn't but I suppose it may all it's probably likely to come to nothing as we have seen in uh previous rounds of talks if the main obstacle uh remains to be the the Israeli Prime Minister who is at odds with members of his own negotiating team that's through this has been the case for the past six months not only that he is at outs with his negotiations team is just he thinks a fire is not his interest or to the interest of his government because they thrive on war they thrive on war but let's not forget that they are totally dependent on the United States now the United States to be clear is not not a mediator only it's partner Israel's partner first mediator second and this mediator the United States has been indispensable for Israel's war Israel cannot survive in this Middle East this Israel cannot survive in this Middle East without the United States there's absolutely no more doubt about this whatsoever right so being so dependent in the United States and although it has not listened to the United States for so long when it comes to the end of the Biden presidency when it when it when it relates to Simply signing the damn deal that they could basically walk walk away from it after the first phase I think there is enough American pressure today it seems to me for Biden uh sorry for Netanyahu to be able to sign off on it he apparently has gotten guarantees from the United States that he could walk away after the first phase if he's not satisfied Hamas of course got contradictory guarantees that said we will definitely move on from the first phase to the second phase that's what a mediator like the United States tends to do and hence we could have a ceasefire agreement but that does not mean we can have long-term peace in Israel Palestine all right thank you for now Al jaer senior political anst Maran Bashar joining us there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
