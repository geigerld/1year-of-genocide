requested as the state of Palestine an emergency meeting of the league of Arab State at the level of foreign ministers in Cairo in the next few days regrettably history for some media and politicians start when Israelis are killed our people have endured one deadly year after another we came to the security Council month after month warning of the consequences of Israeli impunity and international inaction last October about a year ago we stated before the security Council the Palestinian people will be free one day or another one way or another we chose the peaceful way the one the International Community advocates for do not let Israel prove us wrong for our sake and theirs this is not a time to let Israel double down on its terrible choices this is a time to tell Israel it needs to change course that there is a path to peace where neither Palestinians nor isra Israelis are killed and it is the one theatrically opposed to the one Israel is embarked on Israel keeps saying the blockade and repeated assaults on Gaza are to destroy Hamas military capabilities and ensure security clearly and ex and expectedly its blockade and assaults accomplished neither the only thing they did accomplish was inflicting terrible suffering on an entire city civilian population it is time for an immediate end to the violence and the Bloodshed and it is time to end this blockade and to open a political Horizon when Israel now tries to justify yet another assault by the same faulty premise no one should say or do anything to encourage it down this path we know only too well that the messages about Israel's right to defend itself will be interpreted by Israel as Licensed to Kill to pursue on the very path that led us here 370 and the number is Rising by the moment of Palestinians that have been killed already in one day including children some barely a few months old entire families were killed in their sleep will this bring Security will this Advance pece where is the International protection the Palestinian people is entitled it l to when the occupying power violates international law and harms those it is obliged to protect aren Palestinians lives worth saving the Palestinian civilians killed the Palestinian children killed in occupied Palestine could have been spared isn't that a moral and legal obligation and a contribution into peace why nothing is done when those killed are Palestinians we need to think hard of what logic we want to see Prevail here if this is about vengeance then many Palestinians will feel they have much to avenge if this is about peace then the way to it is not through further entrenching oppression and occupation but by ending it you cannot say nothing justifies killing Israelis and then provide justification for killing Palestinians we are not subhumans let me repeat we are not subhumans we will never accept a rhetoric that then denigrates our humanity and reneges our rights a rhetoric that ignores the occupation of our land and oppression of our people there is no right to security that trumps the right of a Nation to self-determination the Fulfillment of our right to self-determination is the only path towards shared peace and security we chose the peaceful path to achieve our rights but Israel continued using blunt force against Palestinian lives and Palestinian rights Israel cannot wage a fullscale war on a nation its people its land its holy sites and expect peace in exchange one needs to address the root causes of the conflict and by doing so we will be addressing its consequences we have been calling for a different rationale a different approach Justice not Vengeance Freedom not occupation peace not war our calls should be heeded the alternative is playing out under our very eyes Israel has announced dozens of times that it had handled the Palestinian Problem by war against our people or peace with others since 1948 a few days ago in the statement of Netanyahu in front of the general assembly nanahu held during that speech in these United Nations a map denying the existence of Palestine a map of aggression and annexation to all the peacemakers to all those who believe in the UN Charter and international law one cannot lose sight of the bigger picture we need to stand up for the vision enshrined in the resolution of the security Council and the general assembly and to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with their Provisions we need to uphold international law not abandon it everybody in the room behind me who will be meeting in few minutes agree on the end end game Israel expects and demands political and Military Support while advancing goals that are fundamentally at odds with International legitimacy and consensus its policies are an assault on Humanity on international law on peace and are a threat for its own people can those supporting Israel ignore its colonialist and racist agenda that would be self-defeating a different path is possible I repeat a different path is possible but it cannot ignore the lives and rights of the Palestinian people it must guarantee them equal measures of freedom and security you cannot stand for peace if you do not stand up to occupation do it because it is the right thing to do morally legally politically and because it will save lives peace will save lives because it is the only way forward I thank you very much we have copies for those who are interested to give it to you thank you that was the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations speaking ahead of a security Council emergency meeting let's bring in sheab branzi who's covering developments for us at the UN sheab Riad Mansour had a calm but strong message calling for an end to the blockade what more did he say and of course his comments come ahead of that emergency meeting and one hour after the the Israeli ambassador to the UN spoke at the same spot but this is a very different message this was a statement rooted in the historical context in the context of international law and the context of un Security Council resolutions UN General Assembly resolutions and what he said were repeated warnings at the UN Security Council that Palestinians in his words would would be will be free one way or another Mansour there though still saying there is a way to peace that the the Palestinian people will be free one way or another but there is still the time for Israel to change course there is a path open to peace but he also that asked the International Community of which clearly the UN Security Council is representative where is the protection of the Palestinian people are entitled to when an occupying power is abusing them we are not subhumans he said and then he repeated that but he said look this is not the time for vengeance this is the time to uphold international law not abandon it now an hour ago we heard from the Israeli Ambassador who said that this current operation was Israel's 911 and from now on nothing will be as it was then he said and this is quite quite interesting in the context of wondering what Israel may do next every inch of Gaza has become part of the Hamas War Machine Israel will exact a heavy price on Hamas so clearly when we're talking about vengeance and when we're talking about international law international humanitarian law the Geneva conventions these are rather concerning concerning statements when it comes to proportionality but both both the Israeli and the Palestinian representatives of the UN speaking ahead of that un security council meeting which is supposed to begin in about 10 minutes 10 minutes time she had just on that security council meeting what if anything are we expecting to come out of that in terms of a deescalation we can only sort of try and do the sort of kremlinology the UN context of that which is okay well what exactly is happening in 10 minutes initially this was supposed to be a private meeting meeting of the UN Security Council so that is actually a formal meeting of the UN Security Council behind closed doors but which the Israeli and Palestinian Representatives could could participate in that was then changed apparently at the request of some members of the UN Security Council to closed consultations so that's not a formal meeting of the UN Security Council and only members of the UN Security Council can attend and we expect them to be briefed by the current special coordinator for the UN for the Middle East peace break process toward wesland so I guess what we think is going to happen here is this really is a briefing this isn't going to be the grand standing that we might see in a public meeting and this isn't going to involve the Israeli and Palestinian Representatives even but this is going to be I I this is what we we we we're gleaning this is what's going to be the un's perspective on what's Happening and the realities on the ground right now from which then I think we can expect the UN Security Council to act we've been checking we haven't seen any formal statements or any dve statements being circulated amongst members for consideration so we do seem to be at a very early stage of the UN security council's deliberative process okay thanks so much and we'll cross back to you throughout the evening with an update sheab ranzi at the United Nations Let's cross to rala now where Imran Khan is standing by for us with some developing news Imran tensions are high tonight what's the latest on the ground in rala well as you heard rman saw there talking he said as I'm speaking to you uh Palestinians are dying as he was speaking two Palestinians were actually killed in kandia checkpoints uh the Israelis use live fire at kandia kandia is the main Crossing between ramala into uh Jerusalem uh there were some minor protests going on the Israelis actually used live fire and two people were uh actually killed in the last 20 minutes I heard ambulances raced down to Candia it's really not that far away from where I'm standing right right now that comes about an hour earlier in Jericho another Palestinian was killed uh he was killed uh by live fire his body's already actually been buried and there's been a fourth in Hebron these all been happening as the UN Security Council is about to meet as the Israeli uh representative to the United Nations was talking and as riedman saw was actually speaking himself this is a very serious uh development within the occupied West Bank the occupied West Bank I'll just recap very quickly has been out on strike uh in support of Hamas people have been protesting here in rala across the occupied West Bank but the Israelis have been using life fire on some of those protesters so clearly uh the Israelis are trying to keep a lid on events in the in the West Bank but what they're doing effectively by killing these people is inflaming tensions further also within the occupied West Bank they've actually stopped Palestinians moving from one place to another you can't can't get from Bethlehem for example to rala uh you can't get from Janine you can't get outside of Hebron the Israelis have got a very heavy security uh presence here but it's this use of live fire against unarmed protesters that's now incredibly concerning within the occupied West Bank and you've been painting a picture of romala this evening what's it like there in terms of public um public people being on the streets for example or people in their homes what are you hearing anecdotally well I'm just hearing the same thing in different ways but the literally the same thing from most people I've spoken to and it says that yes we are surprised by what happened but we're not surprised if you treat people like animals then you should not be surprised that they fight back and that is the real sense of what's going on here people are surprised by what's happened but they are sympathetic towards Hamas and what they're doing okay thank you so much for that update that that's Imran Khan in rala I want to bring in alzer's senior political analyst now Maran basawa who joins us live from Paris plenty of moving parts to this story tonight uh plenty of breaking news we've heard Israel's knesset has just declared the nation is officially at War we've also heard from the ambassador to the United Nations from the Palestinian Ambassador perspective and also from the Israeli perspective I'm not sure if you're able to listen to both both of those press conferences but certainly a a a STK contrast in the messages coming from both of them Maan oh yeah absolutely because uh uh you know this war has many fronts right and one of those fronts is the Diplomatic front and what you will see in the United Nations in the days and weeks to come is probably more of the same that we've seen in the many years uh before uh which is uh you know a a very conflicting uh uh messaging on on both parts uh while the Palestinians continue uh to underline the importance of the uh root causes of this issue the historic uh injustices that the Palestinians fa face Israelis continue to talk about security and to talk about themselves as victims of Israeli Terror uh about Palestinian Terror as it were uh but all in all uh what we have is diplomats trying to score points at this point right I mean while yes they try to make points as well because they are also speaking to an international audience trying to defend their causes but in this stage in time they are certainly trying uh to score points and just briefly before we let you go Maran where too from here we're seeing gaza's night sky being lit up with air strikes are we likely to see a heavy civilian death toll going forward on both sides absolutely I think Israel is bound to overreact there's going to be a disproportionate use of force and clearly the way it's bombarding from far it means there are going to be a huge civilian casualties among palesa no less uh because this is the so-called casualties of war is on the mind of prime minister Netanyahu who certainly wants the Palestinian to pay the price for what happened over the weekend okay we have to leave it there thank you so much for your time that's our political analyst Maran bashara in Paris
