we begin in southern Gaza where the Israeli military has carried out overnight attacks on the city of [Applause] Rafa at least 63 Palestinians have been killed multiple strikes targeted the vicinity of the Kuwait hospital and crowds of injured Palestinians including children have streamed into the overburdened facility and Israel's defense minister says two captives were rescued during the operation they've been identified as 60-year-old Fernando mman and 70-year-old Luis hard both have been flowing a hospital in Israel and the military says they're in good health I'm very happy to announce that this night two released hostages landed here at sheiba Medical Center Israel's largest hospital they were received inar ER and initial examination were conducted by our ER staff and they are in a stable condition and we intend to continue and follow them up for the coming uh days until we'll be for sure clear of their medical situation A corespondent hany Mahmud is joining us on the phone from Rafa now and hany over the past few hours our colleague tadic has been reporting on a significant increase in Israeli strikes on Rafa and also fighting around Rafa what can you tell us about what's happening there now yes uh overnight the attack seem to be only intensifying and uh with an increased uh intensity in the artillery shelling and it it seems like the is really military uh was using all of its uh military Arsenal with the exception of course of a nuclear power just to point that out but there were there were quad copters attack drones there were helicopters uh were fighter jets artillery Shilling tanks the all at once it started from Midnight as as the time as of now as a speak there's still sound of explosions uh from the eastern part of the uh city of Rafa as the northern part that's the Border area between Han un and and RAF City and the initial report that we're getting right now is overnight attacks targeted uh residential homes of the eastern part of the city there were Target of public facilities and infrastructure that uh including roads and made main routes and connecting commun with uh with the ra City all of this have been um mounting the pressure on people uh I can safely say that it was a Sleepless restless night for the vast majority uh of the the people in ra City here uh and still continuing to happen right now uh there is a dense presence of aack drone just making it very difficult for any possible a movement in or out presidential home there is a a state of panic and fear and for a lot of people this is the beginning for them this is probably the beginning of the offensive uh in in ra City the offensive of course that the Israeli military has been warning about for well over a week now they have been saying that they are going to advance their ground operation into Rafa and Hanny when you speak about you know the vast majority of people in in Rafa and how they're feeling it's really important to remind our viewers at this point that the vast majority of gaza's population is now in Rafa is in its Southernmost city on the border with Egypt yes that is accurate more than half of the Gaza Street population have been squeezed into this small part uh of the city I mean you can easily spot how densely populated become has R City become just a brief walk walking into uh the streets of raahan and and seeing the all the tents that have been set up on the sidewalks or on the little island in the middle of the road or evacuation centers managed and run by uh hona and all all all the empty pockets of lands here at the initial weeks of the war when uh we arrived here uh or when did some of the reporting the city was still relatively uh empty with the exception of course of the local that just within a span of two months the population went from 250,000 all the way to 1 a little over 1.7 million people uh here all crowded in in this small part the city doesn't have enough State doesn't have a proper infrastructure doesn't have necessities and Facilities to accommodate this large number of people but so far what we're looking at the pattern that's been created on the on the ground is not only displacement and the the fact that there are difficult living conditions that they have to experience on daily basis and what seem to be their new normal uh now is on top of this is the mounting the trauma of of the and the threats of the ground Invasion uh but they are left with no options and in terms of safety it's equivalent to non or very limited because no talks about a a possibility of providing a safety zone or safety parador and even if if there are talks about this there's still that terrible experience they had in the past with with safety zones designated by the isra military and its people ended up being killed in the very designated uh zones that the military told them to go to and right now there there is a huge explosion going on at the northern part of the city and I I can clearly hear it hany thank you very much for that that is our correspondent hany mahm joining us on the phone from Rafa with the very latest thank you Hy and the Israeli Army has been speaking about the military's actions in Rafa let's go to our correspondent Rory Chalin he's joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem and Rory as we were hearing from hany that increase in Israeli military action is very much continuing this is after Israel has got those two captives out of Gaza they have said that the way wave of Air Raids that they launched were to get the captives out yeah that's right and that's what's being reported uh in the Israeli media that the intense bombardment that uh Rafa had overnight was directly linked it was part of this rescue operation now we've heard from uh in a statement we've heard from the defense minister yav galance who has called this uh an impressive rescue operation he said I followed the operation closely with the Prime Minister and officials and we express our appreciation to the Army and shinb forces for the important operation this was a joint operation Army shinb that's the internal security agency intelligence Security Agency and Israeli police as well now what's being reported in Israeli media we can't independently verify this at the moment the pcture that we're getting is that the operation took about an hour uh and it happened happened at say 1 in the morning uh local time overnight that the uh captives were being held in a heavily guarded uh apartment building on the second floor of that building uh and that the operation had been planned for quite some time and it had been delayed numerous times before it was finally undertaken what are the takeaways from this well this is obviously a rare bit of good news for the Netanyahu government it highlights the difficulty of uh rescue operations to get those captives out this is only the second time that an operation of this sort has been carried out successfully uh so Netanyahu is likely to use this as uh further indication further proof that uh a proper ground operation in Rafa is necessary because these captures were found in in the Rafa area it it also I think uh shows the level of Destruction and death that the Israeli Army is willing to inflict on civilians in Gaza we've had 60 plus Dead uh in Rafa to get two hostages two captives out so that's another illustration of of that kind of mismatch that that balance of of death and Destruction for for Israeli lives and also I think it plays into this idea of of well where were these hostages is being kept the assumption is that most of them are being kept underground in in the tunnels but these two if we understand it correctly were found above ground in in an apartment building so that might influence this kind of the rumors that we're getting out of Israel at the moment are that many more of the captives are assumed to be dead than had initially been or officially been stated and that might these two might be linked it might well be because some of the captives are being held above ground rather than underground which means of course they're subjected to the same level of intense bombardment that the civilians of Gaza are being subjected to Rory thank you very much for that Rory challenge with the very latest live in occupied East Jerusalem
