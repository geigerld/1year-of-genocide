welcome to the program we begin with breaking news coming out of Gaza where an Israeli strike has killed more than 40 people and injured dozens of others the attack took place near the alaa hospital in the central part of the strip more than 150 others have been killed in the past 24 hours these are the latest pictures coming from the region and this is all despite Israel claiming it's scaling down its military operation of course seen of Devastation there just outside of the hospital uh Rescuers getting there as quickly as they possibly can to take the injured two nearby hospitals uh it's in incredibly confusing situation obviously and we'll try and uh get more to you uh as uh we can I think we can now join our correspondent TK Abu aom Tark I hope you can hear me we're showing our viewers shots of the most recent strike very close to the alaxa Mosk ala Hospital pardon me uh in Gaza the injured um being taken to hospital those buried under the rubble are trying to be rescued it's a pretty desperate situation that we're seeing here what more information are you getting about this particular incident yes uh the Israeli military in fact in the past hour had targeted a residential building that is only a few meters away from alaka hospital that is the main Central Hospital still operating in the middle governate of Gaza strip were thousands of Palestinians being killed and injured in that building as it was a center for evacu where different families were taking shelter inside uh alongside with their relatives uh to be away from the Israeli buming and this area had been multiply targeted throughout the military copters drones in that part of Gaza strep until this very moment the uh evacuation process to pull the victims from under the rles and the India people continue as it was a multiple store building while was hit and the in fact the al- AKA hospital had been widely uh threatened to to different kinds of Israeli fires uh since the expansion of the military operations uh in the middle goates of the territory now people are still right now uh trying to dig to search between the rles about the victims and the injured people and this is one of the uh main bloody attacks that had been carried out since the early hours of today's morning and we have been reporting in the past a few days that we are saying and keep trying to uh inform the the the world about that the these areas are witnessing mass destruction by the military as they are destroying residential houses that is full of evacu that are full of evacuees and alongside with the key infrastructure for residents that we have been seeing today a number of videos emerged for the gates and the entrance of anarat refugee camp in the same governate that had been also destroyed alongside with the main Lincoln Road which also imposed more threats and challenges es for ambulances to evacuate victims and to reach the locations of targeting of course T we're seeing these pictures the latest pictures uh from outside the hospital uh as local residents try to come to the aid of those that are caught in the middle of this latest Israeli strike over the last few days we also know that medical staff within the hospital from many Aid agencies have had to evacuate because either they haven't got the supplies to help people or because of safety concerns they too have had to leave it leaves the medical infrastructure desperately fragile in terms of personnel to be able to deal with the [Music] injuries yes uh literally we can say that the medical situation in Gaza still operating hospitals uh is completely uh dramatic and very dire very limited medical supplies being allowed to enter the territory uh since uh the last couple of days and also the hospitals that still operating in the areas of battles and confrontations including Al AKA hospital and nasar Hospital inhan unas have been also exposed to different kinds of military attacks on the vicinities of such areas also we are talking about these hospitals are overwhelmed with patients and injured people they are they are facing more PR that had been imposed it due to the increasing number of injuries that are arriving to the hospitals due to the expansion of the military attacks ACR Gaza and we personally we have been moving in in between these hospitals throughout the last couple of days and we have been seeing how medical staffs and workers are facing such an Ence pressure just to keep operating despite all the difficulties in terms of the affordability of the medical supplies some uh residents are forced to go to search for the treatment in the clinics just to to the to the due to the fact that the hospitals in these areas are receiving a very limited amount of medical supplies that cannot match the level of medical responsibility and also the medical care that that patients and injured people on a very desperate need for and today the director of the international Committee of the rep Crest had stated that the Gaza hospitals are facing very increased rate of of absence of medical supplies as long as they not able to carry out Advanced surgeries for injured people due to the absence of Necessities in terms of the affordability of the medical drugs and the medical equipments that could be suitable for carrying such operations so we can say that as the expansion of the military attacks on Gaza Strip continues the medical sector in the territory is getting much more worse day by day as there are still uh very few numbers of hospitals are still operating after 30 hospitals and at least 100 50 Medical Health Centers have become out of service due to the outscale uh destruction and attacks that had been carried out against since October the 7th TK our colleague hany Mahmud earlier in the day had also been to what was a makeshift uh medical facility a tented medical facility that was uh apparently being operated in a safe area its generators to the side of that hospital were targeted by the Israelis Also earlier in the day making the hospital inoperative It's a combination of these popup hospitals that are trying to help with the medical uh problems that uh Palestinians face when there aren't any hospitals working and then the worry of attacks as well yes uh this is uh definitely uh the reality for such hospitals that had been recently set up on different areas in the South just to help the Palestinian medical sector to be able to keep providing medical treatment for thousands of Palestinians who have been injured and they are also day by day full as injured uh and we can say that we are talking about Qatari hospitals amirati hospitals and American Hospital that recently had been established inside Gaza but these areas and these uh hospitals have been set up in areas that also witness expansion of the mil attacks by the Israeli forces and which also will put them on the scale of risk as they won't be able to fully and peacefully keep providing medical treatment for Palestinians being injured and this is a part of what the medical sector inside Gaza have been going through for more than 9 F days of fighting inside the territory but what we expect more that these hospitals must be protected at least but what we can see is that more more increase of of military attacks across Gaza Strip as they are as they are trying to embose the ultimate pressure on Palestinians to uh to keep fleeing more to R now this area we can say that now has been very overcrowded with residents as Medical Teams are miraculously trying to keep providing a treatment for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that are di that are varied between being patients and injured people and also a part of the spread of infectuous disease special among children and women and this is uh systematically happened by the Israeli forces which also exacerbate the medical conditions inside Gaza T abum thank you for those of you joining us here on Al jazer English the latest pictures you can see now full frame on your TV screens are coming from darl Balor and just outside of Al AXA hospital where a short time ago an Israeli strike seems to have hit a residential area and a commercial area you can see people running trying to get to the site to try and help those that might be injured other people are running away uh the injured are being taken either locally to the Alexa Hospital which is as TK said already uh overflowing with the injured Let's cross over to alzer's hindel kudri she was near uh the site of that particular uh attack near the alaxa hospital hind if you can hear me just talk us through what we know happened near you so an explosion erupted and it was not only one air strike there were three Israeli air strikes on a residential building in front of the entrance of ala hospital it's one of the gates of ala hospitals where there were a lot of ambulances a lot of people who were seeking uh Refuge with tents and not only that with people in the streets so it's a very busy street and people were terrified and it was very horrifying and all I remembered was when Al ala Hospital entrance was uh targeted in the past couple of months there were dozens of killing dozens of injured and and and the hospital was crowded it was a chaos you can't imagine the amount of blood I saw uh the amount of people that need help but there the hospital has been working on a very low capacity after a of people evacuated and the medical personnel as we reported in the past couple of days so can I just jump in there just for a second can I just clarify that it is a residential building close to the hospital that's been hit and the de brief from that residential building has fallen down into the area close to the hospital injuring people it's like the seet like it's the seet of the hospital and there was the FF guy who sell FF and he's very famous on the street who he was selling FF every single day was killed by a sharpman and we saw his blood covering the FF ingredients on the floor and on on the walls it was it it I I literally can't describe what I saw today it was it has been a very big loss for a lot of people all I saw is is people trying to rescue other people because as we said that the medic te were were not enough for all and the huge amount of injuries I saw babies being injured men women a lot of people because it's a normal street and it's a very busy street where it's it's it's an Hospital's entrance and we know how Hospital entrances are you have shops you have people H Crossing by every second and the people right now are are trying their best to see if there's someone under the rubble stck and they're trying to help the ambulances and the medical team uh to transfer the people who have been affected by the air strikes into the hospital but I went into the hospital and I went into the emergency department it's a complete chaos in terms of in terms of the facilities available to those arriving in accident and emergency what sort of help are they able to get I mean obviously we've been talking about the lack of medical facilities and the lack of medical St St how how under pressure is the hospital right now it's a chaos you can't imagine there's a lot of nursing teams and a lot of volunteers but the the main doctors are not are absent so can you imagine doctor like nurses and volunteers trying to help people with severe injuries uh the i unit was was pared with people uh the people who have been um affected by their lower limbs were were were were cousins and and and the amount of people who were trying also to clean the amount of blood because it was literally a river of blood on on on the ground uh of of the hospital seeing this it was not the first time I saw this and I witnessed this in ALA hospital and it's the exact exact same thing but the only different thing is the people killed and injured are different people and of course just stay with us for a moment h I'm just going to describe the pictures that we're seeing at the moment we're seeing individuals carrying the injured on any sort of either door or or taring or even with their bare hands to uh the emergency accident emergency center of the hospital there are wrecked cars with concrete on them there are people uh within the debris of that Main High Street that you've described outside of alaxa Hospital digging through the concrete and the rubble to try to get to those that may have survived or those that are injured uh desperate scenes as you've described them but these are scenes that are happening every day we just don't always get to see them so quickly after an Israeli strike and the panic and the worry that people have when these strikes happen there is fear that there could be another strike exactly we're talking about a hospital that not only is a hospital but it's also a house in a place where hundreds of people seek Refuge yes a lot of people evacuated in the past couple of days after the quad cter targeted the ICU and the maternity areas but there are still thousands of people who are still seeking shelter in the hospital with their tents uh a couple of steps away from where H uh the target was and we're talking about theal building where it has a lot of blocks and and cement blocks where uh literally flew on the sides of the hospital we also saw ambulances being damaged severely damaged and we know that there are lot of not a lot of ambulances in the Gaza Strip right now especially after dividing the north from the south um it's the Mount of Destruction is is massive like I have been asking the palestin Ministry of Health doctors can you please inform me how many uh people have been killed or injured they were like we could not even count them and this is an indicator of how much people were injured I remember a little girl telling me I saw people chattered with blood I saw these people and I saw I saw people were like normal people how would a three-year-old girl describe what happened all she all she said was I saw people scattered into pieces where a threee a a four or five year old girl saw people with like their bodies and and and I still don't forget the blood of the FF boy that everyone is famous and everyone knows him okay hind we will leave it for the moment uh thanks very much uh for that those of you joining us here on alaz of course these are the latest pictures coming from outside of the AL AXA Hospital in balala where the Israelis have hit a Target in the middle of the road it seems as you can see from those pictures complete chaos as uh local residents tried to get the injured to hospital let's bring in Mai director of Gulf studies at the center uh or at the center there at catle University good to have you with us sorry I'm getting Tongue Tied because we rarely get to see pictures like this it's absolutely shocking um so soon after an Israeli targeted hit um just want to get your impression of what you're seeing cuz I'm horrified we have um uh Israel have already committed more than uh 450 massacres and this attack maybe uh be number is more than 1,000 of those attacks maybe this one of those attacks we saw in the spots after maybe a few seconds but with the media limitation he created in Gaza with the the target policy that Israeli is is following on basically doing everything uh far away from cameras and microphones and the number of journalists who have already killed around more 115 that tells you that how much Israelis are worried of people seeing such an images and and pictures of course um what is what's ironic about this this happens less than 24 hours after blinkin was saying that Israel will be more careful when they attack about the civilians and that was today until now uh more than 40 people were killed in Gaza yesterday 126 people of Civilian were killed and the question is uh how much they want to kill so Israel is doing so-called smart operation or sergic operations that's a big question mark this happens unfortunately under the eye of International Community including the United States and such pictures will be beamed across the world but also another statement we have to remember that the Israelis have used from day one is they have a special military operation against Hamas they will have to justify where Hamas were when struck this location with all of these civilians all of these casualties all of these women and children people covered in dust people injured people under the rubble they are going to have to tell the world where Hamas were here right here right now they have to do it but unfortunately I have to say they used to lie and they insist on lying I mean just before I join you I was reading a statement for one of the uh member of the keset where he was talking about um basically targeting more civilians and actually uh killing more of the civilian in Gaza to sorry destroying more houses of gazans and killing more to make sure that Israeli are achieving their goals so if this is the way how they think of people in Gaza I would be I would not be surprised of seeing this kind of attack and more attacks on civilians they have to justify they have to explain this but so let's remember there's no accountability to tomorrow there will be discussion about it do they look at these images will they look at how many civilians were killed International Community if there is remaining morals or ethics they should look at what happened in gazda seriously after 97 days ma zi thanks for joining us we'll get more on this as the hours progress
