the UN Security Council passes its first motion on the Gaza war that come after two months of Israeli attacks that have killed 20,000 Palestinians the resolution weakened by us pressure calls for more aid but not for Israel to stop its bombardment will it have any impact this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm D abuga the United States's backing of Israel's war on Gaza has been crystal clear on the military front supplying huge quantities of weapons and money and diplomatically Washington's also been at the Forefront in driving Israel's cause yet after vetoing previous un Security Council resolutions for a ceas fire a us exstension has finally allowed a motion to pass a weaker version than the original draft it agrees on AIDS but not a ceasefire and it's taken days of political and back room wrangling to get it through as more Palestinians are killed in Gaza of course for the 20,000 who are dead lying in makeshift Graves or under the rubble the first un Security Council vote passed during the war is meaningless and whether it will have any impact for those who've survived red Israel's merciless attacks will only be known in the coming days so what does this vote mean for the Palestinians and also for the United Nations just how far is the Biden Administration prepared to go to keep going in supporting Israel We'll be asking our guests these and other questions in a few moments but first this report from um Kum Sharif on what happened at the UN Security Council as Palestinians were being killed in continuous air strikes and ground attacks across Gaza in New York the United Nations security Council passed a water down resolution to increase desperately needed Aid to the strip the vote was delayed three times before it passed without being vetoed as the United States and Russia abstained and 13 of the 15 member Council voted in favor the Palestinian ambassador to the UN criticized the vote and and the security Council it took this Council 75 days to finally utter the word secession of hostilities to utter the word secession of hostilities 40 days after the general assembly first referred to that objective and tens of thousands of Palestinians killed later the original draft called for an urgent cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas but the US opposed it and also insisted on removing a clause giving the UN exclusive control of humanitarian deliveries the final vote came after the United States vetoed a Russian Amendment with a stronger wording earlier I said the vote would be a moment of truth and that's what happened the US once again exposed their true face in front of the world blocking an even extremely weak call for a cessation of hostil ities in Gaza the US ambassador to the UN rejected critics who said there's a disconnect between the majority of the UN member states that want to cease fire and the United States that's blocked one there's no disconnect here we are all working to address the humanitarian needs on the ground and we're working to address those needs immediately that's what this resolution is about the resolution comes says the un's world food program is warning a quarter of households in Gaza that's roughly 500,000 people are starving a un back report warns the extent of hunger in the strip is worse than that seen in near famines in Afghanistan and Yemen in recent years un Secretary General Antonio gues is skeptical of the resolution without a ceasefire the real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian Aid inside Gaza an effective Aid operation in Gaza requires security staff who can work in safety logistical capacity and resumption of commercial activity these four elements do not exist the vote came as Israel expanded its ground offensive ordering more people to evacuate from areas it had earlier declared safe nearly 85% of gaza's population has been displaced and its Health Ministry says more than 20,000 have been killed more than 2 months into the war the security Council has passed its first resolution on Gaza in the weeks ahead the challenge will be to implement it as Palestinians endure mounting Slaughter and humanitarian crisis kulsum Sharif for Inside Story so the United States has a long history of using its veto power to back Israel at the United Nations its first veto on Palestine at the UN Security Council was in 1972 it's blocked 35 un resolutions critical of Israel in more than 50 years two out of those vetos have been during Israel's ongoing war on Gaza the US has vetoed resolutions on Israel 47 times in all including over Israel's invasion of the south of Lebanon as well as its occupation of Syria's Golan Heights we'll now bring in our guest joining us is Scott Lucas from Birmingham in the UK he's a professor of us and international relations at University College Dublin and also the founder and editor of the online news site EA worldview from Moscow is Dimitri babit who's a political analyst at inai internet media project and from Islamabad malha Loi a former Pakistan permanent representative and ambassador to the United Nations thank you all for joining us um malha I'll come to you first if we look at this latest resolution it opposes a demand for the suspension of hostilities but calls for the creation of conditions to allow a sustainable ceasefire how does that work well I mean I think the question to be asked is uh 10 weeks into a brutal War with over 20,000 civilian Palestinians dead is this all the security Council could do I think it's a failure of its Duty and its responsibility because after all this is the world body uh that has primary responsibility for the maintenance of International Peace and security so this resolution is so watered down uh it doesn't even I mean let alone a ceasefire I mean the I mean that's an important point you rais and we're definitely going to be talking about that in a moment but first I'd just like to um zero in on some of the language that was used so when the resolution calls for Urgent steps to establish conditions for a sustainable ceasefire I mean how open to interpretation is this in your opinion you uh were a uh a permanent representative to the United Nations because if you look at Israel it believes those steps uh would involve the complete destruction of Hamas for example so so the language used how would you describe it I think it's meaningless it means absolutely nothing it will do nothing to change the situation on the ground because we know that several days of negotiations where the US threatened to use the veto unless it got the language that it wanted and in the end it did get the language it wanted because the language originally was that there should be a session of hostilities and then the word was changed to suspension of hostilities and then we ended up with that being dropped in only the call for creating the conditions whatever that means uh it's up to anybody to interpret that so frankly I think us delay uh and display of duplicity led to an outcome that is going to change absolutely nothing while people continue to be killed and Devastation continues you know the UN Secretary General as your report itself indicated has expressed his own um disappointment and skepticism and basically said uh this is not going to help anything unless there is a ceasefire how can you get humanitarian assistance in it's not possible let's bring in Demitri because we had reaction from the Russian Ambassador uh saying um that the US had rendered this resolution toothless is that then how we explain the Russian exstension to uh this vote no I think Russia and the United States abstained for absolutely different reasons you know the the Russian representative the Russian side thinks that the resolution doesn't go far enough in in forcing Israel to stop the bombardment and the United States wants to water down their resolution uh let me remind you that for many years the United States criticized the United Nations and uh the United States even Justified uh its actions by passing the United Nations such as the invasion of Iraq such as the invasion of Yugoslavia they explained it by by the UN being toothless by the UN passing uh watered down resolutions well what can be more watered down then a resolution calling for the creation of conditions for um what do they say for um sustainable ceasefire to allow for a sustainable ceasefire that's a language that it's time to stop shooting exactly this is a very very watered down language uh people dying you know uh the shooting should be stopped immediately so that humanitarian Aid could come uh the Secretary General of the United Nations has been very open about it and still we have these uh empty wordss and we have the United Nations we have the United States first blocking the security Council resolution then we have the general assembly where the United States votes against uh our resolution supported by just a handful of its you know let me just ask you this let me just ask you this because the uh we also heard we got reaction from the isra from Israel's permanent representative who called the resolutions focus on Aid mechanisms unnecessary and disconnected from reality but we also know that that resolution has changed over the past few days until uh delegates reached the text that they did on Friday would those changes have been uh done not maybe not so much in conjunction with the Israelis but but how much pressure would the Israelis been putting on the Americans for example to water down the text I think uh Israelis do not need to pressure the Americans Americans were more than willing to water down this resolution there are two main points should the uh bombardment be stopped immediately and who controls the process of distribute Distributing Aid uh Israel uh wants to control that process obviously this is not acceptable uh for Palestinians and for many countries that want to provide Aid so these are two stumbling blocks and uh and the United States keeps using them in order to block uh any progress on these resolutions right but we also know on that last point you made that the US also insisted on removing the Clause that gives the UN exclusive control of humanitarian delivery so we understand that Israel still is going to manage those Scott Lucas over to you what does the US get out of abstaining from this resolution after a number of days going back and forth and then this resolution is put out and as we're hearing from our panelists it's almost meaningless what does the US get out of this well I think first of all it's important to note it's not just the US that's playing politics here uh we should note that the Kremlin is using this as a process to try to get off the vote over its repeated vetos when it enabled and indeed joined the Assad regime in the mass killing of hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and of course it's paralyzing the security Council over the kemin invasion of Ukraine but in this case of the United States what you had and you've described this there are three key points here first of all removing any reference to a suspension of hostilities let alone Association of hostilities secondly removing the phrase giving the UN control over Aid which effectively gives the Israelis a veto over those supplies and thirdly removing any reference to uh violations of international humanitarian law by all sides what the United States is continuing to do is to try to sort of maintain this idea that it has leverage with the Israelis that somehow it can call on the Israelis to limit the operations they're killing civilians I think quite frankly that ship has sailed the US does not have leverage with the Israelis unless it was to restrict military aid uh but in fact of course the United States has increased military aid to Israel since October 7th including more than 15,000 bombs more than 10,000 of which are unguided dumb bombs and the broader answer to this is is that the United States since the 1967 war has treated Israel as one of its three strategic allies in the Middle East one of those three allies Iran is gone uh Saudi Arabia is not an assured Ally at this point and so us institutions are still beted in with the Israelis and even behind closed doors as they try to tell the Israelis please stop please limit this the Israel a second Scott is the US here trying to send a message then to uh to the world in fact that it's still strong in the Middle East well the the US is actually playing both sides here are trying to play Both Sides here now you're seeing the side here where you've got the Biden Administration or those officials in the Biden Administration who publicly will not criticize Israel over its military operations the other side of this has been for example vice president kamla Harris who has publicly called for the protection of civilians the problem here is is that a both sides message by the Biden Administration means almost nothing much as Ambassador Lo mentioned the fact that this ultimate UN resolution means nothing until you have a firm line from the Biden Administration enough is enough backed up by action which means the Restriction of military aid to the Israelis Tel Aviv is going to use that wiggle room you know whatever is being told them by behind Clos Closed Doors by Anthony blinket for example publicly they'll continue to expand this offensive as we we seen in the last 48 hours uh Mala this was a UAE Le resolution from the get-go in which the us then managed to water down why would the UAE allow this I think the UAE was desperate to get any resolution in before its term ended on the security Council but I think in doing that it exposed itself to the kind of negotiations in which uh the United States basically got its way uh and it got its way uh to Israel benefit uh as you said earlier uh Israel retains uh its control over the delivery of Aid and of course there's no ceasefire so I think you know we have to look at the big picture the big picture is that the world is standing on one side as expressed in two general assembly resolutions Global opinion and then we have the United States and Israel standing on one side and yet the Security Council is is unable to act in any meaningful way to stop the war because I agree with Demetri unless unless there is an end to the blood shed unless there's an end to the War uh it is meaningless to talk about getting humanitarian assistance in I mean you're killing people and then you're saying uh we'd like to help whoever is surviving so uh Dimitri um H how will the security Council respond if Israel doesn't comply with this well uh it is difficult to predict uh what will happen next but I see a very dangerous tendency and I think Lucas uh uh noted it very well uh the western side is trying to uh I would call it expand the base of the conflict they keep mentioning Russia Ukrainian conflict they keep comparing Russia to Hamas which is absurd to my mind but they keep doing it you know the United States president is doing it several foreign ministers in the EU are doing that so uh I think we should all concentrate now on seizing hostilities this is the most important thing if the security Council can concentrate on that uh I'm sure uh there can be an outcome uh but uh I I don't think anyone can tell you what will happen in the next seven or eight days uh because uh it's so unpredictable that policies of the Western countries have become unpredictable they keep finding enemies uh for themselves and uh also of course the world is watching uh who are the countries that abstained or voted against the general assembly resolution on seizing hostilities in uh in in Gaza in Palestine you know Ukraine abstained the UK abstained the US allies and the NATO members they were the countries that abstained right so scottt I mean it just sounds like I'm I'm struggling to to find um the point of such resolutions then am I correct in saying that and and how far away is the council from actually making a real difference on the ground when it comes to the war on Gaza there is a point but is a symbolic in terms of the Practical the military the economic the reality is and we've known this for decades is that the Security Council is held hostage to the five powers who have veto over it so the security Council was held hostage and could not do anything over the mass killing in Syria or over Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine because of the Russian veto here the Security Council is being held hostage because of the American veto that said I do think it is important that you have a vast majority of the security Council in this case 13 of 15 members yesterday with only Russia and the US abstaining who have signaled the fact that they want something to be done I think it's important that the general assembly by an overwhelming margin 153 of 193 station Nations calling for that ceasefire it does highlight the isolation of the Israelis it does highlight that if the Israeli War cabinet cannot quote destroy Hamas soon as its own foreign minister said we risk diplomatic defeat so yes this process is not satisfying this process will not help out Gaza civilians so Scott what does this tell you that what does this tell you about the US timetable when it comes to this war because what we've heard from the Israeli side is that they need a few months the Americans have reportedly said you have a few weeks and now we have this resolution that doesn't call for a ceasefire fire I I I go back to a point I made earlier that American officials have told the Israelis behind closed doors they've leaked it to the media that they wanted these operations wrapped up by December 31st I think it's evident that baring a very quick Israeli quote victory in southern Gaza these operations will not wrap up so just as I said that the Security Council is held hostage by the US and Russia the Americans are held hostage by the Israeli War cabinet unless and I repeat unless the Americans take a meaningful step which is either to support a resolution which has enforcement powers to bring Aid into Gaza or unless the Americans restrict military aid to the Israelis if they do neither of those the Israeli War cabinet they can proceed knowing they're not going to suffer a punishment no matter how many civilians and perhaps a moss Fighters die in Gaza for weeks or even months Mala does this resolution have enforcement Powers how can it actually be enforced because I mean we've spoken also to a lot of humanitarian groups here on Al jazer since that resolution was passed who who said this is likely to make no difference to them look it's very weak I mean if you listen to what many heads of uh uh non-governmental organizations are saying humanitarian organizations are saying they're all saying the same thing which is it's going to make precious little difference on the ground and I think what it does is these sorts of actions what they do is they undermine the legitimacy of the security Council and that in turn brings into question the very credibility of the United Nations the United Nations is then seen as you know losing any relevance uh in a crisis that's gone on for over 10 weeks and where the situation gets more and more grave as the days go by so I think this kind of res resolution is of no help to anybody but clearly it's a response to Growing pressure uh there is pressure exerted by the two G resolutions uh which clearly call for something to be done and that something was a ceasefire but that didn't happen so in in you know instead of that it's almost like substituting what really needed to be done with something which is so weak and as I said before so meaningless but in a way responding to pressure also so uh from demonstrations that have taken place and are continuing to take place across the world uh public demonstrations calling for Action to stop the genocide to stop the Bloodshed so you know these kinds of resolutions then are used uh really frankly in my opinion as a smoke screen uh because nothing really changes right uh Dimitri what does this mean for the Secretary General himself if anything at all does it Empower him to speak out more because we saw saw him a few weeks ago invoke article 99 which calls for a cessation of hostilities and at the time he said that he hoped that his move would put more pressure on the council do you think it has pressured the council in any way at all what does the Secretary General do next well unfortunately the power of the Secretary General of the United Nations has been decreasing in the last uh I would say at least 20 years since the invasion of Iraq uh uh we saw that Security Council you know the The veto rule which Scot criticized uh unfortunately U I don't think it's going to be removed because it saved the world from a nuclear war several times after 1945 you know the veto power were given to the nuclear Powers so I don't think Humanity will say goodbye to the system that somehow protected us for so many years but the power of the uh general secretary has been decreasing uh we we saw how the UN has been unable to prevent huge invasions such as the invasion of Iraq such as the covered covert invasion of Syria by uh the countries that were not invited there by anyone not by the Syrian government not by the uh United Nations so I don't expect Antonio gues to be very effective I I frankly I would not like to be in his shoes right now he has been powerless to stop the repression of Russians speaking population of Ukraine for 8 years I mean for eight years before uh Putin started the so-called military operation Donas and wans were bombarded by the Ukrainian troops and the United Nations did nothing Scott go ahead so I sorry I'll just come back to you know the fundamental points to stick with facts rather than putting out propaganda here and the fundamental fact here is is that I think as Ambassador Lo has pointed out that that as as as as unfortunately as Ambassador Le pointed out that as long as you have the veto power which is placed in there by the security Council uh it is going to be a body which is really not going to intervene to effect in a number of cases and this goes all the way back to the 1950s um you know the last time the UN Security Council really acted effectively in an issue regarding one of the great Powers was when it decided to intervene in the Korean War and that's because the Soviet Union boycotted the security Council a mistake they bailed never to make again so again when it comes to the case of Iraq uh as Demitri pointed out in 2003 yes the security Council ultimately was powerless to present a disastrous Invasion when it comes to China repressing its own population uh the security Council is powerless to act because there'll be a Chinese veto and when the Kremlin creates the propaganda lines to say oh it's okay for the Assad regime to kill Syrian civilians because supposedly it's all the fault of the western Powers they can paralyze the security Council when the Russians when the Kremlin invades Ukraine invades Ukraine doesn't defend Ukraine invades Ukraine then they can say oh it's the Western Powers it's the NATO it's their fault we're going to cast our veto and the security Council and then proceed to justify their own war crimes which ensue if you want to deal with this you fundamentally have to deal with that question of veto power where the five powers do not hold the the world hostage and that means giving more power to the general assembly or having an expanded Security Council where the veto power does not paralyze it yeah where of course we know resolutions there are in fact non-binding but we'll have to leave it there on that note thank you so much for joining us Scott Lucas Demitri bichi we appreciate your time thanks for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website al.com for
