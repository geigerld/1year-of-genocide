an Israeli media report is quoting Army sources who are blaming poor discipline among field commanders for the killing of seven Aid workers in Gaza they told the hared newspaper that soldiers and officers violated Israeli Army regulations a convoy of vehicles from the world Central Kitchen Aid agency was hit by Israeli air strikes in Dar albala in central Gaza on Monday six of the victims were foreign Nationals and one was Palestinian well Al jazer investigation has found the Israeli Army intentionally targeted the world Central Kitchen Convoy in three consecutive air strikes here's what the evidence shows the organization says it three vehicles left the warehouse here in darl Bala sometime around 10:30 p.m. local time on April 1st the Convoy traveled just over 4 kilometers making it to rasheid Street along the coast Witnesses say the first vehicle was hit by a missile here just before 10:45 5 p.m. the injured were seen being transferred from the first car to the second armored vehicle the second car made it 800 M south from the first attack when it too was bombed photos clearly show it was hit straight through the roof by a projectile from above the Third vehicle in the Convoy made it a further 1600 M down the road before it was hit by a third and final strike also through its roof let's bring in aler is Imran Khan in occupied East Jerusalem so Imran quite a lot of contradiction in what we've heard from the Israelis and what our investigation has revealed let's start with this haret article which talks about a lack of discipline on the part of commanders in the field in Gaza tell us more about this well what you're supposed to have in any situation in any kind of war is a clear command and control structure any drone strikes any military strikes any operations need to be signed off on by a senior Commander that depending on the situation could go all the way up to the defense minister him or herself that seemingly hasn't happened in this case all of the military analysts I've been speaking to suggest that this is a clear violation a clear destruction of that command and control structure and then we have this heret article a key newspaper here within Israel very good sources who are now saying uh that commanders on the ground are simply doing what they want it's worth reading you a couple of quotes from here a source in the intelligence Branch said the command knows exactly what the cause of the attack was in Gaza everyone does as he pleases now the Army regulations say that the final provement for any action against sensitive targets and organizations must be given by senior officers they go on to say that that simply isn't happening it's a case of every commander sets the rules for himself that is a breakdown of a command and control structure it's something uh that now military analysts are actually openly talking about and like I say we have this heret article but will it have an impact on the Israelis the Israelis are actually saying you know what we are going to set up a new uh Central command system we are going to do everything uh that we need to stop this from happening again but those structures Folly should have already been in place in fact they were in place there is a war room so the big question is now was this a deliberate attack and at what level was it actually approved was it just the commanders on the ground who are behaving in a way that allows them to Simply do what they want or was it signed off on at the highest levels and Imran this is not the first attack on Aid workers in Gaza many Palestinian Aid workers have been uh killed in this conflict and in previous conflicts are we likely to see a proper investigation and proper accountability in this case as foreign workers were the victims I think you've hit the nail on the head because this was foreign workers we will see the Israelis mount a very significant and very key uh investigation uh but will we see that will the public see that it's likely that that investigation will simply be given uh to the various governments involves the Polish the Brits the Americans uh the a Australians and the Canadians uh and they may well say okay well we've got the results of the investigation we're satisfied that the results are something we can live with and we'll go back to what we were doing before which is supporting Israel in its war on Gaza however International pressure is still mounting from the global South who are wondering why this investigation is taking place into these deaths when you have at least 110 Palestinians working for the United Nations relief Works agency who were Distributing Aid who were killed why hasn't Israel investigated those death the answer is obvious and it's clear and I'm not going to say it okay thank you Imran Imran Khan life for is there in occupied East Jerusalem
