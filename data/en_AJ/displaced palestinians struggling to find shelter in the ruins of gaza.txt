for Palestinian families displaced by Israeli bombs this ruined school is the best shelter they can find Hamdi has previously taken Refuge here earlier in the war but he and many others were forced to flee from the Israeli War Machine we were staying in on schols that were supposed to be safe places but the Israelis bombed us some people were killed and injured there were some who could not get out we were first to flee to the coastal ious the Israelis left little behind after their last attack and it will take a lot of work to make this school fit for people to live in we found the school completely burned down and had no blankets or bedding to sleep on when we returned we found everything destroyed but I live in jabalia and I will die here many Palestinians in Gaza are forced to be constantly on the move their homes have long been destroyed and Israel has restricted shipments of Aid now all these families can dare to hope for is a temporary roof over their heads and maybe a briefer spite from the bombing displacement is very hard we have children with us we have suffered a lot and this is the third time we have had to be displaced from this school I don't know how I will manage we don't have money we don't have possibilities millions of Palestinians in Gaza are suffering the same fate a daily struggle for for survival that grows ever more difficult as the war rages on vinon Monahan Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
