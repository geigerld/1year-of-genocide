Antonio Gutierrez is now speaking live from Cairo along with the Egyptian foreign minister let's listen in for his critical leadership I am in the Middle East on a humanitarian Mission at a moment of profound crisis a crisis unlike any the region has seen in decades that crisis was triggered by the atrous 7 octo Hamas attacks that killed injured and kidnapped a large number of civilians from Israel and indeed from around the world but this led Israel to a total Siege on glaza and the Relentless bombing campaign with an Ever also journalists workers and many others including all right that's un Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez so the head of the United Nations he's in Egypt obviously Egypt playing a major role here since uh Egypt controls the Rafa border crossing the only door out of Gaza right now that is not also controlled uh by the Israelis and uh he is speaking along with the Egyptian foreign minister now remember the context number one is that the UN Secretary General has called for ceasefire that's language that is new as of uh today or the previous day and the first 10 or 11 days of this crisis the UN actually hadn't called at the highest Echelon for a ceasefire but now he is doing so uh and there are many questions around how that Aid is going to be delivered around the volume of the aid the amount where it's going and how it's even going to be distributed within the Gaza Strip given that no fuel is going to be allowed in as we keep an eye on that and and we keep an eye on the Skies over Gaza that life shot just moments after we saw um continued bombardments on Gaza City I want to bring in Sultan Barakat you are professor of public policy at hammad bin Khalifa University here in Qatar thank you for being with us I want to talk with you a little bit about what the Arab and Muslim nations can do at this stage for the Palestinians I say this because there were statements coming out of Iran today saying the Islam world's silence is completely unjustified this was in a phone call with uh Qatar um and now you see the UN Secretary General in Egypt there's also the King of Jordan who's in Egypt where does diplomacy diplomacy stand right now within the Arab world in support of the Palestinians well the two world within the Arab world and the mostl of they the states and the people on the streets I think the public uh has made their views very very clear throughout the W World many seen protests huge protests demonstrations and so on but when it comes to the states uh they have been more reluctant to make a direct statement against the situation in Gaza partly because of fear of the implication that may bring Vis A V the United States in particular their relationship with the United States others have already tied themselves into processes of normalization with Israel and or already had peace agreements with Israel so for example Jordan Egypt Morocco even Sudan well Jordan and Egypt that's Jordan and Egypt that's decades old but countries the Abraham Accords the UAE Bahrain Morocco that's that's very recent do you think that they normalizing of ties with Israel do you think that could be that could become more fragile as this uh conflict continues it has to it must become more fragile I mean the the problem now is that they're still banking on the fact that there is hope in the process but their public will be very it will be very very diff sorry hope in what process in the normalization that it can continue as as if it hasn't been interrupted and so on but I think the public opinion now is very much against respectfully and I'm sorry to do this but let me interrupt you because we now have the translation for the UN Secretary General let's listen to and ra crossing board are the only Lifeline to those in Gaza Strip for Egypt once again proves that it is a a pillar of peace and Security in the region it is the only country capable of diffusing violence the longer the war the more the violence will become and consequently the more losses there will be in human life and property we are demanding an immediate ceasefire and the quick and Swift Delivery of relief Aid I will put this humanitarian Mission into effect from now and from Egypt we shouldn't lose sight that we are all anticipating and looking forward to a longlasting permanent and final solution with the establishment of as dependent Palestinian State side by side with okay we've just been listening to um Antonio Gutierrez he's calling on Hamas to release uh hostages he's calling on Israel to give unrestricted access to Aid into Gaza uh he is calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza again that's his new position it wasn't his position for the first 10 days of the conflict but it is as of I think 48 hours ago uh and he says that Gaza needs Aid at a scale and on a sustained basis what do you make of the uh the position of the UN since the beginning of this conflict I must say it was slightly it was disappointing in the sense no one knows Gaza more than the UN the UN has been in Gaza for 75 years so they know exactly the situation he does uh know very well guus that this is not did not start on the 7th of October this has a long history the UN itself has been the victim of Israeli attacks many many times over the years so all he does really he's trying to put it within an acceptable framework for the super for the super powers and that's basically the United States and Britain and France at the moment so he's trying to walk tight row between satisfying them and uh their protection of Israel which he fully understand that is Israel enjoys an exceptionalism that no other state has in the world he has the the longest history of Engagement as the UN and with Israelis understand exactly the qualities Israel enjoys as the spoiled child of the of the West now within that he has to come up with statements I think upgrading to uh a ceasefire is is a better call than initially humanitarian corridors but uh ultimately he'd be lucky if Israel allows in humanitarian corridors in a systematic and safe ways how does he have any leverage over what's about to happen Aid going in the trucks going in from Egypt into the Gaza Strip and the conditions that are put on those trucks how much Aid what Aid can be in those trucks Etc does he have not at this stage I mean the the UN has the infrastructure and can deliver Aid and can guarantee for Israel that this Aid will not make it into the hands of Hamas and will not include any weapons and this is not the first time they've done it many many times before and they've done it all over the world but at the moment the cony that we see ready to go into uh uh into Gaza is a token a 20 trucks for 2.2 million people 20 trucks for two yes it's it's nothing it it is not a United Nation Aid this is mostly from Egypt it's a token to show Egypt is doing its part it's a token to show that Biden didn't travel on uh Air Force One all that distance and back for nothing so he's done something and it is also a way to show that the Israeli still have a space in their heart to to look after these people but we all know that the 20 trucks are not sufficient you know just to supply the hospitals never mind the ones that were damaged the one that are still running you need much more than that on daily basis yeah you don't need to be an expert to know that you can't feed 2 million people with 20 trucks you can't give drinking water food would have spoiled by now these have been trucks have been there for about 10 days so this is for mostly mostly we probably have medical uh equipment and hygiene kits to help limit the spread of diseases this is the the next thing that is coming to head Gaza there will be a spread of epidemics across the the the area largely because of uh failing of sewer system without electricity there's no way to pump the sewers and these will now come to haunt everyone aside from the fact that there is no uh fresh water available to the to the people of GZA Sultan Barakat thank you very much for joining us this hour appreciate your context and Analysis
