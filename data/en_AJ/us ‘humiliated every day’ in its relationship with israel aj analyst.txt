well in an interview with the Wall Street Journal Israel's foreign minister said that we do not want to rule Gaza and they look forward to handing over the responsibility of governing Gaza to an International Coalition so let's bring in our senior political analyst Mar bashara the foreign minister the defense minister the Prime Minister the security the US security adviser spokesperson John Kirby all talking about the day after the war finishes it's all Nuance but it really does seem like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing they're lost they are completely lost I would tell you uh looking in hindsight now the last month of uh of of of this war that Israel's assumptions Israel's tactics even Israel's end game have changed the only constant is the destruction of Palestinians lives and livelihoods that's the only thing that's been constant uh the past month Israel just wants to kill as many Palestinians as possible and Destroy as many civilian instructure infrastructure as possible in as far as the end game clearly the three Israeli officials and that of the American position differ they don't know what to do in the end game and clearly there are these fantasies that are so farcical they don't even Merit a commentary such as when the foreign minister says we're going to bring the Europeans and the Americans and the Islamic countries to govern while we maintain our military presence in Gaza I mean theah as it were is is breathtaking clearly they don't know what to do not just with the end game so they don't know what to do today I've just seen a report by CBS news that says after a month of killing and more than 10,000 civilian deaths Israel was able to reach and kill only 60 60 uh principal Hamas Fighters 60 10,000 killed and tens of thousands of wounded and that's where the Israelis are they are certainly cannot reach the Hamas Fighters underground the resistance continues and clearly they're even shooting Rockets but Israel's um shooting aim has been the civilians it wants Gaza to pay a price for October 7 it wants the people and we've heard that from the America from the Israeli president that there are no Innocents in Gaza and hence uh they are shooting they are bombing they are in the midst of a genocide without a clear aim of what's next they might not have a clear aim yet Anthony blinkin the secretary of state who's done his Whistle Stop tour of the Middle East had his hands slapped is now in Japan at the G7 foreign ministers meeting is talking about a clear voice on Gaza he himself knows that not everybody at the G7 agrees with him France certainly one and now you know Emanuel macron will be under pressure because a newswire has dropped that even opposition lawmakers some of them who are supporters of macron on certain occasions when legislation gets through uh in France want a ceasefire he's under pressure there'll be other leaders there under pressure from not just their own politicians and opposition uh politicians but also from their public too absolutely look even now the United States is moving away from just a mere humanitarian pause now are talking about a number of days at least uh because they're also bringing in the hostage issue to it but clearly as you State uh uh rightly the Western and the international public opinion are getting ansy restless in in fact angry especially here in the region the Arab street is boiling in Anger at the sight of this massacre uh that continues unabated in Gaza but uh unfortunately we have a superpower that has been so reckless so irresponsible personally I would think even so foolish to box itself in behind uh an Israeli government that is so fanatic and so fascist that its only aim now is to take revenge and contrary to what the uh spokesperson of the US National Security is saying this is not a war for defending the Israeli people this is a war to defend the Israeli occupation which really poses the question um now that the now that we all know that the occupation has failed what are the Israelis proposing more occupation occupation of the rest of Gaza now that we know that force and violence has not worked what are the Israeli proposing more Force more violence which begs the question that they are I mean absolute morons because when you know if that you've tried a Thing Once and again for decades and it hasn't worked to try it once more is a sign of utter Madness this is create a huge problem for Biden because well it does create a huge problem for the American president because you know you have this superpower who has aligned itself with Israel very clearly to the global audience and yet is finding it very difficult to decouple itself in the months ahead if and when this war should finish in whatever format it finishes in it's got to try and bring the International Community with it and having you might Stak its claim so clearly to Tel Aviv it's going to be difficult to ABS win over those that were Skeptics to start with absolutely and and uh it's it's it's rather timid attempts have been so clumsy I mean diplomatically speaking there's just been so clumsy because look what happened over the the past month in the first in the first first half of the month the American Administration box itself completely behind the Nano government parting parting one sound bite after another one falsehood after another about a human shield about the need to protect its civilians about why war must be why Hamas is like isol all that humbug it just continues to repeat one falsehood after another when that did not work out and clearly the Arab world and other American Allies are discovering slowly but surely but this is all falsehood the Americans instead of distancing themselves from Israel and taking a more sober view they decided that they're going to start talking about the day after but we are in the middle of War now we are in the middle of genocide talking about the day after in these fanciful foral ways about a two-state solution when we look at the reality and see that President Biden cannot lean on the Israeli Prime Minister to force a 2hour humanitarian pause whatever that means he is promising a two-state solution how how could anyone believe the admin American Administration how could the American Administration have any credibility when in the one hand it cannot pose it cannot force a twoh hour pause for humanitarian purposes while talking so fanul about two set solution they are stuck they are lost they are facing a a vicious resistance in Gaza and the only people who are paying the price for it are tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of Palestinians unfairly and unjustly this must end and we'll see when it does marn but for the moment thank you marwin bashara our senior political analy
