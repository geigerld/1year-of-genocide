a major development in the last hour Jordan has announced it will recall its ambassador to Israel the government also says Israel's Ambassador cannot return to Jordan let's bring in Alan Fischer in occupied East Jerusalem for more on this how significant is this move by Jordan Allen it's pretty significant diplomatically that Jordan one of Israel's neighbors has said that they have no intention of sending their Ambassador back they're very angry at what is happening in Gaza they said if Israel stops the war in Gaza and stops the humanitarian catastrophe it is causing then it will reconsider its decision this have comes of course after a number of South American countries took action diplomatically uh on uh on Tuesday we saw uh Bolivia cut all ties with Israel we saw Chile and Colombia recall their ambassadors as well will it affect anything on the ground highly unlikely it would be much more potent if someone like the United States or the United Kingdom withdrew their ambassadors or certainly Express their diplomatic displeasure beyond the the war should be conducted within International humanitarian laws if it was more than that then this would have more of an impact but it's not going to change what is happening with the Israelis on the ground in Gaza um Alan Israel has confirmed now that 15 of its troops have been killed uh during its ground incursion into Gaza Hamas says it K uh Israel also killed uh seven captives uh during the attack on jabalia refugee camp uh on Tuesday how is all of that playing out in Israel right now how much pressure does it put on prime minister Netanyahu and his government on top of the pressure that already exists well there's certainly a number of people in Israel who are concerned at the loss of any soldiers but indeed they're concerned about the loss of any life in Gaza at all and have called for an end to stop the war but there are many who support what soldiers are doing in fact one interview I saw on Israeli television just a few hours ago someone said there's a price to be paid for making Israeli safe we would rather the soldiers didn't die but this is the reality of the situation as far as the captives are concerned the fact that seven have died according to Hamas including two foreign Nationals will let a lot of people say we told you so there was real pressure on Israel before the start of the ground war not to go ahead because they wanted there to be a window where it was possible to negotiate the release uh of the captives and many people warned that if the war started to the extent that we're seeing then a lot of people would die now Hamas have said that 50 people already died in the early bombardment in Gaza but the fact over the last 24 hours another seven have died but it's not going to change the reality again of what is happening the Israelis were aware that this could happen and in fact people very high up in the Army said some of the hostages will die when we're doing this but they view this as a necessary uh step to take to try and secure uh Israel's future they see this as a war against Hamas and obviously it's continuing right across Gaza with a rising death toll but there is little con little concern would be a bit harsh but there is uh nowhere near the concern about inflicting deaths on on the the captives if it means Israel will defeat Hamas in the long run Alan in uh occupied East Jerusalem Alan Fischer thank you very much
