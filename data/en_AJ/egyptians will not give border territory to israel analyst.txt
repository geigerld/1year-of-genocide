Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel should take control of the Philadelphia Corridor on gaza's border with Egypt the corridor is a 14 km strip of land on the southern end of Gaza Philadelphia the Philadelphia Corridor or to put it more correctly the southern stoppage point of Gaza must be in our hands it must be shut it is clear that any other Arrangement would not ensure the demilitarization that we seek let's take a closer look now at the Philadelphia corridor Israel says one of the purposes of the corridor is to monitor the movement of goods and people between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and to search for weapons Israel believes there are hundreds of smuggling tunnels there and has previously conducted military operations to destroy them when it was established as a buffer zone under the Egypt Israel peace treaty of 1979 Israel controlled the corridor until 2005 when it withdrew from the strip after which Egyptian Security Forces began patrolling the area two years later Hamas came into power in Gaza both Egypt and Hamas strongly oppose Israel's control over the corridor because it would effectively sever the Gaza strip's only land connection to Egypt Rami kurri is the director of global engagement at the American University of Beirut he joins us live now from Boston welcome to the program first let me ask you how significant do you think is Benjamin netanyahu's statement about the Philadelphia Corridor you know it's hard to take uh anything that Netanyahu says totally factually um but he's constantly negotiating he's constantly boasting he's bluffing he's uh appealing to different audiences uh he wants his domestic audience to feel reassured he wants to scare the uh the Palestinians uh he wants to negotiate with the Egyptians he wants to get more support from the Americans so anything he says has multiple audiences multiple purposes and should should not be taken at face value but we do know that there's two things that the Israelis have always wanted since the be creation of their state in 1948 they want um a territory and security a territory for security to be secure and they want to um in many phases including this government expand the land of the state of Israel to include what they call parts of the Biblical land of Israel so they have this Messianic biblical theological drive and they have the security Drive neither of those has ever really brought them security the more that they expand the more they control land the more they try to be secure by taking over people's lands driving people out of their homes the less secure they become because they just instigate greater and more intense forms of resistance by Palestinians and and by other PE Lebanese that happened with Hezbollah and Lebanon and in Palestine with Hamas and Islamic Jihad so we have to just take this as one element that he's throwing into the negotiating pot because there are serious negotiations going on to resolve the immediate issues which is the uh the Israeli genocidal assault on Gaza the uh prisoners and hostages and detainees on both sides uh to get a ceasefire all these things have to be negotiated and then maybe what comes after that so this is I see this purely as one more uh element he's throwing in there uh to to be negotiated and with and with that element forgive me with that element I mean how much tension does that potentially create amongst other Regional players like Egypt well the Egyptians will not accept uh giving that territory to uh to n yeah to the Israelis um they negotiated in 1979 with the Egyptian Israeli peace treaty and that U Corridor was created they agreed that Egypt would Patrol it I think with 750 troops and all kinds of specified arms um uh they don't seem to have done a very good job because there's all these tunnels underneath it and and Hamas and Traders and students and people needing Medical Aid can come in and out of Gaza using that area uh and that's what Israel presumably wants to stop and and Hamas and the Palestinians in Gaza want to not stop it because it's their only Outlet to the world the Israelis control the Sea and the west and the North and the east of Gaza the south is the only part that leads Gaza right onto an Arab territory it's also where the leaders of Gaza of Hamas and other groups uh Community leaders U you know Educators industrialists whatever uh they can come in and out of Gaza using that route so given given what given what you say then what could this mean for the population of Gaza going ahead who are already suffering so much from this war well this is again an unknown because we're in the middle of a of a intense uh military assault by Israel and an in intense diplomatic negotiation and in the context of both of those both sides are going to say things that try to give them more Advantage Hamas doesn't speak too much in public it makes statements through its official spokesperson once every few days and occasionally some of their leaders in Lebanon and um and qar and in Egypt make a statement but not too much the the Israeli politicians are totally different nyaho in particular um he he's never seen a television camera that he doesn't fall in love with and he he loves to speak and and and he's he's trying desperately to show show how tough he is how this time we're really going to destroy Hamas which he said four times before using military force this time he's using much more drastic Force destroying the whole society the schools the hospitals the Water Systems uh but this is part of it you have to see him as part of this sort of performance political performance it's serious stuff you're telling you're talking about a state that was attacked on October 7 to a limited extent uh and then it responded with this massive unlimited uh assault back on uh on Gaza but this is a political process uh and he wants to make it point to his people uh that that this is what he's going to do because there's a huge amount of opposition to him inside Israel also he may be doing this partly to U come up with a negotiating point card that he can uh trade in to get more arms from the US maybe the Egyptians will will play along at some point and get more Aid if they allow something maybe they'll say let's do joint patrols I'm just guessing I have no evidence for this but I don't think so I don't think people want to give Israel more territorial control of Arab lands we want them to get out of the Arab lands and shift into a political negotiation which would give the Israelis and the Palestinians their full rights like the Egyptians got their full rights when they made peace with Israel so given given what you say then forgive me given what you say how does this Philadelphia Corridor issue play into Israel's overall military strategy in its war on Gaza well they think Israel thinks it's very important because they feel that Hamas has been getting a lot of its military equipment through there but if they're going to destroy hamash as they say then you know that hamash is not going to be there to get more equipment uh so it doesn't it doesn't make a lot of sense uh to me at least U the uh future of Gaza was going to be part of Palestine that includes the West Bank and maybe down the road parts of East Jerusalem we'll see uh these are all factors that have to be negotiated and there's no way you can guess what they are um now but there's Gaza clearly he says they want he wants Nano says that Gaza has to be demilitarized um and he used a crazy term the other day that the population has to be deradicalized I mean this is television CNN stuff this is performance for uh for the world this is not serious political uh statesmanship um so we but this it does give you a hint that security is so important to them which is understandable given what they suffered under white racist Europeans and Russians and North Americans 7 80 100 years ago security is so important to them um that they want to defend it and they see land controlling other people's lands as bringing them security but it doesn't so they're still they're obsessed with this and this is another way they've done this they tried in Lebanon they controlled Gaza they got out of Gaza they got out of Lebanon they still en Circle Gaza but they want this piece of land because it will give them total encirclement of Gaza it'll have no it will leave no outlet for the people of Gaza to come and go without having to pass through some kind of Israeli checkpoint and this is not going to be acceptable Hamas won't accept it the PA won't accept it nobody will accept this we'll leave it there for now Ramy curri thank you very much indeed for your insights here on Al jazer thank you
