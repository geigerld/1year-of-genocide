[Music] with Al jazer straight to the US President Joe Biden who's speaking in Nantucket massachusett now and uh so those who are now uh rapping Abigail in love and care and the Supportive Services she needs she's been through a terrible trauma you know her mom was killed in front of her when her when her kabut was attacked by Hamas Terrorist on October 7th Abigail ran to her dad then who then was gunned down gunned down as well while using his body to Shield little Abigail she then ran to a neighbor for help where they were all taken hostage that entire house of neighbors were taken hostage by Hamas and held for 50 days what she endured is Unthinkable Abigail was among 13 hostage released today from Gaza under the broker and sustained the Intensive us diplomacy she's now safely in Israel and we continue to press and expect for additional Americans will be released as well and we will not stop working till every hostage is returned to their loved ones as I said when I spoke about this deal on Friday this has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team we've been in close contact with the leaders of cutter Egypt and Israel speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks to help secure this deal we spoke again yesterday with the mayor of cutter I owe special thanks to in order to keep the hosi release on track and push for Abigail to be part of this release and I'll be speaking again shortly with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and we will continue to remain personally engaged personally engaged to see that this deal is fully implemented and work to extend the deal as well for weeks I've been advocating to pause in the fighting for two purposes to to increase the assistance getting into the Gaza civilians who need help and to facilitate release of hostages we know that innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly as well because this war that Hamas has Unleashed is so has such consequences thousands have been killed and from the earliest days of this crisis I've worked closely with President CCE of Egypt the Israeli government King Abdullah of Jordan and leaders throughout the region to expand the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinians in need who are not part of Hamas under this deal fighting in Gaza has now been paused for three days over that time 58 hostages have been released including the tie of Filipino and Russian Nationals dozens of families have been reunited and we worked urgently urgently to take advantage of the pause to Surge Aid into Gaza we've moved approximately 200 Aid trucks into Gaza each day day loaded with food water medicine Fuel and cooking gas more is needed but this deal is delivering life-saving results critically needed Aid is going in and hostages are coming out and this still is structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results that's my goal that's our goal to keep this pause going Beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into into those in who in need in Gaza we've seen this is the day byday approach hour by hour process nothing is guaranteed and nothing is being taken for granted but the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again the proof is little Abigail more than 20 other children 18 years and younger have been released they been released through this deal as well they've endured a terrible ordeal they can now begin the long journey toward healing I'm going to continue working with the Amir of cutter president CCE of Egypt and prime minister Netanyahu of Israel to do everything possible to see the hostage are freed all the hostages I'm grateful for the personal partnership as we puru this deal from each of those men I just mentioned and as we've worked together to see the see all this implement now to try to extend it further I'll continue working with all our partners to take the hard but necessary steps to build an integrated and more prosperous and more peaceful future in the region a two-state solution is the only way to guarantee the long-term security of both Israelis and Palestinian people to make sure Israel and Palestinians alike live an equal measure of freedom and dignity we'll not give up on working toward that goal so thank you very much but thank God she's home the little I justess can't imagine the enjoyment in the I I just I wish I were there to hold her Mr President do you have an update on the other Americans who are being held and any sense as to when they would be released uh we are hopeful but I don't have anything firmly to tell you at this moment sir do you expect that if you are able to use this momentum to extend the pause have you extracted any guarant about proof of life for other hostages or do you have an expectation of how much longer you could push this cause well look you know the deal calls for for every for every 10 hostage release to extend another day so I'm hopeful this is not the end it's going to continue but we don't know and uh but I get a sense that um all the players in the region even the neighbors who aren't have been directly involved now we looking for a way to end this so the hostages are all released and Hamas is is completely uh how can I say it no longer in control of any portion of Gaza do they have control of all of the hostages are there still other militant groups that you have to deal with we think there are probably other militant groups we're not certain Mr President Mr President how is um Abigail doing what's her physical condition um do you have any information I haven't gotten that information I just want to let you know immediately they were going across uh into Egypt as you recall that was a roote but an older non-american elderly elderly woman is very sick and was in need of immediate medical help so they arranged a cross directly into Israel to be able to take her to a hospital all I know is that she was been held I don't know I haven't seen a photograph I've just put in communication with my team but she is safely ins sconed in Israel but there's a lot more work to be done how many days would you like to see the I would like to see us move to a point where we were able to uh well let me put this way I'd like to see the pause go on as long as prisoners kept coming out all right thank you all so very much I know you know we have to call you I know you said what's he call me with only 10 minutes or so notice I said that's the notice I get because we didn't know I didn't want to be having this press conference if they weren't physically even when they were in the Red Cross Ambulance I didn't want to do it because they were not out they were they were still in Gaza so uh I don't thank you enough but thanks for your patience and I know we're here anytime all right Jo I think happy holiday okay happy holidays okay you are watching aler that's the tail end of an important press conference by the US President Joe Biden who's been speaking uh about the release of a US national a four-year-old Abigail Eden who has been released by Hamas from Gaza she sadly lost both of her parents in the October 7th attack in southern Israel he also acknowledged the the suffering in Gaza and reiterated that he'd been speaking to all of the regional players Qatar and Egypt when it comes to hopes of a lasting ceasefire he says we need to take advantage of this pause to get Aid in we need to build on these results to keep it going Beyond tomorrow he said it was a day byday approach
