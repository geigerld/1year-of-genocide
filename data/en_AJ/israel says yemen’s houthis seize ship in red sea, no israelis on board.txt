so we begin with de developments in Yemen where a Hui military spokesman has confirmed to Al jazer that their Fighters have hijacked a ship owned by an Israeli businessman in the southern Red Sea at least 22 people were on board the Galaxy leader which is on route to Turkey from India the Israeli military have called the situation a very serious event on a global level Sarah is joining us from West Jerusalem to tell us more about the reaction coming out of there Sarah yeah well we've heard from prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's office saying that it's actually 25 crew members none of them are Israelis it says that some of those on board from Ukraine uh Mexico uh as well uh as the Philippines and Bulgaria but no Israelis on the ship also saying that that vessel is actually Brit a British ship uh operated by a Japanese company but from what we understand is it's part partly owned uh by a a multi-millionaire Israeli uh businessman that's in the shipping uh business and this would mean that this isn't the first time one of his uh ships have uh been intercepted in fact in 2021 one of the ships that he owned was targeted uh by at the time what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said was Iran even though Iran had at the time as well uh denied that uh well here we are today uh 12 hours a post uh a video that was released by The Hui the Iranian backed Hui rebels in Yemen and who had released a statement via video saying that they will uh begin targeting uh ships that they deem as Israeli because of the escalation and because of the situation in Gaza now if you actually look at the map it's a strategic location because a lot of those ships that enter via that bottleneck as you go up in the southern part of the Red Sea up all the way to the top which will eventually lead you to the sews canal and that is a main shipping Lane and a main international shipping Lane for the whole of the world that would pass all the way uh from Asia to bypass going all the way around Africa it would cut through that Red Sea and onto Europe uh what we understand is the ship was heading uh from Turkey uh to India and that just gives you an idea of how strategic that location is and how much the huis are are really going for uh attacks against Israel they are at least attempting to with the Drone attacks or drones that they've managed to fly to elat in the southern part of Israel and now this obviously International Community will probably be quite concerned uh given the situation yes Sarah as you're saying I mean we've seen attacks on the Red Sea particularly on elat in the past couple of weeks since October the 7 but this is the first first time that a ship has been hijacked in this way what do we expect the Israelis to do next well last time this happened in 2021 when that explosion happened on that ship uh it took time of course to uh say that Iran was behind it uh but this time it's been very quick to blame Iran uh even though Israel says that it's not fighting war on several fronts it's trying to focus on Gaza but it seems to be that this has become a regional concern where you have uh the uh uh um hthis in Yemen that are T trying to Target Israel you also have the armed group Hezbollah which is also backed by Iran on that southern uh border with the northern border rather with Lebanon uh so it will be a major cause for concern because this really does show another level of escalation you had several attempts by the hthis in terms of sending those drones to try and strike uh Israel especially in that southern area in elat uh one of them had actually seemed to have been a mistake that ended up hitting or targeting an area in Egypt inish in that part of uh the country but here you are now uh this will be a major concern especially for those uh shipping companies where millions and multi-million dollar business that could also uh effectively affect the uh trade that will be going through from Asia via the mid least to Europe and vice versa right thank you Sarah we'll let you go for now thank you for that update that's Sarah K reporting for us so now let's bring in uh dorsa Jabari uh to find out whether there's been any Iranian reaction dorsa to uh Israel quickly pointing the finger at Iran yes uh well first of all daring there has been no evidence uh put forth that Iran is behind this this is an accusation made by the Israeli Prime Minister's office without any uh concrete evidence uh to support the allegations that Iran is behind this now Iranian officials in the past few uh weeks since the October 7th attacks have been warning that there is a potential for this conflict to escalate in the region and we've heard from Iran supreme leader from the Iranian for Minister Iranian president all saying that it's a very very tense situation and it has the potential to escalate as we've just seen today that escalation taking place but in terms of this specific attack we've only just heard from the Iranian foreign minister who uh issued uh comments following a meeting with MPS briefing them about the latest developments in the region and Hussein Amir Abdullah hyan said that the resistance groups are quote cleverly adjusting pressure on Israel and it supporters and have unactivated capacity for pressure that's according to um State media that the foreign minister has made these comments now uh Iran in the past has distanced itself from these uh various uh groups in the Middle East who are um against Israel and the existence of Israel as a country uh the Iranians were the first the supreme leader was the first to H comment after the October 7th Hamas attack and Israel saying that Iran had no knowledge of the attack there was no cooperation between Iran's revolutionary guard and Hamas fighters to plan or carry out the attack and that Iran supports palestini resistance groups in uh politically and um economically in terms of uh Aid uh and very adamant that Iran had no part in that attack but he we have heard since that uh given Israel's continuous bombardment of Gaza and what they are doing as Iranians call it a genocide of the Palestinian population in Gaza the conflict will spread it will not be contained to just Gaza and H the hes in Yemen are part of the so-called access of resistance of groups that Iran has called um meaning these groups that fight are against the existence of Israel and the occupation of Israel and Palestine and we' seen nearly 60 attacks take place from uh Syria Iraq and uh Yemen against um Israel all right dorsa thank you so much that's dorsa Jabari reporting from Iran let's speak to B Shaban who's a yemeni political commentator who's been following developments joining us from London thanks for your time what's her reaction to this development well I think um it's an it's an interesting timing because uh yemenis um have been uh meeting in Riyad they were very close uh to sign uh what it looked like a permanent uh ceasefire uh but this seems to be a constant uh challenge with uh with the uh with the houthis which is kind of it's going to be now a similar situation like hisbah where basically one party um is uh deciding on behalf of everyone that whether they can uh engage in a foreign conflict or not uh now in general the Yemen people have been uh supportive of the Palestinian plight uh the uh public and official uh uh uh statements and position of Yemen as a country has been in general supportive of the uh of the uh uh Palestinian cause uh they in general uh of course yenes do not support normalization with with with Israel now that's the public stance uh but they want to engage this within the Arab framework so they don't would like Yemen not to be engaged with a with a foreign conflict the houthis unilaterally the think that actually it is better for Yemen to be part of this you know so-called AIS of resistance and therefore uh they they want to engage they want to to say actually no we can do something so does this have the potential does this have the potential then to escalate absolutely I mean this this risks escalating the uh because now you're inviting the Israelis to respond you're also putting the United States under a heavy spot because the United States kind of the guarantor for the security of the American time routs across the across the Red Sea this put also a lot of pressure regarding the insurance companies I wanted to ask you all this in fact strategically right so strategically how significant is this development on a global scale well it is significant because Yemen has always been important I mean it's it's kind of an an interesting thing because when the situation the conflict happened in Yemen the main interest for the International Community is this for this conflict now not to spill over and threaten the uh International uh International Security Now this seems to be the case the case right now uh the other thing is that of course everyone knows about when uh the ships are being uh you know uh threatened across the Red Sea this basically puts um uh insurance companies H you know companies have to pay higher price right now for any ship going through the through the Red Sea and the houti leader himself had been threatening so right now what the H are saying that we were serious when Abdul Malik Ali was announcing that he's going to hit uh targets uh in the Babel mandab Strait that we are serious and we mean business so do you expect then Yemen and the houthis to continue to play that card that they have with the Babel aland straight As We Know it's one of the world's busiest shipping lanes carries about a fifth of global oil consumption uh I think I I'm I'm I'm I'm afraid I do because the um one of the things that the houthis constantly aspire to is seeking legitimacy through um such actions they want to tell their base Who Remain of course in general people Yemen are supportive of the Palestinian cause uh that we are actually um helping in this uh ongoing fight in uh fight in fighting Gaza and uh the uh uh um the other thing is because it also distracts attention from the demands of the yeni public inside this is an easy scape goat that you can actually start engag in a in a in a in a in another conflict and um it it doesn't cost much I mean you can you know they they can continue um threatening ships and then uh they know that the appetite of the International Community to be engaged again in another conflict in Yemen is very low at the moment no one wants to go into a fight inside Yemen all right we'll leave it there thank you bar Shaban thank you for speaking to us from London
