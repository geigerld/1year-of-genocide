well John hendren joins us live now from uh Chicago John you've been speaking to the protesters uh earlier quite a few of them actually what are they calling for exactly well the first protest is over now you wouldn't know it but those are the remnants of them there but just about a half an hour ago or so the protest ended after hundreds and what looked like probably over a thousand demonstrators marched through the streets of Chicago and as I think we're going to see often this week it was a wide array of issues they were calling for uh Reproductive Rights uh lgbtq issues um and then of course there were a number who were also protesting against the war in Gaza and uh unlike many of the protests we're going to see later in the week this is one where they actually uh are outside of the regular protest zones and they March down Michigan avue the most iconic Avenue in Chicago and shut down uh the about a mile long portion of the city they were escorted by police it was entirely peaceful there were as far as we could tell no arrests but among that crowd there were there were people who were who were calling for a broad array of issues and of course Gaza was a big one and this is a a quote from one of those that we spoke to on that issue what brings you here yeah yeah so my dad immigrated here from Palestine when he was 18 I've known the occupation and the hardships that Palestinians have had to face throughout the years since 1948 leading up till now the you know uh genocide happening in Gaza and so I'm here today to do whatever I can in whatever capacity I can for the people the innocent people by 40,000 innocent people who are dying right now in Gaza and you're here protesting at the Democratic National Convention is that safe to say that you won't be voting for Comm Harris yeah I would say as of right now my vote is not with KLA Harris um I hope that that could change um I'm somebody who's open um to always having their mind changed I think what it comes down to is whether or not you're going to take a legitimate stance against a country that's acting out and the whole world sees that that's why we have a un un and so when America goes against the UN and systematically vetos various treaties and various positions that the whole world wants to see that call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza right now so no more women and children die I I think that it's important that kamla back that and until she can do that um Jill Stein will will have my vote and Jill Stein is with the green party so a third party and you were saying earlier you think it's important that third parties uh in the US grow yeah exactly I don't agree with all um that the green party has on its on its uh plate but that said I also don't think the green party you know legitimately has a chance at this stage in 2024 to beat the DNC or RNC but that that said I think it's important that we make this our year to start putting our efforts into other parties so that way we can build those up over time and hopefully that they have a chance that's true democracy having more candidates on the ballots for voters to choose not for big machine political parties to choose and John just moving now to uh tomorrow where we're expecting uh to see uh 4 days of this uh convention we know that Harris has been formally now she will be formally declared as the Democratic nominee what else are we expecting over these next 4 days well these 4 days are really a celebration of the democratic party for the viewers out there on television and it's an opportunity for those delegates in the Democratic party to sort of get their moment in the sunshine but all the formal business has really taken place normally in the old days before when a convention happened like this it would be at the convention that the ultimate nominee was elected and that the delegates would vote for them this time they've done that in advance by a roll call that was virtual so when they announc kamla Harris and Tim Walls will be the nominees on Tuesday that will have already all taken place and it will really just be an opportunity for speaker after speaker to anoint the next person that they hope will be president of the United States and in this case of course it would be the first black woman president it would be the first South Asian President and there will be a number number of speakers first of all on Monday Joe Biden gets his due he will speak and then it's the first lady and the second Gentleman on Tuesday who will speak as well we expect Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton and of course ultimately kamla Harris and Tim Walls to cap off this 4-day celebration of the democratic party and what they're hoping to do is have viewers back the party learn what kamla Harris stands for because of course she's only been in the race a number of weeks and then we'll be motivated to vote for them uh so in the end kamla Harris will accept but it's really a surprise to nobody in a party for the television viewers well thanks John hendin there live for us from Chicago of course we'll be covering this extensively here over the next few days on aljazera we're still ahead here make sure to subscribe our channel to get the latest news from aler
