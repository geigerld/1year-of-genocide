well it's now been 17 days since the war in Gaza began and Israel is continuing its bombing campaign at least 400 Palestinians have been killed in some of the worst overnight attacks on the territory according to health officials in Gaza well humanitarian Aid does continue to enter as hospitals are in dire need of medical supplies thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter and schools are now receiving some aid but people say what they need most is for the attacks to stop on Monday Israeli air strikes hit several locations including neighborhoods in Gaza City now many families and children have been displaced after their homes were left in Ruins and Israeli forces have intensified raids too in the occupied West Bank dozens of Palestinians were detained there overnight two killed during an Israeli raid in the jalone refugee camp now since the start of the war on October 7th more than 5,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in Gaza according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces have killed 95 in the past 2 weeks in Israel 1400 people were killed in hamas's military operation Harry forcett begins our coverage nighttime brings no respit for Palestinians in Gaza instead More Death more destruction the Israeli Army says it hit 320 targets during the night children among the victims gaza's Health Ministry says about 2,000 have been killed so far medical and rescue crews work through the dark to pull people from the rubble they're only lights torches and car headlamps electricity is scarce in the strip under a complete blockade by Israel rescue workers and volunteers are sent scrambling by another Israeli missile strike nearby those rescued are taken to one of the D windling number of hospitals still functioning but even there the threat is constant another bomb near the alud hospital creating Panic for those inside and the strikes continued further south where the Israeli Army has been telling Palestinians to flee we were told that Khan unun is considered to be a safe place and everyone came here from the North or from Gaza City but unfortunately last night was the hardest night so far we saw Khan Unice when we moved to Kan Yunis with my family there were 17 of us then after the Israelis hit us and betrayed us there's only four of us left I can understand how the four of us will live and how we will return to our home in gazi after 17 of us used to live together this is a real nightmare one I will never forget for the rest of my life nearby what Aid has so far got in through Egypt is being sorted and prioritized it is mainly medical supplies for the hospitals there is also a small amount of food supplies which we had received we will work with the Palestinian red cresant to start distribution instantly to those in need we will distribute in the South and are hoping to reach to the north of Gaza to deliver the aid for those in need some of that work is now underway but Aid agencies continue to call for a sustained reliable Supply one that includes desperately needed fuel for a population Under Siege and under unrelenting bombardment Harry foret Al jazer well the CM brigades has now released video footage showing the launch of its kamakazi drones into Israeli territory the military wing of Hamas said it targeted sites in Israel for the first time since it's offensive more than two weeks ago well let's speak to alzer's hanni abuba he's live for us from Khan yunes in the Gaza Strip honey we have been now hearing about a a third Aid Convoy that's heading into the strip do we know where the aid that's gotten in so far has gone yes for the past half an hour we received reports confirming the the entrance of the third uh batch of humanitarian a from the Egyptian side uh those trucks were uh arrived this morning at the Egyption side from Alish City they were checked to cleared and then transferred to designated United Nations uh trucks and then at this particular hour they have been allowed to enter the Palestinian uh territories now these Aid uh are going to be uh taken from the area of the Raa Crossing all the way to designated uh Ona uh warehouses where they will be sorted and prioritize so far we know the United Nations and its uh operations uh Branch uh have prepared lists and and and made and specify locations where those AIDS are going to we don't we don't know exactly where but we know the uh the the lists have been prepared and exact locations have been also identified for these AIDS to be delivered we also uh received a a report from a source confirming the arrival of a fourth batch of medical supplies only Med supplies and a medical team arriving Alish airport uh on the Egyptian side uh we don't know when this is going to be uh entering Gaza could be uh tomorrow or the day after tomorrow depending on the coordination the process uh it's necessary to point out that so far uh these Aid Convoy only contained uh Food Supplies and medical supplies there is zero fuel supply supplies entering the Gaza Strip now it's also important to mention that a 20 trucks even 40 or 50 or 100 uh it's just so little compared to the needs of the of the Palestinian Gaza Strip Gaza needs daily 500 trucks uh of of of Aid of Food Supplies medical supplies and other and other supplies honey we know some 400 people have been killed just in the last 24 hours and the strikes are continuing in the South where people have fled where you are currently what have you been seeing and hearing well for the past hour we worked on verifying the number and we learned from a source at the Ministry of Health that the number of people who have been killed uh throughout uh the past 24 hours have reached 500 people now and it's an in an official statement by the Ministry of Health uh uh all of this is happening under a mass bombardment and air strike just at about 3:00 uh we were preparing for a live from the hospital a a house a a few hundred meters away from the main entrance of the hospital was targeted by four uh by four missiles and those C of missiles are the warning that are sent by Israeli drones in a preparation for complete destruction by an F16 uh it's it's a very scary scene right now because everybody's anxious and expecting a bomb being a drop at any moment I'm sure that sounds terrifying honey abua they're on the ground for us from hunis in the Gaza Strip thank you so much honey and please stay safe
