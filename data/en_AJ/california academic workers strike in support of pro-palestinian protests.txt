on the campus of the University of California Los Angeles unionized student teachers researchers and lab assistants set up a picket line on the very spot where a Gaza solidarity protest was broken up by Riot police earlier this month the student workers say their rights were violated then and they are demanding now that the University of California system declare amnesty from reprisals for any students or faculty members who participated in the protests it means that classes are cancelled um students won't be getting well first exams and other uh tests and and assignments will not be administered you know the university makes diplomas that's that's the kind of factory it is and so if we can withhold the deg the grades that make the diplomas um that's an impact we can have on the functioning of the university and hopefully that will push the administration to actually take our demand seriously the University of California says the labor stoppage is illegal because it violates the no strike clause in the Union's contract it asked the State Labor Board to order workers to Halt the strike but the board refused Strikers say the university deliberately endangered its own students you know there's so much discourse now about Jewish students being or feeling unsafe on campus as a Jewish student I know why I'm feeling unsafe on campus it's because of the cops it's because of UCLA Administration and it's because of the sist fascist that they've allowed on campus the strike is underway at three of the 10 University of California campuses so far with workers at other schools likely to walk out in coming days while the strikes disrupted campuses here in California across the country Gaza solidarity protesters were making their voices heard at graduation ceremonies at Brown University vocal protesters drowned out a speech by the University president you know I really like to give you your degrees do you want your degrees at Princeton a small group protested outside the gates of the stadium where the commencement ceremony was held inside dozens of graduates wearing cfas over their gowns stood and turned their backs on the University's president University administrators may have thought Riot police would solve their protest problem but students continue to find new ways to show their outrage and demand change Rob Reynolds Al jazer Los Angeles make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
