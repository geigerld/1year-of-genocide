faraja samuni has just been released from an Israeli jail more than 6 months after Israeli forces detained him near his home in the Gaza Strip surrounded by his family he struggles to describe his experience and what he says Palestinians inside Israeli prisons continue to endure I wish none of the detainees had to go through interrogation it is nothing but utter torture total torment may God help those detainees being interrogated by the Israel's internal security service tortured battered and are genitals beaten verbally and physically abused only God knows for God's sake set them free and release them from that hell Gage describes conditions inside the jail cells they are unimaginable disease broke out amongst the detainees around 30 are kept in one cell our bodies are plagued with abscesses mange Gang Green we were given only one cup of rice per day a piece of tomato and a piece of cucumber with a small loaf of bread these are some of the other 55 detainees who like farage were released at two locations in the besieged Gaza Strip on Monday morning I see he's ready forces neither announced the operation was happening nor coordinated with the Red Cross the condition of their bodies an indication of what they have endured show them brothers detainees have worms parasites in their bodies do something for them says one man abscesses have grown all over our bodies says another we were left without soap or water and only one quick bath every week among the released men is head of the ashifa hospital Muhammad Abu Salia he was detained in November with five other health workers while they helped a un mission to evacuate patients from the medical facility even those who have been detained for more than 10 years have been deprived of their rights and many were killed under interrogation many of the medical staff arrested have been denied food water and medson the Israelis have no red lines they deal with detainees like their objects not human beings even the Israeli Medics are involved in the beatings the Palestinian prisoner Association says there are around 10,000 Palestinians being held in Israeli jails at least 3,600 of them have never been charged with a crime or face trial Israel says it abides by international law in its treatment of them the testimonies physical and emotional scars of these men indicate that's a lie Charles stford Al jazer let's bring in now political commentator AI Goldberg he joins us live from Tel Aviv so Ari you may have been hearing some of the testimonies of people that were speaking to right now who've been released by the Israeli occupation authorities when you look at what the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for human rights all right I apologize it seems we've lost our connection with AI all right I'm I'm being told he can hear us now so let me try again so Ari hopefully you could hear the interview we were doing there with some of the people who've been released by Israeli authorities very disturbing stories but it's not the first time we're hearing this back on December the 16th we had a statement from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for human rights saying it had received what it called numerous disturbing reports from northern Gaza of ill treatment Mass detentions enforced disappearances of thousands of Palestinians is Israel taking statements from credible organizations seriously when we hear what daines are still saying months later upon their release well uh I'm afraid uh trying to ascribe any sort of seriousness to Israel at the moment is perhaps far-fetched um Israel's actions as far as I understand them are quite chaotic and even organizations that are based on strict discipline don't exhibit such discipline anymore um prisoners are being taken obviously they're being tortured uh the purpose of this torture and the information gleaned or the intelligence used to help IDF uh forces as they operate in Gaza these are questionable uh Because the actual nature and purpose of ID the idf's operation in Gaza is questionable the issue here is operating without any Clear Vision of uh say as it as previously of eliminating not going to happen this was what's happening now is all sorts operations aimed at but with no regard to what is calling collateral damage and taking uh of in horrible conditions is part and parcel of this quote unquote strategy part of what we're also hearing from people being released is about these claims that some of the medical facilities like a shiffer were being used for military purposes something those doctors deny an analysis by The Washington Post on December the 21st of 2023 found that there was little proof it said of any tunnels under a shiffer leading to a Hamas command and control center something that Israeli authorities had spoken about what do these increasing testimonies add to the picture of the The credibility of Israeli claims when they say look we we had to intervene in these medical institutions because they were command and control centers for Hamas Fighters well they make Israeli claims appear um highly let's call it problematic uh tunnels are to be found all all over underneath Gaza that's that's apparently a given but the headquarters and the notion that um if you Vis if you uh take these institutions if you occupy them if you arrest the staff you will find these headquarters and then you will be able to uh harm hamas's ability to act you'll be able to limit it to minimize it these claims I think uh have been proven to be mendacious repeat repeatedly uh alifa we have to remember was one of the biggest PR efforts of Israel's uh campaign in Gaza it was supposed to be even as far as the victory image when when the headquarters underneath asifa were to be revealed that was when Israel at least that was what we thought then that was when Israel would announce that the mission had been accomplished that of course did not happen one can only assume uh I think one of two things or perhaps both of them one is that again Israel has intentionally focused exclusively on the Tactical level of locating non Hamas operatives that means that if one person or another actually stayed in a hospital operated from a hospital met other known operatives at a hospital the hospital was was fair game it's a very very tactical approach I definitely think it characterizes a large part of IDF operations but the second option which again I think is very much a real one is that Israel has uh taken it upon itself to uh eliminate or destroy as much of the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip that makes it livable hospitals universities right or if I could jump in you know I'm sure you remember the icj has ordered that Israel allow fact finding missions to go in there and investigate are you hopeful at all any sign that Israel will comply with that so we can get to the bottom of allegations like this uh keeping in mind what even the history of how Israel has dealt with allegations and investigations even by its closest allies like Josh Paul from the US state department talking about how when he received reports of the rape of a 13-year-old boy and when he put these to Israeli authorities he said the next day he says the IDF went into the offices of the charity organization that had passed the state department this information removed all their computers not only banned the organization but declared the charity organization a terrorist entity how much hope does that leave one that Israeli authorities will allow credible independent investigations I'm afraid to say that my answer is absolutely no hope at all s uh Israeli policy has been very consistent Israel does not allow outside investigations Israel at most uh acknowledges and error and then um promises that it will investigate independently uh us uh I mean we here in Israel know that that is not the case Israel claims that its legal system uh operates independently and investigates uh such claims against IDF operations that is emphatically untrue Israel does not carry out these investigations if it does they are lip service only it doesn't convict it doesn't follow through it doesn't gather data uh and and if Israel doesn't do it the notion that Israel would allow some sort of outside authority to do it is um as far detached from reality as it can be thank you so much for your thoughts and Analysis on that Ari Goldberg there political commentator thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the
