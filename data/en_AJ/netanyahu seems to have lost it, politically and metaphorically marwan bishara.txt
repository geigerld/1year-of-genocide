well Maan bashara joins us now he's alzer's senior political analyst he is with us on Skype from Paris first of all can we just talk a little bit about Israel's response uh to Norway Ireland and Spain today they've threatened sanctions they're pulling their ambassadors Netanyahu has just said that this is a reward for terrorism what do you make of that do you think well you I mean first of all are you surprised by anything that he has to say at this point in time well I've been saying for a while now that Netanyahu has lost it he lost it both metaphorically and politically he lost it uh metaphorically uh simply because everything he stood for uh has basically uh imploded in front of our eyes and his eyes over the past eight months Mr security turned out to be Mr insecurity Mr long serving prime minister tend out to be indicted on important corruption charges um his idea of War uh Swift one against Hamas winning and reoccupying Gaza tend out to be a nightmare for the Israelis Israel is ever more isolated in the region and in the world so really all in all uh he lost it he lashes back against uh each and every person who criticize Israel calling them Nazis and anti-semitic even referring to the IC prosecutor as what did he call it Nazi judges or something he he he's B basically lost it and and in in more ways than one and I think his response about pulling ambassadors it just goes a long way to tell you how uh unintelligent rather foolish he's become in a way that imagine if other European countries other countries around the world do the same thing what is he going to do withdraw all Israeli ambassadors from all countries in the world just makes no sense whatsoever yeah do you think that this is actually going to change anything in the short term especially on the on the ground in Gaza it's not meant to change anything Gaza for for some this is a bit too little too late a bit symbolic and it's sort of a step by Europe to do something on Palestine without doing something serious against Israel as it carries its war crimes in Gaza so one has to be realistic uh skeptical about these steps but at the same time appreciate that there is a movement towards more recognition Palestinian rights I mean we can hold those two thoughts at the same time that this is little bit too little too late but this is also good thing that is happening for the Palestinians yeah there are huge divisions in Europe at the moment aren't there though because you've got Norway Spain and Ireland on one side but you've also got the likes of Germany and Italy which are providing huge amounts of weapons to Israel I think Germany is second only behind uh the US and the in the terms of how much it is spending in sending uh weapons to Israel yeah Germany is of course as we all know is a special case because of its history but one could have learned the lesson of History by saying never again is not just never again against Jews but never again against anyone that the world should not accept another genocide unfolding on TV screens on over our eyes as we speak so Germany took the narrow uh version of Never Again to mean that we going to Israel even if Israel carries a genocide against the Palestinians and I think there's a lot of American pressure on European powers like England France and the and Germany and so on uh to withhold their support for Palestinian rights even when Europe tends to be a bit more Progressive United States but also the United States is getting a bit desperate like Israel is getting desperate on its uh 30 years of the provin is leading to nowhere and instead of that they continue to uh double down and talk about direct negotiations that will lead to two set solution which is probably the the dumbest thing I've heard over the past so many years because we know and probably this is a time to write the book uh diplomacy for dummies because diplomacy and creative thinking does not lead to Major Solutions after uh after such long-term problems as in Israel Palestine what you need is a different strategic balance of power what you need is inter AAL pressure what you need is American pressure on Israel to change dire that's what leads to diplomatic breakthroughs not cynical talk about direct negotiations that we know that over 30 years it Le to nowhere and it will need to Nowhere if we have another 30 years of more of the same okay thanks so much Maran as always we really appreciate your Insight Maran Bashar are there elazer senior political analyst make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
