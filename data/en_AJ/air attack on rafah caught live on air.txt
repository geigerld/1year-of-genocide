the 46 Palestinians have been killed in more Israeli air strikes in northern gaza's jabalia city 40 others with serious injuries have been rushed to a medical center in the city dozens are feared to be stuck under the rubble and bodies of 29 Palestinians killed in Israeli raids have been brought to the NASA Hospital in Khan yunes in southern Gaza Israeli war planes have bombed several buildings in the city hanim Mahmud is in rafah in southern Gaza for us so hny what more are we hearing on Israeli air strikes yes well within the past couple hours more Relentless air strikes are concentrated in the northern part and in the southern part mainly in Han Unis and the central part of the gri but the the latest that we have from jabalia where massive Relentless air strike destroying more of the residential homes that includes not only homes but also public facilities including schools and and shops and an area that better known as a market a Central Market in jabalia came under heavy Mass bombard there are more than 40 people who have been killed reported killed and 40 other or a little over than that number been injured and rushed to uh surrounding medical centers when we refer to those Medical Center we're not talking about hospitals because there are no functioning hospitals in the northern part nor in Gaza City we're talking about a very very basic places that can do basic in medical intervention to save uh whoever they are able uh with light ones H but so far what we're hearing it from reports from North part in Gaza that the uh the the people who are injured and those are strike they come into these these places or these particular locations for medical attention they come with severe ones as well as some of them come with a with part of their their their bodies are are are cut off or torn apart a similar situation we' seen this in the central part in earlier hours of of this morning when an air strike s Dar balah destroyed another residential home but causing a great deal of damage to the surrounding homes the aftermath of this of course not only people get died on from those air strikes and and CR being becoming critically injured but also the remaining population the area gets to be displaced and and this is the uh the tragedy of every air strike causing more problem and forcing more Palestinian to displacement which can of course Mount the pressure uh on on on healthc Care Facility as well as evacuations Z as we're we're getting into [Music] [Applause] yes oh my god did you hear that yes yes we oh my God that's the hospital that's the hospital that's the hospital oh my God are you guys hearing that yes we are we are hearing that hny are you are you okay are you are you in a safe place oh my God no no no no this is really bad this is bad are you guys seeing this yes we are we are seeing this is right behind the hospital right now we are we are seeing that it was it was a very loud explosion Hy are you are you okay to to us right now because if not we can come back to you a little bit later the important thing is that you stay safe you and you and your team there stay safe okay are you guys see yes as you see this is a huge huge Dark Cloud of smoke this is what we were expecting for five days this drone did not leave the sky of this area flying at a low level and I think what it was marking a target of more residential homes people now are rushing to the site just to see if if there are people I guess we're we're looking at a a tragedy right now it's causing a chaos you see people are running away from from the side of of the explosion those were multiple massive air strikes right at the vicinity of the Kuwaiti Hospital you see people are panicking they can't even walk indeed we we've been reporting on this this is really bad just to jump in here for a moment um Hy I see people are rushing now down the road this is this is multiple multiple multiple residential homes and we we're hearing there were were people inside those homes that were targeted there are home these were homes full of evacuees and this place Palestinians at this particular location more than three residential homes completely destroyed you see this is this is exactly what we've been talking about there is no safe place in Gaza at all no safe place in Gaza no place more safe than the other even the vicinity of this hospital this a Smalls siiz Hospital become became a target of those Relentless air strikes that's exactly what we describe every word describing these air strikes being relentless at aggressive and brutal Hy if I could if I could just jump in for a moment I want to ask you as far as you know is this the first time that this particular hospital has been targeted no no no before before we move to this vicinity and I start reporting it from when we were busy in kanun a residential home down the road was targeted and destroyed and every time we drive from home from where we are we have evacuated to this area we see the rubbles and there are writings across the road sorry suffocating the debris and the the smoke is killing us but uh there a residential home earlier uh this month was was destroyed uh down the road of the hospital and we there were more than 10 people were killed in that in that area uh Hy can you tell us this is not the first time I mean the the attacks of the past two nights were very close as well what is what is the name of the hospital there that that has been attacked Annie can you hear me this is we're reporting from the vicinity of the Kuwaiti yes the Kuwaiti Specialized Hospital this is a small siiz right here the the attack happened on the surrounding it's it's on the surrounding residential homes just down the road there is a roundabout that takes you from the area into the main road uh to the other neighborhoods in RAF City and those residential homes at the roundabout were completely destroyed now we we're hearing it from people who ran from the area they said these homes were full of people I'm telling you this hospital will not be able to take this number of injuries that will start coming to the hospital this is overwhelming for the hospital and the medical alhamdulillah so hany are you can you still he hear me oh my God yes I do yes yes yes I wonder if I could hearing about entire families inside those buildings women and children four families were inside those buildings Hy I wonder if I could ask you what we just witnessed there how does this compare with previous attacks that you have reported on and and that you have seen there yourself you know what this can be compared to what we have been reporting on since the early morning this hour there is an increase in intensity a magnitude of those attacks they are done at this level on purpose just to inflict as much damage and as much killing as much pain on people we're seeing since early hours of this morning entire families being wiped out people is it's like a whole sale Slaughter of of Palestinians the the problem here we we're hearing it from people those residen Shalom one of them is full of displaced Palestinian that's exactly the problem of the Israeli narratives telling people to move to Safe area but to find thems under those uh severe and brutal bombs in in those areas and we we thought this is a relatively good area to stay in but this is beyond imagination I'm I'm seeing look at the the children just panicking women everyone okay we're getting worse now more ambulance are rushing because the number of injuries not only inside the building but those who were at the vicinity of the area as well were injured by the debris that sharpen out hany uh as we've been reporting for for for days and hours of this War uh this the bombing that's been going on has has been Relentless and we are if anyone was wondering uh getting a sense of of of just uh what Palestinians are dealing with on a daily basis we are seeing it in real time right now uh in front of us and we just heard um that explosion as we as we were uh reporting uh live live with you just a couple of minutes ago and as you were saying lots of ambulances rushing to the scene right now uh to the scene of that explosion which as you were saying hany is uh near the the one of the hospitals in RAF um and as we've been reporting before hany it just reminds us once again that there is really no safe place for Palestinians in Gaza not not at all not not a single not a single foot is safe in in the gala strip right now air strike Relentless Mass bombardment from North to th and this the the tragedy of this a of this air strike is the fact that more people are going to become this place an area that's being targeted becomes less and less safe for people and we're going to see more people leaving to evacuation Zone and evacuation centers where the humanitarian situations are very difficult so not only they're being bombed now but also and killed but they are also will become displaced and hungry and living in the worst living conditions possible indeed and as we're as we're uh I I I see more people rushing carrying bodies carrying injuries and dead bodies coming to the hospit now this is a group of people running and carrying what seems to be a dead body to the hospital yes it is a dead body oh God H unfortunately ham this is the the situation that every place where Relentless targeting takes it Place uh I mean we're not in the northern part to report the the tragedies of people experiencing it since early morning uh since the early hours of this morning in jabalia and Gaza City but this is a real life example of what people have been experiencing for the past 70 days Relentless bombardment it is it is happening it is happening in front of our eyes in real time and just to remind our viewers Hanny is reporting to us uh from Rafa in the southern tip of the Gaza Strip where so many Palestinians uh have had to converge on because of the fighting that began in the northern part of Gaza uh and the the Gaza Strip which is already a very densely populated uh area of land is even uh more uh densely populated in the southern part because of so many Palestinians that have been forced to move there but as we have been saying uh throughout this our coverage of this story there really is no safe place for pales Ians in Gaza to go to at this point and we are certainly get getting a sense of that from these pictures we seeing ambulance is rushing to the scene uh and looks like the ambulance is coming away from the scene of that explosion right now I wonder hany if you're still there if you can just talk to us a little bit more about what is happening in front of you yes there are more ambulance paramedics are coming back from the site carrying number of injuries into the hospital now the problem with this hospital is that small it's a small siiz hospital and will not be able to take this number this large number of injuries coming to the hospital we'll see in a bit more ambulance leaving here carrying those injuries transferring them to surrounding medical centers and other larger size hospitals in the area namely a Nar hospital and the Gaza European Hospital to the Eastern side of Rafa this hospital will not be able to uh to to to survive if if we have a large number coming into it it's mainly for basic intervention and eventually they will have to be transferred from now from here uh to other hospital but the there is what we hear from people is the the level of damage caused to the surrounding homes is beyond imagination these homes that are severely damage not the destroyed one are becoming not suitable for living we're talking about falling uh falling walls and destruction from the inside of these of these homes will force more people to seek shelters somewhere else and at this point particularly I can see with confidence people will start moving to evacuation zones and evacuation centers the honare designated school which are by the way are not safe and we seeing the constant attacks on them in the northern part and Gaza City and Han Unis where more of these schools being the target of Israeli air strikes and artillery chilling the scene is very chaotic it's causing panic I mean you wouldn't see this number of people uh had there not been thousand of displaced in the area all of these people here happen to be displaced Palestinians coming from from different parts of the G who are now worried of staying in this area this is not the first time this is the second time in less than couple weeks that has come under heavy Relentless air strikes we're getting words about more than more than 25 people been critically injured mainly children and and women brought to the kuti hospital and hany if I could just jump in here for a moment just give us a sense of of where you are uh in relation to the the surrounding area there because going by the pictures that we're looking at now this looks like a um a fairly busy part of of of RAF right now you were referring there to evacuation zones I wonder if you could tell me where where are how far are these so-called evacuation zones uh to to where you are right now in where all right well the evacuation zones in here they're not far from here they're about 15 minutes to drive it from the vicinity of the Kuwaiti hospitals uh but uh we are here right next to this small building that acts as a medical center it's a Specialized Hospital but for basic intervention not for complicated large uh we see okay there is this is these are injuries that are they're performing CPR on this person this is an injury brought from the S of Target him no ambulance was available people rushed him on a cart pulled by a donkey this is how desperate the situations now in the this injured man brought to the hospital on a cart pulled by an animal to the hospital back to evacuation zones are not from here there are multiple areas including the largest evacuation Zone that was set up by by people when they were told to move from Khan unun and the central part of the Gaza Strip to RAF Al maasi is is is is the probably the largest evacuation Zone but it lacks all the necessary basic supplies in terms of Water Supplies and Food Supplies the living conditions of of evacuees and displaced Palestinians in these zones are very difficult and if they if they if they don't happen to die from these bombs they will die from the spread of diseases which are by the way byproducts of the ongoing Misery the ongoing bombardment that destroyed everything basically all means of life in terms of Sanitation and hygiene facilities more than 85% of infrastructure have been destroyed all right hny we're going to uh I think at this point we're just going to let you have a breather right now and and give you and your team uh a moment to collect yourselves but stay with us because we will come back to you we're going to play uh right now uh the moments uh that that explosion um occurred just just a couple of minutes uh when we were reporting live with hany hi yes oh my god did you hear that oh my Hospital oh my God are you guys hearing that so there's there was the uh the clip there that um as we were reporting to uh hany can and you could hear him there saying that that's the location of the hospital it happened just a few minutes ago
