hello we begin in Gaza where Israeli war planes have continued their attacks on residential areas in the center and the South a warehouse Sheltering displaced Palestinians was hit inah ambulances took the injured to AA hospital nearby at least 27 a half thousand Palestinians have been killed since Israel's war on Gaza started in early October and a series of Israeli air strikes have also targeted the city of fah in southern Gaza ambulances took the injured to the Kuwaiti Hospital nearly 2 million Palestinians are in the area on the border with Egypt after being told by Israel to leave the north of Gaza displaced Palestinians who fled to Central Gaza from the north say they have no water to drink we don't have a single tomato there is no water no electricity no food nothing to drink no bathrooms we use the tents and we drowned our women drowned our children drowned and we are humiliated it's enough it's enough we do not want Wars we've been displaced from Gaza for 115 days today we've been abandoned we have children and now we're infected with diseases it really is truly enough we'll now speak to Han Mahmud Han's joining us from ra and Southern Gaza Han and that is where there have been air strikes overnight and also um increasing worries that the ground offensive May begin soon what are you hearing on the ground yes Daren we're not only will looking at more than half of Gaza population crammed in RAF City displaced hungry cold but more profoundly right now and given the attacks and overnights and early hours of of this morning in fact ongoing artillery Shilling and massive built of fires around the city city of RA we're seeing a largely terrorized population overnight we're talking about 11 people have been killed inside residential homes they were Sheltering in in a series of Relentless air strikes in Salam at Salam neighborhood that's at the southern part of rafah City very close to the Egyptian rafah border as well as in the central part of rafah City an area largely designated a safe area for the vast majority of displ Palestinians who arrived to had the initial weeks of of the war and more of this just within the past couple hours a more intense bombing campaign taking place is still in ra City while at the same time there is a growing fear and concern of an imminent ground Invasion going to come to RAF and very consistent largely consistent with statements made by the Israeli military officials or the political leaders about the intention of coming to ra just throwing the fate of all displaced Palestinians here the 1.9 million displaced pal to uncertainty as there is no place to go to ra is the last safe refuge for palestini and it hasn't been largely safe and uh since the beginning of the war it has been repeatedly attacked and causing great deal of damage and causing further civilian death particularly in areas in central of the western part of it where Al maasi evacuation Zone has been set up for hundreds of thousand of pal who have turned the city into a t Camp so far in central area on Khan unun the more of the bombing campaign continues to crush remaining residential buildings causing further civilian casualties in D Bahan area again designated a safe area a warehouse where uh hundreds of Palestinians where Sheltering inside came under heavy artillery Shing and heavy machine guns by tanks several people were injured and rushed to alaka hospital right in Han unun around the vicinity of Naser Hospital the remaining Residential Building were targeted destroyed and just causing a great deal of panic for those who remain inside the hospital particularly in elderly and injuries inside the hospital yeah and hany the the humanitarian uh disaster uh continues to unfold and we're hearing reports of people in parts of the Gaza Strip who simply don't even have drinking [Music] water yes that is correct and around the area where we're reporting it from there is a a a a desolation station here that hasn't been operating efficiently given the fact that there is not enough fuel to run the power generators so people can get access to clean drinking water the vast majority of water available right now is contaminated water and we we we we are aware of the cases documented by the World Health Organization I and by Medical Teams in ra city of of the spread of diseases particularly poisons and hepatitis A given the contamination in the the drinking water particularly in evacuation zones where we talk about very crowded packed areas and and list sanitation available right now the infrastructure for Hygiene has been largely destroyed or severely damaged by the ongoing uh bombings it just not only drinking water that is not available but also basic needs we're talking about survival items things that are needed by women as well as newborn babies or little children who are in need of these survival items to help them combat these difficult condition now all of this happening of course while at the same time there mounting pressure as again talks about the possibly ground invasion is going to cause further destruction and further civilian casualties and it's important to point out the vast majority of health facilities in Rafa City are small or midsize Hospital largely unequipped and unprepared for large numbers of injuries thank you so much H Mahmud reporting for us from in the south of the Gaza strip
