now the UN Security Council is to hold another emergency meeting on Monday that's after the United Arab Emirates called for another one seeking a humanitarian pause to the fighting in Gaza last week the general assembly voted in favor of a resolution for an immediate truce the US and its Ally Israel were among the countries who voted against kimley Halid is live at the White House but first let's head straight to unhq in New York Gabriel elisondo is standing by there and so Gabe first up the UN Security Council has failed to agreed so far might this change well we'll see I can tell you that here at the UN headquarters uh they are watching events in Gaza very closely and many of the member states are quite concerned this emergency meeting of the security Council called by the United Arab Emirates is expected to happen at about 19 GMT 3 p.m. local time here in New York the Security Council is expected to be briefed by top un officials uh in the region uh from unra the United Nations relief and work agency in the Gaza as well as the uh OSHA the coordination for humanitarian Affairs office it's important let me just point out the latest numbers from the UN unra they're saying that now 63 of their staff members have been killed in Gaza from the Israeli bombardment they are saying that they are housing about 672 th000 uh internally dis bled people in Gaza in about 149 un shelters and they say just in the last 72 hours UNR is reporting that 44 of their facilities in Gaza have been damaged from bombardment now aside from this I will point out that we are hearing that uh Malta and the UAE are working on another draft resolution behind the scenes uh for this Security Council already four drafts have been uh voted down at the security Council and or vetoed since this conflict began but we're hearing that the elected 10 if you will of the security Council are working on another draft resolution uh urgently given the escalation and uh trying to get that to a point where perhaps it could come to a vote uh in the next day or two all right Gabe back with you as as that goes on uh you headquarters Let's cross over to Washington DC to the White House and fact our White House correspondent kimy halat is standing by for us there and kimbery so the President Joe Biden he's under pressure nearly a year before the election how does that factor into everything that's going on as far as his uh stance and position is concerned well overall the American public has been largely supportive of what the president has been doing in terms of support for Israel and that is also indicated in the US Congress but when you dive a little bit deeper and you look at what Democrats specifically uh feel about the president's handling of this conflict that's where there start to be some problems for the US president and what we've been seeing among Democrats particularly over the last decade is a decline in support and it has to do with the fact that there is growing concern about the plight of the Palestinian people among the more Progressive wing of the democratic party uh we've had a number of Democrats that have sent a letter to Joe Biden calling for him to H call for a ceasefire uh We've also had uh members of Congress who have said that there needs to be a more urgent uh priority put on bringing humanitarian Aid to Gaza so uh when you look at those numbers they've actually declined pretty sharply since this conflict began and one month ago he had about 86% approval rating within the Democratic party for his foreign policy and specifically his handling of of uh Israel issues and and areas in the region but that has fallen at about 11 percentage points and that is a pretty dramatic drop considering it has been such a short time span so this is a problem for a president who's looking to get win reelection in a year's time kimy thanks very much indeed kimbley H at that was at yeah the white houseing in DC let's bring in Abdul Hamid ASM who's a professor of political science and middle studies at Ruto University joins us here in doart great to have you with us thank as we've just been hearing the United States very much focused on what's going on and it is in fact the key to what's going on uh in Gaza and has the power to ease the situation with a phone call from Joe Biden to Benjamin Neto is that likely to happen do you think they could do that they could at least allow a draft resolution the security Council to pass M there is now circulating a draft I just looked at it before I came mhm it it repeats the points that the US is insisting on that to condemn taking hostages allow to release all hostages to condemn Hamas but also to call for immediate uh humanitarian pose is still not final I mean the United Arab Emirates trying with other non uh permanent members to bring almost the same text that had passed in the general assembly to bring it to the security Council saying that it has been approved by over 120 countries so it's rather pass here in the security Council so if the US wants to ease the situation it could let it go and it could put some pressure it could empowered by the security Council resolution to tell Netanyahu enough is enough stop it it could do but what's your got feeling will it I don't think the US is now uh is restraining Netanyahu in any way it's for for uh electoral reasons one one thing and there are so much support among the military establishment in in Washington to support Israel without any restriction that is that's unfortunate there is no serious voices coming from the administration to to to tell Biden that is there are a tragedy is in the making we have to to interfere we have to do something but there is a growing voice within the country amongst the people and indeed protests around the world are growing that voice is getting louder and louder and sooner or later surely the leaderships are going to have to take notice it could most of the in the streets are the Young Generation lot of Peace activist many Jewish voices also uh go into the streets especially in Grand Central stration and the Congress so that could make a difference however what makes a difference is some kind of dissension among the European allies and it's moving there way I mean the Europeans might not continue with this blind uh support of the United States policy Vis A Israel especially with the with with now news about the tragedy taking place and their warning that there might be diseases and there might be also uh hundreds of or maybe thousand people under the red so for how long un can uh the I mean International Community can accept this going on I mean this hundreds of thousand of people are under the threat of Extinction if they don't stop it now uh this video released by Hamas of the uh prisoners in Gaza what do you make of that and and the pressure that it will put on the Israeli leadership I think it adds more pressure on Netanyahu it says also that the hostages are are in safe place they are fine and fed and they are frustrated with their government so that adds also to the pressure and uh it it it shows also there might be some kind of movement on that direction and that we are willing to release them if you address also the issues well heras have said that haven't they they said they are willing to do to swap all all their prisoners for all the Palestinian prisoners in Israel yeah does that got any traction do you think I I think there might be some release of some prisoners okay I mean the Israel arrested about 1,600 from the West Bank in the last few weeks since October 7 so that is there are about 300 children they could release that there are about 33 women they could release that so there could be I mean through a a good mediator just like that of Qatar for example right they could reach kind of an agreement to release good number of Palestinians who are not that of like with with a life sentence but at least some of those civilian we could call them civilians when you have 300 children when you have about 800 in detention center they had never been put on trial so why they are there you you don't you you don't indite them and you don't release them so they could be released so I think there might be some breakthrough in that direction all right uh ABD Hamid there's much to talk about but we'll do it later for the time being thanks very much thank you thank you so much
