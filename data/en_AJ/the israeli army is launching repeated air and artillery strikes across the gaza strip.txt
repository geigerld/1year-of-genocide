Israel carries out its largest ever bombardment on Gaza Hamas is now threatening to kill captives anytime civilians are targeted without warning it's been a deadly day of Devastation in the besieged enclaved civilians including women and children are among the dead in jabalia Israel says it has retaken control of Southern areas attacked by Hamas as the armed group continues its barrage of rockets towards Tel [Music] Aviv and Israel deploying more troops to its northern border area as Islamic Jihad claims responsibility for an incursion from neighboring Lebanon it's 1800 GMT that is 900 p.m. in Gaza where Palestinian homes continue to be targeted by air strikes an Israeli Army spokesman has described it as the largest ever bombardment of Gaza and we've now just heard from the spokesman of hamas's military Wing he said that the group would begin executing Israeli captives if Israel bombs civilian houses in Gaza without any pre-warning now a warning to our viewers that the pictures you're about to see from Gaza are disturbing these are the scenes from the jabalia neighborhood in the north of the Gaza Strip early today there are reports of mass casualties around 560 Palestinians and 900 Israelis have been killed in the most serious escalation in violence in decades Israel has also declared a total blockade of the Gaza Strip that means cutting off food fuel water and electricity the jabalia camp is the largest of eight refugee camps in the strip densely packed with more than 116,000 refugees not too far way is a un Run Elementary School though it was not impacted by Monday's air strike it's still not clear how many people died in that incident at jabalia now Tark Abu aom is live for us inside Gaza Tark we've been watching very intense bombardment of Gaza over the last few hours what are you hearing now well after the uh the series of uh devastating and even attacks that were carried out by the Israeli occupation forces inside the Gaza STP now uh uh relative uh tranquility and relative calm now is prevailing inside the Gaza Strip uh this uh impact did not come by chance uh this uh relative calm uh came after the threat of the uh spokesman of the military wing of the alasam of Hamas movement alasam brigades uh after mentioning that they will execute every civil captive Israeli captives uh if if there is any Palestinian house was completely destroyed without pre-warning now the uh the level of bombardment that we had witnessed uh during uh the early morning is uh absolutely were absolutely uh uh critical and serious uh bringing a catastrophic damage for the Palestinian uh civil infrastructure and even in terms of the death toll as well but after the announcement of the uh alasan brigades uh generally the uh level of the Israeli uh strikes uh decreased uh remarkably and maybe now the the poll is in the court of the uh Israeli occupation to study the uh statement that had been released by the militant uh group inside the Gaza strep now as you can uh clearly hear the sound of the Israeli drones hovering on the sky of the Gaza strap can be notably he looking for targets but the level of Destruction and even the level of targeting have uh remarkably uh decreased and uh this uh uh fake uh comb could uh quickly be turned upside down if the Israeli occupation decided to continue uh targeting the Gaza Strip on the same Rhythm what are the residents of Gaza doing you say right now there appears to be a lull in the bombardment even as we see lightning over the Skies of Gaza um what do residents of Gaza do during that time do they shelter at home or do they try to look for other areas of shelter now we can clearly say that the majority of Palestinians who are residing in the Eastern areas of the Gaza Strip which are adjacent to the borders they uh earlier of the occup of the uh conflict they were displaced from the houses they uh they went to H shelters uh specifically to the United Nations Affiliated schools in order to be protected from the Israeli uh Shillings as well uh and the other part of the Palestinian people inside the Gaza Strip are now on the houses uh they don't have any proper shelters to be uh secured and protected from the Israeli strikes now uh we can clearly uh say that the humanitarian condition in the Gaza Strip is absolutely on the age of of collapse uh simply because uh now the internet access have been uh cut in different areas inside the Gaza Strip as you can right now uh can clearly hear the uh Israeli strikes continued after uh this frequent calm disappeared and let's uh say that the Palestinian people are experiencing uh human catastrophic consequences of the Israeli ongoing strikes now the majority of central uh oh that explosion was so close uh the the the ongoing strikes of the Israeli occupation on General Public streets and even on the uh main roads uh led to the inability of movement now Palestinians cannot really move freely by using their own vehicles but they tend to walk on foot in order to get and even to buy their own needs and it's important also to mention that now if I can get you to pause a second buildings are destroyed what what are you hearing because we have live footage and we are seeing very impressive bombardment of the uh of the um Gaza Skyline what are you hearing true right now a number of buildings inside the Gaza Strip are being hit by the Israeli uh fighter jets now the sound of the Israeli fighter jets are can be overly uh hear and the the uh the attacks continued after a a short period of calm and it has been resumed again now from time to another we can clearly hear these kinds of explosions but since the early hours of today the uh the speed and even the quality of targeting were uncomparable with the uh with with the previous conflicts that Gaza really had with the Israeli occupation now the areas that have been hit in Gaza um do people normally get a warning well uh we can clearly see that uh we say that the uh the Eastern areas of the Gaza Strip since the early beginning of this uh conf lict they received warnings only to evacuate the houses in order to be safe from the Israeli strikes but later after the uh series of uh fire exchange between uh the militant groups and the Israeli occupation forces Israel tend to directly Target alers without any previous warnings and a clear example of that is the uh the massacre that had been committed uh today's uh afternoon in uh jabalia refugee camp uh the place that has been hit in the refugee camp is a public street that used for um for transferring goods and even for uh even for uh civil uh facilities and interactions so we can clearly see that throughout these attacks and throughout the number of casualties resulted from the Israeli strikes now it becomes so clear that Israel tend to directly it houses without sending pre-ww warnings to its dwellers all right tar abazo stay say if you're in Gaza we'll come back to you for an update on what's happening there for now
