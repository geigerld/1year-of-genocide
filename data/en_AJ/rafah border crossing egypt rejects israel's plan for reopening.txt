Iman Khan joins us now live from am man in Jordan because Israel has shut down alzer's operations in Israel so we're reporting from outside the country Imran look listening to these comments I guess they show just how strained relations are right now between Egypt and Israel right that's absolutely right these comments come from uh president CCE after the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly said that uh The rafha Crossing could open but Egypt didn't want to open it now Egypt and Israel have a very complicated security relationship um agreement the beginnings of that were Camp David which was set up in uh 1979 the Accords that were signed out C David when specifically talking about Rafa meant that Rafa should be demilitarized and Palestinians should be in control of the Gaza side of the crossing one clearly those two things are not happening president cc is also uh saying effectively uh to the Israelis that you are in Gaza you've created this mess this is and isn't on us but you also have to remember uh the Egyptians are under a tremendous amount of domestic pressure as well the war is incredibly unpopular amongst the Egyptian public so that's something that CCE will be looking at be looking at the voices of the streets uh that will be hearing any capitulation any agreement with Israel is going to be incredibly popular unpopular so that all plays into why we've heard these comments come out so far but like I say uh we haven't had any Israeli reaction so far but it's likely that we're going to hear something that we've heard before particularly from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who intends to deflect and blame the Egyptians for not letting in that humanitarian Aid now the Egyptians are actually fighting back in this it seemingly those very angry words are the beginning of that fight back against these isra accusations thanks to Imran Khan following the situation from a man in Jordan and a reminder that he's there covering this story because Israel has banned Al jazer operating inside Israel now let's bring in M Rabani in Montreal he's the Middle East analyst and co-editor of the online magazine Jalia good to have you with us first of all M maybe be useful to kind of step back a second and remind viewers of what the previous agreements say about who manages the Rafa Crossing agreements like the 2005 Philadelphia agreement yes it's the 2005 agreement on movement and access which was um reached through I believe us mediation after Israel um disengaged from the Gaza Strip and it's specified that um Palestinian Authority in conjunction with European Union Union monitors would be responsible for the um uh Palestinian side of the crossing this was basically an indirect way I think of of maintaining Israeli control over that Crossing and then what happened in 2005 uh sorry 2007 when Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip um the Europeans took a unilateral decision to leave um The Crossing and Egypt used that as a pretext to cooperate with Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip I think what's happened now is with Israel so brazenly taking over um the ra Crossing they have exposed Egyptian complicity with Israeli policy towards a Gaza Strip beyond the point um to which the Israel the Egyptian leadership can bear and as Imran Khan was pointing out it also has to do with Egyptian domestic um uh opposition to the war in Gaza there may well also be powerful forces within um the Egyptian ruling establishment and particularly the security establishment who are not too happy at the way the Egyptian um uh government has been cooperating with Israel during um the past uh8 months or so and it's in that context that we need to see um the Egyptian lead leadership now taking a more public and forceful position of opposition to what Israel is doing all right so given what you're saying how series of a rift is really going on between Egypt and Israel then is this just maneuvering or posturing for domestic consumption in Egypt well there's certainly posturing involved but I think it would be mistaken um to see this as as merely playing to the gallery for um cosmetic uh purposes if will it is it is a very serious issue inside Egypt and that almost by definition makes it a serious issue for the Egyptian um uh leadership and there's there's a broader issue here rather than just the details of the agreements which is um Egypt has a Central National Security principle which is that it will refuse to take responsibility for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip uh from Israel in the ABS of a comprehensive political settlement Israel has for years been trying to shove off the Gaza Strip to Egypt and by closing um uh their side of the border and saying that Egypt should be the one um responsible solely responsible for the entry of Aid into the Gaza Strip I think many in the Egyptian leadership see this as kind of a surreptitious um uh initiative to um try to have the Egyptians take responsibility for Gaza through through yet another maneuver and they're simply refusing this what position is the US taking because as you mentioned the us brok at some of these agreements whether we're talking about the Philadelphia or the Camp David well the US is acting as a us always does in such situations namely that it's exercising pressure on Egypt um to um go along with Israel's demands and it's using the dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip as a pretext so once again instead of placing pressure on those responsible for creating the crisis namely the Israelis it's taking the Israelis under its wing protecting them and putting um pressure on Egypt to go along with Israeli demands it's entirely what one would expect um given what we know about us policy Wayne Rani good to talk to you thanks so much thank you make sure to subscribe to our Channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
