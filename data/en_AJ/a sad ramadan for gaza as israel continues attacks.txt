Palestinians fasting in Gaza have never known a fast day of Ramadan as tough as this one when they are not avoiding getting killed in Israeli strikes they are looking for food that they either cannot find or afford to buy I'm 71 years old and I have never experienced a Ramadan like this it's an awful feeling during previous Ramadan I used to prepare the dining table to eat at Sunset but today there's no food and I don't have to get food to break our fast nearly 2 million Palestinians have been displaced across Gaza since early October they are sleeping in makeshift camps wondering how they will break their fast if the first day of Ramadan is tough on us how will the second and the third day be we're calling for ceasefire not a temporary humanitarian truce or anything else we want to go back to our homes we want to live the spirit of Ramadan like every year we want to decorate our homes and feel the joy of Ramadan Ramadan is a time to h family and friends to break fast and pray together but Israel's Relentless bombardment has made that impossible I wish that the airplanes will strike me and I will die it will be better than this life where are the Arab Nations where are the Muslim nations as the first day of Ramadan ends in Gaza and Palestinians break their fast they are hoping that their prayers for Ceasar will be answered Hamza Muhammad Al jaaz
