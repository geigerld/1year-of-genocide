Israelis have now come to the point where they believe that the solution to their problems is to basically uh ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and then eventually from the West Bank in order to do that you need to create a catastrophe and to create a self- sustaining catastrophe you dismantle those parts of life that make life manageable in a place like a and so you go after the water desalination plants you dismantle the sewage system you then destroy the health system while wounding 40,000 and so that once the war is over there are epidemics there is infectious diseases and people sit and watch their wounded loved ones die in front of their eyes and so the war continues after the bullets and the bombs stop
