Chris gunnis is a former unra spokesman and joins us now from London Chris unra is sadly no stranger to its workers being targeted and killed by Israeli attacks in this war indeed over7 unra workers have died and to be clear about what happened with the world Central Kitchen staff this was a deliberate calculated premeditated Massacre of innocent humanitarian workers the Israeli Army had been told of the exact route in fact they helped established the exact route that these workers were driving along the uh Convoy itself had been coordinated with the Israeli army they knew the exact GPS coordinates inch by inch of the route that these workers were traveling along and what we saw is not one not two but three deliberate attacks or so it appears and I hope that these attacks are investigated and that there is a full and transparent investigation not by the IDF not by the Israeli Army because for years we've seen attacks on humanitarian workers in Gaza not just unra un workers but others and we've never seen any proper criminal individual criminal liability accountability for these attacks and I hope that the world Central Kitchen will press with its contacts in Washington because the world is revulsed by this and as I say 170 plus unra workers have been killed there must be full accountability for their killing also for too long the Israeli Army has got off scot-free with these massacres and I use the word massacres advisedly of humanitarian workers Chris you say the world is repulsed by this attack but but where is the out outrage where is the action being taken against Israel well let's talk about the international court of justice and let's talk about the security Council whose response has been holy inadequate at the icj what we've seen is Israel told that it's committing a plausible genocide here is the the people the nation the country against whom a holocaust was was committed accused of a genocide against a population which it has put in a a ghetto the world's largest prison camp as David Cameron the current British foreign secretary when he was prime minister once described it so let's hope that the icj will move towards accountability that is something which is new it didn't it wasn't the case in 2014 when I was the unra spokesperson and let's see what the security Council will do because things are changing there wasn't an American veto and of course America is supplying $3.8 billion dollar per year of Weaponry that's being used for these massacres of workers and we would like to think that America is coming to its senses that there will be some kind of effort within the Biden Administration given the huge pressure that we're now seeing from the American Arab Community for a change of policy and I think that's also true of the American Jewish community so let's not write off accountability quite yet but I can understand where there would be huge huge sism across the Arab street because nothing really meaningful has happened whatsoever let's look a bit more at World Central Kitchen we this is an organization that we believe coordinated closely with the Israelis in so far as it was also bringing Aid to Gaza by sea with ships from Cyprus it involved the building of a jetty it involved distribution of aid from the boats across Northern Gaza if this is an organization that has been attacked having had that close coordination with the Israelis what does it mean for other Aid organizations in Gaza that's a very very good question because I think what we're now seeing is a deliberate attempt to make clear to the world that the genocide is going to happen that if this organization which was so closely coordinated with the Israeli authorities is going to be deliberately attacked not once not twice but three times and of course it called off and has suspended its delivery of food and with each of those boats coming in we're seeing half a million meals delivered to 300,000 people who are facing starvation in Northern Gaza it seems to me that that's a very clear signal to the world as if it was needed that Israel is committed to the genocidal project it is De developing Gaza it's destroying Gaza all the universities destroyed schools hit cultural centers hit and of course Netanyahu and yav Galant the defense minister and yach Herzog the president have made it clear in their public statements they intend to commit genocide and that's what we're seeing in this attack on these Aid workers today this tragic Massacre this liberate uh calculated premeditated attack not once not twice three times on these workers that is part of the genocidal the project that has been made clear by these Israeli leaders Chris we're hearing that the second largest Aid organization humanitarian organization after unra inside Gaza Ana is going to be suspending its operations after attack uh threats it says of attacks and obviously attacks on the world C kitchen and other Aid workers what do you know about this and what impact is it having on the people of Gaza well for the people of Gaza let me be clear there are 300,000 people in an IDP Camp internally displaced people camp in the north and there are 1.4 1.5 million in Rafa they are starving to death as we speak despite the propaganda that's being put out by Israel and its propaganda machinery and what we had and here's a breaking news story for you today the IDF the Israeli Army blocked an entire un Convoy from going to the north and that's because the world food program has made it clear that it will not do food distributions uh in a way which undermines unra in any way what the Israelis were trying to do was save the world F the world food program you come and do food distributions will block unra well today was a coordination meeting and the uh world food program and other un agencies made it clear that if there's no unra there's no Convoy if there's no under going to meetings then there is no meeting and that's an advance but what it's meant is that the Israelis have now blocked an entire un Convoy going to the north So within hours of this attack this massacre of these innocent humanitarian workers the Convoy I hope this is is referred to the international court of justice as further evidence that a plausible genocide is being perpetrated by the country for whom the word genocide was created and that is an outrage which should be a cause for international outrage and I hope things will start to change because 2.3 million people today are facing starvation in Gaza it's an outrage and it must end soon Chris GIS former span for unra thanks very much for talking to Al
