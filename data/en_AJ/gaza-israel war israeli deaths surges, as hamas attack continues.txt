in rala many Palestinians were marching in support of Hamas military's operation Nita Ibrahim is there in the occupied West Bank some of the chants in the protest here that has been walking in the streets of ramala are calling for National Unity for Palestinian factions to reunite and launch more attacks against Israeli targets we're heating Palestinians here also praising Hamas saying that Israel only understands the language of for people here were telling me that they feel that they've been left alone by the world and that they only have themselves to rely on if they were looking to free themselves from The Continuous decades long Israeli military occupation all in all in the occupied West Bank we've seen Palestinians observe a general strike where businesses have shut down and people are still worried about their uh people and families and friends in the besieged Gaza Strip afraid of the Israeli retali ation but some of them were telling me that Israel already has been bombarding Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip also here in the occupied West Bank as Palestinians have laid to rest some of those who have been killed by Israeli forces we've seen Israeli military close down their Palestinian towns basically isolating them from one another also the only link for Palestinians here in the occupied West Bank with the outside world with Jordan the alen bridge has been shut down by Israel so that gives you an idea that even if the situation is considered relatively calm the tension is still Brewing nid ibraim Al jaaz ramala the occupied West Bank let's bring in Diana Buu now who is a lawyer and former legal advisor to the Palestinian Liberation Organization she joins me live from haer Diana thanks so much for being on the program as we've been reporting Israel's knesset has just declared the nation is officially at War does that change anything no not for Palestinians look I think it's important for this to be put in its proper context Palestinians have been living under an Israeli military dictatorship now for more than 56 years and the images that we're seeing today in Israel are the same things that we Palestinians have been living with each and every day for the past 56 years Israel has never held back when it comes to the use of force and all that it wants to do now is somehow show that it's entered into a different phase when when it comes to Palestinians it's always had the gloves off it's never had any restraints and the world has never forced Israel to to to place any any any blocks any barriers any anything to the way in which it deals with Palestinians this is why we're in this situation today this is a colossal failure on the part of the International Community which has allowed Israel to continue this brutal occupation for the past 56 years without any accountability that brings me to my next question about the International Community we expecting the United Nations security Council to hold an emergency meeting in the coming hours what if anything can the Nations that are a part of that do to deescalate this situation I would hope first and foremost that they would hold up a mirror to themselves and be blaming themselves look this is not this is an occupation in which Israel is occupying Palestine it's up to the world Community to put pressure on Israel to end that occupation it can do so by declaring war it could do so by putting sanctions on Israel it's got a number of different Tools in its hands it has failed to do so for these 56 years and what Israel has yet to understand is that it will never have peace as long as another people have been denied their freedom as long as Palestinians are still laying languishing in refugee camps what's very interesting about all of this is that back in 1956 one of the Israeli men Minister Chief of Staff of the army mosha dean expressly stated that the that that Israel should never be angry with what uh with with any reprisal attacks that Palestinians conduct against them because it is Israel that has forced Palestinians into refugee camps so going back to the UN it should be looking at itself and asking itself why it is that after 75 years Palestinians are still in refugee camps waiting to go home why it is that after 56 years we still live under a brutal military occupation and it's because they have failed in their job were you surprised by the Ukrainian president vadir zelinsky's show of solidarity to Israel which is the occupying force in this instance um not at all you know he's he has previously stood by Israel he's he came to the knesset and indicated that that he was Israel and and uh and that Russia was was Hamas um he's done this this time and time again so I'm not at all surprised by his reaction what does surprise me however is that people are surprised that this actually took place again we may be surprised by the magnitude of it but after 56 years of of every day being abused by Israel it should come as no surprise and I think that we should never ever underestimate the desire and will of people to be free How likely do you think it it is that this could spill over into a wider conflict particularly after hezbollah's strikes from Lebanon today targeting three Israeli military positions well that remains to be seen I think a lot of it depends on what Israel's next steps are Israel's already already openly talking about a massacre in Gaza in fact is already perpetrated one um they're saying to to gazin to flee but they know that they've put them in a cage where they can't flee they've already attacked the uh a number of buildings they've already indicated that they're cutting off fuel electricity and water supplies these are lifelines this is illegal under international law so we know what Israel is planning next it's a question of what the rest of the region is now going to do what I do hope happens is that at least this puts a break on some of these this normalization garbage that we've been seeing over the past three years the fact that Arab states are closing up to a dictatorship and closing up to a human rights abuser and coing up to a country that has proven that it can't even that it can't do any anything when it comes to security uh I hope that this now comes to an end appreciate your insights thank you so much Diana Buu a lawyer and former legal adviser to the Palestinian Liberation Organization thank you there's plenty more ahead on Al jazer we'll bring you more coverage of the Gaza Israel war these are live pictures coming from that region do stay with us
