the Netanyahu government has come out with a list of dos and don'ts for journalists covering its war on Gaza document is available on the government website it says media are forbidden from reporting on eight topics without prior approval from the military sensor office the order prohibits publishing details about weapons used by Israel or seized by Hamas ITB Bar's reporting on Hamas targets hitting strategic infrastructure including power and gas plants military bases and Transportation depos details of War cabinet meetings are also not to be published without the military's approval AA alar is a columnist at haret newspaper joins us live from Tel Aviv so first of all what impact do these rules have on the coverage well Sam uh these rules are not very effective since uh uh from my experience I can tell you that uh first of all we we know what to do in order not to undermine the uh attempts of the military to fight terrorism and uh not to help the enemy to uh Target Israel uh strategic units so uh it's not it's not needed because every Israeli journalist is either a veteran so uh maybe some of them are graduates even of the Secret Service of the mosad of unit age2 200 uh and they know the rules and uh um since they have been part of the this uh uh apparatus they know that they don't want to harm their neighbor who is now uh based in Gaza their brother or their son who is now based in Gaza so uh these rules are not actually new the the problem is how much concern is there then over self censorship well that's that's something that I am personally very concerned about because at the time of war the uh journalists become more soldiers part of the IDF or part of uh the Secret Service and they more concerned about the uh security and about the viewers and the viewers don't want them to be so to speak El jazer that is doing a very balanced reporting from both from Gaza and and from Israel where the Hamas is hitting civilians uh the the Israeli journalist or editor knows what his clients want him to do so he will not dare uh reporting about something that may undermine the attempts to get the captives out or to Target the Palestinian strategic units what does that translate into for coverage of the human suffering that's going on in this conflict are Israeli seeing that Yes actually uh I want I watch Al jazer and I watch CNN but most Israelis that watch the Israeli networks or read the the Israeli newspapers they believe that there is only one victim there is only one narrative in the narrative is starts and ends at October 7th and this gives Israel a permit to do whatever it likes or needs to do um the the thing is that uh AA sorry for jumping in but what about social media hasn't that changed that sort of ability that you know traditional media can have to present only one side yeah Israelis who are bothering to follow the war through the social media Facebook yeah they they are exposed to this but they don't like to do this uh you need some you need to understand that it's very different now it's I I still remember the atmosphere here during the Six Days War and the yipo war and the Lebanon two Wars it's very different uh the the footage that the Israelis saw on October 7th and since then the stories of the captives uh they turn also the journalist from doing balanc honest reporting uh to Israeli Patriots and if you add to this that we are not allowed to go into Gaza the only way to get into Gaza and to see and report and offer footage is to follow the military spokesperson who takes the Israeli journalists as well as lucky Foreign Press to where he wants them to go to show them the tunnels the peers uh to speak to the offices that they pick up they cannot meet Palestinian until today I didn't seen any Israeli networks an interview with a Palestinian woman child or old people in in the camps uh and and the reason is you know that this is not not what the customers want to see and the media doesn't want to uh antagonize their clients well luckily you do have another choice you can watch us here in Al jazer will continue to bring you coverage from Gaza as well as from the Israeli side of the Border thank you so much AKA alar har columnist thank you sir
