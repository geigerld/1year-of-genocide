some live pictures from the United Nations where the Secretary General is about to give a news conference his first news conference if he takes questions of course since the October 7th attacks let's listen it humanitarian crisis it is a crisis of humanity the intensifying conflict is shaking the world rattling the region and most tragically destroying so many innocent lives ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces and Contin bombardment are hitting civilians hospitals refugee camps mosques church and un facilities including shelters No One Is Safe at the same time Hamas and other militants use civilians as human Shields and continue to launch rockets indiscriminately towards Israel I reiterate my utter condemnation of the abhorent acts of Terror perpet ated by Hamas on 7 October and repeat my call for the immediate unconditional and safe release of hostages held in Gaza nothing can justify the deliberate torture killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians the protection of civilians must be Paramount I'm deeply concerned about clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing let me be clear no party to an armed conflict is above International humanitarian law ladies and gentlemen of the press Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day more journalists have reportedly been killed over a 4-week period than in any conflict in at least three decades more United Nations Aid workers have been killed than in any comparable period in the history of our organization I salute all those who continue their life-saving work despite the overwhelming challenges and risks and the unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour the parties to the conflict and indeed International Community face an immediate and fundamental responsibility to stop the inhuman Collective suffering and dramatically expand humanitarian Aid to Gaza today the United Nations and our partners are launching a1.2 billion US doar humanitarian appeal to help 2.7 million people that's the entire population of the Gaza Strip and half a million Palestinians in the West Bank including East Jerusalem some life-saving Aid is getting into Gaza from Egypt through the Raa Crossing but the trickle of assistance does not me the ocean of need and let's be clear the r Crossing alone does not have the capacity to process eight trucks at the scale required just over 400 tracks have crossed into Gaza over the past two weeks compared with 500 a day before the conflict and crucially this does not include fuel without fuel newborn babies in incubators and patients on life support will die water cannot be pumped or purified raw sewage could soon start gashing onto the streets further spreading disease trucks loaded with critical relief will be stranded The Way Forward is clear a humanitarian C fire now all parties respecting all their obligations and international humanitarian law now this means the unconditional release of the hostages in Gaza now the protection of civilians hospitals un facilities shelters and schools now more food more water more medicine and of course fool entering Gaza safely swiftly and at the needed now and fed access to deliver supplies to all people in need in Gaza now and the end of the use of civilians as human Shields now none of these appeals should be conditional on the others and for all of these we need more funding now in addition I remain Gravely concerned about Rising violence and an expansion of the conflict the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem is at a boiling point let us also not forget the importance of addressing the risks of the conflict spilling over to the wider region we are already witnessing a spiral of escalation from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen that escalation must stop cool heads and diplomatic efforts Prevail hateful rhetoric and provocative actions must cease I am deeply troubled by the rise in anti-Semitism and anti-muslim bigotry Jewish and Muslim communities in many parts of the world are on high alert fearing for their personal Safety and Security emotions are at a fever pitch tensions are running High and the images of suffering are heartbreaking and soul crushing but we must find a way to all hold on to our common Humanity I think of civilians in Gaza the vast majority women and children terrified by the Relentless bombardment I joined the UN family in mourning 89 of our unra colleagues who have been killed in Gaza many of them together with members of their family they include teachers School principles doctors Engineers guards support staff and a young woman named Mai Mai did not let her muscular distrophy or her wheelchair conf find her dreams she was a top student became a software developer and devoted her skills to working on information technology for unra I am so deeply inspired by her example and I think of all those tortured and killed in Israel nearly when months ago and the hostages abducted from their homes their families their friends while simply living their lives 10 days ago I met with some of the family members of those hostages I heard their stories felt their anguish and was deeply moved by their compassion I will never relent in working for their immediate release this is essential in itself and Central to solving many other challenges one mother movingly movingly shared with me a desolation over her abducted son H she also spoke outside the security Council and on the subject of confronting hatred she said and I quote when you only get outraged when one side's babies are killed then your moral compass is broken and your humanity is broken end quote even in her hotter despair she stood before the world and reminded us and I quote in a competition of pain there is never a winner end quote we must act now to find a way out of this brutal awful agonizing dead end Destruction to help end the pain and suffering to help heal the broken and to help pave the way to peace to a two-state Solutions with Israelis and Palestinians living in peace and security thank you you very much [Music] sir all right the United Nations Secretary General speaking in New York to reporters there we were hoping that he would take questions from the reporters there but he hasn't it's his uh spokesman who will be uh doing that uh a little later I think Stefan dejar at the podium Antonio guz speaking to reporters for the first time since the October the 7th attack uh by Hamas on Israel and uh his uh statement there coming on the day that the death toll of Palestinians killed in the Israeli attacks on Gaza reached the green Milestone of 10,000 a statement also coming as Israel's bombing campaign as you can see on those live pictures from Gaza are continuing intense bombing of Gaza City in the last few minutes as the United Nation Secretary General was making that statement it was a pretty strong statement uh the language used by Antonio guz very strong he said Gaza is becoming a graveyard for Palestinian children hundreds of girls and boys day he announced also that the United Nations and its partners are launching a $1.2 billion humanitarian appeal to help the 2.7 million people in Gaza and uh also half a million Palestinians in the occupied West West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem uh a number of things that the United Nations Secretary General talked about there which were going to discuss now with our diplomatic editor James spay who's here on the set with us uh as I said James a pretty strong statement from the United Nations Secretary General coming on what is an important day today with this 10 10,000 death toll uh uh in in Gaza of Palestinians killed in Israeli air strikes what did you make of what he had to say and what stood out the most for you crisis of humanity was one of his first words and he was very very clear who was responsible saying that it was the ground operations of the Israeli Defense Force and the continued bombardment but are hitting civilians hospitals refugee camps mosks churches and um and un facilities um it is interesting though that this speech was very balanced there was quite a lot about what happened on October the 7th remember the criticism he got when he spoke the security ccil from the Israelis right from the Israeli the Israeli Ambassador calling for his resignation that's because he said what happened on October the 7th didn't happen in a vacuum and there was a context to it got a great deal of criticism and interesting that there was nothing really about the historical context uh in this speech and he has to be very measured um and has to remember that he has an Israeli audience as well because he is the man uh in his job as the as the Secretary General of the United Nations who might have to try and negotiated some sort of peace that puts him in a difficult position when you also hear him saying uh that he mn's 88 un colleagues who've been killed in Gaza because he's their employer he has a duty of care if you were the employer of 88 people who are killed you'd want to start raging at the person responsible for killing them which of course is Israel right a strong but measured speech as you said he also talked about Aid which is crucial right now for Gaza he said some life- saving Aid is getting into Gaza from Egypt through the Rafa Crossing it's not enough he said he says the Rafa Crossing alone does not have the capacity to process a trucks at the scale required so there is uh there is the um another Crossing of course that he's alluding to here are we likely to see any progress on more Aid getting into Gaza not just s Rafa but through the uh other Crossing yeah it's it's a hint but it's not one I've heard him make publicly before that Israel should open up Kum Shalom I'm sure privately they've been saying that to the Israelis all the way through this Kim shuram is a much bigger um uh deal uh it is where most of the trucks used to go in from Israel directly into Gaza and it's been completely closed since October the 7th saying that Rafer alone doesn't have the capacity there is no other Crossing from Egypt so you'd have to have a Crossing from Israel it seems that he's talking about that publicly the other thing he's talking about on Aid publicly is about fuel of course that's the one thing even though some trucks have gone in nowhere near enough according to the Secretary General just over 400 uh trucks um no no fuel has gone in and he made it clear that that means newborn babies and people on life support care um people on dialysis they going to die briefly James uh there's a security council meeting later a closed door security council meeting what can we expect from that well I think there'll be more uh discussion of the current situation and and and and more disagreement and impass in the security Council I think they'll be hoping that a closed door meeting the security Council will also perhaps give some impetus to negotiations because remember the security Council hasn't been able to pass a res ution in over a month uh on this particular issue the argument at the moment is if you have a resolution does it have the word seesar in it or does it have the word humanitarian Paws you've got currently both the US and Russia prepare to use their veto over those words I'll pause you there James B is our diplomatic editor thank you very much
