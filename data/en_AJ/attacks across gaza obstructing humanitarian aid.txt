let's go live to our correspondent on the ground hanim Mahmud who's live from Rafa so Israel has said it would open the IRS Crossing into Northern Gaza what's the latest on that honey and how much Aid has gone in in the last few days yes Paul well so far what we're looking at is more of the talks and then more of theoretically things are going to get better hopefully within the coming but in terms of practicality nothing on the ground is significant nothing has it changed within the past few days and and the fact that we're still seeing uh people are struggling on daily basis here overcrowded southern part of this trip to find uh basic supplies food supplies and survival uh items is just an indication that nothing uh significant happened within uh the past weeks and uh the fact that there only uh a tricle amount of of Aid has has been allowed so far and the the miles of the tracks on the other side of the Border just make it very difficult uh for people to cope well with the with the very difficult living conditions created by the ongoing intense bombing campaign along with the restrictions on the the ground that has so far prevented Aid workers from doing their job and delivering delivering much needed uh items and Food Supplies to a largely desperate uh population in in the northern part of Gaza C is the situations are are far worse and and just right now despite the talks uh and the uh the Alternatives that proposed either by airdropping or or constructing the temporary peer to provide more Aid uh people are still uh suffering from a spread of acute famine that so far has uh has caused the death of uh uh 30 Children of the enforced dehydration and starvation now everything sounds really nice and and flowy in theory but the problem is uh on the ground we're talking about a situations that are described as it's a an Emergency that is uh it's a crisis that is above emergency level that has been the bi product directly created by the intense bombing campaign and in terms of logistics it's impossible to be doing any of Aid uh food uh delivery in the northern part and G city until there is a complete seize fire and insurance of safety for Aid workers and and Aid Seekers uh to receive uh much needed items so no changes when it comes to the humanitarian situation what about the fighting honey what's the latest on that and well the fighting continues and the air Air Raids continue and air strikes continue to pound across the central area and and the City of unit in the northern part in Gaza City and it's it's directly linked to what's going on more air strikes more attacks are leading to more obstruction of a humanitarian Aid the whole uh a a chain of events have led into these catastrophic situations and now with the shattered sense of of Safety and Security right after the attacks on the wck employees a lot of people and donors and volunteers and Aid workers of the gr are very discouraged unless there is Assurance of safety for them to continue working uh the one and as long as we have more Air Raids continue to happen and not nothing is going to change more people are being injured that put a pressure on hospitals in the central area for example we have only one health facility that is semi operational right now and the fact that it has turned into more of a refugee camp because of the thousand of people Sheltering uh inside and has been uh within the past few days a site of attacks as well where in journalist and and and patients and injuries were uh killed inside the courtyard of the hospital on top of that the insufficient medical staff it just making it very difficult the more bombings the more we're seeing difficult conditions that created on the ground that going to prevent anything meaningful to change uh uh the course of people's life across the Gaza Strip yeah difficult conditions for the people of Gaza no doubt thank you so much honey for the update that's Al jair is hany Mahmud live in Rafa
