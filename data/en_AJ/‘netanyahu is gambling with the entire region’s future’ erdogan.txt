new levels day after day and my presence here today epitomizes our mutual will and I am certain that we can cement these relations by joining hands and hearts as well the volume of trade between turkey and The JCC increased 13 fold coming to $23 billion it is very important to also have the free trade agreement between turkey and J CCC member states come into effect it is also with pleasure

relations in the energy domain turkey has become a safe haven for international and GCC Investments and we have witnessed very significant development in terms of security and confidence in investment also the Turkish military industrial stresses the significance of this cooperation that's why it is imperative to continue to diversify our aspects and domains of cooperation my brothers and Friends during the ex extraordinary Summit convened in Riyad uh between the organization of Islamic conference and the league of Arab states we all touch the significance of cooperation and solidarity our talks on Gaza was very significant towards a joint action and it is very important to continue to Monitor and follow up with the decisions and resolutions handed down during that Summit similarly and equally enough the uh ministerial council's efforts are also important we also commend the mediation efforts played by the state of qar for the truth and swap of detes and captives we had hoped that the ceasefire would be have been permanent as nyaho is gambling with the entire Region's future for his own political calculations the killing of women and children as 177,000 unarmed innocent civilians were killed this constitutes a war crime and Israel must be penalized and held to account for these crimes turkey extended the necessary relief Aid to Gaza through 12 cargo planes we also procured number of Gaz and patients and wounded including cancer patients our goal is to have a permanent ceasefire established and an independent Palestinian sovereign state be established on the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital and within this context and towards this end we are prepared as explained to all the states including the regional states that this should be included among the options as we are prepared to act as a guarantor State this Injustice cannot continue with in relation to Syria and to restore security there which the pkk and pyg act terrorist activities cannot be resumed at this region it is that these activities that undermine our efforts towards peace and security we aim towards finding a diplomatic solution in Syria on the basis of the UN

conclude I reiterate our welcoming to you all among your brothers in your second Homeland hoping to meet with you in the upcoming Summit praying to God Almighty to save you and guide us toward the best interest and the welfare of our peoples thank concluded well you were listening to concluding comments there uh by the air of Qatar after speeches given by leaders attending the gulf cooperation Council uh Summit here in Doha a moment before we heard from tur's president RB t erdogan uh with his thoughts on events in Gaza of course high on the agenda there Netanyahu gambling he said with the future of the entire region for his own political calculations calling for Israel to be penalized for war crimes for immediate ceasefire and for uh a return to talks towards a permanent Palestinian State our diplomatic editor James baz was listening in he there indeed at the summit uh he joins us live James what does turkey bring to precedings well I think it is important that you had the president of turkia talking and the Amir of Qatar talking um because they were very strong in their condemnation of Israel's bombardment of Gaza uh it's interesting that some of the other members of the gulf cooperation Council although their their position as members of the Arab League um and the organization of Islamic cooperation is that they want a permanent ceasefire and they condemn Israel's actions some of them I think probably would have been a little bit more muted in their criticism of Israel in a public setting and that's because you've got to look at the different nations that make up the cooperation Council some of them have very different uh backdrops to their relations with Israel uh you had during the Trump Administration uh the Abraham Accords that were signed and that includes the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain they have normalization deals with Israel and despite what has happened in the last couple of months and despite what we're seeing even now in Gaza they have not dropped their diplomatic relations uh with Israel they've just condemned uh its actions and remember Saudi Arabia was also very close um to signing one of those normalization deals prime minister Netanyahu telling the UN General Assembly in New York in September they were on the cusp of a historic deal of course that deal never got signed and it's certainly on hold right now but I think for some of the GCC countries this is a little bit more complicated than it is uh for Qatar and for Tura which is here obviously not a member of the gulf cooperation Council not a country in the Gulf but an important Regional player invited as the VIP guest for this annual Summit of the GCC the way it works in this organization is you have your annual Summit at the beginning and then you have a year as the chair so katar is the chair of the GCC for the next year and then there'll be a summit in Kuwait when Kuwait takes over the chairmanship next year okay James thanks for that James be our diplomatic editor at the GCC Summit and let's uh cut back now to Sammy Hermes who is still here with me on Set uh he's an associate professor at Northwestern University in Qatar and Samy I just want to pick up on what James was saying there Qatar and turkey are speaking strongly in condemnation of Israel's actions all of these countries are united in wanting to see a permanent ceasefire but some of them perhaps more muted in their public criticisms because of their individual ongoing relations with Israel so this is a body that speaks with one voice but not necessarily with great force yes indeed and I think uh at this point we'd have to sort of wait and see what the final uh declaration that comes out of this uh Summit is uh they're uh they're able you know in fact I I thought uh turus president was uh could have been stronger he's used much more eviscerating language in the past in the past exactly and so I I was a bit uh sort of unimpressed or uh surprised yeah um but these are you know the public pronouncements let's see what uh what comes out with the Declaration uh but you know I think we were talking earlier uh if you don't mind sort of going back to the I was going to as well um the I think what needs to happen alongside these diplomatic Maneuvers is is global public pressure uh what you saw after the during the pause naturally people are sort of an await Andy and then the bombing escalates but people need time to sort of take back to the streets and react but you're seeing that again uh in Western capitals there's actions being taken protests um and I think you know what I was saying earlier is that the BDS movement boycott divestment sanctions is an important part of this uh this Global pressure because it's through one through that that people get educated it's through that that we call for mil milary embargo for example and we've seen uh unions in Italy and Greece uh I think in Belgium refuse to uh sort of unload or uh to uh sort of uh send uh um unload or sort of what's the to supply ships with with arms so we've seen some of that taking place and we need to see more of that um and it needs to get obviously up to the level of sort of political political action um but I think that the sort of um you know these boycotts also from the Arab world right we haven't seen uh Arab governments take these sort of positions and so you need more public pressure it's there but it's not this kind of critical mass um and you know one last thing i' I'd like to say is sort of the in Western capitals what you've seen are uh Jewish allies right who have uh stormed uh capital and and occupied uh spaces the Senators offices and so on who have really kind of put the sort of anti-zionist agenda on the table and have been allies of Palestinians and I think that is really important in shifting public discourse shifting political discourse in the US especially Sammy thanks for your thoughts great to hear them
