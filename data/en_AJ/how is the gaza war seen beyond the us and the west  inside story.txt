an overwhelming call at the United Nations for a ceasefire in Gaza Israel and the US among the few voting against the resolution how isolated are both nations from most of the world which opposes the war can International opposition have any impact this is Inside Story [Music] hello welcome to the program I'm Adrian finigan the Hamas killing of 1,147 people in southern Israel on October 7th caused Global outrage since then though 15 times as many Palestinians mostly women and children have been killed in a merciless bombing campaign by one of the world's most powerful militaries backed by the US and Western allies these countries Proclaim support for human rights and international law both of which Israel tramples on daily in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to how is Western support for Israel viewed elsewhere could the Gaza War change the current world order is support for Israel damaging the West We'll be asking these questions and more of our guests in just a few moments but first this report from Cara Le on how Israel and the US have found themselves in a minority of world opinion months of bombing and a worsening humanitarian crisis despite growing calls for a halt to Israel's war on Gaza the world's most powerful body the United Nations security Council has failed to put a stop to Israel's violence with the US wielding its veto power standing alone in blocking resolutions for a ceasefire but the demands have not stopped moving to the UN General Assembly I used my recent attendance at the Doha forum and every other platform I can to encourage cooperation among states with the same singular goal in mind to make peace for all in the name of humanity I ask you all once again stop this violence now the assembly spoke loud and clear and overwhelming votes in favor of a resolution seeking a humanitarian ceasefire and the release of all captives from Gaza 153 member states supported it 21 more than the last time the assembly called for a humanitarian truce War Tor Ukraine was among the few countries to abstain refusing to call for a halt to a war backed by its Western allies the US and Israel however voted against the resolution we support speaking out with one voice to condemn Hamas for his terrorist actions on October 7th why is that so hard to say unequivocally that murdering babies and gunning down parents in front of their children is horrific the exploitation of the Palestinians has made the UN a moral stain on Humanity why are you continuing to allow them to make the United Nations irrelevant our brother the resolution is non-binding ing but it carries political weight and reflects a global perspective of the war the Arab and Islamic countries who spearheaded the effort have pledged to use this as momentum to keep pushing for a ceasefire the Palestinian Authority has welcomed the resolution and urged countries to pressure Israel to adopt the ceasefire as ground battles intensify in Northern Gaza Israel has carried out some of the heaviest bombing in days in South the UN vote indicates Israel's growing diplom atic isolation US President Joe Biden has warned it risks losing international support because of its quote indiscriminate bombing even close Ally Australia backed the UN resolution in a rare split with the us while the world waits to see if the UN Security Council will hold another vote people on the streets far from the corridors of Western power are making their voices heard Cara leg Al jazer for Inside Story so let's bring in our guests for today's discussion from Paris we're joined by Tamir porus a former career Diplomat in Venezuela and a policy adviser specializing in Latin American economics and geopolitics from Cape Town South Africa we're joined by malani verwood uh who's a former South African Ambassador and Member of Parliament in Nelson Mandela's Administration and here in Doha is Sami homz ass associate professor at Northwestern University in Qatar he specializes in social movements the state and Security in the Arab world a warm welcome to you all Sammy let's start with you um how significant is this un general assembly vote it's highly unlikely to lead to a binding resolution in the security Council anytime soon is it I mean is it the best the UN can do of what relevance is this vote to someone suffering under the constant bombardment in Gaza no I mean on one hand it's uh it's great that we've seen a shift of 20 countries uh in the last month but of course it's not uh you know uh quick enough and uh of course it's uh wonderful to see that the US is now isolated I think that's the first step um is that it's isolated and we hope that the next resolution that comes out um will see a change and the US won't be able to protect uh you know its interests and is isra any anymore uh but in a sense it is also um as you know the Israeli ambassador to the UN said right he it's total double speak I mean he blames the Palestinians for everything but they're the ones who are constantly uh breaking international law um and so in a way the the UN has become uh ineffectual but I think what what is really important is this movement um what you see is uh International global solidarity actually sort of moving this dial and I think that's what's really important is that uh we see that you know even this resolution it's not put on the table Antonio guz he did not invoke article 99 because Russia told him or China told him what what there this movement we're seeing is because of global public opinion and pressure on the streets in uh the hallways of power um in you know in all sorts of ways that you know it could talk talk about in in this uh you know in the next minutes but I think that that is really where um where we should really take note uh that none of this would happen if it wasn't for this public pressure Milani 10 Nations voted against including the US the UK and Germany were among the 10 Nations who abstained how isolated does this vote leave the US picking up on on what from what Sami was saying what message does it send and is that message likely to be heeded and if so when well I mean the message is very very strong right um it's not often that the UN votes on something so strongly um and agree on something that strongly so the message is very clear the question is what will it result in um the moral message is there and I mean also interesting for me living in Africa only three countries did not vote for it um two abstained and it was only Liberia who voted against it um so you know even in a continent as diverse as Africa there is seems to be a very very strong message and one has to ask how can they not be you know how can one not ask for a ceasefire um after everything that we've seen and and and you know that we've seen on our television screens now for so long um but the question is of course the with the Biden Administration um are they actually going to heat this message and well one would think that he would increasingly start thinking about the fact that he is losing a lot of Support also in America from the liberal left um but it you know it seems that this relationship with with Israel just keeps on holding them in some way both financially um and also diplomatically seems to consistently still support Israel in this war Tam um picking up on that allies are supposed to speak supportively of allies at least in public and take a more honest and robust tone in private what are we to make then of President Biden's remarks that Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza is losing it public support uh and that PM prime minister Netanyahu needs to change his government and his stance on a two-state solution where is that coming from well I I believe that President Biden is probably speaking about his own public opinion because Israel's public opinion I mean Israel's support all over the world has never really existed on the Palestinian cause I think the the vote at the UN National General Assembly resolution on on on Palestine reflects what the uh I would say historic opinion in the global South is about uh the conflict and the uh the fate of the Palestinian people and the rights of the Palestinian people it is in the in the west in the United States in the uh in the European Union where governments have been supporting supportive of Israel uh somehow in disconnect uh with a growing uh portion of their own public opinions who are of course appalled at the uh at the barbaric uh campaign of bombing that has been uh uh that has been imposed over Gaza and of course it is their own stance their own stand uh supporting Israel despite of these uh I would say proves that are that are visible to to all public's opinion and to the world that is creating an internal problem in uh Western societies and for Western governments such as the US government of President Joe Biden and and I I I think he's referring to that public opinion that uh doesn't understand how governments in the west are uh um supportive of uh the government of Israel uh irrespectively of uh its actions that are clearly violating international law and and of course committing war crimes let's um discuss the the points that you bring up there with with Sammy uh Sammy what do we what are we to make of the the the Stark differences in position on Israel and its bombing of Gaza uh of governments I'm not talking about public opinion here now but governments in the global South uh compared to those richer nations in the north look the the whole issue really stems from the fact that uh Israel is uh ultimately a European settler Colony so it makes perfect sense that uh Europeans so the Richer countries Europeans Americans are going to support uh their their settlers and so I think this is this is a really important point that keeps getting missed and this is why uh there's a a real interest uh from the US uh to support uh the Israeli State because it's supports its you know its interests in in the region and I you know I would go as far as to say that uh we talk about ethnic cleansing and genocide but really I think what we see here is is the US uh actively involved in this and it's just Israeli soldiers doing the you know the labor of it but I think this is why you don't see global South countries supporting uh Israel they're they're not you know it isn't a global South settler Colony so I think this is um and and I think one one other thing I'd want to say on on President Biden's remarks is that you know he's he said things to this effect in the last month that you know things are are are public opinion is Shifting and so on um I I find these as sort of diversions they're just uh ways of to sort of buy buy time I mean you know you can keep saying this but ultimately the US can turn off uh the sort of the weapon supplies it continues to do so even uh even in light of these massive atrocities um and it could you know turn this off and according to Israeli generals and former generals they would tell you that it would end this war very quickly if that stops melani is this shattering the reputation of Nations who continue to stand by Israel the war on Gaza I I mean and uh what does this this conflict mean for international law who in future polies nation state actors when they appear to be able to act with impunity well let me just first say in terms of what the previous speaker was saying I think funny is the name um you know of course that South Africa would very much Echo that on an official level um exactly that that you know South Africa was very aware and thec government in particular how Israel had very close relationships with Israel sorry with the aparte government um for many years and how many of the weapons that were actually used to kill antipathic activist came either from Israel directly or through Israel and so you know then of course also that thec government can see how the Palestinian cause the fight for Freedom um against land occupation Etc very much mirrors their own battle for for so many decades for freedom in South Africa Mandela of course famously said that South Africans wouldn't be free um until uh the Palestinian people are also free um so I just wanted to to Echo that in terms of international law you know as an African and somebody from the global South the global South has always said and has always pointed out for a very long time for well not always but certainly for decades um the hypocrisy when it comes to international law and the application of international law in particular when it comes to a superpower like America who likes to play this sort of global policeman And yet when the rules um have to apply to them or to countries that they support they often change the rules or somehow want to reinterpret the the the the rules and and that's not something new for for people in the global South we are very aware of that um and and so the question is not a new question it is just whether this is finally The Tipping Point where the world will see that um you know to use the the children's story that the king actually has no clothes on when it comes to America um in this in this moral Global um question Tamir is this a Tipping Point to what extent is this a defining moment not just for the UN but the current world order and countries that claim to stand for defending human rights well yeah it it is a test definitely it is a test but it is reassuring to see that uh in the general assembly of of the United Nations such a unanimous uh stance in defense of the rights of the Palestinian people uh in this particular case but that also um um says a lot about the aspiration of the global South and the International Community at large to have uh an international I would say International realm that um is organized around international law so that every country has to abide to international law and in this case it is very clear that the behavior of of Israel is of course opposed to to those values at the same time in the United Nations for instance once one uh country like Israel behaves in such a manner there should be you know the recourse to the United Nation Security Council uh where you know the members of the security Council would be um uh able to impose sanctions International sanctions in this case to the country that is violating international law but we all know that there you know the political logic and the geopolitical logic um imposes itself because the United States would uh exercise its veto rights so it's it's a moment where at the same time you see this very large aspiration but also where you can show the limits of the current International architecture that uh the tools are there but there are also political tools for those countries who want to impose a unilateral vision of uh of of or unilateral um uh force in in the international realm so it becomes very clear to the I would say the international public opinion what needs to be changed in this architecture for once again a a more balanced and and and peaceful International Arena to to exist so Tam is the UN currently a complete waste of time nothing but a a debating theater of of wishes and dreams I mean its critics have been saying for a long time that it's not fit for purpose its credibility uh and once again that of the Security Council is on the line here right now isn't it I mean if the un can't stop the indiscriminate killing of of Innocence it's as good as useless well it it I I understand and share that frustration but at the same time it's the only tool available for small countries those who cannot impose Force so if I mean this is this is again this is real politic and and indeed in the face of real politic the UN cannot do much but at least it is a Forum where that Injustice can be underlined and I think it's very important that these is uh that that you know that it the ability to the international for the International Community and the global South to express its opinion and to and to unveil the double standards and the injustices is in itself something that is worthy of keeping but I understand of course the frustration that these tools uh do not allow uh the International Community to Stop The Killing and the oppression over the Palestinian people melan do you do you want to come in there and and and expand upon on what uh tamy was saying well I mean again from South Africa Africa and I think more generally the the global South has for a very very long time complained and pointed out that a body like in particularly the UN Security Council is not representative of the whole globe and neither does it serve the need and the interests of of a very large section two-thirds of the world's population and so they have been critical about this for so long but I do and of course also like bodies of the IC and it and it and it is worthwhile mentioning that um South Africa has asked um quite a while ago already the international criminal court to issue a warrant of arrest for president Netanyahu for for war crimes and it's going to be I think from a from a southern perspective it's going to be very interesting to see what the IC will do um the the but I do agree that you know at the moment we don't actually have something better than the UN um yet to to um hold countries to account um of course on an economic level this is why bricks you have seen such a big expansion and development around bricks where more than 40 countries wanted to be part of this um and six um quite big countries were um or entered bricks this year and will start being full Partners on the 1st of January and that is all part of this effort of the global South and also of Africa to form a balancing power um um or a balance against the sort of superpower of particularly America um who seems to often not act in the interest of of the global South Sammy um after the general assembly vote Israel's Envoy called the UN a moral stain on humanity and as far as public Global opinion is concerned I mean you could argue that he has a point not for the reasons that that he was actually arguing at the time but many people are so frustrated with the un's apparent impotence while people are dying every hour in Gaza yes I think you know listening to your other two guests the one thing that strikes me is that and you've said this as well is that this is not the first time we talk about the un uh not meeting its uh responsibilities but I think this is one of those moments where uh Global South countries could really take the charge and you know I think the IC is a defunct institution and they I think Global South countries should be thinking about alternative institutions and just bypassing uh you know the the Western Powers but of course you know that is uh in some ways a dream talk but I think I was going to say how how how Samy would that how would that work book well I mean I I think you have 150 Nations that have agreed on something they can actually take action and say you know we're going we're going to impose a no-fly zone on on Israel and uh put that on the table as a threat and let's let's see where that goes I mean you know I I assume my I imagine that things would probably eventually deescalate from there rather than escalate into a global war I don't think that that's where it would but the the threat of something like that or you know thinking about an alternative uh international criminal court to sort of uh you know put these things on the table um not allow Israeli politicians to travel around like as if they're not committed uh war crimes I think some of these things are are really important ways that we could uh you know put put pressure to think about new institutions because we just you know we get to this point every time this is not the first time on Palestine that we've talked about it's the incapacity of the UN but we find ourselves here every time um and it's you know it's tiring and Palestinians are dying in the meantime and when they're not dying in Grand great numbers as they are in Gaza they're dying of slow genocide uh where that you see for example in the West Bank right where uh their territory is shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and so you know but but under the radar and nobody cares nobody cared about the prisoners until October 7 and now you know people are talking about Palestinian prisoners to me some's got a point hasn't he I mean you know this talk of of it being high time for for new institutions is all well and good but in the meantime people people are dying now absolutely absolutely but again and um it it it is ultimately if you will because we move from from the framework of and we have shown the limits of uh International institutions and international law but it's probably then to the public opinions in the countries that are supporting this uh uh horrendous policies uh for instance the uh the public opinion in the United States uh should put pressure on its government I mean it's it's uh political action is always difficult it it requires uh building appropriate tools uh why aren't Western politicians um um put to uh to the scrutiny by their own public opinions on on the supporting of of Israel why don't we have a a broader or deeper discussion in the countries that are responsible ultimately for supporting Israel in this this is probably the way you know it is probably the national public opinions that need to do the work in order to change the policies of their own countries which are backing uh and and probably the this very same people in Israel again um where is the public opinion in Israel and is it supportive of of this horrendous campaign again I I I think this this is a time again to to focus on where things can be changed immediately in order to reach what we all hope for which is a ceasefire and then a political resolution that takes into account the rights of the Palestinian people Milani final word to you then do you have any hope that that that could happen that this can be brought to a conclusion quickly without further suffering and death was probably not that quickly but certainly I never underestimate the strength of ordinary people um on their governments if they start uniting and I agree this is now public opinion that has to really push because um even for example I think countries should turn their attention now to the us as well not only to Israel because we can see that it's not really working with Israel but I think if countries like for example in the European Union Etc starts putting pressure also on America that could also help in um more speedily bringing forth a peaceful resolution um which is so desperately needed um for the people of Gaza Milan you you really think that it's going to come ultimately down to people power well people pushing their political leaders to stop um you know the Israelis have made it clear they will not stop until they will in their view eradicated Hamas which I think anybody who's grown up amongst Liberation movements know that you cannot stop and particularly terrorist organizations by killing them you have to take away the conditions that will that motivates them to exist um and you know I think the we know that it's not working on on Israel but I think um public opinion needs to push the rest of the world to all stand together and we've seen many of them have come together now but the remaining ones and in this case particularly America who funds um a large extent this war or to a large extent contributes to the funding of this war and also orbe it then in public um still you know supports the war um I think we need to you know that is what's going to to make the difference is the pressure to to to stop this there we must end our discussion many thanks indeed to you all Sami Hames
