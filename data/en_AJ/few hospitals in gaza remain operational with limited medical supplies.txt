this is one of the last few remaining hospitals in Gaza each day brings more patients for neurologist Muhammad Alti and his staff at ala hospital it means another long shift with little resources every day we deal with dozens of cases there is a severe shortage of Essential Medical Supplies we are dealing with patients using very primitive methods which take a long time we sometimes lose the patient in the operation room due to the lack of medical tools most of the 36 hospitals in Gaza have been destroyed and critical Health Care remain inaccessible nearly 500 Palestinian health workers have been killed and those are still standing with limited supplies have often to make a choice about who gets to live Specialists and other medical professionals have had to move around to avoid being targeted in Israel's attacks in the past 8 months they have been providing essential treatment to the wounded and those who were already sick and with each Israeli strike causing Mass casualties keeping people alive with limited supplies becomes that much more difficult unlike medical professionals all over the world doctors and nurses in Gaza do not get breaks a good night to sleep is a luxury for Muhammad we work 24 hours on certain days we are providing medical care for three basic departments we should follow old cases in the hospital we continue to treat new cases in the emergency department and we carry out medical surgeries for critical cases along with my colleagues to save patients but the neurologist is also a refugee Muhammad has had to move multiple times because nowhere safe in Gaza Israeli attacks have targeted people in areas that they were design ated safe zones for doctors like Muhammad that are worrying thought while they work because they have to leave their families and flimsy t for days When The War Began I didn't see my family for two weeks because I didn't leave alifa Hospital even when I visited my family later I was thinking about the hospital and the patients and how I can balance my personal and professional life gaza's doctors and nurses have refused to leave patients behind even when they were given evacuation orders by Israel all over the world doctors and healthcare workers have protested in solidarity but for doctors like Muhammad ceas fire could not come soon enough as they tirelessly work to save lives tarum Al jazer darl balah Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from our Al jazer
