to Al hany mmud he joins us from Dara Bala hany bring us up to speed with all the latest strikes that Gaza has been experiencing yes well we just got uh confirmed reports of at least 18 people within the past 12 hours have been killed across the central area and the southern part of the strip that includes the overnight attacks in Northern Gaza on a residential home but Mainely attacks have being con concentrating on the N refugee camp that's in the northern part of the the Northern Western part of the uh west of the Central Area New Waves of attacks on residential homes and public facilities just not only causing further civilian casualties but also keep enforcing people into enforce internal displacement meanwhile in the southern part of the strip particularly Al maasi evacuation Zone that's been largely designated by the Israeli military as a safe zone for people to evacuate to have been relentlessly attack and this time we're talking about at least eight people being killed inside the tents that they built in order to protect and take them shelters just protect themselves and their children inside these T Del maasi is a a narrow Coastal part of the Gaza Strip on the western part of the of the central area and the southern part of the strip stretches all the way from D bah City all the way to Egyptian rafah borders and it's been a a spot for the Thousand hundreds of thousand of this place amilies been Sheltering since the beginning of this genocidal War what's going on right now is the more we see of these attacks on the rise it's just putting more pressure on healthc care facilities across the central area and the southern part of the strip uh we're talking about Naser hospital for example that has been completely pushed out of service and right now is trying to get back on track with a few of the uh the insufficient medical staff inside the hospital as well as all the difficulties and challenges invol in getting the hospital back to on track but we're talking about one only Hospital in the entire city of hanun the situations are quite similar in the central area we are here at the courtyard of ala Hospital the only remaining semi operational hospital that lacks basically uh everything that is needed and necessary to to save lives and in order uh just to get a bit picture of what's going on inside the hospital we've been documenting things for the past months inside for inside the health facility here but to get a better idea of how the situations are inside the hospital we are uh joined by Dr Jamal Mari uh he is a gener pediatric uh surgeon as well as Dr Bushra Osman general surgeon from panima that's a part of a medical Mission from Australia uh thank you so much for joining us and maybe a better way to start uh uh this conversation is to talk about a the uh give us a general assessment of what's going on in the inside the hospital mainly like what is the situations uh with the hospital in Gaza my name is Jamal Mar I'm one of the surgeons coming with Bima from Sydney Bima is a medical Palestinian Australian medical doctors Association and we are coming to help with uh relieving the teams and help as much as we can and unfortunately we were having expectations but what we saw is well well beyond what we expected basically they got a hospital that is uh helping uh or servicing a million people supposed to be less than 200 before and it just it's not they're not cing I can't understand how they are going but they got five theaters in in in the operating theater five rooms and they said they are theaters but honestly they're just little cubicles refashioned and done as theaters there is zero supplies previous medical missions brought their own consumables and supplies to cover them for the couple of weeks they come and relieve through and we were denied bringing any medical supplies so we are just depending on whatever left over from other missions or whatever left over in the hospital and basically whatever disposable we assume it we keep reusing reusing reusing which is not safe at all I think we should mention a little bit about some of the injuries that we've been seeing here I mean this is a hospital that's stretched Beyond its limits and most of the patients that are being affected are exceptionally young kids and um women and children so you know some of the injuries we saw yesterday shrapnel and blast injuries from explosions massive chest wounds esophageal and lung injuries major abdominal trauma um young kids as young as 18 months old who've been martyred in explosions severe burns throughout their bodies none of these patients can go to the Intensive Care to get appropriate treatment because the hospital is understaffed um under supplied and there's just not enough to go around in terms of resources the teams here are stretched beyond their limits so these are teams that have been working for over 260 days straight um and we'd highly encourage teams from elsewhere to come and help support the healthcare workers here I know this is your first time as part of a medical Mission from Australia and you're probably overwhelmed by what you have seen already but can you briefly just share with us your experience and how has your work been so far within the past few days I think first of all you know the nature of the work in terms of general and trauma surgery doesn't necessarily um differ too much from overse but the amounts that we're seeing here are Beyond imaginable uh in terms of quantities of numbers um and from a second perspective I suppose there's a lot of emotional attachment um and repercussions to the the situations that we're witnessing so you know when you witness young kids who've been murdered from both parents who have no home to go to uh when patients have finished their care they they go back to a tent or they don't have ability to get wound care these are things that we just wouldn't expect or want to inflict on anyone in any part of the world and we're just not able to provide the care that they require here today yeah Dr Jamal just given your expertise I want to know your your assessment on what are the M major medical needs needed right now I would say everything is needed Staffing wise people here were going on for 9 months underst staffed they're really stretched emotionally drained physically drained they're just cobbing and uh that's Staffing wise consumables theaters again we had to operate in a difficult situations without electricity it comes and goes and when it goes it's just like for 5 10 minutes we had to use the mobile torches to continue operating of course if that was a critical moment with bleeding or something that would be very very serious for the patients uh overcrowding is a big big issue people has to queue to come to theater they have to wait like 2 to 3 days just to get their wounds looked at or dressing changed medical team wise they're just cobbing there's no plastic there's no vascular surgeon there's no neurosurgeon spine fixation is a big issue of course we're dealing with multi trauma where people have injuries everywhere yesterday we did a labom for a stomach perforation and he had arm amputation he had combined fracture of his both legs and really they need multi multi disciplinary teams to manage to be able to manage their conditions here we don't have any resources anybody can just general surgeons has to cover for everything pediatric surgery is a big issue as well we had an unit with necrotizing interus we just managed to to operation but unfortunately she did not survive she was 1 and a half kilos really in big centers they will hardly survive she didn't survive with us although we operated but yeah the mortality rates here in intensive care are 100% so you know in any situations normally we would do these major operations and then be able to provide one-on-one care for these patients that does that cannot occur here uh these patients are getting extubated and then going to the ward they're being looked after by family members there's not enough nurses and staff to help distribute medications there's not enough medications there's no supplies to change wounds on the wards so on a systems and microscopic level this Healthcare System needs huge reform Dr Jamal Dr bsh thank you so much for your Insight thank you thank you uh so as we heard from both Dr Jamal and uh Dr Bushra the situations are quite dire inside the hospital alaka hospital is a representative sample of what's going on of this of this difficulties including the uh the insufficient medical staff the kind of cases that they had to deal with the the acute shortage of medical supplies that making even their work it quite difficult given the lack of of resources Han Mahmud reporting there on the situation inside Al AXA Hospital in Dar alala thanks very much hany make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
