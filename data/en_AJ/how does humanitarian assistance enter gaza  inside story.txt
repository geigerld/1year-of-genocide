Israel is blamed for blocking Aid deliveries to Gaza an accusation the government denies So What mechanisms are in place for Israel to ensure food and humanitarian assistance reaches the millions of people the UN says are at risk of starvation this is Inside hello and welcome to the program I'm Muhammad jamj before Israel's war most of the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza were already dependent on humanitarian assistance after 4 and a half months of a total Siege compounded by an intense bombing campaign the situation is dire access to Aid has been a major aspect of the conflict Israel first blocking it then maintaining tight control over deliveries and now it's accusing un agencies of failing faing to distribute it all while its forces attack the strip from the air ground and sea so how does humanitarian Aid enter Gaza Dimitri medeno explains the humanitarian assistance for Gaza goes through a lengthy logistical process before it reaches the millions of Palestinians who so desperately need it step one it needs to get to the Border Gaza is a narrow strip of land on the Mediterranean bordering Egypt and Israel hundreds of trucks wait for hours and sometimes days at these checkpoints Nana and Karam Abu salm step two after Israeli inspections all United Nations deliveries are sent through the Karam abalam Crossing while non-un Aid is currently being roted to Egypt and enters via the Rafa Crossing step three the supplies are offloaded on the Gaza side of the Border collected by humanitarian agencies sorted and then distributed across the strip there are hurdles at each stage at the borders Israeli protesters have been trying to delay deliveries despite the government designating The Crossings as a military zone the security inspections are conducted by Kat the coordination of government activities in the territories a unit of the Israeli defense department it decides what is allowed into Gaza and what's banned the same unit is responsible for overseeing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank International Aid agencies have increasingly warned of famine in Gaza accusing Israel of blocking the entry of food and much needed supplies but the head of Kat unit has refuted the accusations saying this the problem lies with the international organization processing and receiving the aid there is no food shortage in Gaza yet families are eating animal feed and parents are skipping meals to ensure their children have something to eat and the un's food agency a Lifeline to millions of Palestinians has suspended its operations and convoys have come under Fire despite coordinating their roots with the Israeli military Demitri medeno Al jazer for Inside [Music] Story all right let's go ahead and bring in our guests joining us from London is Andreas cre an associate professor of security studies at King's College London he specializes in security and strategy in the Middle East in occupied East Jerusalem is Sarah Davies spokesperson for the international Committee of the Red Cross in Israel and the occupied territories the icrc has operated in the region since 1967 and in Oslo Raymond Johansson is the Secretary General of Norwegian people's Aid which has provided humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip for more than 35 years he's also a former Norwegian state Secretary for foreign affairs a warm welcome to you all and thanks so much for joining us today on inside story Sarah let me start with you today could you explain to our viewers just how the icrc is involved in the ongoing efforts to get more Aid into Gaza for example what exactly does the icrc um do as far as speaking with specific bodies negotiating with specific Israeli government bodies and what kind of access are you getting thank you so much for having me on so firstly I think it's it's very important just to clarify that as the international Committee of the Red Cross we are not negotiating as such but we do of course engage with parties to the conflict as well as other actors other institutions other states um and really anyone who has influence over this this situation we are heavily focused on our humanitarian diplomacy which does include speaking directly to the parties to this conflict including of course Israel and Hamas um and reminding them of first and foremost their obligation under International humanitarian La for Israel as the occupying power in Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territory they have the the obligation to ensure that civilians have access to Necessities things like food and and safe drinking water as well as shelter uh these are all part of our ongoing discussions with them um and the relationships that we' built having been here for so many decades Sarah obviously the icrc has a very long history of difficult negotiations with Waring parties around the world this is according to these long-held principles of the organization how does this compare what we're seeing in Gaza the kinds of discussions that you're having right now when it comes to humanitarian diplomacy how much more difficult is it compared to other conflicts in the past so yeah as you said we have worked in in many different conflicts all over the world I think every conflict has its own challenges uh but this particular conflict as we have all seen uh has had a very intense few months of hostilities and this has severely impacted the people the civilians on the ground in Gaza who you know are not part of this height uh we have seen as well in this day and age the the very fast spread of information uh on social media which unfortunately can have an impact on uh States and and authorities and other organizations um knowledge of the situation uh and unfortunately does have an impact at times on our operations on the ground as I said we have longstanding relationships with uh both Hamas and Israel as the parties to this conflict and why I can't go into the the content of that discussion as as a dis a discret organization as that mutal organization that we are we are regularly in contact with them uh consistently discussing all different aspects of this conflict of this conflict our concerns what we're seeing on the ground and and we will continue to do so Raymond What mechanisms are in place for Israel to ensure food and humanitarian assistance reaches the millions of people that the UN say are at risk of starvation in Gaza first of all I think it's uh important to say that the over staff in Gaza they are as from other organization displac themselves and most of our people are from Gaza City and uh but for the time being the resources is very limited they are doing the best to set setting up some latrines and uh for women and children and uh at the same time we find that the aid workers are subject to direct attack and so are also the Health institution the humanitarian sites and so it's extremely difficult for the time being to do any humanitarian assistance and uh as the representatives from the Israeli government said that there are no food sortage in Gaza that's of course free fantasy it is food shortage in Gaza and even before the 7th of October 80% of the population in Gaza was dependent on Aid and now with the blockades and just the Rafa Crossing and a k Shalom Crossing operate with a minimum capacity with a lot of restriction it sets itself the bombing must stop and it we have to open up for more sight to bring in humanitarian assistance and it's extremely difficult situation for the people who lives on a very very small area which is different from other conflict this is small small area with two millions people in the biggest prisons prison in the world so it's uh it's important to take that into account as well Raymond let me follow up with you about another point the Palestinian red crescent is warning that that a number of people in Gaza have died as a result of Israel's deliberate starvation and famine in Gaza is is what we are seeing now from your perspective is it War by starvation and and are Israel's actions causing Famine of course that's the consequence of the the bombing that's the consequence of the lack of access for humanitarian uh assistance and we saw also the northern part of gasa is no basic basically an IDF military zones so it means that it's also difficult or almost impossible to to go back to see if there's possible to find to harvest some food to find some food The Fishery it's impossible so totally depend on humanitarian assistance Andreas we heard in Dimitri's report earlier uh uh he was talking about a body known as Kat uh that's short for the coordination of government activities in the territories it's a unit of the is defense department I want to ask you more specifically what is Kat and how does it work right I mean Kat sounds civilian but as you already said is a unit in the ministry of Defense it's run by the military it's run by a military officer it's staffed by Military Officers and it's an exe execu executive body of the IDF to actually Implement occupation so we have to understand that obviously occupation was supposed to be phased out after Oslo it didn't happen so this was sort of an interim body to facilitate the military the civilian side of the military occupation but Kat responds and answers to the military uh it's part it's it's answering to a military body and the Central Command it implements military strategy so it's not a civilian body um and as such also we see that is obviously responsible for all the choke points for all the flows of data of people of Aid uh of goods Financial Services anything that goes in and out of the occupied territories that includes the West Bank and Gaza and as such it's in many ways when it comes to Gaza the the prison gatekeeper because it kind of keeps the gates and controls the most important choke choke points for Aid uh for people for capital for any sort of flows going in and out of Gaza and whatever goes through the rougher Crossing which they now control increasingly as well uh is ALS is is is usually not controlled by Kat but is is is punished when it goes through there so they're trying to implement they've tried to create a situation where they control flows of people in particular there as well but it's absolutely a pivotal point and an ele a crucial element of military occupation and the fact that they control everything that goes to uh the AR Crossing as well as K Shalom and the South they cons and and enforcing is that's very important enforcing forcing the blockade means that they're very much uh uh not just complicit but they're a crucial part of that blockade they're crucial in controlling that territory and that makes the IDF and the military and the ministry of Defense as well are very much a a a party that occupies the Gaza Strip even if they don't control their daytoday operations on the ground you should maybe in a in a in terms of illustrating that I would say that Kat is a many ways the national government while what Hamas is doing domestically is more like a municipality government because they're completely tied and controlled by what Kat is doing in terms of information flows flows of people and flows of money and goods so Andreas if you can follow this train of thought a little bit further Israel is being blamed by many Aid agencies for blocking Aid deliveries to Gaza of course the Israeli government denies those accusations but then you also have Kat officials with Kat who are saying essentially that the problem doesn't lie with them that the problem lies with International organizations uh and they say that International organizations need to do more to ensure the flow of Aid into Gaza how do you make sense of these statements from Kat leadership saying that the could do more to get Aid in essentially pushing blame onto the UN or other NOS or Aid agencies while while as you're saying they're actually the ones in control no I this is obviously a part of that information campaign it's a way of deflecting responsibility away from Kat Kat has been on a on a massive information campaign in the United States with some of their senior members uh going around speaking to people and saying look we're doing everything that we can but it's not our fault uh in reality considering that they are The Gatekeepers the prison Gatekeepers of Gaza in many ways they do control what's going on and it's it's part of that information campaign that we've seen in Western capitals run by Israeli information networks to kind of blame the UN and un agencies of saying they're insufficient they're undermined by Hamas they're they're they're complicit in whatever is going on whatever happened on the 7th of of October uh and so that's part of that information campaign and Kat is part is integrated into that overall strategy but kogut isn't a strategic so it's still because it reports to the military it's not a civilian institution that is next to the military it is answering to the same military strategy and as Raymond said already before military or humanitarian Aid has become weaponized it had become a tool of statecraft a tool of Warfare by the Israelis and kek therefore has become part of that same military strategy of uh attacking not just Hamas and the Hamas infrastructure but also the civilians that live in Gaza and and as such Kat is very much complicit in that uh and I would see any of these kind of information campaigns as part of a wider effort to discredit International International Community and the especially Nos and the humanitarian Community Raymond I saw you nodding along to a lot of what Andreas was saying there it like you wanted to jump in please go ahead yeah I just want to to drop in and uh I think it's fair also to to mention the catastrophic impact of freezing of funds to unra unra was responsible for all the infrastructure for receiving humanitarian assist into Gaza and now we see the freezing funds uh that unra it's not able to do their work they have also been very instrumental to the rest of the humanitarian family because they had the infrastructure so uh no 20 countries or or so uh still are freezing the funds so this is very very dramatic and that's also uh the part of the ongoing PR campaign that everyone who has been in involved in Gaza from the humanitarian side if it's Ang if it's un they to blame and indirectly say that they are supporting groups that we are not supporting because we are doing the humanitarian assistance and we're trying to build up and strengthen the Civil Democratic Society which is also the prerequisite for trying to find a more peaceful solution first we also have to strengthen that because it will not be sustainable if you are just flushing in a lot of Aid without any control and we know that in Gaza these days the Law and Order of course it's almost impossible to to Prevail so uh we need access at the same time to see that we are partners that doing over bus to trying to save lives in extreme critical situation for the population in gos these days Sarah before October 7th you had around 500 trucks of Aid that would enter Gaza daily and and even then most of the population depended on humanitarian assistance of course things have grown much more dire and the drop off it's been precipitous when it comes to the number of trucks that go in everyone knows not enough relief is getting into Gaza what are the priorities right now and why isn't it getting to the people who need it that definitely is is not enough uh entry of Aid into Gaza right now for us at the international Committee of the cross one of the the main priorities is Medical Care medical supplies and medical equipment right now there is I would say no functioning health system in Gaza and there are increasing concerns and increasing rates uh of things like infectious diseases on top of those who have been wounded and require ongoing care ongoing dressing changes you know people already lived with chronic diseases and disabilities before the 7th of October before this escalation began there are still people who require their regular medication things like uh dialysis and and cancer treatment chemotherapy uh that has now been uh had immense pressure added to it because there are so many thousands of people who have been severely wounded who are exposed to the elements uh in Gaza right now living in tents uh in a very small area in in about 20% of the entirety of the Gaza Strip and this is really just a a hot bed uh of of public health concerns I think there are many challenges and many reasons why suppliers are not reaching people the first is that there is such a a vast array of needs you know individual people individual families have different needs and to even be able to to go through that and try and address each need uh is is a challenge in and of itself there are of course the security concerns um our team has been impacted by by security uh incidents our team was fortunately in November fired upon I know other humanitarian organizations have have had similar incidents uh and the logistics there are no passable roads in Gaza or very few passable roads they're lited with rubble there are the uh concerns of unexploded ordinances fighting in this that people are are not able to tell uh where it is and of course there is very little access to those civilians who are still uh in the north Sarah let me also ask you you're talking about you know the logistics and how difficult it is and and on that note there are reports now that the UK and Canada have started to airdrop supplies to Northern Gaza because they say it's impossible to get Aid in there from your perspective is that a sustainable or efficient way of delivering Aid and and is it really impossible to the extent that that's the only way that Aid could get in so air drops are something that we at the icrc have used in the past in in different conflicts around the world um and we're we're very uh pleased of course that this means that some in the north will receive uh the medical supplies that I believe were dropped but drops air drops do come with their own you know set of challenges um apart from the logis sticks things like that there needs to be uh large areas that are not filled with people uh that do not have objects in the way um it is it is a very expensive and so therefore I'm unsure how sustainable that would be for for multiple uh attempts um you know there's always the the small uh potential that things break on impact it really depends on what's in these airdrops is it is it medical equipment that's very sensitive is it supplies is it bags of rice or flour uh they are their own challenges with air drops uh on the on the impossibility of gaining access to the north I don't know if I would call it impossible in a general sense but safely absolutely not right now it's very complex very challenging for any organizations to to go to the north uh or return from the north this is as I said there there's all those Logistics like the the rubble the unexploded ordinances but it is an active conflict Zone still there are still fighting ongoing there are still you know missiles and Rockets flying back and forth there is at times hand toand combat fighting in different areas telecommunications is a huge challenge for teams to be able to even even communicate uh their Pathways where they are that's a that's a really big challenge um for anyone who is attempting to to gain access to the right now Andreas I want to explore a bit more about Kat because this is a complicated issue and there is a lot of confusion about how exactly Aid gets in uh we were talking earlier about Kat being a body within the defense Ministry you were saying as part of the military structure from your perspective would things be at all easier if something like Kat were shifted under a civilian controlled structure or would that perhaps complicate things further maybe even politicize the matter further now in a normal country in a normal liberal democracy I would say yes this sort of agency should be civilian control shouldn't be run by the military uh when you look at um you know the the what happened in our counter Insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan executed by Western countries we kind of try to shift governance back to a civilian body fairly swiftly um the problem in Israel is obviously and there has been quite a lot of debate in in recent months to kind of shift Kat away from the ministry of Defense to uh no no less no one uh less than the Minister of Finance schmage who himself is obviously a settler he's a convicted uh is a convicted uh offender as well in that space and obviously is highly politicized has a has a huge interest in making sure that Kat is actually no longer cooperating and as we are criticizing Kat quite rightly for what it said does as a gatekeeper to let Aid into Gaza it things would be far worse if Kat was not controlled by the military but would actually be controlled by a highly politicized uh Ministry such as the Ministry of Finance which would respond to a radical like schmage who in his own views would love to uh continue with ethnic cleansing uh kind of create a situation where Garin would no longer be able and allowed to live in the Gaza Strip and would instrumentalize Kat for exactly that same reason hence why the military has been pushing back Raymond um there is confusion when it comes to reporting how much Aid is actually getting into Gaza there seem to be a lot of discrepancies in the numbers that have been posted and reported by different bodies how difficult is it to actually decipher how many Aid trucks are getting into Gaza these days earlier in the discussions today we heard that usually before the 7th of October it was 500 trucks each day now it's some days it's snow tracks some other day it's up to 20 maybe 100 and then down to zero the day after so the overall perspective it's that there is a limit of humanitarian ass assistance is almost nothing so I think it's a saying in war the first victim is the truth and this is also the truth in this war we're trying to say that well it's not that serious it's not the blockade it's still uh as we heard in the earlier discussion today there are no food sortage in Gaza of course what is the consequences 30,000 has been killed they have been killed since 7th of October 80% depend on that that so it's limitation it's difficulties but we know that it's coming Raymond some yes Raymond I'm I'm sorry to interrupt you we just have about a minute and a half left I also want to ask you about the fact that when it comes to the concern about being able to operate in Gaza and distribute Aid we heard in the last couple of days that the world food program is going to be halting Aid deliveries in the northern part of Gaza how much concern is there about that right now and and do you believe that perhaps even Norwegian people's Aid will have to Halt distribution of Aid in the north of Gaza because of security concerns too going forward yeah that's true we hope that it will we need some more International humanitarian workers into gasa we think that also for security reason it will be good we have heard news about that birdfood program that they have in pipeline food for two two months more to go uh which is possible but but still access is the main problem now we have to see that both AAS Crossing near Gaza City must be open Carney Crossing can be open and at the same time we have Rafa Crossing and K Shalom Crossing which is necessary because it's limited access for the people who lives in gasa to move from north to south and east to west so we need to have more more access all right well we have run out of time so we're going to have to leave the conversation there thanks so much to all of our
