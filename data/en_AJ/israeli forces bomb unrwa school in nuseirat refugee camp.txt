we're moving on to other news now and at least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza it targeted a un School housing displaced people in the nth refugee camp the injured have been rushed to the nearby alaa hospital well let's bring in our correspondent hany Mahmud he's joining us live from De Al Bala in central Gaza uh hany what are you hearing about this latest strike well in the a little over 24 hours we're talking about the three atrocities committed in different parts of the gastro including hanun M evacuation Zone further north to a shot of refugee camp and just within the past couple hours almost less than uh two hours an air strike targeted honorable school that's the United Nations for Palestinian refugees the turn facility into shelters and and evacuation centers for the hundreds of Palestinian displaced families from the northern part in different parts of the god strip 12 people reported killed transferred to a hospital a small siiz Hospital in no Camp better known as ala Hospital some of them arrived here to Ala hospital but the vast majority of those critically wounded have been transferred to alaka hospital we' seen some of the most horrific wounds arriving here uh and for the most part they are being admitted into surgeries right away at the operating theater in an attempt to to save life we're talking about at close to 70 people now the tragedy of all of this is the patterns of these attacks the patterns of the the kind of casualties that we looking at again women and children are making the vast majority of casualties uh brought to the hospital whether here or the uh allow the hospital in NRA refugee camp this is not the first time we're seeing facilities uh managed and operated by Honor being attacked deliberately and directly targeted by Israeli air air strikes or in what H what happened in in the northern part of the gusta when is military storm uh these evacuation centers and destroying its facilities and the properties of these evacuation uh centers there's a sense of Mayhem sense of chaos going on right now at the school it has deepened the the shattered sense of Safety and Security these people when they were told to uh leave their homes in the northern part in Gaza City or different parts of the Central Area they uh they found the honorable facilities a safe haven for them to protect themselves from the unpredictable uh Fallen bobs for the past nine month but so far sadly these facilities that been turned into shelters have been the uh the subject and the side of major attacks by the Israeli uh occupying forces by Relentless air attacks and by artill heavy artilleries for the past nine months and honey it's difficult to imagine you know the latest strike on nth it's difficult to imagine what's uh left there to attack because it has been one of the areas Thea the refugee camp there have been one of the areas that have been that have seen the biggest number of attacks over the past more than 9 months yes well right now almost every corner of the Gaza Strip has been repeatedly targeted but notorious among these is a noat refugee camp just almost a month ago when there really military in what it described as a precise military operation to free a hostages from a refug camp this really military and the extent of the the the tragedy and the crimes committed there continues to unfold we're talking uh close to uh to almost 400 people uh who were killed in that attack on the N refugee camp and close to 700 of critically wounded and the fact that the paramedics and civil defense crew were still just not until last week they stopped the search they put all the searge operations into uh into an end they were looking for people who were buried under the rubbles buried under the pile of dirts and pile of sand that were caused by the Relentless multiple air strikes and the heavy artilleries of an entire residential block at the N refugee camp this is and what what we're seeing today is is one uh of many events many horrific events taking it place at refugee camps and let me just point out this refugee camp across the gust trp have been major sites of Israeli attacks to the point some of the residents of these refugee camps started to describe that this war is against refugee camps against people who are the children and the grandchild of Palestinians who were forced from their own homes and residency in in 1948 and were scattered into different areas whether here in the Gaza Strip or outside of the Palestinian territory hany thank you very much for that update hanni Mahmud with the latest on the latest Israeli attack in noat uh joining us live from there Al Bala in central Gaza and let's bring in Luigi Danel now he's a senior lecturer in law of armed conflict and he's joining us live from Nottingham in the UK thank you very much for your time you are an expert in the laws of armed conflict and it's a day after one of the deadliest attacks in Gaza in several months Israel said that it went after hamas's military leader in the attack in al- maasi more than 24 hours later no indication he's been killed but we have uh more than 90 people killed in that attack including babies more than 140 people killed in Gaza over the past 24 hours will the attack in masasi just the latest attack in nus will these attacks be used against Israel in the genocide case at the international court of justice absolutely they are already being used in the genocide case and appropriately so this is now a routine of the Israeli assault on Gaza and even attacks on safe areas with devastating bombs are not new uh we can remember that in December several news outlets counted at least 208 craters compatible with 2,000 hom s in the southern areas of the street of the strep declared safe since then these indiscriminate bombardments have continuously daily killed hundreds of civilians totaling 15,000 children killed so when war is conducted so lawlessly against civilians then it means that it includes policies accepting the elimination of a protected group under the genocide Convention as if it was an incidental cost of warfare and how will the justification that Israel is going after top Hamas leaders fair in a court of law Israel has since a long time tried to devise a distortion of the laws of war concept of proportionality progressively dehumanizing hundreds of Palestinian Ians killed in each attack as collateral damage this has no legal basis under the law of War uh collateral damage means incidental harm to civilians not excessive in comparison to the military Advantage Israel is basically saying that given uh the pursu of its security uh involved in the elimination of Senor senior amas Commander there is no limit of the amount of Palestinian civilians and children that can be knowingly purposefully killed and this is per se a war crime of disproportionate attacks criminalized in the r statute of the international criminal court but the fact that these war crimes have been committed in the hundreds means that the overall policy of the war has a genocidal character Mr Daniel thank you so much for your expertise on this we really appreciate it that is Luigi Daniel joining us live from notingham in the UK thanks for having make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news
