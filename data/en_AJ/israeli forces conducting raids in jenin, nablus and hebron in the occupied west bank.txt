while turning to the occupied West Bank now where Israeli forces have been carrying out yet more raids we're getting reports of incursions in the towns of Janine nablas and Hebron Israel stepped up nightly raids on the territory in recent days let's bring in Zay basravi he joins us live now from rala Zay so just bring us up to date with the latest on those raids well it's been another very busy night it's been far busier than it has been in previous nights in recent weeks we've seen the occupied West Bank really turn into a patchwork of violence with multiple raids going on in communities across the area earlier this evening we saw raids in Nablus Bethlehem uh heon in nablo at least three people were arrested in the village of azun in the kilia area uh we had heard reports uh that today a couple of days ago there had been gunshots fired at Israeli troops residents there say they were bracing for some kind of retaliation for some kind of incursion that did happen this evening now we don't have any further update at the moment but it seems that the raids there uh may have ended so far but the the main flash point the main area of activity this evening seems to be once again Janine Janine City uh a heavy presence of Israeli military forces went into that area earlier this evening uh they were accompanied by armored vehicles as well as armored bulldozers and at least two people were injured in what people there residents described as ongoing heavy clashes between Israeli military and Palestinian Fighters uh now we know that two people were injured ambulances were trying to get into those areas to try to get to the injured uh they were being stopped in many locations but Israeli bulldozers were digging up streets digging up infrastructure making it more difficult in the long run for people to be able to navigate those communities and that is part of this it is not just about going after people it is about creating longlasting effects creating sense of dread and fear in those communities um we've also heard that there are raids now in ramala at the jalon refugee camp two journalists were arrested in the bade Village as well uh Zane on the uh diplomatic front US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is traveling to rala there where you are to meet with the Palestinian president that's right as part of this Whirlwind tour he is going to be here in ramalan just a matter of hours at 9 GMT in just a few hours we are expecting him to meet with the Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas they will no doubt be discussing primarily trying to bring a halt to the violence in Gaza trying to bring a ceasefire to Gaza trying to get humanitarian Aid in but in parallel there have been ongoing problems in the occupied West Bank that will no doubt be a topic of discussion 148 people killed since the October 7th uh attacks uh 2,40 people have been arrested and detained in these nightly raids that have been ongoing settler violence has been ongoing but all of the frequency all of the intensity of these things have gone up since those attacks but to what end it remains to be seen no amount of diplomatic engagement has so far brought an end to the violence not in Gaza not in the occupied West Bank all right Zay Bazi live for us in rala Zay thank you
