in support of Palestine continue at University campuses across the United States despite a Crackdown by police hundreds of students and teachers have been arrested over the past week while Kristen salumi is live for us now at New York University K Christen I can see obviously there are protests uh behind you there just talk to us about what's been happening yes indeed last night 133 students and faculty members were arrested at new New York University in a Plaza on the school campus itself today hundreds of them hundreds more have joined them those who were arrested students and faculty have returned to this park outside of the campus just across the street from the campus uh to resume their protests they are calling for the University to close its campus it has a satellite campus in Tel Aviv Israel they're calling uh for free speech to be protected on campus which they say it wasn't last night and they are calling for the University to divest of its Assets in companies that profit from Israel's war in Gaza so what we are seeing here today again hundreds if not thousands of people joining this group of demonstrators to amplify their voice many of them showed up here with their faces covered by mouth I was told that they were nervous about showing their faces and being identified because of all the blowback that they are receiving for these demonstrations they also denied that they're being hostile uh and that they are anti-semitic they just want to make their point to the university here's more of what happened here last night police moved in after dark to arrest demonstrators at New York University where over 100 students and teachers defied orders to leave a school Plaza or face consequences there were arrests at Yale University too dozens of them these students and others across the country coming out in protest of Israel's devastating war on Gaza and in solidarity with Colombia University students there the so-called Gaza solidarity encampment has been re-erected after the school called in police to arrest more than 100 students and dismantle it last week we demand that all Columbia's faculty joined protesters to condemn the move initiated by the University president who canceled in-person classes Monday to address security concerns the president's decision to send Riot police to pick up peaceful protesters on our campus was unprecedented unjustified disproportionate divisive and dangerous they are outraged not only by the arrest but also by President namat Manu shafi's testimony before Congress while conservative Representatives called for shafi's resignation for not doing more to crack down on demonstrators the school Senate consisting of students faculty and administrators is expected to vote to censure her as early as Wednesday it's very important for faculty to um defend the university in a way that our president did not before Congress student demonstrators including Jewish student demonstrators deny accusations of anti-Semitism at Columbia University they even stopped their protest to celebrate the first night of passover they described their movement as peaceful and blame any antagonistic inflammatory statements or actions on Outsiders from California's state Polytechnic University on the west coast to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College on the East the demands for school leaders are the same we want Emerson College number one call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza number two to disclose all financial investments in Zionist organizations number three to divest best from those organizations number four to drop all charges against students for disciplinary actions attempts to silence the movement only amplifying its call Kristen salumi Al jazer New York m is a lecturer at columia law school he's joining us from New York thanks very much for being with us what in your interpretation happened when these arrests took place so I and other faculty members were horrified last week as we watched uh 108 students get arrested on the south lawn of columia university for standing in solidarity with the people of Raza and asking Columbia to devest from the Israeli War there um it was appalling to many of us that the Columbia president went straight to calling NYPD New York Police Department into campus Without Really Trying to do anything to deescalate first this is a really outrageous step that the president went to um these are students who pay tuition to be here they're in our care and we should uh be protecting them and creating a space for free speech and freedom of expression not calling police Riot police to remove them from campus I'm reading here that the NYPD commissioner Edward caran said that the students quote that were arrested were peaceful offered no resistance whatsoever and were saying what they wanted to say what was the reaction are you aware of what they the reaction was when the police arrived and what the interaction between the police and the students was yes so I was at the protest about 30 minutes ago uh the camp is back up um it's peaceful there's students there uh talking studying it's the same as it was last week there was really no justification for calling in Riot police to remove protesters who are sitting peacefully on a lawn not holding buildings not disrupting classes not preventing people from going to class um really just holding space and calling on the university to divest um so the fact that you know in response to that the school went straight to calling at the police is pretty outrageous and it's why more than 100 faculty members from Columbia walked out of class yesterday uh to protest this reaction it's why the president of the university is currently facing a censor vote um and it's all also why the New York civil liberties Union our own Human Rights Institute here at Columbia have all condemned uh the fact that the president went straight to the police here we should also note that it's not just the police the University's also suspended these students without any kind of due process um many of the students have been evicted from their dormitories dormitories that they pay for some given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings and so overall it's been Draconian punitive response to these protests um in a situation that really doesn't Merit it there's no justification for this when students are really just sitting on a lawn doing their homework correct me if I'm wrong but I I understand that the encampment had been timed because there was a congressional testimony that was being given by the Columbia president Manu safik that was taking place the same day the um on the University's response uh she was going to be talking about the University's response to anti-Semitism now those Congressional hearings as we've heard in the past or seen in the past can we very tense they can be very um um they can the certainly the educationalist can be held to account account significantly do you think that that has in some way influenced the decision by the The Faculty to bring in the police so to to be clear there it was not the faculty that brought in the police it was the University president The Faculty did not support this move student Senate Columbia Senate did not support this movement so it was unilateral decision made by the president again the wishes of many faculty to bring in the police here um it is true that the camp came up on the day that the president was testifying in Congress um I should note that this follows months and months of actions from students um to push the college the university on this issue so it's not something that is spread started last week this is student organizing that's have been happening for many months now and has now culminated in an encampment that the students are holding um I think students were disappointed that the president in her remarks to Congress uh did not push back against accusations of anti ISM from students did not really try to uh you know create a distinction between hate speech and promotion of Human Rights and so there's a lot of anger I think right now on campus for the actions of the let me interrupt you very quickly forgive me for interrupting you but I mean thanks for the clarification that this was a unilateral decision made by the president it used to be that universities and schools and colleges were supposed to be hot beds of protest that was part of the educational process it was part of a student life How concerned are you do you think given what you've uh gone through and what the students are going through that this will have an impact on uh the the confidence that students might have to hold protests like this I think it's very dangerous uh infringment on what is really a proud culture of protest and proud history of protests here at Columbia and in many universities around the country and as we seen now it's not just Colombia but there's protest and capist popping up in universities around the country um it's anytime police are brought into Crackdown on students like this it of course chills free speech uh to the students credit they don't seem to be backing down and and are back out on the lawn really within the same day that the the original CET was shut down B we appreciate your time sir thank you very much indeed make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
