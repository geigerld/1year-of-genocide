all right we're going to take this on uh with uh somebody's going to give us an interesting perspective on all of this TK habash who's a former Biden Administration political appointee now he resigned from the US Department of Education last week due to the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza uh please to say he joins us from uh Washington DC Studio T good to have you with us here in Al jaaz before we get into the wise and walls of your resignation I I'm just curious as I say you're a political appointee and you were a member of the government effectively that Anthony blinkin represents what goes through your mind when you hear him singing the same old song when he's speaking from Israel basically backing Israel's efforts in Gaza with weapons that the US supplied yeah and thank you for having me Nick um you know it's it's hard to hear unfortunately you know we're in a situation where um the indiscriminate bombing of over 2 million people in Gaza has continued for uh over three months now and it's clear that the messaging and the policy is not really shifting I think like there's a clear acknowledgement that there is too much uh violence too much harm that has fallen on uh innocent Palestinian lives but we continue to fall short of acknowledging the humanity and the right to life for those Palestinians and it it's difficult to hear now you had a sign ific an important job in the Biden Administration it's the ongoing situation in Gaza that of course forced your hand and I'm sure you didn't take the decision lightly but just just take us through if you would why you did make the decision that you did in the end yeah listen I mean for me as a Palestinian American as a Palestinian man as a Palestinian Christian you know my my identity is intertwined with everything that's been happening and the reality is is that there has been a near daily dehumanizing effect of our current policies and uh just what is allowed to persist um in terms of the aggression against Palestinian life and I you know for weeks used every Avenue I could to raise concerns about these policies to emphasize the importance of humanizing Palestinians uh you know Palestinian men too Palestinian Christians who are a significant minority in the region now and you know that message was it fell on deaf ears and uh it was clear the only thing that I could do in this moment to emphasize my consternation my concern with the ongoing policy uh was to resign so when when you say it fell on deaf ears what actually happened did people just tell you just to keep quiet and and not mention it or what was what was the how did it unfold yeah it it wasn't necessarily like uh keep quiet um you know the White House held listening sessions um policy briefings which was mostly just communicating to us what their assessment of the region is um of the circumstance as it was uh unraveling um you know within the Department of Education there was a lot of understanding even from the secretary himself who I met with and spoke with on numerous occasions about um how the how the violence was affecting me on a personal level um you know there was a lot of patience and um and just like con and constant support from my own building but I think you know being able to communicate about that on a personal level is very different from acknowledging how the broader policies are affecting millions of people in the region and also millions of Americans who broadly support an end to this violence and uh permanent ceasefire right we'll come on to that in just a second but I guess it must been extremely hard for you to hear what you what was being said effectively by your boss the president and when he said he didn't for examp example necessarily trust Palestinian figures for the number of dead yeah yeah absolutely I talk about that in my letter that you know there are certain things that I think were um really dangerous rhetoric that was used by the administration over the last three months that allowed and facilitated uh the level of Destruction against uh the Gaza Strip and the millions of people who live there today so yeah now you you talked about the growing support for the Palestinian cause in the United States a protest has interrupted President Biden's speech yesterday in South Carolina we're likely to see more of that I guess as the in this election year to what degree do you think this is going to affect uh the Democrats hopes in the polls the election polls yeah I think it's up to the president and the Democratic party more broadly to make a decision but I think we're seeing it affect uh that right now like you said there were protests at the church where the president spoke there were protests across New York City that shut down uh four different tunnels and bridges you know this is something that we're starting to see more of because I think the the soul of the American people really does believe in an end to the violence here I think we see a majority of Americans support a ceasefire we see the vast majority of the democratic base younger voters voters of color who do not believe that the current policies are reflective of their values and I think the president has frequently in the last week t talked about what 2024 means with respect to protecting democracy from an authoritarian um regime that would uh be possible under Trump and I think that's a really important and critical message but I think it's also inconsistent with what the president is doing uh with respect to his deference to an authoritarian right-wing regime in the Israeli government and its oppression of millions of Palestinians so I was just one final thing the thing is that Democrats disagree all they like with President Biden but what are they going to do are they going to just just turn turtle and vote for Trump no I think it's up to the president to decide how important his voters are and uh understanding that they really do value human life regardless of whose lives it is and it's clear that the current policies um you know put restrictions on uh when Palestinian lives matter and when they don't and I think that's a problem for voters T we do appreciate you coming on to talk to us here at Al jazer thanks very much indeed as T aash your former Biden Administration political appointee who resigned from the Department of Education last week thank you T
