welcome to the program it's 19 GMT that's 10 p.m. in Gaza at least 500 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike in The besieged Enclave that's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry hundreds of families were Sheltering in and around the Baptist Hospital Palestinian Authority president Mahmud abas called the attack a massacre and genocide in a statement he went on and said that he will not be meeting with the US President Joe Biden when he visits the region the Palestinian Liberation Organization has released a statement in response to the attack it says we call on the International Community to intervene immediately to stop this massacre let's bring in our correspondent now T Abu AUM who joins us live from KH Unis in southern Gaza T any further information about what un folded at the Baptist hospital this evening well firstly I'd like to start with the latest update inside the Gaza Strip uh an official Source in Hamas movement had told us that Hamas is ready to release uh civilian and foreign captives if the Israeli occupation forces stop its aggression on the Palestinian people this is what the latest updates that we have got from the Gaza Strip according to official sources that had told us during the last hour in terms of what was happening in al- madani and in Arab a hospital according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health inside the Gaza Strip the death to still really spiking according to the latest updates that we had uh reached from the Palestinian Ministry of Health that the number of people vict of the victims uh killed by the Israeli ongoing uh air strikes has reached around approximately from 200 up to 500 uh Palestinians who were killed uh due to the Israeli strike on that hospital uh this Hospital was densely populated with a lot of people who were really displaced from the houses after receiving different warnings from the Israeli occupation to to evacuate the houses uh this uh densely populated Hospital also was a shelter for a lot of people who really uh run away from the Israeli ongoing compartment inside the Gaza Strip till this current moment Medical Teams are trying to identify the number of victims and even are providing a treatment for thousands of Palestinians who are being victim and the new victims that had who have been injured and the new injuries that have turned up to the hospital it's also important to mention that the director of a shifat hospital said that we are conducting and carrying out operations on the on on the ground it seems that even medical uh facilities are not yet enough uh to keep providing medical treatment for the great number of people wounded in this air strike TK how does the intensification of this evening's bombardment compared to the previous 11 days well this is the uh bloodiest attack that had been carried out by the Israeli occupation forces on the Gaza trp since the early outbreak of this round of fighting between Palestinian Fighters and the Israeli occupation forces uh you are talking about a huge number of victims in comparison with the previous kind of strikes and the bombardment that took place uh the the the uh the the minimum uh range of attacks that could least could at least cause severe destruction to civil and uh to civil uh and even private uh properities also uh claiming the life of thousand of of dozens of Palestinians but this attack claimed the life of hundred of Palestinians in only one strike this is considered to be the most aggressive attack since the early beginning of this fighting tck we know that the situation with water has been dire it's been cut off there has been shortages of fuel and food speaking to Residents around you what are they saying about the conditions that they're living in well uh people inside the Gaza Strip are really experiencing hard conditions specifically especially with the ongoing Israel clo of borders and the prevention of Entry of any essential items to the Gaza Strip uh also the Israeli authorities uh have rejected the entry of any fuel supplies to The besieged Enclave people inside the Gaza Strip are trying to survive based on minimum abilities and me even based on minimum uh let's say water sources and fuel they are consuming the already exist fuel before the the eruption of the round of fighting even hospitals inside the Gaza Strip are really suffering from the great shortage or fuel that even ambulances won't be able later in the coming hours to be able to evacuate victims due to that great shortage T if civilians there can't seek help help or shelter in hospitals and they can't seek shelter at un schools where can they go well there is no any place inside the Gaza Strip Palestinians really are frustrated every single corner of the Gaza Strip had been bombarded by the Israeli occupation forces schools hospitals uh public buildings private sectors even private companies were targeted so it seems that the Gaza Strip is witnessing uh very horrific uh attacks that could be really uh that really BR catastrophic consequences on every life aspects inside the Gaza Strip so people really have no safe place to go to they just only depend on uh residing in the surrounding areas of hospitals meanwhile hospitals become a new Target for the Israeli strikes and you're outside another hospital that's close by what impact is that having this most recent bombardment having on on health workers where you are and in terms of it being already overwhelmed well uh the this hospital and the majority of gaza's hospitals have been full uh fully crowded with people who really were displaced from their houses uh those displaced people did not find initial building just accept hospitals in order to resign around and hope to be protected from the Israeli bombardment meanwhile uh the the the Intensive existence of those citizens around the hospitals really sometimes affect negatively on the impact and the performance of the uh of the medical teams in order to uh to carry out the work uh perfectly even Medical Teams are are really finding great difficulty in in performing their jobs due to the great lack of medical supplies so the entire Gaza Strip had been turned to a very uh catastrophic city which is really full of Sorrow pains and even uh the the great shortage of basic necessities well the situation unfolds around you and people are no doubt just mainly trying to survive we're seeing images of stretcher after stretcher injured person after injured person is there any sense of what's going on outside of Gaza on the Diplomatic front well uh generally uh pal Ians here inside of the Gaza Strip become uh profoundly uh believ that they are really unsafe from now on specifically with the uh great destruction that have been caused in al- madani and Arab Hospital uh this building has been uh targeted by the Israel air strikes people were sleeping on the ground in the surrounding areas sometimes on the floor of the hospital so it seems that this densely populated building had been mercilessly targeted without taking care of the existance of hundreds of Palestinians who really evacuated the houses even Palestinians here inside the Gaza Strip after this attack delivered different messages to the International Community that they need an urgent intervention to gaza's STP in order to help them to be able to be protected from the Israeli strikes and even to provide them with humanitarian AIDS T we appreciate that update in trying conditions TK Abu AUM in southern Gaza for us let's stay in Gaza and speak to a resident there who's joining us on the phone reat aler who's also the editor of Gaza rights back reat we appreciate you speaking to us given the intensity of the situation around you can you describe what's happened where you are this evening uh what's happening is a a total blood paath it's a it's a massacre unprecedented in in terms of uh where uh Israel struck in terms of the number of people with speak about uh 5,000 people congregating in a small place in a hospital that also has a church in Al uh Baptist Hospital killing uh around 500 and injuring injuring injuring more uh I want to start with something also equally important soon after the the strike several Israeli uh media influencers in social media uh celebrated the attack quickly celebrated the attack and I'm quoting here somebody is saying that Israeli Air Force struck a Hamas terrorist bace inside a hospital in Gaza multiple number of terrorists are are and I'm saying this because Israel will always quickly rush to deny such hideous and heinous massacr against against Palestinian what Israel is doing is extermination this is genocide that has to be sted at price and at as possible I've spoken to you a couple of times now rat over the past few days and this is by far the most emotional I've heard you on the phone where are you at emotionally we are devastated we're devastated the the family members they're weeping they're crying the little kids are terrified they can sense that because we also have relatives Sheltering there we are also have we also have neighbors Sheltering there there from Sha we also have relatives who are injured and inside of the hospital and we we can't uh uh get hold of any of those people to make sure that they are doing okay we can't go out we can't reach the hospital because it's also dangerous because the bombing after the mass did not also stop Israel several areas so this is devastating not only to me because I live in Al because you have fames and friends but to every Palestinian every Pro Palestinian social media is is is is is very angry hopefully this is going to uh uh uh uh put more pressure on on America that is sending arms sending weapons on the European Union that is aiding and aiting the Israeli genocidal regime that is Exterminating Palestinians reat while we're speaking to you I just want to explain that we're actually seeing some Vision Live Vision coming from rala what we do understand was that hundreds of Palestinians had come out in support of Gaza uh and against the Israeli War if you will um is it somewhat comforting to know that people are coming out in force albeit they are being met by Security Forces that's that's a a really really disheartening scene but it's good that the Palestinian authori is also uh pushing to I I heard you just reporting that abas is refusing to to meet with uh with with with Biden uh this is good hopefully the PA security forces would stop Palestinian protesters and stop attacking Palestinian protest or harassing Palestinian resistance in the West Bank what what's happening in the West Bank is an extension to what's happening in Gaza we speak about more than 60 Palestinians killed in in in 10 days in the West Bank because we are a whole people we are united together they're not in solidarity with us they are part of us and we are part of them reat we um we've seen a humanitarian catastrophe over the past 11 days was there any sense that it could get even worse I think yeah it is it's going to get worse what's happening is literally Israel pushing Palestinians in hundreds and thousands of people in tiny small places all around the Gaza Strip and Israel is targeting those people we speak about more than 3,000 now almost 4,000 Palestinians killed we speak about 1 ,500 Palestinian children and Israel continues to bomb I'm telling you that I I could he some bombing after the this hideous massacr with Palestinian congregating in areas with Israel targeting un schools just this morning six Palestinians in in the middle area we were killed in a un shelter six Palestinians targeted by by Israel so there is no no no one is safe no place is is safe not a hospital not a mall not a church not even a shelter that is uh uh providing refuge for for Palestinian families especially the one inly and women well we appreciate you speaking to us during what is a trying time refat Aller a resident and editor of Gaza writes back
