nowhere in Gaza seems to be safe right now un facilities schools Sheltering displaced Palestinians have also come under attack Al just here spoke to some people who fled to a primary school they described the conditions [Music] there we are in a miserable situation even animals have a better life than ours we have not seen or touched water for 5 days now in a few days time we all starting with our children will die from thirst or infected diseases there is no water for us to drink or wash let's go now to he's actually at a un run School in Gaza what are conditions like there where you're at s do people have access to drinking water well as in the interview uh we talk to the people here they say they live in a miserable conditions that even they all the say say the same thing that even animals would not accept to live in these conditions we went inside before and we find like 50 people in one classroom these schools are made for uh for learning for uh uh you know for um students and not made for to to to get or to have uh 50 to 70 in some other rooms uh people in one in one classroom uh they don't have the minimum of uh of hygiene uh measures they don't have the minimum of food standards the food needs they don't have the minimum of of even drinkable drinkable water I saw some of them even outside carrying bottles and looking for uh the trucks who sell uh putable or drinkable water because uh for the last couple of days there is serious lack of water so uh in this at in this Place only there are more than one uh 100 1,600 people in including women and children living in this miserable place next we have we could see the the uh you know garbage burning garbage because the municipalities are not able to to come and collect the garbage from these areas and Still Still They these people they believe they are lucky because the vast majority of the Palestinians in Gaza of the Tomb million 43 people they couldn't have the chance to move inside United Nation schools because these schools are already full all over the Gaza Strip some of our colleagues that he moved his children into five or six different places because there's no safe place so still with all these back life conditions here they believe that or it's believed that they are lucky people that they found a place to stay with their children safety even for the personal safety while we are standing here we could see we could hear the uh the heavy uh waret explosions or raids uh bombarding just few hundred meters from this place so even these shelters are not safe uh for any either life measure or safety uh measures and S now that electricity has been cut what does it mean particularly for hospitals look Samy uh let me just add one thing electricity is live everything runs by is run by electricity not only elevator not only universities uh um schools not only uh um medical centers or so everything is connected to electricity the other serious point is that there is no fuel access that to that we can either operate or the the Power Authority can operate the so power station or even for the individual or personal generators so people can have some of uh some electricity per day Israel still ban the electricity the the the fuel needed for uh for using the personal or individual electrical generators so no electricity no life all life walks of life will stop and they start now they started with uh the serious shortage and lack of drinkable water and not only drinkable water even the daily use water so people now are using only bottles and gallons all right thanks so much
