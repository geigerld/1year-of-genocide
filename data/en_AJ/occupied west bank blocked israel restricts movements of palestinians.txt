Israel has blocked travel routes inside the occupied West Bank Imran Khan has this report from rala okay I'm going back I'm going back the occupied West Bank is now not only occupied it's effectively blockaded the Israeli Army has turned it into an archipelago of separation you can't leave your home to go visit family or friends in a neighboring area 3.2 million Palestinians are simply stuck I left 10 minutes ago I am sick but they're not letting me in this is worse than when we used mules to move around in the old days now we can't even get anywhere with cars Israeli forces have also severely restricted the border with Jordan the only crossing point for Palestinians want to travel abroad leaving thousands stranded so Kalia is the head of settlement monitoring at the applied Research Institute Jerusalem he specializes in Israel system of checkpoints and restrictions on Palestinians the West Bank is surrounded by hundreds of checkpoints at the border with Egypt at the green line or within the West Bank these new restrictions have turned the West Bank into small prisons and the occupier controls all entries and exits this is the dco checkpoint just north of rala it divides Palestinian territory now the Israelis make it very difficult for Palestinians to normally cross this checkpoint but now it's impossible they've just shut it down completely in the Palestinian town of Hua this road that runs through it cannot be used by Palestinians sometimes the Israelis make exceptions for medical or family emergencies but even that small concession has now gone if you're Palestinian and you visited a neighboring area on Saturday you're now stuck there many here feel this effective blockade may not be temporary that it's simply a precursor to even heavier Israeli restrictions that may well become permanent Imran Khan Al jazer Rah the occupied West Bank Sir Jeffrey nice joins us from Canterbury UK he is Emeritus Gres professor of law uh sir I had a long list of questions for you but we just heard the US president he said a short while ago from the White House quote we uphold the rule of law and the laws of war it matters there's a difference and end quote presumably he was drawing a distinction between the legality of uh hamas's actions hamas's attack in Israel and Israel's attack on the Gaza Strip can you help our viewers navigate this what is legal and not legal in what you've been watching over the last four days he may well have been drawing that distinction and before I come to the specific answer to your question I was was inclined to make this observation President Biden and Israel could do a great deal for the rule of law if they joined up to the international criminal court and allowed that Court to investigate the legality both of the occupation to date bearing in mind the illegality of the war in Israel and submit peacefully to Legal adjudication of what they're doing it's an unhappy reality that Israel is more or less immune from the jurisdiction of the international criminal court that America will save it if there's any attempt to refer it there by the security Council and that America itself is not a member of that Court as to your specific question then I think the following has to be accepted the strike by Hamas is pretty obviously unlawful they give reasons for it but I don't think the reasons would Merit a defense if challenged in court the attack by Israel may or may not be justified in part defense against the Rockets certainly self-defense already a hard issue from them to advance for several reasons not just because uh um of the overall circumstances but because uh you defend yourself against a state and Gaza is not a state it's also an occupied territory and it's occupied by Israel so there got out the initial problems about the legality of what it's doing although defending itself against the Rockets is undoubtedly legal the nature of its attack on Gaza is much much more problematic for it and the language of the politicians and military leaders is something we must watch with great care Siege may just about in certain circumstances be legal for example if the siege is of a territory or a town or an area that is comprised entirely of opposing forces that is not the case here and Siege brings it the inevitability of the risk of starvation it's almost forecast by what is said by Israel and intentional starvation is now recognized without any doubt as an international crime so the attack by the response attack let's not use a portive term all right Israel is doing is problematic in at least those areas Sir Jeffrey nice again I I would have loved for this conversation to last a lot longer um we weren't hadn't quite forecast the speech and the length of the speech by the US president but I thank you so much for that invaluable analysis of what is legal what's not legal and what's a great area when it comes to the law of War
