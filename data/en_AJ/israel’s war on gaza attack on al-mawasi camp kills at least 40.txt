we begin in southern Gaza where at least 40 people have been killed and 60 injured in an Israeli attack in an area housing displaced people war planes bombed an encampment in almasi west of KH Yunis it happened in the vicinity of a field Hospital run by the British charity UK Med the attack caused large craters and widespread Devastation emergency teams are recovering bodies and the injured Israel's military says it targeted a Hamas Command Center but Hamas has called the claim a blatant lie well earlier in central Gaza an Israeli air strike killed several people after a home was targeted in al bar refugee camp the injured were rushed to al- AXA Hospital in De albala Bara Zale is a vascular surgeon who has recently returned from Gaza he joins us now from Flint in Michigan welcome to the program describe if you can the kind of chaos and Devastation that in ensues when air strikes Target people living in tents and and makeshift homes and and how that affects any kind of rescue effort so in Gaza there's a common phrase that I learned recently it's very funny and very sad at the same time the phrase goes as in Gaza whoever died has survived and whoever survived is dying so anytime I hear something like this I hear about 40 50 people are dead my my heart or my mind goes to the people who have survived this attack and by no means I'm not saying that 40 people is not a significant number of death even one civilian dying is one too many but honestly what I saw in those kind of attacks when I was there is not only the severity of the people who actually died it's the injuries that happened around it for example one of the stories that really really stuck to my mind in one of those attacks there was something that they called a Precision attack they were attacking one specific tent around Naser hospital where I was in Khan unes and supposedly they attacked one tent but about 20 tents away from that tent we have multiple injuries and one specific story that came to me that really broke my heart at the time was I I was in the ER in in Naser hospital and I saw a young lady she's in her late 20s she was literally pacing from one side of the ER to the other she would stay in one side of the ear for about 2 3 minutes and then she would literally Pace quickly to the other side and I was so fascinated I was like what is she doing why is she doing this so I dropped everything I'm doing and I I I ran after her and it turns out that this lady she's a mother of two her two daughters one is six and one is nine or 10 I believe one daughter has significant shrub nail came to her face destroying half of her face and I apologize if I'm sharing too much graphic information but I think people has to know this literally her brain was sticking out you could see the brain material of that little child and the ER said you know what she's Beyond any resuscitation effort we will let her just pass away yet she was still breathing she was still grasping for air so they put her on one side of the ER where they let all the little kids die peacefully quote unquote peacefully on the other end of the ER it was another her other daughter who has both legs amputated and she was actively bleeding from both legs so this young mother she was torn physically and mentally she was racing from one side of the ER to say goodbye to her daughter whose brain is showing and who's sending her last breath going to the other side of the ER to put some pressure on the other daughter who is actively bleeding from both amputated legs so this is the kind of CH that we get after each one of those attacks and again the focus usually in the media is about the one who died and no disrespect to them that's really tragedy but my heart as a surgeon or as a physician goes to the injured mostly pediatric injuries that happen around those civility or around those casualties and with that kind of unimaginable trauma that you describe how do you even attempt to carry out medical procedures uh without the equipment or supplies that are actually needed you you try your best and the sad part is even when you try your best even when we've done and I'm so proud of my colleagues in Gaza the doctors the NES I have seen some amazing cases that are done under the bombardment but even with that even with those heroic effort in between cases whenever I have no cases no surgery to do I will just go do rounds and just check patient random patient in the in the hospital and it wasn't uncommon where I would go to say to see someone and I would check I will ask that someone you have some bandage you have some gauze in your legs when was the last time that someone changed that bandage and the standard of care in the US is at least once a day at least once a day you should change the bandage so it doesn't get infected and the very common answer would be oh the last time someone changed this bandage was six weeks ago so I will grab my scissor and I will cut that bandage to see what's underneath it and very very common I would see life maggot and warms coming out of the wound it it was literally eating the Flesh of that poor patient because no one has even symble gauze when we talk about supplies in Gaza I'm not talking about fancy supplies I'm not talking about surgical material or surgical instrument I'm literally talking about Syle gauze and tape they don't have it and that leads to the patient I just described to you where no one has changed the gauze for 6 weeks to the point where the maggots and the worms are physically eating his flesh and very very often we will end up utting that leg because it was no use just because of the lack of simple material which is Gau and dressing and and tape with all of this how do you feel not just as a surgeon but as a human being when you hear of these kind of ongoing strikes I I honestly I don't I I don't have a way to describe it the the way I would think about it is what what's the point like what is the end game of this what is and not only the air so I I I I often saw pediatric patient kids coming up with a bullet to their head and honestly in my mind I'm thinking how is that a military Target how is a kid who's barely 10 or 11 with the bullet to his head how is that little kid a military Target honestly it goes beyond my ability to understand what's the point of this war anymore given the significant amount of not only civilian casualties but pediatric casualties that we see and we see on the TV and I saw myself multiple times there okay with those harrowing accounts
