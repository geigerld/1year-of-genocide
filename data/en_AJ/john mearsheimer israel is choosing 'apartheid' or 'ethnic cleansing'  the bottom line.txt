hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question if Israel's war has gone Way Beyond self-defense to the point of making the Gaza Strip itself completely unlivable why is the Biden Administration supporting it let's get to the bottom line in less than 3 months Israel has killed nearly 1% of the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip to put that in perspective 1% of the population of America would be more than 3 million people that's like wiping out an entire State like Arkansas or Nevada and so far there's just no end in sight hundreds of innocent civilians mostly women and children are killed by Israeli forces daily and almost 100% of the people living there are now displaced that's 100% they're desperate they're hungry they're cold Israeli and US officials are acting as if the Palestinians should blame themselves because Hamas carried out a surprise attack in October that killed about 1,200 Israeli soldiers and civilians but when a country wages a war it usually has a specific outcome that it's looking for so what's the endgame for Israel today we're talking with one of America's most influential thinkers John mimer professor of political science at the University of Chicago and author of the Israel Lobby and US foreign policy as well as most recently how States think the rationality of foreign policy John it's terrific to be with you today thank you so much for joining us um you wrote a piece this week death and destruction in Gaza in which you said that we've reached a point where there is simply no meaningful military purpose in Israel's war tell us what you meant well when it comes to what Israel is doing in Gaza you have to distinguish between going after Hamas and punishing the civilian population and when we talk about punishing the civilian population we're talking about killing murdering huge numbers of civilians displacing them from their home starving large chunks of the Palestinian population inside Gaza and so forth and so on these are basically war crimes I don't think there are many people who would dispute that Israel has what we call the right to go after Hamas Hamas attacked Israel Israel's going after Hamas that's not really a contested issue for the most part but what the Israelis are doing is they're going far beyond going after Hamas and they are inflicting massive pain and Punishment on the civilian population and in my opinion this should be unacceptable to decent people all over the world and the idea that the Biden Administration is not only sanctioning this but supporting it it's very important to understand that the Israelis could not conduct this punishment campaign without support from the United States they need American military weaponry and furthermore they need American diplomatic support and we are giving that to them so we are as as deeply involved in this disaster this humanitarian disaster as the Israelis themselves are do you find that there's a worry that America's on the wrong side of this no I think there's widespread support in inside the American Body politic uh for uh uh the Palestinian civilian population I mean I don't think there's any question that lots of people think that what the Israelis are doing to the civilian population is deeply wrong there's no question there uh a lot of people won't voice their opinion on this issue publicly uh and that's in large part because they fear that the Israel Lobby will Target them and that will do damage to their career uh there's all sorts of evidence that people on college and university campuses are self- censoring for fear of the Israel lobby but even there it's clear that there's just widespread support uh for uh the Palestinian people and widespread criticism of what Israel is doing what would you be advising President Biden early on in this conflict if you were trying to advise him or the Israelis how to respond after October 7th well I think in the beginning uh Biden should have gone to Great Lengths to tell the Israelis to make sure that uh they executed a measured response and that they did not overreact and he should have made it clear that uh he would support the Israelis against Hamas uh I mean he had no choice there for sure but he also should have made it clear to the Israelis that uh if they went after the civilian population the way they are going after the civilian population uh the United States would go to Great Lengths to throttle uh Israel's attempts uh to murder huge numbers of civilians that's what he should have done we should be on the other side of the divide with regard to this campaign this bombing campaign that the Israelis are w in uh against uh the Palestinian civilians and by the way it's not just a bombing campaign uh the Israelis are trying to starve uh large numbers of Palestinians to death they've made that very clear it's not like I'm making this up the Israelis themselves say that this is exactly what they're doing uh if you look at what the Israelis are saying about uh the Palestinians how they describe the Palestinians talking about them as human animals uh and so forth and so on and then you you talk you listen to what they're saying when they talk about what they intend to do uh to Gaza you know they talk about flattening leveling it eradicating it uh you see very clearly that they are purposely uh targeting uh the civilian population and they are doing massive amounts of killing John if killing 1% of the population so many innocent people isn't a red line for the neighborhood for Egypt for Jordan for other nations around there for the United States are we all just in a in a performance act right now saying Israel please don't harm civilians please limit what you're doing but we're watching we're just helpless and just watching a horrible scene just unfold with no real leverage yeah I think that's exactly what's happening I mean just to talk about the United States we have uh the potential uh to bring this uh bombing campaign to an end we have huge potential leverage over Israel there's no question about it but it's almost impossible for any president including President Biden obviously uh to use any of that leverage and uh the end result is we can say that we hope Israel uh will limit this campaign and do everything it can to minimize civilian casualties but we don't do anything concrete or at least we haven't done anything concrete up to this point to prevent uh the Israelis from killing large numbers of civilians and by the way it's not just the Americans the Europeans uh are doing nothing themselves uh the Germans and the British their behavior is especially egregious on this front but even in the Arab world uh you don't see uh the Elites in the Arab world uh doing very much to put an end to this and in fact there's all sorts of evidence that in the Arab world it's pressure from below uh that is largely motivating the elites to criticize what the Israelis are doing uh and it's a tragic situation and it is quite remarkable in the year 2023 uh that uh the Israelis are able to get away with this what do you think Israel wants uh if not a two-state solution oh it's very clear to me what Israel wants and we're talking here about the uh the government they want to ethnically cleanse uh Gaza and they want to ethnically cleanse uh the West Bank the problem that the Israelis face Steve is that inside greater Israel and greater Israel includes Gaza the West Bank and green line Israel there are approximately uh 7.3 million Palestinians and there are approximately 7.3 million Jews so you have rough equality in the number of Jews and Palestinians inside greater Israel and that means you can have a democratic State and if you don't want a two-state solution then what are you going to do well up to now the answer is quite clear Israel has turned into an apart time state it is an apartheid state and the Israelis understand that over the long term this is probably not viable we all know what happened to South Africa can Israel exist over the long term as an apartheid state and you want to remember that groups like Human Rights Watch uh Amnesty International Bellum and so forth and so on have labeled Israel as an aparti state so they want to get out of that situation and the best way to do that from their point of view is to ethnically cleanse uh the ga the Gaza Strip and the West Bank much like they ethnically cleansed large parts of green line Israel in 1948 and much the way they cleansed large parts of the West Bank in 1967 the problem is that they have not been able to do that and the United States much to its credit has at least said that it will not uh countenance Israel ethnically cleansing Gaza but we'll see what happens there the Israelis are punishing the civilian population in Gaza in large part in my opinion to drive them out but they have not been successful so far I want to play For You John a clip um of Danny Danon Israel's former ambassador of the United Nations in 2019 and something he said about what's behind Israel's goals listen this is a deed to our land he's holding up the Bible basically the Old Testament to say this is the deed to our lands in the United Nations and I'm just asking you as sort of an analyst to say if that's what we're working with and America is allied with that how does this ever get to a different point than just an ongoing horrible convulsive ulcer it doesn't I mean this is where we are and by the way if you look at the demographics inside of Israel the people who are most likely to make the argument uh that was just made uh that you know the Bible is Israel's deed uh to owning all of Greater Israel uh the people who are most likely to make that argument are the ultra orthodox and the old Orthodox now form about 133% of Israel's population uh but over time their numbers are going to increase greatly up to the point where in about the year 2050 uh you're going to have about 30% of Israel close to onethird of Israel will be uh Ultra Orthodox and that's because the birth rate among old Orthodox women is so high uh this means that the argument that Danny Denon was just making is going to become heard more widely in Israel it's not only going to be people like him it's going to be more and more Ultra Orthodox Jews making that argument uh so this argument is simply not going away let me ask you about responsibility to protect because right now in Washington we have a couple of things tied together uh American support of Ukraine uh in in the Russia War a lot of particularly um those in on the progress agressive side of the foreign policy we're talking about r2p the responsibility to protect as one of the animators of Americans support Ukraine where are they with regards to the Israel Gaza conflict and the responsibility to protect Palestinians I I hear remarkably little from them uh there are all these people who have been talking uh for years now about the importance of r2p uh the importance of Protec ing human rights and you would expect all of them to be uh loudly proclaiming that what the Israelis are doing is unacceptable and that the United States has a moral responsibility to put an end to all of this killing of civilians of Palestinians but H you hear very little from these human rights proponents and uh from human rights groups uh inside the United States uh the silence is actually quite amazing you know when I watch polls and what's going on it's very clear that younger generation Democrats particularly Democrats of color but it's really broad SWA of younger voters in the Democratic party are very very uh uh frustrated with Joe Biden's position on Israel Gaza and you see a collapse in their support and when you interview them and do focus groups right now they say there's nothing that's going to bring them to support Joe Biden there's a more General problem at play here uh and that is that Israel has lots of support among people your age and my age but once you begin to go down uh and look at younger cohorts it's a very different story there's a Harris Harvard poll that came out very recently that says that if you look at people between the ages of 18 and 24 you survey them and you ask them this question was Hamas Justified in killing Israeli citizens on October 7th we're not talking about killing the military we're talking about killing civilians in other words was Hamas justified in what it did on October 7th 51% of people in the United States between the ages of 18 20 18 and 24 say that Hamas was justified this is stunning and then if you look at people between the ages of 25 and 34 25 and 34 48 48% say that Hamas was justified in what it did on October 7th so you see that Israel has a real problem and of course this problem manifests itself on college campuses and that's why the lobby is working overtime now to try to shut down criticism of Israel uh at universities and colleges and then uh his last last interview Henry Kissinger did with Axel Springer CEO Matias dner Kissinger said that the problem societies like the United States and Germany had was letting in so many refugees so many people from other groups because they then become agents for those other groups for those other identities and it just seemed to me one of the most remarkable inhumane comments about the importance of others outside like Palestinians you know I'm interested in that tension about race and identity inside pluralistic societies right now and whether or not we're trying to wrestle that decency out of ourselves well I would come at this from a slightly different perspective uh I I I don't like the Kissinger argument uh about bringing uh people from different ethnic backgrounds uh or different countries into the United States the United States is an immigrant culture I think that's a wonderful thing and I have no problem with bringing immigrants into the United States I think it's what's made bringing immigrants into the United States in huge numbers in the 19th century is what made this country great and uh it's will will keep this country powerful into the future so I have no problem with immigration the issue for me is uh how to think about realist Behavior versus moral behavior when you think about how a state should act in the International System and I fully understand that states have a deep-seated interest in security competition for the purposes of maximizing their chances of surviving and I fully understand that states sometimes do ruthless things to other states for good strategic reasons okay but at the same time there has to be a moral Dimension that underpins how States behave towards other states and as long as there are no sort of strategic reasons or realist reasons for behaving ruthlessly States should go to Great Lengths to act in a moral way I have no problem making that argument and I think in the case of what's going on inside of Gaza uh there is no strategic reason for Israel to destroy Palestinian Society to kill huge numbers of civilians it it just doesn't make good strategic sense and I believe it is morally wrong uh so this is why I am so deeply opposed to it I think there's no question that Israel has the right I use that word Loosely it has the right to go after Hamas Hamas attacked Israel Israel can go after Hamas and I understand that as Israel goes after Hamas there's going to be collateral damage civilians are going to be killed this happens in Wartime it is regrettable but it is a basic fact of life it's very different than purposely targeting uh civilians uh for the purposes of inflicting massive pain and Punishment on them and again this has no strategic logic there's there's no sort of realist reason for doing this and therefore I think it's deeply wrong do you see any chance at all America will in any time you know close to now turn off that tap it's a rare occasion when the United States puts course of Leverage on Israel especially when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians uh and that's because any government including the Biden Administration understands full well that if we are to get rough with the Israelis or we were to get rough with the Israelis the Israel Lobby would come after the administration hammer and tongue and the administration doesn't want that especially since we're moving into an election year are we going to be complicit do you think in the possibility of equations that are in fact ethnic cleansing well there's not a growing clamor I mean there's no question that uh this is a powerful uh motive uh on the right inside of Israel and inside of the United States uh the United States has made it clear uh the US government the Biden Administration has made it clear that that's unacceptable uh the question is what happens if the Israelis just do it uh when could argue that you know we're marching towards the point where there may be massive ethnic cleansing uh if this bombing continues and the Israelis continue to prevent uh water and food and Medicine uh from coming into Gaza in large enough amounts uh it could be that the Palestinians begin to move out of Gaza and that the Israelis uh do everything they can to facilitate that just hard to say how this plays out moving forward but the Israelis could just do it and just ignore uh what the Biden Administration is saying about what is that is not acceptable so it remains a real possibility and as I said to you before you want to understand that the Israelis basically have two choices here whether to continue operating as an apartheid state and to continue keeping Gaza as basically a giant open air prison or to ethnically cleanse Gaza and the West Bank at the same time if they can now they would definitely prefer to do that and uh the the Administration has said you can't do that but again how that plays itself out uh remains to be seen well the Biden Administration uh keeps trying to say that it wants the ground war to end by Year's End I don't see that happen I see this as a story we're going to be having to continue to focus on for some time John I hope you'll come back and keep sharing your perspectives as this evolves thank you so much for joining us professor John Mir shimer of the University of Chicago thank you Steve for having me on the show so what's the bottom line Israel's forces have destroyed more than 100,000 buildings in Gaza that's on top of the killing of thousands of women and children Innocents and it implies a different objective in this war according to at least one Israeli cabinet official the emphasis is on quote unquote damage not accuracy this conflict the babies buried in the rubble of collapsed apartment buildings the destruction of bakeries that provide bread the parading of captured Palestinian men and underwear all of it is going to be seared into the minds of not only Palestinian victims but all of us there's no moral High Ground here there's no sense that innocent Palestinian people matter in any equation they were a burden and a new in the eyes of many in Israel particularly settlers before October 7th they're looked at as inhuman the US government is complicit in the horrors we are seeing it's just nonsensical it's an orwellian Circle where America thinks it can both be seen as a legitimate Ally of palestine's interests while it sits coldly on the side of Israel's untempered war machine that only cares about damage and that's sadly the bottom
