As you can see, it is winter weather, and we are spoiled. I mean, we also have young children. I mean, at the same time, I don't know how to wash them. I have to take a shower. Answer: Of course, our eyes will not pour, water will be wasted. I mean, there is not even the existing Nile. If we have it, we will make it transparent, and this is expensive, by God. I mean.  Look for a solution for us. We are humans, not animals. I mean, there are people who are afraid of animals. They fear animals more than humans. We are humans. We exist. We do not know how to sleep, we do not know how to live, and we do not know how to teach our children. We do not know how to teach them that we are five years into the fifth month. We still do not know how to teach our children. The children are learning.  But if they go and get wood, they go and get firewood, they go and make a fire, they go and get water, this is our life, but eating, drinking, and water, and it depends on eating and drinking, even in good health, as you can see, they are canned goods. We eat, by God, what is wrong with you? I mean, I donâ€™t have anything. I mean, do you advise me anything? For example, I had a mobile phone with me, which I sold electrical appliances that I had brought with me from Gaza. Uncle, manage our affairs. How are we? Where we are sitting, there is no entrance. I mean, we have an entrance. I see the situation in the country, how there is no money, no money, no work, nothing.
