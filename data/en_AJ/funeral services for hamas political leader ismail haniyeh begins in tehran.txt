well the funeral for hamas's political leader isma hania has just begun in Iran's Capital Teran the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali H will lead prayers for the assassinated Hamas leader at the University of Teran ania's body would then be transferred to katar's Capital Doha on Thursday afternoon ahead of his burial on Friday well Al jaer correspondent Rael SAR joins us live now in the studio Rael so the services have already started for is hania in the Iranian Capital talk us through what we can expect today in tran yeah the services just for the prayer services now are taking place in the University of tan uh which is a symbolic place whenever a high level killing or assassination happens or any dignitary that passes away in Iran uh the the the the funeral the the first uh part of the funeral will be taken in the University of tan the most recent one was the the the the Iranian Le president Ibrahim REI after he died in a helicopter crash in May and now uh when that happens in the University of tan usually the Iranian supreme leader alian lead the prayer and before the prayer he will he's expected to deliver quite a brief speech as well that's going to be quite remarkable and we're going to watch and listen what he says and later uh hania's Budd today is going to be taken to the aadi square the freom Freedom Square which is another iconic place in tan usually hosting the mass Gatherings and we expecting thousands of people to attend that parade so his coffin will be uh will be shown to people and there's going to be a long parade so people are going to come and pay their respects we we most likely are going to see here chantings and also the calls for a Revenge because many of Iranians are feeling that their sovereignty their dignity has been violated Gravely yeah and and we saw yesterday racial uh government protesters come out on the streets uh of Teran condemning the attack and the Assassin of is what's the public mood inan since the attack so it when we talk about the public mood inan or across the whole country it is quite divided it's a difficult position for many of Iranians on one hand they have seen constant assassinations or assassination attempts many of the the the Iranian important figures have been killed assassinated particularly by Israel most notably their nuclear scientists uh and one of them the biggest brain behind the Iran nuclear program F so each time that happens you will see that Iranians are asking their government to do more to stop such attacks and they believe that the the the the government on IR of Iran should respond quite strongly that Israel will not think to do that again however on the other hand there are grave concerns as well from the public they know that in case of a a retaliation uh a massive retaliation it could easily lead to a regional war and a regional war with Israel for many Iranians means a direct confrontation with USA a direct confrontation with USA means Al almost like a detrimental case a deadly case for majority of Iranians so you will see that there are secur in between the dignity their dignity keeping their dignity on the other hand keeping themselves safe so they're worried as well absolutely and just a final thought to your raceel you've been telling us this morning that the body of is Hanah will then be flown here to Doha for burial what more can you tell us about those funeral arrangements uh for tomorrow so today afternoon the hanah's body is going to be flown to Doha and tomorrow after the Juma prayer we're expecting uh his body to be buried in in in DHA so we'll see uh dozens and dozens of dignitaries coming to Doha attending his funeral and prayer uh the head of state statements VIP guest head of the governments and also several representatives of the of the uh the the the the civil uh organization NGS across the world so we're expecting it to be quite a massive massive Gathering and a show in of solidarity with Hamas with the Palestinians but particularly with isma hania because he has been almost the face of the resistance the Palestinian resistance his decades let me just squeeze in one more question before you go uh Rael we we we heard earlier on there from the speaker of parliament Muhammad Baga galiba um making that clear statement uh that Iran will enact Revenge uh they you know there will be a response what did you make of that well in April when Israel attack the Iranian em Embassy in Damascus and then we have seen that Iranians say that well we change the rule of the engagement so far normally until that time up to that time the rule of Engagement between Israel and Iran was that in case of an Israeli attack Iranians will respond to their proxy let let me just let me just let me just interrupt you there for a second Rael sorry for that uh let's just go back now to the live pictures because we want to hear from who's hamas's Deputy in G let's just listen into what he's saying was to unify this nation and to support this nation and to unify the nation and to resist for the sake of liberating of Palestine his blood today confirms this the nation today is carrying his coffin and the nation today is raising the flag of jihad and resistance towards the goal of liberating Palestine and Jerusalem all right so you're watching live pictures there from the Iranian Capital Teran uh of the funeral service which is underway now for the slain Hamas political leader isma Han let's bring in faad isari he's a professor of international relations at Teran University joins us live from the Iranian Capital um f the killing of is hania yesterday happened just over 24 hours ago um what's the mood in the capital now with the start of his funeral arrangements that we're watching here on our screens what what's what's going through people's minds you can seeing your pictures it's a very sad day in tan we have had people traveling from other cities to attend the funeral we have hundreds and thousands of people attending the funeral um the government has uh announced 3 days of national morning this 3 days of national morning is generally reserved for Iranian high ranking government officials uh and uh so the government is respecting uh the guest that was assassinated by the Israelis as as a high ranking Iranian government official basically giving him the same level of respect the same level of uh uh sort of prestige that uh that the highest that that they can offer um you know Iranians um for listen sorry sorry to interrupt you but please stay with us we're just going to go back to those live pictures we're seeing on our screens now of the funeral service because Hal ala the Hamas Deputy in Gaza was speaking let's listen again to what he's saying the Faith of Our on the Palestinian Soul we are sure that the assassination of isma hania the Zionist entity will bring anger to this entity from the entire free people of the world all right so if you're just joining us here in Al jaer you're watching live pictures of the funeral service underway in the Iranian Capital Tera and those are the pictures now on your screen we have uh guests in tran we also have alzer's racial SAR uh here in the studio to talk us through what we're seeing um R let me come back to you quickly before I go back to Fadi um in Teran Rael so we heard we we we're hearing there now from KH ala the Hamas Deputy in Gaza what's he been saying well he simply saying that this the blood of the the former Chief the the former political bureau chief of Hamas has not been shared in in in Wayne and there that is going to even contribute to the cause of the Palestinians and it's going to further create an anger among the people the free people across the globe so far it is mostly a political rhetoric but we need to listen more to see if they are planning any of kind of a concrete uh steps to be taken against this assassination and and and despite what Hamas says and and and this this speech here at the at the isia funeral is is is clearly quite emotional and fiery this is a big blow to the Hamas leadership isn't it indeed it is because is Han was one of the figures that is regarded the most pragmatic and the moderate representative of the the the Palestinian resistance so just he has been quite through his since his young ages he has been a member a part of this resistance movement and then in 2006 he has served as the prime minister of the unity government in Palestine and he was the leader of Hamas until up to 2017 then he has been replaced by y in then he moved to Doha and started to reside in Doha and since then he has been the face of the political engagement with the rest of the world and also the main negotiator negotiating on behalf of the Palestinians particularly with the Israelis and now that the negotiator political negotiator is assassinated by Israel so the concerns is is is that so usually to end a war you need a political negotiations and when you kill the negotiator that is negotiating with you who are going to thees that are going to be negoti it just seems you know the Ceasar is being pushed further and further away um R for the time being thank you very much indeed let's just go back to fa isari he's a professor of University joins us uh from the Iranian Capital um faad we were as we're watching on our screens there we're looking at KH Alaya he's the Hamas Deputy um in Gaza I mean the killing we were asking you earlier the killing of is hania happened just over 24 hours ago the dust is just starting to settle you were telling us about the mood in the capital now with the start of these funeral services what's going through minds you know internationally Iranians are known to uh like guests welcome guests respect guests so when you have uh the guests of of the country coming for the inauguration of the new president assassinated in this manner this is quite heavy you know Iranian col is famous for uh welcoming guests um and when you have some very high ranking official uh assassinated in in the capital city this is a shock and that's why you see this huge crowd that's why you see the energy in the crowd um this is a message I think that Iranian people are sending uh to the world um you know is Han was respected not just by Arabs or Muslims he was a freedom fighter he was someone who led the Palestinian struggle for many years you see all over the world people demonstrating in support of Palestine he was the leader of these people the people who supported the Palestinian cause and uh being assassinated in this manner is obviously a grave crime and the anger that you see on your screen is reflecting that that very fact that people are quite angry people are quite sad let's just stay with that uh with that anger that you just mentioned there we you know we saw protests on the streets of Teran yesterday people calling for a decisive response uh to this attack to the assassination of hania will there be growing public pressure to act against Israel but also worries about a wider escalation here in the region you know uh if has no other choice but to respond and I think you heard this from the speaker of the Iranian Parliament you know under Iran's Constitution we have a National Security Council 10 people have a voting uh presence in Iran's National Security Council one of those 10 people is the speaker of the Iranian Parliament so when he talks about um responding to this terrorist act you can take him seriously I think you will see Iranian ballistic missiles The Landing in at military sites in occupied Palestine Israeli sides in in in a few days or so Iran is going to respond and I think the respond is going to be bigger than what you saw in April after an Iranian General was assassinated at the Iranian Embassy this is the red line that Drew uh many months ago that attacking Iranian uh uh territory is going to have a severe response and I think you're going to see that yeah and that's that's a real worry then isn't it for let me just go back to what um KH Alaya was saying earlier um because I think we've just seen the supreme leader arrive but but just a quick question to you um Khal haa said that the resistance all the resistance movements um are now United um he said that they will never re um in fact let's just let's just let's just look in Now quickly at these live pictures of the Supreme leader leading the prayers so if you're just joining us here in out here you're watching live pictures there of the funeral service for the slain Hamas political leader is Han these are pictures coming from the Iranian Capital where the funeral service has started we heard from the speaker of parliament Muhammad gbba a little bit earlier uh and now we just saw the supreme leader aah alih H their deliver prayers let's bring in back Rael SAR Rael just talk us through uh what we're seeing on our scens because I think that's the coffin of hanas there in front of the supreme leader indeed there are two coffins over there one of them is is the first one is is Han's coffin lay down there and the other one is his God's coffin uh laid down just in front of the supreme leader when he was leading the prayer on the other hand when he was leading the prayer we have seen them the nely elected president M pesan uh was on the Supreme Leader's left side while the head of the the guardian Council which is is one of the executive buddies in Iran that overlooks all state affairs was on his right side and also khid ha now is there however as we were were expecting uh Al to deliver a speech but he did not do so so it's quite an interesting picture because many of the people that now you see there the executives of the Iran that are running the state now have just started their job in the office and particularly for the N elect President m pesan is quite interesting because no one would like to have such a crisis in in at his table in the first day into office well I know I was going to ask you um racel I mean this is the first big political geopolitical test for Iran's new president there standing next to the Supreme Leader um president masud pesan what pressures then do you think from the political and religious uh establishments within the country will he be under now indeed a lot so here this is almost like a in in may we have seen almost kind of the same picture when the late president Ibrahim REI died so the same pictures same digitar is attending his funeral and now this is happening however it was an accident according to the Iranian officials but now there has been high level political assassination happening right in tan and many of the Iranians are regarding this as an also attempt to undermine Iran's sovereignty so for M pesan who has been promising to to open up Iran to the world to develop the ties with the rest of the world to have a better relations with the rest of the world particularly with the West now in his first day in the office he's facing a crisis an attack from Israelis killing a dignity that dignitary that has been invited to attend his inauguration ceremony is killed now so on one hand the Revolutionary guards and the hardliners in Iran particularly those who are running the state affairs will ask for will ask for a retaliation but a retaliation will probably worse Iran's ties with the rest of the world and the newly elected president is going to be sced in between okay so uh Rael I think we're now seeing um that the coffin is going to be moved um after prayers from the supreme leader to Freedom Square you were telling us about that earlier so talk us through what's going to happen there there's also a routine uh process that takes place usually in Iran when a dignitary a VIP or a high level killing assassination or death happen so now his his coffin is going to be taken on a on a truck and then shown to people it's like a long parade roughly around 5 kilomet uh marching toward the Freedom Square or uh in Persian the aadi square and then there will be speech delivered by uh by by some Representatives probably we are going to hear again from the representative of Hamas and some of the important politicians I'm just hearing that we won't hear uh from the supreme leader Ayah Al Harmony uh um at Freedom Square so again just take us yeah usually at the Freedom Square the the supreme leader attend prayer in teram but he doesn't appear on the Freedom Square the Freedom Square is rather a show of solidarity is also like the you will you will hear the calls from people for the revenge and so but that's not a practice that the Supreme leaders attend such marches imagine that he's 84 years old and also due to the security reasons he usually avoided attending such marches in public places okay Russell sod thank you very much indeed make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaer
