Israel has banned Al jazer from reporting from there so let's go to S hiat who joins us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman and S I know we've been keeping a close eye on these protests uh throughout the evening in Tel Aviv but in the last half hour or so they've turned from what was relatively peaceful to quite uh violent uh clashes between protesters and police yeah that's right Tom I'm just looking at the pictures here um obviously you were saying we can't report from there cuz we've been banned but we have been covering these protests right from when they first started certainly when the families uh of those held captive were gathering in what's known as hostage Square in uh Tel Aviv we were there uh all of the time that we were covering those protests on Saturday uh they started off relatively peaceful and certainly this is um this is the first time if you're looking on your screens now you'll see uh the horses turning up they've already uh taken out brought out the uh uh water dirty water known as skunk water as well tanks um and also we've been seeing some uh protesters uh being arrested and that's because they're BL blocking one of the main intersections in Tel Aviv in central Tel Aviv in fact and that's something a lot of the anti-government protesters and those that are protesting against the prime minister in fact calling on him to immediately resign they said because of the handling of the war because half of those that were taken captive almost 125 of them are still stuck in Gaza and their families don't know whether they're still alive or dead many of them have been speaking today one of those is a mother of one of those that was killed and their bodies brought back yesterday saying that enough is enough we need answers and we need to see the rest of those that are still stuck there to be brought back this as we're seeing and it seems that there will be talk taking place next week uh Israeli media has been reporting that it will possibly take place in Qatar Hamas has also come out with a statement saying that uh it won't be held on Tuesday contrary to what Israeli media is reporting so the details are still very much unclear but the tensions that you're seeing in those pictures that's certainly a step up from what we've been seeing in the last few weeks Anger from the side of the protesters Anger from the sides of the families at the stalemate they feel uh that there's not they're not getting anywhere with this war some of the families have also been speaking on public TV saying that they were told by the Israeli military that they had finished in the north of the Gaza Strip that they'd eliminated Hamas and the fighters and the commander commanders rather in fact in the north and that's why they moved on to the center of the Gaza Strip and then onto the South and Rafa well there they are again in jabalia now today it's the 14th or 13th day even uh since the Israeli troops have returned yes they managed to retrieve those three bodies but the biggest concern the families of those captives have is that they will come back dead and that's their biggest worry and on top of that just today as well more Rockets coming from Lebanon in the northern part of the country so a lot of those families or lot of those hotels in and around that square that you're seeing are housing those that to be forced out of their homes from that northern border and from the border with the Gaza Strip and they're losing money they want to go back to their lives and they're seeing no results so far and that's why they're angry but they're also being met by what seems to be some form of Force if you look on social media and if you look at those that are speaking out they're saying that this kind of force is absolutely unnecessary and they will continue they say to protest until they see those results Tom yes s you're talking about tension overflowing into anger the just the frustration after months and months of this war going on with the Netanyahu government the war cabinet these protests are obviously designed to try and put as much pressure on the Prime Minister and his cabinet as possible is there any sign at this stage that that pressure is actually [Music] working well well um and I just keep looking to the side because I'm looking at the pictures as we speak but um prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh it seems had a meeting a few days ago with some of those uh that are in the know on the negotiations and it seems it was a result of some of the pressure that the families had put on uh the war cabinet and that was after they had released a video showing five females female soldiers uh that had been kidnapped and taken across to Gaza on October uh the 7th it was very gory it was quite detailed and in fact today they've been uh showing that in front of the Kira that's the defense Ministry on a massive screen and they said that they had hoped by showing that video that it would put pressure on Netanyahu and also on the government this at a time when Israel is also facing huge backlash obviously we saw the icj order yesterday and then there's also ICC Pro Chief prosecutor that's seeking an arrest warrant for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the defense minister U Galant so on the international stage they can see that Israel is coming under a lot of scrutiny now when you hear from the families what they're now starting to say is that they feel that every decision that's being taken isn't with the captives in mind isn't with the families in mind what's what what's in it for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and certainly for those within this farri government is that he they say that the decisions are politically motivated and to save themselves when we talk about saving themselves why is that because prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a trial within his country that pre goes before he even got elected to become the Prime Minister the current prime minister through this coalition government and also on top of that now with the seeking of an arrest warrant it could potentially mean that at some point it would be further so the concerns here are that this is personal and politically motivated and that when it comes to the interests of the families and those held captive they say they want an immediate end to the war and that they feel that their government isn't representing them and doesn't have their interest to h s some really quite remarkable scenes uh that we are watching unfold on the streets of Tel Aviv now the uh police clearly moving in and trying to disband this large group of protesters that are that are trying to hold their ground at this point in time as you say these started out as just peaceful protest that we have seen uh every Saturday evening in Tel Aviv for months now uh but we've never seen them uh escalate to this uh level uh in recent times s you talked a little bit about how politically motivated um the the the the cabinet the war cabinet is that they basically just want to save themselves save their own political necks at this point in time can you just talk a little bit about how fractured that cabinet is right now between the decisions that Netanyahu is making on the ground and and the pressure that uh clearly is coming on them uh from Israelis themselves yes absolutely when you look at the divisions those fractures didn't appear right in the beginning when uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed a small War cabinet uh that included people with previous experience and they stayed United but over the weeks over time you started to see some cracks appear and certainly a couple of weeks ago if I remember correctly uh one of those War cabinet uh members came out with a scathing uh Speech against prime minister net Yahoo and really calling out those divisions and then just a few days ago through a freedoms of act uh uh it was revealed that the uh Israeli military had it seemed warned the Prime Minister and warned the government that those divisions that existed in the country because of them wanting to introduce judicial reforms was weakening them in front of what they said were the eyes of the enemy uh for them for the Israelis for example for Hamas and those warnings it seems weren't just internal but uh it seems also Egypt for example had a few months ago said that they had also indicated that there could be some potential security breach uh so you know the the people the leaders of this country were so busy with these anti-government protests and judicial reforms before the war and not just that Tom busy by sending all their troops to uh the occupied territories for example occupied West Bank every day we see raids daily day every single night people are arrested uh families mothers uh people's homes are demolished in those occupied territories and occupied uh East Jerusalem for example uh and that's exactly why on October the 7th uh where were all the uh forces when they needed them on that border with Gaza a lot of them were in the West Bank and that's exactly one of the reasons why a lot of those families of those cap blame uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Army because they said that they had dropped the ball they put their focus elsewhere and What mattered was the warnings that something may be Brewing now that's in terms of the divisions when you also look at for example the icj order uh that we heard yesterday um the discussions that are happening in Israel are at the moment is that they believe the uh the Supreme Court which is independent in Israel should be looking into the situation and these accusations and looking into whether the military uh has created or or or breached International humanitarian law which could potentially then help them if they are if this is taken further on the international stage but they're not doing that they say they're investigating some of the comments made by uh ministers far-right ministers for example itar benav these is national security minister or the Finance Minister who's also in charge of the illegal uh settlements in occupied West Bank that's bezal smotrich they've made incredibly inflammatory uh remarks which could amount to incitement of genocide for example uh they have repeatedly said that they welcome anyone from Gaza uh volunteering to leave the Gaza Strip and have called on Egypt many times to open their borders to allow Palestinians to leave another example is that they want the resettlement of let's remind our viewers that Israel had occupied Gaza and withdrew in 2005 they want uh the uh illegal Israeli settlers to re settle Gaza so those remarks on
