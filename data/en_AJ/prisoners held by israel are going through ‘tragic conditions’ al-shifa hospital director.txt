right we're interrupting that report to take you live to Kan Unice in central Gaza where the director of alifa Hospital Muhammad Abu Salia is holding a news conference after being recently released by Israel let's listen ining under dire conditions unprecedented since the 1948 NAA they are they are suffering Beyond description even those who have been detained for more than 10 years they are deprived of the least of their rights many of the Palestinian diones were killed under interrogation they were denied food water and Medicine many of the medical staff including doctors and nurses I left them behind as they are still in the Israeli prisons from among the medical staff Dr Adnan B and Dr were killed and may they rest in peace the Israeli a forces left has no regard to any red lines they are dealing with the detes as if they are objects solid objects even the med the Israeli medical staff instead of providing Health Care to the Palestinian detes they are instead beating battering and torturing them the Israeli occupation forces and soldiers have no meaning of human values they are torturing the Palestinian Jones day and night denying them the basic necessities I am not going over the top if I if I say that each and every Palestinian Dy has lost at least 25 to 30 kgs even the Palestinian detes with chronic disease like diabetes and cancer they are denied medical attention if the International Community the world organizations the world health organizations do not act swiftly more Palestinian detes will continue to be killed at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces this is the message I'm carrying from the Deton I left behind again the issue of the detes must be part and parcel of any negotiations they must be part and parcel of any deal as to the conditions of my detention I was detained at the net line in November I was in contact with all the officers who stormed alifa hostiles and when we all left accompanied by the International Red Cross the Palestinian Red Cross we informed the Israeli occupation forces that we are taking our patients to the European hospitals yet the Israeli occupation forces turned the Blind Eye to all the international laws and treaties and they detained me without any charges even if I was put to three four trials I was not given any specific charge I was only informed that I am detained till further notice this means that the Israeli occupation forces have been detaining me on no legal grounds the Israeli occupation forces stormed alifa hospital and they lied they propagated false reports that they found weapons inside the hospital this Pro proves that my detention was on malicious basis I reassure that I will resume my duties as soon as it is possible we by the grace of God will rebuild ala hospital to be once again a beacon for medical and health care not only for the gazans but for all the Palestinian people and Beyond within the coming few months by the grace of God we will be back back on our feet again fully functioning and operating while you were detained were you following the news about the destruction caus to Ala Hospital honestly speaking I have recently heard about this bad news there is no doubt this came very heavy on my heart ala hospital was a castle was a fortress was a Beacon for health care for the entire gazin this proves that the Israeli occupation forces are willfully and purposefully destroying the medical institutions all across Gaza no matter how grave this is we will rebuild it and we will be back on our feet again I was put to uh torture um this uh my fingers are broken I was also beaten and battered on my head I was put to torture on daily basis myself included with other Palestinian daes we are daily beaten battered tortured and abused physically and verbally I have lived this experience very bitterly and I once again call on the International Community to do what is needed to put an end to this we have the orthopedic specialist Dr Bassam who was also detained and released and as you can see how many pounds he has lost he has lost more than 30 kilog of his weight while being detained under these all right we've been listening there to the director of alifa Hospital Muhammad Abu Al salmia who was just recently released by Israeli forces he was arrested in November and has been detained since then Dr alalia talking about the conditions of his detention he said that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are tortured on a daily basis day and night in fact he said he said they were denied food water and Medicine the issue of detainees he said must be part and parcel of all negotiations with Israel uh he was detained on no legal grounds he says he will resume his duties as soon as possible and that they will rebuild alifa Hospital let's listen once again to Dr Abu Salia leveled against me I was only told that I was detained for till further notice I was not uh offered or provided with any attorney nor was I approached by any International Organization during my detention as I said there was no specific charge leveled against me I was detained on malicious PES the Israeli falsely reported that the alcha hospital was AAS for Hamas however they failed to prove this in reality I was detained on malicious Paces I was moved from one prison to another including offer person all of which are dire each and every Palestinian datiny is living only on one loaf of bread daily can you imagine many of them are with chronic disease diabetics and Cancers however they are living in very dire if not catastrophic conditions all I can say that the Israeli occupation forces are verbally and physically abusing us they are even unleashing dogs on the dayon each and every dayon is beaten and battered at least three times every single day they are deprived we the Deton were deprived of mattresses and cover covers we are not even offered the least of our basic rights including food water and Medicine the Israel occupation forces have turned a blind eye to all rules laws or measures applicable in such conditions thank you okay Okay so we've been listening there to the director of Gaza alifa Hospital Muhammad Abu salmia who's just been released by Israeli forces he is among 55 Palestinians whove been released by Israel Dr Abu salmia describing the conditions of his detention there and the conditions of other Palestinians in Israeli jails he said he was moved from one prison to another including offer prison he said Palestinian detainees are subjected to torture on daily basis by Israel they are denied food water and medicine they are beaten on a daily basis he said uh there was no legal justification for his detention Israel uh was uh of course claiming that alifa was a base for Hamas when they rated that hospital and arrested the hospital's director let's speak to manour Schuman once again who's a Palestinian journalist and humanitarian who's here in Doha with us uh Mansour you were also arrested in 20 9 in the occupied West Bank so you know the conditions that uh Dr Abu Salia talks about in those Israeli jails that beating the detention The Torture that Palestinian prisoners are subjected to on a daily basis yeah I mean I I nothing like I'm sure what they're going through right now there is no legal representation no oversight from any International agency it's just continuous daily physical and mental abuse um they are experts in that they know how to drain the prisoners as you saw some of those that were released lost over 30 kilog but despite all of that the thing that I'm so I mean I think that the whole world now are seeing that despite all of that look at the resilience of Dr Muhammad and his colleagues he says he'll resume his duties as soon as possible and rebuild alifa Hospital look at how positive they are despite going through over six months of of torture of horrendous dayto day um uh despicable acts by by the Israelis against him so like I said before um the spirit of the Palestinians is only getting stronger let's talk about our shifa Hospital a little bit for our viewers who may not not know this this is gaza's biggest medical complex and uh during the war in November it was the main hospital where Palestinians were being treated but Israel claims that this was also hamas's base and this is one of their justifications I guess for arresting uh Dr Abu Salia no legal reasons but they claim that this was Hamas base talk to us about this Hospital in in Gaza its importance and why Israel insists that this is a a Hamas base uh they I think one of I think them claiming that a shifer hospital was a Hamas base and then once them going going inside and not showing any kind of proof to the world we did see some videos that they claimed were you know proof of Hamas being there but nothing really substantial nothing substantial I think that was a big change in how the the whole world saw the Israeli occupation and the lies and the propaganda that they were playing into and I don't know why they thought aifa was a Hamas base but what I do know is that it's not only um an international Beacon for hope and health in Gaza but for the whole world and ashifa uh is not just one or two buildings it's over a dozen different medical uh buildings with specializations from all around the world people who left the United States Europe Palestinians and decided to go back and live inside Gaza to try to contribute to the Palestinian cause and to help 2.3 million Palestinians continue to live right now A shifa is destroyed however they are rebuilding it the dialysis center is now open slowly the emergency unit is starting to to to work again and I think Dr Muhammad we will will see him at the top of his work as soon as a ceasefire happens and the NIT Sim uh people the the IDF in the NIT Sim uh uh that is that is dividing North and South leave and inshallah we can see him back there together with the doctors taking care of our patience thank you thank you so much manour for joining us once again manour Schuman a Palestinian journalist on the newsour with us make sure to subscribe to our
