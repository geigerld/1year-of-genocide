first we have uh been holding back and we're in active conversations with Israel about the provision of heavy uh or high payload weapons uh large bombs because of the concern that we have about the effect these weapons can have when they're used in a dense Urban environment like Rafa we're discussing that with Israel right now second what the president said is that if Israel goes in with a major military operation Rafa uh in that case uh there are certain systems that we will not provide to Israel uh that would aid aid that that effort because it's something that we do not want to be part of given the damage that it would do to civilians and again uh not to achieve a durable lasting effective result for Israel and for its security that's what the president said we've said that in uh conversations with our Israeli Partners our senior political analyst Maan bashara he joins me here in our Doha studio blinkin in that interview also mentioned the Resurgence of Hamas I was interested to see Maran he he talked about how even with a fullscale assault on Rafa there would still be thousands of armed Hamas Fighters left and that there was no plan for the day after is the US increasingly disappointed with Israel's military progress oh absolutely absolutely it's been it's been disappointed for a good number of weeks if not months in fact ever since that Fallout between uh President Biden and prime minister Netanyahu back in February it was clear that the United States was not looking favorably at the war while continuously supporting um the war um I think it's clear for uh Americans including the American establishment that there is no ending of Hamas I think um there's also becoming clear that the day after will be perhaps an Insurgency in Gaza or a no man's land which will eventually produce an Insurgency of sort or chaos and so on so whatever the Israelis are looking to do in Gaza is not working and whatever they think of as a day after it's not working and the United States with a bit of a distance with a bit of experience a bit of history is able to advise Israel about why they needed to wind this war down several weeks if not months ago and why they need to accept the ceasefire and why they need to start thinking about the day after and why they need not anger Arab neighbors and so on and so forth well it still certainly sounds like the has Faith or or certainly is committed to the negotiations around a ceasefire what's your reading of of how that's going given what we're seeing now in Rafa it's not going but certain not going anywhere and clearly from what secretary blinkin has said it's like as if there there are no talks because he keeps talking about Hamas giving up the captives if this there is no deal that was almost signed if it weren't for uh Israeli rejection and eventually uh blinking blessing of Israeli rejection and hence once again we go back to negotiat look in the end of the day there's something about blink's approach to this issue which I think sometimes could be Nuance with what Biden says Biden as the president apparently he has a bit of a leeway he can sometimes talk in more cander he is kind of older sometimes words slip like indiscriminate Israel indiscriminately bombs Gaza right or it cannot there is a red line now this is interesting again Biden says Red Line linoln says what we don't do we don't have red lines for Israel I think that says a lot about his psyche I think every time anyone says red blink sees orange or yellow or green or something right he he doesn't see that there could be uh red lines for Israel he doesn't right and second he doesn't see that there's any double standards with Israel he sees that there's only one Israeli standard that's the American Standard when it comes to Gaza that's why in the report when they talk about the the in idents not the patterns not the patterns of human rights violations of war crimes of unraveling genocide when he talks about incident he talks but the Israelis are investigating it hence what why should we you know intervene when the Israelis themselves AR doing it as if the Israeli standards of investigating themselves and their own crimes is good enough for the United States to continue to supply 2,000 weapons which they are still reviewing and considering doing M Bashar will'll leave it there for now thank you for joining us again make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
