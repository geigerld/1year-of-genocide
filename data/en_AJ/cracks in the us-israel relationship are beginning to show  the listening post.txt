finally a ceasefire resolution passes at the United Nations but what difference does it make when Israel will not honor it and the US calls it non-binding in Gaza the horrors of ethnic cleansing are compounded by Israeli surveillance technology and Narendra modi's reelection campaign in India powered by an army of foot soldiers on the ground and a messaging Blitz on WhatsApp this past week's United Nations security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza the first to do so is significant although not for the reasons its authors may have intended the passage of the resolution at the highest body of the UN with the US declining to use its veto could Mark a pivotal moment in Israel's increasing International isolation for its Western backers the fact that Israel through its continued bombardment and starvation of Palestinians is defying that resolution makes their role that much harder to defend in the Israeli media the opposition to the UN vote is almost unanimous more striking is the lack of interest from American news outlets the implications this story raises are a little uncomfortable for them as well they hit close to home because a fallacy has been exposed the one about the us-led inter interntional rules-based order in which the rules are selectively applied we those in favor of the draft resolution please there raise their hand it was the ultimate mixed message sent from Washington to Tel Aviv that upon examination amounts to some cynical politics abion for at least 32,000 Palestinians in G including those who have been starved to death in front of our eyes the ceasefire resolution that passed at the United Nation Security Council this past week comes too late for those still getting killed by Israel's bombing of Rafa the patients and medical staff at alifa hospital still getting shot by Israeli soldiers it has had no discernable effect after vetoing three previous ceasefire resolutions the American government finally allowed this one which would last just 2 weeks to carry but the US's ambassador to the UN then argued incorrectly according to Legal experts that unlike every other resolution the security Council has ever passed this one was in a category of its own that it was somehow non-binding we fully support some of the critical objectives in this non-binding resolution and we I hope she was being merely rhetorical because she certainly can't can't be speaking from a legal perspective all un Security Council resolutions are binding the UN Charter makes that perfectly clear it then takes another resolution to determine what actions will be taken if the parties defy it as Israel uh has said it's going to do but whether or not it's enforced it's certainly binding as a matter of law if the Americans are arguing that this is a non-binding resolution they are winking at Netanyahu by saying you really don't have to implement it the message to the Israelis is that you can carry on with the war until you achieve whatever objectives you have in mind I don't think uh Benjamin Netanyahu cares much about the International Community the United Nations security Council the UN they've made it clear within minutes of the resolution passing that the Israelis have no intention of abiding by it and indeed less than 24 hours after the passage of that resol olution about 17 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli bombardment with scores of others injured so the message is clear Israel has no intention of abiding by resolution 2728 call on the parties to um cease fire the Netanyahu government put on a display of outrage over the Biden administration's refusal to veto the resolution by initially cancelling a visit by an Israeli delegation to Washington before or quietly rescheduling it it could have recalled its defense minister yoab Galant who was already in DC Shoring up more American Arms shipments to Israel it did not other political figures like security minister itamar benir dismissed the UN as anti-semitic this in a country that owes its very existence to the United Nations on the Israeli Airwaves the calls for Palestinian blood keep coming and partisan domestic politics are also a big part of the mix cast our mind back pre October 7th where you have a deeply polarized Society the anti- BBY Camp the demonstrations every week and the pro BBY Camp reaction splits along those lines what you will see from journalists in the anti-b camp is aha he we have bi destroying the reputation of Israel for the other side this is dangerous un America losing its who's the guy who can stand up to this you guessed it Benjamin Nat what stands out in the American media coverage of this story is the noticeable lack of it for the US to fail to side with Israel at the UN is almost unheard of and is certainly newsworthy couple that with the legal side of the story The us arguing that a security Council resolution is somehow not binding one would expect journalists to test that position pick it apart we're not seeing that neither are American News consumers and like Israel domestic politics in the US are having an impact there has been a great deal of lack of interest uh uh in American media especially the so-called liberal media in the United States regarding the resolution the Biden Administration is trying to avoid the Fallout of the exstension and therefore media that are supportive of the democratic party made sure that they really did not dedicate so much time and coverage so that they would minimize any possible repercussions that would be exploited by their opponents in the Republican Party especially a few months before the presidential elections the lack of coverage it's consistent with the manner in which the question of Palestine has been represented in the uh West uh in mainstream media and that has basically been through the prism of an Israeli lens you're not Hamas Israel is a democracy and uh as a Jewish State uh supports and and believes in every life mattering and so and this is matched in Canadian and United Kingdom and other Western States foreign policies it's harder for the Western mainstream media to continue uh with their biased coverage in large park because you have the proliferation of social media from the gazin street to the rest of the world and because of the extent to which mainstream media in particular is very sensitive about being criticized from uh Israel and its uh right-wing supporters in particular it's been shy uh uh to highlight actions that are deemed to be critical of Israel is now actually supporting genocide okay we could maybe just avoid that language if that's okay for now because that is something and obviously a us vote of abstention on Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire would certainly be something that they would wish to ignore or minimize or sweep under the rug among the other stories getting swept under Israeli forces raiding hospitals in Gaza such as Al shifa producing horrific testimonies of the coldblooded execution starved and so on and that coverage that is coming from below is challenging the Western media coverage on these things the Western media even subconsciously is aware that it is feeding Into The Narrative of the demise of its own standing outside of a western space it's done no one takes seriously Weston claims to be standing up for international nor no one wants to hear it after Gaza the world will not be lectured to there's no moral Soap Box to stand on it has dissolved away in the double [Applause] standards and the naked transparency of the hypocrisy over Gaza that leaves us with a real problem we do not have a space that we can go to last year Amnesty International revealed that Israel was using facial recognition systems in the West Bank to entrench its occupation of Palestinians there new details have now emerged about the technology that Israeli solders are using in Gaza and Tark NAFA is here with more well for months now we've heard reports and seen videos of Palestinians forced from their homes Crossing checkpoints where they are scanned by isra isi cameras some of these videos are truly dystopian in addition to being watched Palestinians are also harassed by Israel forces this week a New York Times piece revealed more information about the mass surveillance Israel has deployed on Palestinians in Gaza according to Israeli intelligence officials who spoke to the times anonymously it's part of an expansive and experimental effort to collect C and catalog the faces of Palestinians without their knowledge or consent developed by a private Israeli company called corite Israeli officials say the system was initially used to search for Israeli captives in Gaza but has since been used on a much wider scale to hunt down Hamas suspects one of the problems with this kind of Technology as one Israeli officer confirms is that it routinely gets it wrong with Israeli soldiers accused of abusing torturing and executing Palestinians in Gaza the consequences of being incorrectly identified as a Hamas fighter can cost you your life the Israeli military has always used Gaza as a lab in which it can test and develop new ways of killing or spying on Palestinians artificial intelligence is reportedly being used to generate Targets in Gaza facilitating what one Former Intelligence officer has called a mass assassination Factory we've also seen several videos of Israeli drones shooting at and killing unarmed Palestinians all of this technology has turned Gaza into a hellscape in which at least 32 and a half thousand Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces thank you TK in just under 3 weeks time on April 19th India will begin a 6 week long election process cess for its next national government it will all culminate on June 1st and prime minister Narendra Modi is expected to win an historic third term in office Mod's popularity ratings are high many of his opponents are mired in corruption cases filed by Mod's government and then there's the news media mainstream outlets in India have been almost entirely captured by modi's party the BJP churning out coverage that ranges from the sycophantic to the openly Pro government and that surval media landscape may not be the most powerful weapon in the bjp's Arsenal it also has a formidable get out the vote machine that combines an extensive volunteer network with the power of WhatsApp to influence voters spread propaganda and at times soow disinformation the listening posts Mino shiavi now on the all-encompassing information ecosystem that is likely to help putting NRA Modi back in the prime minister's office in New Delhi Indians have grown used to the omnipresence of their prime minister he's on billboards he's in the papers both in ads and in the news TV channels seem to have little else to cover and on March 16th the very day the dates for India's elections were announced Narendra Modi was whatsapping the country a letter from the Prime Minister was delivered straight into the phones of hundreds of millions of [Music] Indians the transformation that has taken place in the lives of people is the biggest achievement of our government over the last 10 years it is your support that gives me immense strength I am confident that we will continue to take our nation to Great Heights together it was unvarnished election hearing by the ruling part party using the resources and access to phone number databases of the government and it was unsurprising it was all happening on WhatsApp technology is very much part of the Arsenal which the BJP or prime minister Narendra Modi uses the BJP understood before any other party every Indian may not have literacy and public health and so on so forth but they have their cell phones India has the cheapest data in the world so the BJP in areas where it wishes to contest seriously it develops messaging for each constituency that was something that Prime Minister Modi and the Baria J party understood very well Mr Amit sha who is actually virtually the number two to Mr Modi in the within the BJP few years ago while speaking to party workers he had actually boasted you know it is very easy for us to take the message because we have the largest WhatsApp Network in the now that was not a Bast that is actually true you actually have a centralized cell within the BJP which actually in the morning it decides okay these are today's messages which are to be publicized and they're kind of broadcast to various parts of the country the bjp's messaging is carefully tailored and highly produced with the party's star campaigner front and center in virtually all of it the Modi motorade drives through throngs of cheering Indians the videos from that make it to Whatsapp groups YouTube shorts and Instagram reels the Prime Minister hangs out with kids in schools and presents 20-some social media influencers with awards from the government he prays at multiple temples with cameras in tow even if the holy sight is underwater those clips don't just stay on social media they make the Evening News bulletins look closely on his screens he even decided to go underwat to pray at the submerged dwara all this is part of media strategy creating a nationwide perception that Narendra Modi as the leader of this ruling party wants to take India forward wants to create a developed India and make it the third largest economy in the world one senior leader of the BJP had said about Mr Modi he said for Narendra Modi elections is a battle of images and that is what the Indian Prime Minister has shown himself to be very good at and you can agree with this ideology his policies or disagree but it is his skills at political marketing that have been noticed we must remember that in India democracy Works in different uh language zones so the question is how do you recognize a party Modi electoral symbols are important in the case of Prime Minister Modi it is the recognition value of the Modi name the Modi face he has different personas that he has presented to the public one is that of a term called visha Guru which means world leader his performance on the international stage is constantly projected back home the other aspect of the messaging is that of being a strong an apologetic Hindu who goes and leads ceremonies in temples almost performs like a head priest some of his party people have likened him to a Godlike figure the messaging is extremely comprehensive which is according to data the most expensive in India's history the bjp's finances are formidable the party is the wealthiest in India its funds boosted by a financial tool it launched in 2017 called an electoral bond this powerful instrument ushered in a wave of political donations to numerous parties across India the bulk of the money however nearly 60% went to the BJP amounting to about 60 billion rupees more than 725 million earned between 2017 and just 2 months ago February 2024 when the Supreme Court declared electoral bonds illegal due to their lack of transparency the money is in the bjp's coffers though and it it Powers not just an incessant stream of PR but also an impressive organizational Behemoth that underpins the party's election strategy on paper today the BJP is the largest political party in the world it is larger than the Communist Party of China so there is a huge network of party volunteers who was spread across the country besides that it's very important to understand that the BJ is not a standalone organization but it is part of a fairly large ideological umbrella group the S parar it's an organization which was formed in 1925 almost 100 years ago and everywhere they have a presence so during elections it is not just the BJP which is out campaigning but you have leaders and cader which fan out to virtually every village and every electoral booth in the country I think the do too campaigning uh is a very effective method you know each page of the Electoral roles is assigned to one person so that person goes you know to the visits the families to try and to find out have they benefited from the policies and the programs of the party if not why not it is a party that's driven with the will to par and therefore every tool becomes very important for them now the other query we must ask is the playing field now a level playing field for the BJP and the opposition and we must as journalists it's our job to flag that yet for all the many problems that the opposition faces they are going to put up candidates and fight the BJP but the BJP is working on a very very simple tack that they part of the messaging right now is to say there is no alternative to us that is all part of the hype Modi versus whom you know that Modi is the only answer to India back to Israel Gaza the US and the UN this past week the United Nations special raor on Palestine Francesca Alban published an extensive report the title anatomy of a genocide which the Netanyahu government says it utterly rejects so apparently does the US state department its Chief spokesman Matthew Miller said of Alban I can't help but note a history of anti-Semitic comments that she has made Miller needs to do some research the Israeli government has been accusing Alan of anti-Semitism for years now conflating her legitimate criticism of an illegal occupation for a form of hatred and in late 2022 65 Scholars all experts on anti-Semitism endorsed Alban's work saying that Israel's supporters are simply out to silence her some online voices have described Matthew Miller's comments as a new low for the Biden Administration but it's not like we haven't heard that before we'll see you next time here at the listening
