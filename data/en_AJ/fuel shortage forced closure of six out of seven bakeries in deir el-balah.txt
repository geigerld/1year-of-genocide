US President Joe Biden's pressed Israeli Prime Minister bin Netanyahu to close a deal with Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza it comes after a senior Us official said there had been a quote breakthrough in negotiations the officials said Hamas had made a significant adjustment to its position in the talks there are reports the head of Israel's intelligence service is going to travel to Qatar to discuss the details and his call with Biden netanyahu's insisted the war would only end after Israel achieves its goals our correspondent Charles traford standing by for us here in Doha for an update on those ceasefire negotiations first we're going to head to darala in central Gaza where hin C is joining us um live hind uh I understand the situation there bakeries and hospitals out of Po power some are facing a shutdown tell us more well it's very hard on the humanitarian as situation in Gaza at alnaser hospital the only only hospital that is facilitating inun and ra and receiving all the patients the only hospital that is working in that area is on the risk of shutting down due to the lack of fuel uh the Ministry of Health is calling their appealing that this must not uh shut down they need fuel as soon as possible uh to uh keep this Hospital facilitating let me remind you that Al Nas hospital was a a invaded by the Israeli occupation they were uh working on rehabilitating the hospital for weeks now and suddenly now after it stood up on their feet they're working again they have incubators they have all of their departments working the hospital is running out of fuel also yesterday only one uh Bakery out of seven worked in there we're talking about bakeries that are serving 1.8 million Palestinians that are squee seed into the middle area after being displaced multiple times from different areas the wfp the world food program has been uh Ser providing those bakeries with fuel with uh um flour with salt with yeast and with all the ingredients that would make it possible for the bakeries to provide uh bread for all of these Palestinians but also due to the lack of fuel uh there is a threat that those Bakery will also shut down but we got news that uh those bakeries received uh fuel for only one day so the risk is uh also high for shutting those bakeries and those bakeries are the lifeline uh for all of these Palestinians that are have been displaced over and over again but also Palestinians feel this risk uh anaser Hospital uh the bakeries being displaced air strikes still going on so Palestinians still believe that there's a a very collapsing humanitarian situation still going on in the Gaza Strip despite uh the negotiations about the Seas fire deal and everything happening in Doha yeah I want to talk to you about that because of course with the backdrop of hopes once again of a possible uh negotiation towards a a ceasefire we're still seeing air strikes and and artillery strikes happening in uh Gaza just talk us through what the latest is with that well five pal Ians were killed among them are three Palestinian children in Al jabalia in a residential house there has been also a couple of air strikes inun a coule also artillery shelling inat but the main news in where there's no news out of sha we're talking about a ground Invasion for more than 6 days no ambulances are being able to reach that area no journalists are able to reach up the area no firefighters we know that there are heavy shelling endless air strikes and those Palestinians who were trapped and they were uh sending calls and appeals for the world and for the community to evacuate them uh we are not hearing from anyone and this is what's making it very dangerous and risky and scary and those Palestinians who have neighbors still trapped in are very worried but we're still waiting to hear anything from anyone from those families trapped in a due to the ground inv that is still going on in that area H cadri bringing us up to date from deral hen thank you very much indeed we're going to go to Charles statford who's in a Doha for us it was about a month ago US President Joe Biden said that there had been a proposal for a ceasefire on the table uh remind us what was in it and why nothing was done about it that's right rob it has been more than a month since that proposal put forward by Biden um happened May the 21st it was a un endorsed proposal as well and rightly so it's important just to go through exactly what that proposal involves but it's three stages to that potential deal the first stage involves a six- we ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from populated areas in exchange for some of the Israeli hostages um being released um including women the Aged and the sick and that would be an change for some Palestinian Prisoners the second stage is going to involve or was going to involve the the release of all the remaining living hostages it's believed that there could be um at least 50 remaining living hostages Israeli hostages inside Gaza so that second stage was going to involve their release um and a permanent end to all hostilities the third stage was going to involve the beginning of a reconstruction plan plan of Gaza um and then all the remaining uh dead Israeli hostages their remains would then be returned to Israel now there has been push back basically both sides on this plan the US has blamed Hamas um but as you say we are beginning to have hope now that there may be changes to that proposal that have been offered by Hamas that are going to be discussed here in Doha in the next couple of days but if it was understood that Hamas basically wanted an immediate end to the war in this proposal it was no good for a temporary six we ceasefire at the beginning they wanted an immediate end to all hostilities and an immediate withdrawal to um of Israeli forces um and we understand that you know although Israel said that certainly Netanyahu um was very Cy in really appraising this proposal and never really publicly endorsed it so we understand that there has been pushed back in the last month and a half of course by the Israeli Prime Minister also Charles thanks very much indeed as things progress over the next coming coming hours of course we're going to be coming back to you to talk about that Charles Stratford in Doha thank you
