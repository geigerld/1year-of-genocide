while Israeli soldiers have also shot and killed a Palestinian Carpenter who's a father of six near nablas the 39-year-old was initially attacked by Israeli settlers in the town of karwat bani Hassan settlers then forced him out of his car and burned it before he was shot in the neck by an Israeli soldier elsewhere in the West Bank 10 masked Israeli settlers raided a Palestinian owned restaurant in the village of Saia security camera footage captured at the moment of the attack you're seeing there which clearly caused significant damage to that building well let's now speak to our correspondent who's on the ground there for us Abid is in Hebron H tell us what you've been seeing there where you are well there have been several uh raids overnight here in Hebron in total eight people were detained Four Women and four uh young men in their 20s now we're here at the house of the karame family uh where where one of the raids happened at around 2:30 in the morning so as we understanded the soldiers came through this door and you can see around me all this mess that happened this is the soldiers really searching and ransacking uh the courtyard of the house I would say inside you had seven people sleeping the mother and six children of which one is a one-year-old uh child now I'm told that it's only when the soldiers knocked at this door that they woke up and understood that something was going on now the person that was detained is Barak K she's 18 years old and she's a university student and I'm here with her mother Han and Hanah is actually quite emotional still at about 2 in the morning we heard some noise and some banging on the door they tried in a barbaric manner to open the door we told the Israeli occupation soldiers to wait we will open we the this door is totally sealed we had to open the back uh door this door was smashed by the Israeli occupation soldiers at that time they directed their laser gun laser beam on our heads uh we have children uh daughters and boys and one yearold boy uh they dragged my 14-year-old boy they pulled him outside the house and they started roughing him up interrogating him and it was a terrifying uh scene and my children were really frightened they started to take down our names at that point they took my uh 18yearold daughter bar they surrounded her and they started to take photographs of her I want to try to ask what's going on they screamed and asked us to shut up we were really frightened and the large number of uh soldiers armed to the to the teeth they started to destroy and smash everything in the house I tried to ask what uh before that my husband is detained he is detained by the Israeli occupation forces they hushed us they took my daughter together with me inside the back room other they a a female Soldier started to budy search her in a very rough manner they searched her in a very violent fashion and after that they took her away they pushed me out of the room and they kept the daughter inside they asked me that why do you think they took your daughter away nothing was disclosed they asked us tomorrow there will be a swap deal with Gaza and your daughter will be released and the the is sold said let the Gaz have her released so told you that they took her as a prisoner and they it will be she will be released in a swap deal I tried to ask them what is going on what did she do what what crime did she commit they did not answer they kept destroying and smashing everything in the house I told them we are civilians she is a a juvenile she was born in 2005 she's a young child what did she do you are very anxious and tense no doubt before that last week my husband was detained and today they have taken my daughter I even begged them to give her some heavy clothes because the weather is called they refused they even refused to give her anything while they took her away last week many detes Palestinian detes were released and you must have heard there stories yeah this made me more frightened I'm really fear for my daughter the way the Israeli occupation soldiers are dealing with the Palestinian dettin we hope that the Red Cross would intervene and find a solution she is an innocent young 18-year-old University student she did not commit any crime now she doesn't know where her daughter has been taken into but we spoke to other uh females who were detained here in Hebron just yesterday and they explain to us that there's several phases in their detention they first are taking to uh a nearby to offer prison and from there they take him to somewhere called the shaon prison where there is where they spend several days during interrogations and all the females we spoke to said that the conditions there were very harsh and it's after that they they are moved once again to Damon prison which is the female prison for Palestinians inside Israel now they said that inside those jails they are completely cut off from the world and that the conditions are quite harsh uh because they said that they felt that the soldiers there the prison guards there were taking their revenge or their anger out of what happened on October 7th on these detained people people inside the jails H ABD Hamed with that report for us from the ground in Hebron in the occupied West Bank thank you h
