now with Mahmud basal Mahmud is head of communications at the Palestinian civil defense in Gaza and um he is joining us from inside the Gaza Strip tell us sir what your teams have been doing in the last 24 hours and how they've been [Music] operating as a matter of fact the situation in Gaza strip all across the strip as we speak is more than dire amid the Relentless bombardment the Israeli occupation forces continue to commit massacres against Palestinians innocent Palestinian civilians namely targeting residential areas uh uh since the truce came to an end the shelling of missiles by Israeli war planes had has intensified now residential areas are targeted by a number of missiles it means that missiles are fired from different directions on one residential quarter this causes more destruction and higher number of victims as civil defense teams within the areas we can document dozens of innocent civilians being killed on each and every air strikes hundreds also are being wounded we are doing all what we can with the little resources at hand we start by digging H in order to recover those killed under the debris however no matter what we do we are not able to salvage all those who fall uh many remain killed and buried under the debris at the same time uh we can speak for days on this particular issue we at the end of the day require heavy equipment bulldozers and lifts in order to be able to remove this heavy concrete debris we also require diggers bulldozers tractors uh LIF in order to be able to recover those victims I regret to say in Gaza Strip and in the north part of the strip there is not a single piece of equipment the Israeli occupation forces have destroyed all the equipment within this area as we speak hundreds remain buried under the debris and we are standing helpless we cannot do anything we're using our bare hands and this will have a very heavy mental toll not only on the families but also on us as civil defense and rescue teams I also regret to say that the numbers of victims in thousands who are still buried under the debris day after day this will pave the way for an environmental issue many of dead bodies remain bloated and wreaking this is a source of contamination however this has not deterred the Israelis from continuing to bombard and pound all the residential areas more than 50 residential houses within one single quarters were sheld and level To The Ground by war planes as a result in this particular program more than 300 civilians with from the single quarter were killed according to the eyewitnesses hundreds more were injured and again we are helpless this particular quarter were was once home to more than 1,000 Palestinians many of them have even taken shelter in this area from the Relentless shelling by the Israeli War plan they were C killed in Cold Blood we also again repeat the same thing that dozens hundreds thousands remain buried under the debris from the morning till now the air strikes have not come to a stop the targeting of residential areas has not come to a stop from the morning only more than 30 were killed and unknown number remain buried under the debris another residential area in for example more than 20 were killed as a result of one single air strike from the sunrise this morning the Baptist Hospital received more than 86 dead bodies by 900 a.m. more than 86 killed Palestinians arrived at the hospital uh double higher numbers remain buried and we are helpless we cannot do anything especially that the Israeli war planes continue to pound the areas speaking of the same issue again the equipment I again regret to say that the Israeli occupation forces destroyed more than 2/3 of the civil defense Vehicles they are totally destroyed and out of service we are short of heavy equipment that will will enable us to remove the heavy con concrete these are very critical for the rescue and Salvage these are targeted directly by the Israeli occupation forces what adds insult to injury is that we are short as a team more than 120 from among our own team members were killed hundreds of others were also injured as a result we the civil teams are suffering sharp shortage of team members minutes ago only minutes ago one of our fellow civil defense members lost his limb his right leg was severed from the knee as this is only an example we are standing defenseless helpless amid all this destruction and we cannot do anything to our own people I can continue to speak for days however this ask you a specific question here if I could jump in uh Mr basal are your teams in the southern part of the strip you've explained the situation in the north where you have no more equipment all your equipment has been destroyed hundreds if not thousands of people remain buried under the debris I wonder in the southern part of the strip now since Israel is intensifying the bombardments there are your teams able to move from one area to the other whether it's Rafa whether it's hunis in order to bring the help that is needed after strikes as we speak G strip is divided into two the northern part and the southern part it is very difficult to move between both the sectors we tried on a number of occasions to at least uh allow some of our team members to head to the south in order to lend a helping hand to our fellow uh teams however those team members were detained by the Israeli occupation forces more than five of our team members uh were detained and we do not know where their whereabouts they were detained by the Israelis aten Unice Road block and we do not know exactly what has become of them are they detained were they killed we do not know that means no one is able to move from South to the North or North to South whatever team members in One location they should remain and try to operate within the very few perimeters as they could this adds to the difficulties we have been already facing especially that the northern part of Gaza Strip is reeling under intense bombardment by the Israeli War ples nothing but destruction magnitude of Destruction is in unspeakable Indescribable Mahmud basal head of defense in Gaza thank you very much for your time today
