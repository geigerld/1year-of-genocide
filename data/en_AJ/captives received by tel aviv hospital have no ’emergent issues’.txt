told we can now listen live to the Israeli Health authorities speaking about the health of the captives who've just been released uh for us uh where uh we as a organization had the uh amazing privilege of being able to treat uh our brothers and sisters our children um that have been kept kepted uh uh by the Hamas in the last few weeks the edmon Safra Children's Hospital uh together with the whole Sheba Medical Center uh has been preparing uh for this uh uh opportunity uh We've gathered the best uh professionals uh and trained them uh we learned a lot uh we uh consulted with our peers and with the Israeli Ministry of Health um and tried to prepare uh to be able to give those that were kept uh captive um any uh care and attention they might need uh when this uh fortunate event where they are released uh happens uh and indeed uh last night after a very uh confusing uh and stressful uh period at around 3:30 a.m. uh we received um uh these uh 12 uh captives uh children and women um that came back um they underwent uh a medical evaluation and a psychological evaluation I am uh happy to say that despite the fact that the uh har conditions that have been under and the um experience of captivity they did not um require any emergent medical uh intervention we will keep them here at the edmona for children's hospital for as long as they need uh and uh care for them help them uh in their preparation of coming back uh to their communities um some of them uh have no homes to come back to but they have a a very significant and supporting community that will uh embrace them uh as the whole nation Embraces them uh when they uh come back on a personal note um this is a pediatric hospital we have a lot of emotional and significant uh days here uh caring for children from uh all over um I've been doing this for many years and I have to tell you that this uh past night was one of the most significant evenings and and nights for me and I'm I feel privileged to be to have gotten the the opportunity to be here for these uh children and their uh and their families I think uh I share uh this with the other members of the team we've been here for uh many hours uh and I I think no team member has uh has left they all stay uh trying to care for these uh to these uh uh people to these children um there are only a very very small part of the people that are kept uh captive by Hamas uh we pray together with the whole nation I think with the with the world for the early uh release of the rest of the captives um there are children there there are uh women there there are are elderly people there uh there are women and men uh and we we are ready to treat them as they come back hopefully uh very soon I want to thank um the Israeli Ministry of Health that um supported us uh and okay you're listening to the health authorities there in Israel at a pediatric hospital that is holding some of the 13 Israeli captives who were released um yesterday today that's Saturday and that includes seven children we can cross now to Rory Chalin who's in occupied East Jerusalem Rory what are we learning well sirel I think we're getting the same kind of comments uh today as we had yesterday uh from that that Pediatric Hospital as well they don't really go into specifics do they they talk about the general harsh conditions of captivity that the uh kids and the people that they're looking after have been under uh for the last you know month plus uh they will keep them in the hospital for as long as they need they talked about how some of them uh don't have homes to go back to because their homes have been destroyed on October the 7th they talked about the emotional toll of everything uh and that the team spirit uh of the people there the Medics caring uh for those free captives for the children particularly uh has been as he put it pretty impressive and they pray for the release of the rest of the captiv so it's a general message they're not going into the individual stories of of the people that they are looking after we do know some of those individual stories though because uh we have been hearing them from Israeli media we've been hearing about Emily Hans this 9-year-old Irish Israeli who was at a sleepover at a friend's house in kibot Bey this is one of the communities in the south of Israel that was most impacted by the attacks of October the 7th how her father thought she was dead for for a long time after speaking to I think the you know the chaos that surrounded October the 7th for many days if not weeks afterwards that it was thought that this young girl had died we've heard of Hiller rotam the 13-year-old who was taken captive with her mother uh again from kibot Bei her mother is still in captivity that's causing considerable anger uh in in Israel because one of the terms they think the deal is under is that parents mothers and children should not be separated um so those are the kind of details that we hearing on media we didn't hear that particularly in that press conference he was keeping it very general yeah Rory chalins reporting from occupied East Jerusalem there
