my aunt sharen abak was killed two years ago today while covering a military raid engine in the occupied West Bank um ever since Shireen was killed no one has been held accountable and for the past two years my family and I have been advocating tirelessly um for justice for Shireen we have been calling for accountability from the halls of the US Congress all the way to the ICC and until this day we still haven't heard back from the ICC and we continue to call on um the ICC to carry out an investigation the fact that there was no justice for Shireen has led has paved the way um for the uh systematic targeting of Palestinian journalists in in Gaz and over the past seven months we've seen more than 140 Palestinian journalists targeted and uh killed um U media workers have been continuously uh targeted and um the fact that there's no justice for Shireen really is uh disheartening because um it makes us wonder if uh if all these journalists that were killed in Gazza will ever have justice as well
