White House mean this literally when the pure unadulterated evil is Unleashed on this world the people of Israel live through one such moment this weekend the bloody hands of the terrorist organization amas a group whose state of purpose for being is to kill Jews this was an act of sheer evil more than 1,000 civilians slaughtered not just kill slaughtered in Israel among them at least 14 American citizens killed parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children stomach turning reports of being babies being killed entire family slain young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace to celebrate peace women raped assaulted paraded as trophies families hid Their Fear for hours and hours desperately trying to keep their children quiet to avoid drawing attention and thousands of wounded alive but carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds and the memory of what they endured you all know these traumas never go away there's still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones not knowing if they're alive or dead or hostages infants in their mother's arms grandparents and wheelchairs Holocaust Survivors abducted and Hell hostage hostages whom Hamas has now threaten execute in violation of every code of human morality it's aorn the brutality of amas his bloodthirstiness brings to mind the worst the worst Rampages of Isis this is Terrorism but sadly for the Jewish people it's not new this attack has brought to the surface painful memories and the scars left by a millennia of anti-Semitism and genocide of the Jewish people so in this moment we must be Crystal Clear we stand with Israel we stand with Israel and we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens defend itself and respond to this attack there's no justification for terrorism there's no excuse Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination the state of purposes the annihilation of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people they use Palestinian civilians as human Shields Hamas offers nothing but Terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price the loss of innocent life is heartbreaking like every nation in the world Israel has the right to respond indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks I just got off the phone with a third call with prime minister Netanyahu and I told him the United States experience with Israel experiencing our response would be swift decisive and overwhelming we also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law terrorists per purposely Target civilians kill them we uphold the laws of war law of War it matters there's a difference today Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart a lot of us know how it feels it leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family feeling like you're being sucked in the anger the pain the sense of hopelessness this is what they mean by human tragedy an atrocity on an appalling scale we're going to continue to stand United supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism my team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this Crisis began we're surging additional military system including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome we're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens my Administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis when Congress returns we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the National Security requirements of our critical Partners this is not about party or politics it's about the security of our world the security of the United States of America we now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recover recovery efforts because as president I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world the United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence the Department of Defense has moved the USS jlr Ford carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence and we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed let me say again to any country any organization anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation I have one word don't don't our hearts may be broken but our resolve is clear yesterday I also spoke with the leaders of France Germany Italy in UK to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our United response this comes on top of days of steady engagement with Partners across region we're also taking steps at home in cities across the United States of America police departments have stepped up security around centers for of Jewish life the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish Community Partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge connection with these horrific attacks this is a moment for the United States to come together to grieve with those who are mourning let's be real clear there is no place for hate in America not against Jews not against Muslims not against anybody we re reject we reject what we reject is Terrorism we condemn the indiscriminate evil just what we've always done that's what America stands for you know just over 50 years ago I was thinking about it this morning talking the Secretary of State the Vice President in my office over 50 years ago as a young Senator I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected senator and I had a long long trip a meeting with golden Mayer in her office just before the am kapore war and I guess you could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced they were facing we walked outside in that that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photo she looked looked at me all of a sudden and said would you like to have a photograph and so I got up and followed her out we're standing there silent looking at the Press she could tell I guess I was concerned she leaned over and whispered to me she said don't worry Senator Biden we have a secret Reon here in Israel my word is what he said we have no place else to go we have no place else to go go for 75 years Israel has stood as the only guarantor of security of Jewish people around the world so that the atrocities of the past could never happen again and let there be no doubt the United States has Israel's back we will make sure the Jewish and Democratic state of Israel can defend itself today tomorrow as we always have it's as simple as that these atrocities been sickening we're with Israel let's make no mistake thank you Mr President what was your [Music] reaction okay you've just been listening to the US President Joe Biden uh and his address from the White House on the uh Israel Gaza War very strong speech we're going to be talking to Maran bashara alzer's senior political analyst you're joining us from Paris first though let's go live to Kimberly hit our White House correspondent in Washington DC Kimberly uh it's not the first time that Biden speaks since uh this is day four of the war not the first time we've heard Biden but the first time we've heard him like this in this much detail and you know he chose to open his speech with I think with a very strong emotional payload it's fair to say yeah the United States has Israel's back and certainly we've always known that in terms of the dollars that are spent but it's certainly something that was reiterated by the US president and a lot of what we heard in this speech was uh things that we've heard in the past few days that Israel has a right to defend itself that it has the United States wants to make sure that it has what it needs to respond in other words the president there as commander-in-chief of the US military saying that it will surge in terms of the Munitions that the Israeli military needs in order to defend itself uh the US president outlining there we expected we might have had a few more details than we actually got from the president uh we we a little thin on details there uh but the US president talking about his call with the Israeli Prime Minister that uh the Israel military is promising a Swift and over overwhelming response in terms of what it calls retaliation towards Hamas uh what I do want to point out though is uh one sort of point of what you might call hypocrisy on the part of the US president where he talked about the uh United States in Alliance with uh Israel saying that what the distinction between what he called the terrorists uh is that that they believe they uphold the law in terms of the the rules of international law and and War he said that only terrorists would attack civilians but clearly that uh is not uh entirely accurate because what we've seen in recent days obviously is the Israeli military cutting off not only food but electricity and water uh to the Palestinians in Gaza we've uh certainly seen the attacks that have been not surgical but in fact uh being sort of a large swath of apartment complexes that we know have allowed for uh women children uh elderly to be caught up in this and so uh for the president to say that they have been uh that they have been abiding by the rules of law certainly is uh not would not be accurate and to to be partnering with Israel in this would certainly not be accurate and I think that one more thing that we should point out in all of this is the language the president used when he talked about the United States coming together and this is not a time for party or politics this is about the security of the world this is very much the type of language that we heard back around the September 11th attacks and many people have called this Israel's 911 for lack of of a better term or terminology and uh many might be sort of almost alarmed when they hear this because uh when it comes to kind of the military-industrial complex and the war mongers on Capitol Hill uh one can kind of be troubled by hearing this that maybe this is a White House pivoting towards uh a conflict or a broader conflict there's much as they say they are not looking to see this escalate that they may at least be preparing for that well Kimberly stand by stay with us everything you've said is duly noted um it's also interesting to note the contrast even as President Joe Biden was speaking we had the live picture of the Skies over Gaza and we saw repeated military uh bombardments of the Gaza Strip Marwan I want to bring you in and I want to get your thoughts on this speech uh US President Joe Biden saying Israel has not only a right to respond but a but quote a duty to respond yes um you know having followed uh prime minister Netanyahu who's a very slick speaker uh with excellent English and an incredible reservoir of sound bites having read his books and followed his speeches for the past 30 years I tell you every single word Biden said is a Netanyahu word I think the prime minister of Israel has once again Brainwashed the American president and it's really sad to see the leader of the Free World as he called himself repeating word for word verting what Netanyahu I guess have told him because much of that soundbite that we just heard from um the American president seems or sounds to me like he was told from the from Netanyahu the point about the sole purpose of Hamas is to kill Jews bloodthirsty this is not an American president's words this is the netanyahu's words and he's been using them forever and the point about the Palestinians using a human shield this is Netanyahu sound bite that's not an American president sound bite you would always expect that an American president when it comes to Israel that American Presidents act like the grown-ups in the room and that they would you know advise patience and advise maturity and advise uh uh you know certain soberness towards dealing with these sorts of questions that are complicated in the Middle East except in this case what we see is President Biden repeating what the uh what what the Israeli Prime Minister told him and on the other points that uh Kimberly mentioned I don't have to repeat them but they are very accurate because the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza and the collective punishment of Gaza and the blockading and the siege and cutting off of electricity fuel food goods and so on so forth that is not International law and these are not the laws of war this is a direct violation of international law and President Biden knows it he knows it but he chose once again for the third time that I heard him the last three days he chooses again and again to ignore the plight of the Palestinians which is absolutely nonsensical because this conflict involves two people now it's okay it's it's it's expected for leaders to demonize one another and it's okay and expected for the American president and the Israeli Prime Minister to demonize Hamas and Palestinian leadership in general it's called politics but dehumanizing an entire people is not politics it's racism when you dehumanize the Palestinian people who have been living under occupation for more than 55 years dispossessed of their belongings for the past 75 years this dehumanization is racism they cannot continue to be racist towards the Palestinians because they are the weaker party or for political expediency which takes me to the third point he says we're all United and we're all this and that and other thing humbug we all know and you read that throughout the American press that Biden is trying to jump on the bandwagon because the Republicans had undermined him and said accused him of financing you know incorrectly as it I might be Iran that finan this sort of operation against Israel so he is basically regaining the initiatives and instead of saying no we did not and the money is still in theq Central Bank he's basically now trying to over uh Kill by going even beyond what the Republicans have been saying and showing this incredible friendship to Israel and in unconditional support and once again he underlined that America is dispatching the uh uh the aircraft carrier and the strike force to the east Mediterranean and he said and warned anyone state or non-state actor which I presume probably isbah don't he said so what does that mean is he issuing an ultimatum that if anyone attacks Israel including America is going to get involved really America wants to get involved into another Regional war after Afghanistan Iraq Libya Somalia and so on and so forth this is the president that promised to end the forever Wars and got out humiliated out of the Afghanistan he really wants to start another War because Hamas carried a gruesome attack in southern Israel that is not a grownup conversation that's not a grownup speech and that is not a way to deal with a with a complicated conflict and certainly not by dehumanizing an entire people that is racism well Maran how do you read that line the the one you just referenced he said quote any country organization thinking of taking advantage of this situation don't um it appears the US president is putting his money where his mouth is to the extent that they're providing military they they are providing they're are surging I think is the word that's being used today surging their military aid to Israel they're going to replenish their ammunition stocks for the Iron Dome uh system and even as I speak we just saw the uh US aircraft carrier that's being sent to the region so there are real there is real military hardware that is being you know that is being increased and that Biden is bringing to bear on situation and it's ultimately mad mad you know all our hearts goes to all the civilians dying including American civilians and Israeli civilians but the idea you respond to the killing of civilians by sending aircraft carriers to the east Mediterranean and I've just read that there's Israeli reports that maybe another aircraft has might be sent towards the east Mediterranean this is just Madness and you by the way October 10 apparently is World mental health day so I'm worried that we are all losing our minds because the idea that an American president issues an ultimatum here where we are with our aircraft carriers that could probably you know start a third world war that we are here and we are warning you any one of you that will you know attack or take advantage of the situation then that presumably America will respond this is a dangerous escalation and I'll tell you why this is particularly a dangerous escalation and allow me to use just one one Concept in in military strategic Affairs through C the this trap which basically says you build up your forces in anticipation of a danger the other party feeling insecure builds up their own uh armaments and position in order to balance out your threats and your military uh uh augmentation so what happens is now hisbah Iran and whoever else is also on their toes while America is awaiting anyone to provoke and what you have is a possibility that this thing will go out of hand simply by you know Hezbollah launching more missiles against Israel and suddenly you have America involved in another Middle Eastern War I think prime minister netan has manipulated the American president into getting involved perhaps eventually hopefully not into another regional conflict that would be catastrophic one for Israel two for America and certainly for the United States and the middle east region I think the I think the United States needs to sober up I think it needs to get its politics out of its strategy I think they need to hold back I think they need to start talking about diplomacy and I think it's time for the American president to start speaking about an immediate ceasefire even if if it's just empty words we need to hear him we need to hear the American president and his European allies in addition to expressing their unconditional support to Israel to start speaking about diplomacy and ending the state of War because we all know and I think the American president probably should know first that there is no military solution to the Palestinian problem there isn't even a military solution to Hamas because it is a resistance uh group it is not sole purpose is to kill Jews Hamas was born in the 1980s as a result of the Israeli occupation Hamas did not exist before the Israeli exist occupation existed no it is not anti-Semitism Hamas is not anti Palestinian resistance is not anti-Semitism even if some of them would actually use some horrific unaccept unacceptable language against Israel and Jews but it's not anti-semitic it's resistance occupation and they are the product of occupation and it is sad day that we are where we are here because of Israel's occupation and American Support unconditional support to Israel as it continues to occupy and settle illegally Palestine Maran Bashar look thank you very much for your reaction and commentary after the speech we just heard from uh the US President Joe Biden a very short while ago from the White House thanks Marwan
