for Israel it seems nowhere in Gaza is off limits every bomb dropped every rocket fired Israel says targets Hamas positions but many perhaps most are hitting densely populated civilian areas Sunday afternoon another major Gaza hospital is threatened with a worst case scenario Al koods is Sheltering 14,000 people some wounded many displaced after weeks of of bombardment the hospital director says there is nothing here for Israel to hit there is no reason in the hospital there is no police presence no military presence nothing at all just thousands of Palestinians here many of whom have lost their homes thousands of others are seeking shelter and unra schools and Israel is targeting every single building around Al's Hospital why is that nobody knows Israeli messages to patients and Hospital administrat aters with orders to leave were accompanied by air strikes targeting areas close by it follows a familiar pattern Israel has hit dozens of other health facilities in Gaza the latest threat comes nearly 2 weeks after an attack on the alahi Baptist Hospital killed hundreds of people including children Israel denies responsibility what will happen with the hospitals if the International Community whatever that is is not getting a ceasefire in place and opening Gaza and getting in fuel water food and medical supplies we will see a disaster of a magnitude that I don't think we have seen in modern times so the most important medical thing to do now is to stop the bombing and lift The Siege Al Good's doctors say any kind of evacuation is impossible there are too many patients who need care and anyway there is nowhere safe to go the only country in the world that can prevent Israel now from bombarding this hospital as they have done to 56 other health facilities that they completely destroyed the only country that can stop that is the United States of America because there is more in United Nations International presence there that can provide protection the World Health Organization issued a statement expressing deep concern for the safety of patients and Palestinian Sheltering there such sentiment of little use in the face of Israeli bombs and missiles Zay basravi Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
