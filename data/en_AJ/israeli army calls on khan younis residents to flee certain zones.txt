now Israel's Army has issued new orders to further displace people in southern Gaza an area that had previously been declared safe Israel says that it's dividing the entire Gaza Strip into zones to let people know which areas they should be leaving it's now saying that these districts here the Yellow Part here on the map these districts of Han yunes the largest city in the now in the South remember will become areas with quote heavy fighting Israel is ordering people to move to three camps in these areas in those directions now the wording of the displacement leaflets because Israel has once again been dropping leaflets over those areas that wording suggests that the survival of Palestinians is now after they've been warned by Israel their own responsibility let's take a look at the situation on the ground after Israel isolated Gaza City in the north the largest city in the Gaza Strip its troops have now been pushing South that means south of that white line Wadi Gaza there uh uh along the strip's main archery which is we've been telling you uh saladine road that is the main axis that goes north to south along with the coastal road but we'll get back to that we have reports that there's been fighting all the way down here in alcara so it's just a few kilometers away from the heart of hanun while Israel is telling Palestinians in hanun to move further south towards Rafa now that's along the border you see it there along the border with Egypt Israel has also been Shing the main roads leading to that area one of the few remaining options to travel between gaza's north and south is on the coastal road so back to that Al rashed road but Israeli military vessels along the Mediterranean Coastline have a direct line of fire over this road and they have been shooting at Vehicles traveling along Al rashed Road the coastal Road all right let's talk about all of this let's bring in Omar Shore thank you very much for being with us uh Omar is Professor of security and Military studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies he's been breaking down the military aspects of all of this over the last few days as you look at this Omar and as you take in all these little bits of information the zones where Israel is operating the information or rather the the the warnings that Israel has been sending to Palestinians what is the bigger picture that is building for you well the the bigger picture uh well we go strategic operational and tactical okay strategic uh basically they are trying to send a message uh probably to the US primarily that they are trying to reduce civilian casualties so allow us to continue that operation for claim they claimed I think two months but I think it will be a lot longer than that if that's the pace and I'll tell you why that's as far as you're concerned messaging and signaling that is also for the International Community specifically for the US when they're dropping those leaflets saying leave these areas because we're going to start shelling here they're talking to Palestinians but they're also talking to the US primarily to the US because I don't think it's going to work uh it's we are talking talking about a population density in in the South that almost doubled it was before the war it was 6,500 per square kilometer now we're talking about U almost over 13,000 per square kilometer so anywhere you're going to bomb you're probably going to uh hit significant um uh numbers of of of Palestinian civilians we should remind our viewers this length here it's 40 kilm just because we also we always say how how densely populated this is this is 10 40 km by 10 yeah so the whole Gaza Strip is the 370 Square kilomet so it's the side of the city of har in Ukraine so it's it's not it's not a big uh place at all so so strategically I think it's it's uh we are trying to reduce civilian casualties so don't pressure us diplomatically to end or have a pause or have a ceasefire let us continue this operationally you know the the Hamas in so they want to go approach the South fair enough but in the north I don't think Hamas command and control structure is destroyed uh we saw U uh the release of hostages from the north as well as from the south we also saw it seems to me that the ground lines of communications were not completely destroyed and just today that you mean the the ability for Hamas to move from the southern part of the strip to the northern part back and forth yeah yeah absolutely to to move not just to move in in terms of um men or Fighters or hostages but also weapons ammunition uh food fuel Etc so but also the the interesting bit in this is the on the technical level today I I saw now an announcement that there was has been an attack again in in B hanon so we're talking about you know the northern back in the northern part of the strip back in the Northern and and previously there was an attack in Bia so both the North Center the the far North Center and the far north is uh there are operations there which tells me that it does not um the the Hamas units there were not really destroyed but the interesting bit there is the the at least for according to the Kasam battalions um I don't know why they why they translate always to brigades but they said which is battalions and and their size even smaller than battalions but also the the they claim that they used a tpg uh U shell a rocket tpg is a thermobaric so this is incendiary rockets and wa you're losing me so okay so so they have the alasin 105 uh this is a a modification of a uh of an RPG 29 M um it's uh it's two tendem so if you have a tank with a reactive armor it deals with the reactive armor it explodes on two levels so first uh the the smaller round destroys the uh the reactive armor the second bigger round the the the one5 destroys the uh the armor of the actual tank so the tanks usually have a reactive armor to to stop that so if they're using it now so it means it it tells me that they have more ammunition more qualitative ammunition that they did they did not use yet uh so now we're at a thermobaric uh ammunition level uh in the north what is the sou it tells me that they they still have more ammunition uh in terms of and qualitative ones uh so the israelies did not complete their mission in the north and I don't think they are closer anywhere to destroying destruction of uh kasan battalions in the north uh which says that you know if they did not do this in the north 58 days later uh after 1,00 air strikes so you can imagine the amount of air sores for 1,200 air strikes and hundreds of tons of uh explosive that were you know was on Gaza and with this level of Destruction and there's still fighting in the far north where they initially the main axis of Advance was was there um so if if that's the case so what about the south which is going to be it's bigger as you see geographically yeah probably more dense in terms of not probably for sure more dense in terms of the population well because by now a large part of the population that was in the north has moved to the South so to the UN one 1,700,000 idps okay all right we're going to have to end it here because we have a lot to get in the show this hour but thank you very much and we hear what you're saying both on a strategic level in terms of the messaging uh when the Israelis are are telling palestin to leave these yellow areas here that it's aimed you say not just at Palestinians but also at the International Community specifically their back Earth the US also what you're saying that Hamas still very much active and able to bring weapons into the Battle Zone in the north of the Gaza Strip thank you very much for making sense of this map telling us what's happening right now Omar sh will'll talk to you again thank you very much
