we're going to begin in Gaza with the Palestinian civil defense team says evidence from Mass graves in the grounds of NASA Hospital in conun shows the Israeli Army carried out summary executions 392 bodies have been recovered in Mass Graves across Gaza but they've not been able to identify 267 of them and at least 20 people may have been buried alive at the medical complex children were also among the bodies recovered the team is accusing Israel of committing crime Against Humanity meanwhile International pressure is mounting on Israel after the discovery of the mass Graves US National Security advisor Jake Sullivan says Washington wants answers the White House says reports of mass graves in Gaza are deeply disturbing the EU and the United Nations have already called for an independent investigation Mass Graves have been discovered in alifa hospital in Gaza City as well as NASA Hospital in the South Dr Muhammad Al m is head of the monitoring and documenting unit at the civil defense department in Gaza he's joining us live from Rafa we're going to be talking to him through a translator sir thank you very much indeed for being with us can you tell us how you and your team gathered the evidence peace be upon you good evening everyone during our work with the civil defense team in order to recover the bodies in the medical complex of Al Naser we have found a mass Graves within the medical complex and one in the mor one in the north of the medical complex and the Civil team civil defense team has worked in order to recover all the bodies most of them were decomposed bodies and the occupation forces has changed the forms and also changed the shrouds and put them in plastic bags we believe that those bags have accelerated the decomposition of those bodies we have also notice through our teams we are trying also to document all the evidence that show that many corpses or bodies uh have shown signs of torture including hand cuffing and also some other parts uh some other bodies has shown that they were shot and gunshot also we have observed that there were corpses of bodies that were completely dismembered in we also found bodies of women young people elderly in the area of uh around the medical complex we also have observed and found some bodies with no clothes and all this indicated that uh some other bodies showed that they were being treated in the medical complex as we have shown in the picture during the press conference that showed that one of the bodies that found was receiving treatment we are uh trying to uh find all the evidence establish all the evidence uh how those bodies have been buried we have also noted and observed that many bodies have been have been put in one bag which is uh in violation of the regulations we have here there is also clear indication that some citizens and some bodies have been buried in certain directions we have also found some bodies in masked and compiled put 30 m underground while in Mass Graves the distance should not be more than 1 meter sir can you tell me what efforts you and your team have made to record and reserve the evidence that you say that you found we have worked in a very difficult conditions and very challenging this is due to the fact that we are lacking all the needed equipment to deal uh with those uh bodies and to maintain them we have uh used the equipment that we have in order to recover the bodies and we have tried as much as possible not not to open the bags in order to keep those bodies until they are moved to a clean area where we can clean them and then we can open those bags and uh document all the evidence that shows that there were signs of torture and are in violation with the uh international law after uh taking note of all those signs and evidence we have also been able to identify all the problems shown by those bodies and we have document them in specialized reports some of the reports are likely to help the international committees that can be launched in the near future in order to investigate in those human uh in those crimes committed by the occupation with the evidence that you have managed to pull together what do you do with it now how do you get it to an independent team to be able to analyze it we are ready and fully prepared in order to uh submit a full report documented with all the photos and evidence that that we have found about those bodies we can publish them and submit them in both Arabic and in English so that it can be a foundation for the work that can be conducted by International investigation committees we are here ready in Gaza in order to help their work in order to refrain or to push the occupation to refrain from the crimes being committed against the people in Gaza uh in during our work we have found children during the those Mass Graves what why do we have to find children bodies in Mass Graves this confirms that the number that we are documenting of children that have died which is more than 14,000 children including elderly and women are you concerned sir that if an independent team is unable to get into Gaza to be able to examine the evidence for themselves that the evidence might become corrupted it might become damaged and therefore may become unusable if a case is to be brought I don't think because we have made sure to document all the evidences that we have found so far those bodies have been identified whether those uh bodies uh were unknown or not known known or not known and we are keeping all the uh evidence that we found in order to present it to the international investigation committee we will exert all effort our efforts in order to maintain and preserve all the evidence we will document it properly so that we can convey the message of the Palestinian people to the world I want to ask you about the impact that this has been having on you and members of your team having to go through these Mass Graves and collect the evidence that you have say you have been able to pull together what kind of effect is that having on the morale and on the personalities of people there is an impact uh a mental uh impact and also Health that is impacting our health and our morale given that we are exposed directly to those tortures some of our uh Team some members of our team have received the distress calls directly but we were not able to reach the medical complex on time because of the situation back then we were not able to save lives also some of our teams or our members are still suffering from traumas that is also impacting the quality of the work that we can carry out as far as their health of our teams are is concerned some of our members were contaminated given that they were dealing directly with those bodies without having the proper precautions due to the lack of equipment we have also lost all the specialized Labs as far as forensic medicine is concerned in Gaza because of the uh occupation uh bombings and attacks which has also hindered our work and we were not we were not able to establish all the needed uh evidence as we hoped so we still believe that the occupation has stolen some organs we have found some bodies with an open stomach and they were just stapled which is also not known as a practice in forens medicine or any kind of medicine in the health system in Gaza we use usually the proper medical equipment and not staple the bodies uh final question sir what would you hope that International organizations who look at your evidence would do with it now we hope to uh establish the clear evidence that the occupation has committed crimes and killed on purpose thousands of Palestinians in Gaza they have used all kind of tortures and violated all the privacy of our people and their dignity the occupation has committed crimes and has killed all forms of life in Gaza they took pleasure in doing so and destroying life in Gaza we hope that there will be a clear report that will emanate from the investigation to prove and establish an Evidence of all the occupation crimes being committed in Gaza Dr Muhammad Al we appreciate you being with us in Al Jaa thank you very much indeed I'm going to bring in Jeffrey Robertson he's an international lawyer and former United Nations war crimes judge he was also president of the war crimes Court in Sierra Leon he's joining us live now from London good to have you with us an Al J sir this is one of the fundamental problems that Dr was pointing out isn't it the difficult of collecting evidence tangible evidence inside a war zone well it's in a long history we now have a many forensic doctors who have had the rather Grizzly task of combing through Mass Graves and examining victims to establish how they died and that is what is NOW essential to get to the bottom of this true atrocity it's a crime against humanity and uh there must be an independent inquiry although Israel does not accept Independence when seven Aid workers were killed by drones the other day they simply sat the two officials responsible and said it was a tragedy it wasn't a tragedy it was a crime crime of manslaughter by negligence but of course the Israeli government would not allow any prosecution or any independent inquiry this case cries out for an independent inquiry and the sooner the better the Gaza health Jeff Jeffrey Robertson unfortunately your line there is is breaking up and I apologize for interrupting you but I hope you can uh still hear me I do want to ask about one of the points that uh Dr Al was making in terms of how they prevent how they present the evidence uh to the rest of the world to be investigated um that he was suggesting that they would make the evidence available in Arabic and in English one would imagine that that the bulk of that may well be online um until such times as a team can get to see it uh in person in terms of bringing a prosecution or making the in terms of the validity of that evidence would it be enough just to be able to present that evidence online or is it absolutely essential that investigators get to see that evidence in person it would not be enough because people would say that the Hamas health authority was party free uh so you have to have for the sake of the Israelis as well as the Palestinians an independent inquiry and the real question of getting a team of experienced forensic uh doctors and uh a prosecutor or judge uh with an international reputation uh in to Gaza I mean the Kim KH the head of the international criminal court prosecution was not allowed into Gaza so I think this is the point at which America has to step up it's got a number of eminent prosecutors and experts I'm sure it can put a team together and it will have to insist because this has caused outrage in the International Community it will have to insist on a truly independent investigation independent of both the Hamas authorities and the Israeli government it will have to have the ability to question those Israeli officers in the vicinity to establish how this horror came about and who is responsible that is only the questions being asked by the European Union by governments around the world can only be answered by uh an inquiry which is independent to both sides but because this is a crime against humanity it requires a full and independent and trans parent investigation Jeffrey Robertson uh International lawyer former United Nations war crimes judge sir we appreciate it thank you very much indeed
