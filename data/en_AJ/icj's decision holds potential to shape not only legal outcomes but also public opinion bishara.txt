the impact of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza is far-reaching tearing families apart it's created a flood of children who've been orphaned according to the euromed Human Rights group more than 24,000 children have lost their parents gaza's health Ministry says at least 10,000 children have died in the strip since October the 7th Hamza Muhammad reports anas and air only have each other they parents were killed in an Israeli strike on their home inat refugee camp in central Gaza to protect his six-year-old brother anas has not told what happened to their mom and dad my brother doesn't know till now that he's lost all of his family except me I don't know how to tell him I'm afraid that if I tell him it will have a psychological impact the strike did not just kill their parents it left them with life-changing injuries I was with my family at home I went to bring something from the kitchen suddenly everything fell down and I was on fire the fire was eating me air loved playing outside with his friends football their favorite spot my leg is amputated what can I do I want to walk I want to run I want to play I want to see my mother I want clothes to wear I want to stand up I want to walk alone on my own I can't sit down I want to be able to sit down I can't sleep I stay awake all the time as he remains in shock anas is wondering what he did to deserve this what did I do to the Israelis I did nothing to them I did not carry a gun against them I did nothing wrong to the Israelis for now anas and air are alone but alive but as Israel intensifies its bombardments in Gaza that is not guaranteed Hamza Muhammad Al jaaz Al jazer senior political analyst Maran bashara is with us good to have you with us in the studio the scenes of suffering prompted 36 un experts on November the 16th to talk about a genocide in the making in Gaza right you know this um these heart-wrenching tragic stories cut through all the legal terminology and the military jargon uh just to basically go to the heart of the the matter as to what just happened the past 3 4 months in Gaza I think these children tell it better than any judge any journalist or any academic at the end of the day this is what it's all about it's about children uh orphans widows and parents losing their children which is probably the worst of it all and it is uh uh you know uh genocide unring from our eyes not just because of the massive suffering the destruction the collective punishment but it's also because behind it um there is a country determined to inflict that much suffering on the people of Gaza and talking about it now we understand from the statement by the international court of justice they're going to release their provisional ruling on Friday this is a a pivotal moment right it is absolutely I think um at least in terms of the court of public opinion uh because as we speak uh this uh continue to accumulate these these tragic stories of the people in Gaza continue to accumulate we're going to see more and more of this not because of what happened yesterday because of what happened the last three months now we're talking about diseases we're talking about a completely broken Health infrastructure Civic infrastructure San a and so on so forth and let's not forget starvation right so this is all happening Al together while the bombing as we reported earlier is increasing in the southern part of Gaza the north is destroyed and now Israel is destroying uh the southern part but while we speaking the Israelis as we understand today from AEL Aviv uh University poll listen to this this is really incredulous 94% of his Israeli Jews think Israel used appropriate use of force almost 95% of Israeli Jews think this destruction this killing this suffering is Justified that ends justify the means that whatever happened whatever you see in Gaza whatever will be happening in as far as the majority of the Israeli uh public opinion it's just so it's not just the Prime Minister it's not just the president it's not just the defense minister and the cabinet ministers and parliamentarians and journalists and so on so forth in Israel in fact there's a public opinion in Israel that supports the war believe it or not as we watch these images a majority of Israelis today 51% want to resettle illegally the Gaza Strip so the judges of the icj the judges of the the international uh court of justice should be watching as what we watch should be seeing what we're reporting should be probably conscious of the unraveling and the accumulating tragedy of Gaza as it happens today and they should probably be listening just one last point to what the UN Secretary General because in the end of the day the icj is a United Nations court and the United Nations Secretary General is saying that you can't get the humanitarian to Gaza unless you have a ceasefire will it make a difference if the icj goes the direction many expect it will and and calls for emergency measures to prevent a genocide in Gaza it all depends if it chooses the first one and this is the one I was just provoking or invoking when I was mentioned the UN Secretary General stop the fighting that's the first of the eight provisional measures it is a must that the icj rules that fighting must stop today right and then it follows from that the other Provisions such as the humanitarian Aid maintaining the records of the decision-making process behind what we see happening especially by the Israelis and so on so forth now once this decide especially on the first provision and if it does and hopefully it does then this is going to have to go to the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council more importantly it's there at the United Nations security Council where this could become actionable or not my fear is my understand we expect we expect a veto to be used by the US by the United States and that will be the most fortunate of all fortunate uh measures taken by the Americans because will have a lot of moral Authority right even though it's a provisional ruling it's not a final ruling it will carry a lot of moral weight around the world right there is no higher moral weight than the icg on this question once it rules on any number of the measures it's basically implicitly saying there is a grave violation of human rights in that part of the world and if it does say the first one you must stop the fighting then the United States and the UK and Germany those Western powers that unconditionally support Israel Finance Israel and arm Israel's war on Gaza probably would and should be ashamed of themselves but it will split not only you know the the question of Gaza and Israel it will split the world because I think a good number of the so-called Global South is waiting and witnessing that at last maybe something that is associated with the West will also be put on trial and that something got to give in terms of stopping the war in Gaza Maran always was good to talk to you thanks for coming in
