Sabah Ahmed struggles Echo throughout Gaza it's a daunting task I have to rest every flight of stairs the difficulty of trying to provide for a family when Israel has cut off an entire population from the resources they need to survive we can hardly find a loaf of bread and if available we just eat bread without any other food item we do not have income and even if there is nothing to buy we cannot afford a decent meal my children and I eat only a loaf of bread and only once a day there are 11 members of the suel family and they live in B lahia in the north hunger and thirst are spreading and sabba is struggling to keep his children alive even when they escape death from Israel's near constant attacks come see for yourself the fridge is completely empty nothing at all not even water my children are starving to death it's now infested with insects and cockroaches there's nothing at all the pans are empty 85% of Palestinian children under the age of five in Gaza are being forced to go at least one in 3 days without food the number of deaths from dehydration and malnutrition is rising in leaving parents helpless as famine takes hold Julie dger Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jaaz
