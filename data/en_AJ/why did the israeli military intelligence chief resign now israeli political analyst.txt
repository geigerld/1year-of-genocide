Israel's Military Intelligence Chief has stood down after saying he takes responsibility for the lapse in Security on October the 7th Let's cross over to Bernard Smith in occupied East Jerusalem uh this is news that's just emerging Bernard but quite significant news indeed sahal Major General Aran aan haliva is the most senior member of the Israeli military to resign as a consequence of the Hamas attack on Israel on October the 7 he said in his actual in his resignation or retirement statement he said the Intelligence Division did not live up to the task we were entrusted with we know now that there was a major failure of Israeli intelligence that led up to October the 7th that allowed Hamas to get away with this large scale attack on Israeli territory we know now that for up to a year before Israel intelligence had got hands on a Hamas document that laid out the plans for the October the 7th attack and that happened pretty much as as th as those plans had been laid out we know that spotters watching from the towers around Gaza in the weeks and months leading up to October 7th Israeli military spotters had said they'd seen a lot of unusual activity they said they'd seen Hamas uh battalions preparing for some sort of assault rehearsing something all of this was ignored at the very highest level of the military and the government because there was this belief that hamus was not interested in launching a military assault on Israel Hamas was more interested in managing Gaza they got that spectacularly wrong the head of military intelligence akan Aliva has accepted responsibility for that he he accepted responsibility a couple about a week after the attacks he's going to stay in post and until his replacement is found and he's also called for the establishment of a state investigating committee to look into everything led up to October the 7th of course the government's not done that yet it says it wants to carry on first finished the war in Gaza Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister facing criticism that he's prolonging this war in Gaza to avoid setting up this committee and the Reckoning that will come with it when he is the prime minister is uh might have to take responsibility himself for October the 7 yeah B thanks very much for that update bener Smith there for us in occupied East Jerusalem Let's cross over to AKA a political analyst and contributor to heret newspaper in Israel and joins us now from Tel Aviv Mr Elder always good to have you you on Al jazer for your contribution um Mr Haron has said that he would resign but oversee the Gaza operation one wonders why he's decided to step down now I think that uh one of the reasons is maybe the main reason is that he realized that uh netan is not going to put an end to this war in the near future um he he also realized that uh as was published in many outlets media Outlets that netan is not really interested in a deal that will enable the captives to those who are still alive uh to get back uh home to Israel um the other reason is that he wanted maybe to step down in the climax after the intelligent success uh in locating the senior General Iranian General that was uh targeted as we know uh according to Al jazer uh by uh Israeli drones as well as the attack in ispahan that is considered to be a success so he is leaving in the climax the other thing is I think you have to look at his letter of resignation there is uh one line that uh was directed is directed to uh the Prime Minister he says Authority comes with responsibility and nany is the highest Authority and he never took responsibility so actually Mr khwa wanted to set kind of a personal message to netan uh to tell him if I can do it you also should do it and the other thing the timing is uh to today this in a few hours from now the Israelis will gather in the holiday and this will be the talk of the day of course yeah indeed I wanted to get to that because the resignation right now on the eve of Passover is no coincidence if he's sending a message to the Prime Minister he's also sending a message to the Israeli public at large that when you gather over Passover and sit your tables for dinner this is the topic that you should be discussing yeah the uh topic was uh until few hours ago was the captives and uh people plan to put an empty chair next to uh the set table and uh yellow ribbons all around and even in the last demonstration in Saturday um people were Distributing uh um plastic bags that contained a quarter of a p and this is what uh the captives are going to get so this will maybe also put uh more energy to the protest against Netanyahu and his uh I I think uh his inability or lack of interest to cut a deal that will put an end to the war and many people suspect that netan is doing this or not doing this what he should have done because of personal uh interest that he knows that the end of the war is the end of his political career and maybe you know this is the holiday of freedom and this will be the end of his uh holiday of Freedom yeah uh we remember remember that he sits in a trial yeah indeed I'm sorry to jump in there but it is something that every any every analyst we've spoken to and every contributor has been talking about the demise of Netanyahu it hasn't actually happened I was just wondering that if uh Major General jiva's resignation is significant if we in the coming days and we're talking hypotheticals here see more resignations at different levels uh within the military brass is that the pressure that is going to you might say get more people out onto the streets and add pressure to the government and the cabinet itself yeah and I think the next one is not only uh a member of the uh highest military ason I think that it will go to two former Chiefs of Staff who are members of the inner cabinet the war cabinet and I mean Mr guns and Mr Eisen cot um and maybe this will create a dynamic that uh will make it uh harder for them to convince the their constituency their voters that uh they have a good reason to stay if Aon Hara who uh was the chief of the Israeli intelligence felt uh that this is a Time to Say Goodbye uh many more and more Israelis will call them to uh step down uh since they were also responsible they were part of this lack of strategy uh to end the conflict with the Palestinians and uh not to uh put more power where less power didn't work we you see what happens certainly in the coming hours I don't think the story is going away too quickly for the moment hav
