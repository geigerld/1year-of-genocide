well let's recap the latest in the Gaza War Israeli air strikes have killed at least 2,670 Palestinians since last Saturday at least a quarter of them were children the Israeli military has killed more Palestinians in 8 days than it did in 51 days of War on Gaza in 2014 the number of Israelis killed in hamas's military operation stands at 1,400 including 289 soldiers Israel has ordered 1.1 million Palestinians in Northern Gaza to move South as the military prepares for a wide ranging land Aon sea Invasion meanwhile Iran's foreign minister has told Al jazer that his country will not remain an observer in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza well Gregory gor is a professor of international relations at Texas A&amp;M University he joins us from Blues Delaware thank you very much for being on El's era first of all I want to talk about Anthony blink's uh I guess tour of the Gulf States before he heads back to Israel uh he said that he's got three aims at this point in time to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza to get uh the uh captives released by Hamas and to ensure that this conflict doesn't spread to other areas hasn't been able to achieve any of those at this point in time what do you make of his uh I guess his efforts his diplomatic efforts over the last eight days I think the more important thing going forward not to say that the fate of hostages are unimportant or humanitarian aid but but humanitarian Aid is not going to be delivered into a war zone uh I think that the the question going forward is what happens the day after the Israeli attack stop uh and I think that that there's no good answer to that uh but I assume that secretary blinkin is speaking to the gulf leaders about us thoughts about what happens the day after the other thing of course that they're speaking about I'm sure is Iran the gulf countries have even even Saudi Arabia I think has better Avenues to speak to the Iranians now than the United States does and I think that uh secretary blinkin is asking them to reaffirm the American public message to the Iranians not to escalate the crisis but as you say that in the last few hours the uh foreign minister from Iran has said that uh this in the ongoing conflict and if the scope of this conflict widens heavy losses will be inflicted on the US I think that this is a time when the Iranians are enjoying a lot of Big Talk uh they're attempting to Rally support for their position and and uh and they are directly involved in this crisis already of course given their relations with Hamas given their relations with hisb but I wonder if that big talk masks more cautious on their part as we can see at least so far hisbah has been relatively restrained in its activities on the Northern Israeli border and I think that the the Iranians would be courting a serious escalation with the United States given the way American sentiments are moving right now if they were to take any kind of direct action now we know Anthony blinkin is heading to uh Israel tomorrow uh what will has message be for Netanyahu after visiting all of these Gulf States I'm sure that the message that he's hearing from the Gulf leaders is that while the Gul leaders understand that there has to be a response against Hamas that there's no justification for uh the the civilian the the casualties to civilians there's no justification for the extent of the retribution from Israel on the civilian population of Gaza and that will make it extremely difficult for the gulf countries many of whom have either established diplomatic relations with Israel or in the case of Saudi Arabia were negotiating on that question to be able to move forward with relations with Israel and I'm sure that uh that the Israelis will uh will want to know from blinkin what the gulf countries have said about what happens in that situation the day after the Israelis decide to stop this Invasion yeah 2,600 civilians have already Di in Gaza what kind of pressure can blink put on Netanyahu to ensure that number doesn't continue to grow out of control I think he has to emphasize to blinkin that that his netanyahu's entire Regional strategy which was to try to establish normal relations with as many Arab states as possible while not dealing with the fundamental basic issue of the Palestinians is not tenable in this situation and that he is going to have to modulate the Israeli response if he wants to get back to that strategy of attempting to increase Israel's contacts in the Arab world thank you so much uh we really do appreciate your time that is Gregory gor professor of international relations at Texas A&amp;M University thanks so much certainly
