zlot thanks very much indeed for joining us uh Palestine ambassador to the United Kingdom first up so more than uh 600 Israelis dead more than 300 Palestinians dead we're only 48 hours in into this assault do you uh support this operation by Hamas which it would seem it's only heading one in one direction that is more death more injury more destruction particularly to gazans young and old hello Nick uh this is the wrong question really uh uh the the the right question and allow me is do I support my people's quest for the last 100 years for Liberation and for ending this occupation and for their very legitimate rights of self-determination and return Yes um do I understand the International position no I don't and I think uh we need to discuss that first and foremost history did not begin only 48 hours ago in Gaza and around Gaza history began here in fact in this very Capital 106 years ago when Britain with the US and the West decided to give away our land without consulting us the Belford declaration denying us even the definition of people's hood and nationhood in the bord Declaration it was declared that we were the non-jewish minorities when in fact we were more than 96% of the population owning the majority the vast majority of the land and then it continued during the British Mandate of Palestine they were committed contractually with the League of Nations to prepare us for statehood and then again they denied us our right of stimation and statehood and until this very day and hearing your correspondent just earlier the West continues to do the very same denial that the Palestinians have equal rights complete siding with Israel and absolutely what we are going to witness in the coming hours and days is going to be heinous uh mass murder will occur Netanyahu has already declared to the world that he will Target civilians he will wipe Gaza off uh uh the map and the question that we needs to be concerned with right now is how do we stop this how do we stop the bleeding how do we stop further further illegalities and violations think do you think down the line down the line given the number of Israeli casualties so far that that will could actually uh Inspire there to be greater International effort to finally try and get some sort of resolution to this I hope so I hope this is a wake up call I hope this was a serious alarm uh in all of our heads all over the world I hope the West will understand that by giving Israel this card blanch impunity Above the Law the exception of every rule things will not do by trying to bypass the Palestinian issue as happened for the last so many years nobody is interested we signed as you know 30 years ago the oso Accords we committed uh to all the commitment ments of the Accords including negotiations and international resolution and the world told told us the US LED International Community they will deliver the two-state solution the world did not lift a hand throughout the last 30 years when Israel made mockery of all these agreements and all International provisions and U uh resolutions what I am trying to say this is an opportunity for everybody to understand that the Palestinian people are ain't going anywhere that the Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves that the Palestinian people for a 100 years now and for another 100 if it needs to be will continue struggling for their legitimate rights and you seen Trump and the the trying of liquidation of Palestinian statehood nationhood self-determination you've seen the dissipation and you've seen the uh uh undermining of even the talk even the talk of a Palestinian State over the last years and therefore this is an opportunity to remind everybody there is no way around this neck there is no way around this Israel's occupation has got to end a Palestinian Sovereign independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital has got to be established the millions of Palestinian refugees have non-negotiable rights to return to their homes properties lands and of course uh Israel has got to respect uh all these rights now how do we do so by one simple word equal application of international law in the immediate future stivity in the immediate future when we're talking about what's about to happen and what needs to happen to to stop it getting worse we're hearing that Egypt is involved in some small way IM mediation in trying to uh get people those some of those taken back home what about the broader mediation that is required here to stop this before it gets as bad as it looks like it's going to get well we need three steps the first step is immediate session of hostility by by Israel and all these warnings and that's why we together with our Arab brothers and sisters called for a security Council uh uh meeting so the security Council takes its responsibility that's why it's there and was established uh to resolve conflicts and to enforce international law the second thing Israel needs to be reminded by the International Community that even as an occupying power it has responsibilities absolute clear responsibilities the first is to the protection of civilians under the military occupation not targeting them as we have seen in the last few hours in Gaza destroying uh total residential compounds so the application of international law until we get to the third stage when the world comes not just the US everyone comes like all other conflicts and resolve it based on the global consensus enough of considering Israel you know the exception of playing political footballing as I had yesterday in Washington of competing politicians in the UK and Europe who supports Israel more of this dehumanization of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian struggle and every interview I've done in the last day or two there is such an attempt to B us in a certain Corner uh that uh we are the ones who should be condemned we are the ones who always the instigator when in fact Nick the military occupation the colonization the apartheid is the only instigator of of violence is the only instigator of all the reactions that you have seen so this is an opportunity to call a spade a spade this is an opportunity to focus on the root causes and this is not an opportunity just to B bandages because this is what the world has been doing managing the conflict rather than resolving it palestin ambassador to the United Kingdom appreciate your time thank you
