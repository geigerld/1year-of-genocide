I'm joined Now by UNICEF spokesperson James Elder he joins me from Geneva James has recently returned from gas and now before we speak to him I want to play out now a video now this was posted on social media by James when he was in Gaza let's watch it I feel like I'm running out of ways to describe the horrors hitting children here I feel like I'm almost failing in my ability to convey the endless killing of Children Here a and so perhaps if the world could see those at risk meet HED and Hannah please meet them see them and pray that they are all alive in a few days time all right James you said perhaps if the world can see them are you disappointed in how the world has responded since seeing them The Killing go goes on oh of course I think anyone anyone who who has watched and listened and seen is has had their heartbroken whether they're in Gaza and have have witnessed it firsthand to see to smell to hear the cries of children to watch a mother a mother another mother watch as as they as they farewell their child as their child dies I think a huge number of people around the world their hearts have opened to the immense unparalleled unparalled I your pardon unparalleled suffering to children but we we must still talk about those who have the power we must still talk about those who have the power to finally influence a ceasefire and to to to put a stop to what has been a merciless merciless attack on children when when UNICEF C talks about it being a war on children we don't use those words lightly this is because 40% of those killed have been children and we don't see those numbers and conflicts there is something deeply wrong about that Sammy and what's wrong there is the the indiscriminate the the merciless attacks and you listen to the authorities they're unmoved by the Numbers they they they're absolutely indifferent to the numbers of children killed and we see that with proportionality that an entire apartment block one after the other after the other is destroyed family after family as I'm sure you've shown in your programs I met so many pal Ians recently who now no longer bunker down with the whole family they split the family in in halves in different places hoping that if a if another bombardment hits somewhere half of the family survives yes it is mindboggling to me and entirely disheartening that those in power have not heard this and if not from a principled moral point of view have not heard it to understand the damage it is doing to the region and to the world and how far we are moving from peace and how polarization is taking over James of course we have to remember Israeli children have been caught in this conflict as well particularly in the attacks of October the 7th but the sense that I get when I speak to humanitarian workers to Aid agency officials repeatedly is that what's happening in Gaza is something unprecedented something even journalists telling me for decades I've worked in War Z I've never seen anything like this why explain this to the world yeah you give me a chill when you say that Sammy and you're right and every moment we get a chance get the those Israeli children who somewhere underground with our men get them back to their families they should you know their children stop the torment of yes when journalists myself talk about unprecedented yes it is both because 40% of children have been killed both because it's the most ridiculous number in a short space of time both because more un workers have been killed in this conflict this war that in the United Nations history and then you have this immense darkness that shows the utter indifference today is the first time when I'm on the phone talking to colleagues and friends and health workers in the Gaza Strip that that a significant number of people now if they can only prioritize one concern for quite a number Sammy it is no longer the 15 bombardment 200 lb bombs whatever they are raining down from the sky it's the lack of water you now have this idea of dehydration people dying being a real threat I spoke to someone today whose mother has not had clean water for in a day and they three-year-old have not had clean water for a day we are going to start seeing not just disease outbreaks we already have the perfect storm but we're going to see people dying of dehydration so when we have these safe spaces that are so designated there's such a cynical cynical world word not once have I ever heard any implication from those people talking about safe spaces to even imply that there would be what they are legally and morally legally obliged to water medicine food protection there is not a a scar of interest and not a drop of water and not a toilet to be seen for hundreds of thousands of people in in neighborhoods on the streets um in Dusty fields in in broken buildings nothing and that to me speaks to the the the coldness and the callousness and and those those authorities being absolutely unmoved by the death of children and women and that on a scale in the size of the Gaza when you have such a density and now another million people having moved to the South 1.8 displaced when you have that mindset this emotional anger out outrage to civilians in Gaza that's why you hear these things of unprecedent Ed because the loss of life and the devastation and the trauma is utterly unprecedented James not only in terms of the death and destruction but also the situation in which Aid agencies feel they are frozen they can't act we just heard from Martin Griffith saying basically our humanitarian operations our humanitarian program is no longer functioning I mean how unprecedented is that that there's not even a safe not a not only no safe area for kids to go to but no help to come to them thank you and remembering that as the occupying power this again is Israel's responsibility Sammy if there were no bombs if we had not seen whatever grotesque historic number of bombardments and artillery artillery on the children and their families in Gaza what we have now just by the fence of 60% of homes being destroyed destroyed and the adolescent girls having to Quee 5 hours for a toilet in a shelter now they're not in shelters they're on a Dusty strip somewhere the threat of disease already we have 30 times rates of diarrhea for children this would be the highest level humanitarian crisis that the UN would designate in its systems we have that and we have this unrelenting vicious bombardment and so we and we do not have we do not have aid supplies going in you know we so the restrictions on Aid you know for me as a humanitarian very frequently when I'm in hospitals my role in a way is to Bear witness and try then at the highest levels to explain to bring a human face to the to the to the people to share the stories of of a you know young guy just for those who don't understand what's stopping you from going in for your teams going into Gaza aside of obviously the obvious danger of bombings when you talk about restrictions right now yeah right now grow restrictions on the number of trucks that come in as you heard the the simple one the one entry point um not being allowed to access the north restricted from accessing the North and then the South yes we continue to function in the South we continue to function in the South but not at any scale and we must be honest about that and to think that it could possibly be at that scale when as you know we've said many times before the atrocity of 7th of October 500 trucks a day 500 commercial then for two months 50 none 20 so it's not enough it's not enough and we are going to see people dying of dehydration and disease whilst they get bombarded a very chillig warning there but thank you so much James Elder thank you
