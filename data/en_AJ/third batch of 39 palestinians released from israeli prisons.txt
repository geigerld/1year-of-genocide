this is rala where obviously large crowds are waiting for the return of 39 all men some of them teenagers who've been held in Israeli detention who are being released as part of this exchange emotions clearly running High we can go to Nita Ibrahim who's there and rala Nita talk us through what we're seeing and hearing we've just seen Palestinians marching and carrying one prisoner uh freed prisoner on their shoulders and they made their way into the square but now we are waiting for what we believe is the bus that is carrying some of those 39 Palestinians who have been released remember some of them have already been released to Jerusalem and uh the rest are going to be making their way to the occupied West Banks Arafat Square as you can see it's a a a a scene that is emotional that is filled with feelings of Victory amongst many Palestinians but it's not uh short on anyone to say that they remember the sacrifices that are taking place in Gaza not just the killings not just the injury not just the bombing of homes but the displacement of Palestinians outside of their homes this is a fear many Palestinians have that Israel has been systematically kicking Palestinians out of their homes in the north of Gaza and then it's going to Corner them in the South later on to kind of push them away uh outside of the besieged Gaza Strip we are seeing um you know because of this traffic that we've been seeing also yesterday the buses took a while to be able to get to the Final Destination that is uh planned for uh uh the main let's call it a celebration but we're seeing more movement we're seeing more Palestinians it could be and I'm not sure it could be that if you can zoom in a little bit Zakaria that they've released some of those prisoners uh from the buses they've let them off of the buses I mean and then they're going to make their way here in like a protest form with Palestinians carrying the free prisoners with them again it's a it's a situation that is unfolding as we are looking but we are seeing Flags we are seeing cars carrying Palestinian Flags we've seen uh mostly fat Flags here today unlike the other days we can we can see neita we can see on our screens the images that you are talking about and we can see now the bus um arriving into the square or area where you are not that far away from that uh exchange happening of course under the oaces of the International Red Cross give us a sense of who is on board who is involved in being released from Israeli jails we know 39 we know many of them well all of them are male anything else yeah we know that three female prisoners whose name have made it to the list that Israel published of potential Palestinians who are going to be released but uh the the Palestinian female prisoners uh have been 30 of them have been released so we have three left uh from the list we have other women of course but most of those have been detained after October the 7th um we just spoke to a father Mahmud from Bethlehem he was was telling us that his son had a year and a half uh left on his already one year and a half sentence but now he's here to uh receive him earlier than planned we've also heard the father uh Abdullah ma telling us passionately really and emotionally about his son a 17-year-old who's been behind bars for six months and we've been hearing very difficult testimonies from pales Ians who have been released after October 7th and they were saying not only has it been mistreatment not only has it been a Revenge by the Israeli forces against those prisoners we've also heard from women saying that they couldn't get even their basic needs that they've used to get them and buy them so you can imagine this detension they've also have been cut off from the rest of the world because you know you have to remember that those Palestinian prisoners have been in and out when we talk about the general population since 1967 in Israeli jails sometimes you'd see them waving and and and starting a wave of protests to achieve certain demands and the fact that some prisoners have TVs inside the prison that they can watch and see certain channels not everything but they can watch the news this has been considered an achievement by the prisoners movement that only have been able to uh happen because they've led a lot of protests inside prison including hunger strikes Collective hunger strikes so for Palestinians they believe that those are achievements that they've gotten now that that they've been taken away from Palestinians post October 7th and just another point to add when we talk to human rights organization they tell us that the conviction rate in Israeli prisons is very very High amounting to 97% or more so what happens with these Palestinians to avoid long trials they accept the plea deal even if it's not what Israel accuses them of doing so they'll say you threw rocks against Israeli forces so you can either stay in lengthy and lengthy courts or you could be detained uh you could uh be detained for a a shorter period and pay are fine so Palestinians choose the later why because it saves them a little bit of prison time n we will come back to you to cover these unfolding events there in rala
