so this Netanyahu post war plan for Gaza the Americans have already said they think it's a bad idea for Israel to reoccupy the Gaza Strip and and have asked for clarification reportedly does this plan in your view is it a clear plan and and why do you think is making this statement now I think that he's making this statement because he knows that his political life is in Jeopardy but before uh the bombing attack on October the 7th netanyahu's holding rates were very very very low with thousands tens of thousands of Israelis coming out and protesting against him now we see that these numbers while they've gotten lower people are definitively blaming netan for uh for all of this and as a result he knows that his political future will come to an end the minute that there is a ceasefire and this is why he's pushing to have this as long as possible the other reason of course is because he is part of the ultra right-wing fascist group um the fascist block and the ultra right-wing inside his government has been pushing him to reestablish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip so you have the combination of these two things of him losing his Coalition if he doesn't remain and as well losing his own political life and potentially go to prison um if he if he doesn't leave the Gaza Strip right and so this is why he's doing it at at this point right and one of his ministers we heard one of his ministers talk about this being gaza's NABA how how worrying is that to you well this isn't it's not just him most of the Israeli leaders have been not only expressing it but we've seen what plans that they have they've expressed things like that they want to flatten Gaza they've said that this is a question of not accuracy but as much damage as possible we've heard them say that Gau is going to be smaller in size and we've heard them talk about expelling Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula we've even heard the so-called leftwing talk about other countries taking in Palestinians as well so this is obviously very Troublesome the problem is is that nobody within the International Community is actually listening to what the Israeli leaders are saying very clearly yeah and some in the International Community are still talking about the the the two-state uh solution being revived in some quarters the supporters of Israel it seems that that two idea of a two-state solution is more distant than ever it's the question is Palestinian freedom and this is where people need to be working in the aftermath of Israel stopping its genocide stopping its ethnic cleansing it's time for the world to realize that this is the result of 75 years of ethnic cleansing and if they really want to see peace then Palestinians need to have their freedom this is where efforts need to be put after we secure Israel's stopping of the bombing campaign what Israel's done is completely ille legal and it remains illegal no despite their attempts to try to make it legal it's not this is where our energy must be focused first to stop the bombing second to make sure that Palestinians are free and so what does that does that Palestinian Freedom look like uh you know what are the options today is it is it you know equal rights for all within the same state like the case of South Africa for example is that is that feasible today well F it's it's up to Palestinians to decide um and this is where we have as Palestinians have to put make our voices heard and and known um it's no longer up to the International Community it's no longer up to a false negotiations process it's time for the world to listen to Palestinians hear what they want and put into place a system that undoes the system of apartheid that Israel has created for 75 years it's time for Palestinians to finally be free it you say it's up to Palestinian Diana to decide what what role for palestin inan leaders what role for the Palestinian Authority specifically we heard Arab leaders in Riyad yesterday say that the Palestinian Authority is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people is it though and and can it represent Palestinian people as a whole in its current configuration actually at this point in time so it's the Palestine Liberation Organization that is the representative but at this time it's very difficult for people to say that they are the the sole voice because so many Palestinian factions are not included in the PLO but but beyond that the importance is that right now what the US is trying to do is they're trying to put in a pseudo Palestinian government one that they like into the Gaza Strip and I can I can tell you that there's going to be no Palestinian leader that wants to be seen as entering the Gaza Strip on the back of an Israeli bulldozer on the back of an Israeli tank that's just simply not going to happen but more importantly this is the same Palestinian Authority part that on October the 6th that the United States had been had been maligning that they had effectively turned into Persona n grada so it's like they pull out this puppet when they want it and then put it away when they don't want it this is where I mean what this is what I mean when I say it's up for Palestinians to decide we need to have our own internal elections we need to decide what shape and form it is of our freedom that is going to look like but first and foremost the bombing needs to end and this apartheid system must come to an end
