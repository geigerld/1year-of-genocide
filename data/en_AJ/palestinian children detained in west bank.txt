it started out as a normal day but as is often the case in the occupied West Bank it turned into a bloody one we were happy it was a good day then our car broke down we got out to see what was wrong the soldiers thought we were going to throw stones they started shooting at us aham took three bullets in his right arm the abdomen and his left foot but that was only his latest brush with the Israeli Army just a few months ago aan and his brother wadia were detained during a night raid their experience similar to this one in a video released by bit Salem an Israeli Human Rights group a father tells his son to wake up don't be scared the Army is here he says aim and Ria were taken away in front of their helpless parents it was petrifying we were both in a 1 square meter cell we couldn't lay down to go to sleep we were tied up in a chair we asked for water they said no water and no toilet unless we admitted our crime I kept on telling them we didn't do anything there are currently more than 180 miners held in Israeli jails many for as little as throwing stones at soldiers or like this 13-year-old child who was arrested for picking wild herbs near a settlement many of the detes are taken to prisons inside Israel parents need to apply for a visitation permit through the Red Cross and that could take up to 3 months in the meantime the minor is cut off from the world on average 800 Palestinian miners are held in military detention each year Israel says it's on security grounds the age of criminal responsibility in the occupied territory is 12 that doesn't apply to settlers who carry out attacks on Palestinians Palestinian children are potential terrorist so this is the mentality by which the Israeli officials are treating uh Palestinian children so first of all uh they convinced themselves that they are treating uh or dealing with potential terrorist and uh behaving accordingly 15-year-old Ahmed alas still Shivers when he remembers his ordeal he was on his way to have a haircut in heon when Israeli soldiers pounced on him just a few weeks ago at first they didn't do anything but then they taunted us tied my hands blindfolded me made me sit on a chair each time I tried to sleep they would pour water on me I was always thinking about my parents what will happen to them if they were to keep me here and I was really Wired from my mom and dad Ahmed was released after 2 weeks but like many children who face military courts and prisons it's an experience that will have an impact on him for the rest of his life ABD Hamid Al jazer in the occupied West Bank
