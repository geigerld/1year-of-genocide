Alon pinkos is a former Israeli Diplomat he was Ambassador and Consul general of Israel in New York he joins us from Tel Aviv a very warm welcome to aler so I'm not sure if you heard what Mustafa bouti the uh Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative had to say there but under no Illusions in his mind the ultimate goal of Israel is to completely occupy and Annex of course the occupied West Bank do Israelis share that view um no no I you know we could we could look at the border I heard what Mustafa bti said NE and I and I happen to agree with much of what he had said but I don't think there's any plan to uh um to Annex uh wide SWAT of the uh of the West Bank only because Israel is too afraid to do so and has been very reluctant to do so for many many years that being established um and while a military operation could be somehow I'm not familiar with the exact details could be justified on grounds of uh um actionable intelligence in terms of counterterrorism the political uh um um angle the political aspect is far more important and this is where I agree with Mr barouti um this is this government is intent on weakening the Palestinian Authority if you recall NE just a few months ago even though everyone stopped talking about it there was there was talk of a post-war Gaza plan that would include the Palestinian Authority extending its governance to the West Bank now that talk has stopped for some reason because is apart from um other reasons Israel was recalcitrant and defiant and engaging it but now with this operation Israel is weakening the Palestinian Authority to the point that there's no there's not going to be anyone to negotiate with and that is the grand plan that the government has when you say that uh Israel is afraid to Annex the occupied West Bank who or what are they afraid of you talking about the United States here well no no no no well first there's something very simple you know between the Jordan River on the East and the Mediterranean uh Sea on the west there are roughly 15 million people and the uh um the distribution is 50% Israeli Jews 50% Palestinian Arabs you take take a percentage off here and there it doesn't matter in terms of demographics it's an equilibrium that means that if Israel an next territories with population not only is it illegal from an international point of view let's assume that Israel is uh not worried and not concerned by that uh um aspect but in terms of of of governance uh uh what are you going to do are you going to INF franchise the Palestinians that's fine that's okay um that means a one by National State uh the chances of that are working are lower than zero just look at Yugoslavia um is Israel going to disenfranchise the Palestinians well then you have a fullblown apite state something which I don't think exists now although know that let me jump in there because many Palestinians of course would argue that what we're seeing and what is supported by this right-wing Israeli government is already a form of creeping annexation when it comes to accelerated settlement building well yes I I I I I know that argument I'm familiar with that argument but if you look at the map closely NE you will see that the expansion of settlements which I am not uh um advocating one bit but the expansion of settlements or in the three settlement blocks that even if you go back to the Clinton parameters following Camp David in the year of 2000 uh 24 years ago uh these settlement blocks will be annexed to Israel in in uh according to those parameters according to that plan now I don't know how relevant that plan is today how applicable it is it probably isn't we need to look at different modalities but you're not going to find any modalities if you're weakening the Palestinian Authority into complete dysfunction which is why I understand when people are saying as you just said Neeve that they uh that there's a creeping annexation uh but but it's not real annexation because that has legal uh implications that Israel has not used until now okay I'm very keen to uh cast an eye on what's going on inside Israel on the power play the power dynamics of play at the moment there I mean you recently wrote that Israel's entire political opposition should resign as a form of resistance to Netanyahu is that what you meant by that yeah yeah yeah yeah it's explained in the article itself look uh uh the opposition has been very weak very feeble very uh lethargic U um out of ideas devoid of any creativity what I asked them to do obviously in an article not not that I had any expectations of them actually rising to the occasion is to unilaterally and collectively resign from Parliament that's a constitutional crisis that essentially will bring down the government now you can you can find 57 reasons why it won't happen I I subscribe to all of them but my point is the dynamic right now is that there is an extraordinarily unpopular prime minister the latest poll from yesterday shows that nearly 70% of Israelis want him to resign including including 46% of people who said they had voted for him in in the latest election that was 2022 just two years ago um yet at the same time his his parliamentary blot is is uh pretty stable despite what many including me uh many people thought uh uh that it would crumble it didn't uh you know the uh uh the scent of power intoxicates them too much um but uh that that is why I call for the opposition to do you know a Hail Mary if you will to borrow a Christian term and do something out of the box out of the box I'm sorry out of the ordinary um I don't have any hopes that they will do so but again um Mr netan is doing something uh uh very problematic here very ominous here and that he is creating a situation an environment in which further negotiations with the Palestinians three four five years from now would probably impossible because be impossible because of the uh weakness and the fragility of the Palestinian Authority Alon pigas uh former Israeli Diplomat and ex Ambassador and conso general of Israel in New York it's been uh really good to hear your thoughts and all of
