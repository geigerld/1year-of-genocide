of Despair these families have been displaced multiple times and now that they may well be forced to move again hind Al jaaz two people have been wounded in a stabbing attack at an Israeli checkpoint near occupied East Jerusalem the alleged asant was shot dead by Israeli forces at the scene well the Israeli military then raided the alleged attacker's home in the neighborhood of jabal Al muker in occupied East Jerusalem Israeli Prime Minister Benin Netanyahu was canceled a war cabinet meeting meant to discuss the post-war plan for Gaza he's been facing growing criticism from members of his own cabinet of talks for the day after in Gaza farite members of the ruling Coalition have announced they'll be holding their own meeting in protest over their planned exclusion from the discussions well Alan Fischer joins us live now from occupied East Jerusalem Alan so this Israeli War cabinet meeting was cancelled at very short notice what is this telling us Alan okay let let's remind ourselves there's a war cabinet Freeman War cabinet there's The Wider security cabinet and then there is the full political cabinet the war cabinet was due to me what would they meant to talk about well the deal that is being discussed with Hamas the Israelis being negotiated by the Egyptians the qataris and the Americans about the exchange of captives in Gaza for prisoners being held in Israeli jails that are Palestinian now that seems relatively uncontroversial and Benjamin Netanyahu told the families of those being held captive in a meeting on Thursday afternoon that negotiations are still ongoing the second thing that was going to be discussed at the war cabinet was what Gaza looks like the day after the war but that's why Benjamin Netanyahu canceled it because one of his political cabinet one of his allies in the coalition government bazel smrc decided that he didn't want that discussion to take place he is very much against the Palestinian Authority having any role in Gaza after the war he's very much against transferring any money to the Palestinian Authority and as the Americans have been urging and so under that pressure Benjamin Netanyahu decided that the war cabinet would not have any discussions about this instead he would leave it to the wider security cabinet which is going to take place we're told on Tuesday but it shows the internal pressure that Benjamin Netanyahu is under he knows that there has to be a plan drawn up for Gaza the day after he's under pressure from internal security service from the the the uh Israeli Army and also from the Americans to have a plan in place but he canceled it because he was worried that it could fracture his Coalition could fracture his government and would mean that his position as prime minister would be at risk and Alan away from those political divisions what more details are now emerging about that stabbing incident in Jerusalem uh this happened uh last night a young 23-year-old Palestinian man allegedly stabbed two Israeli police officers stroke Army at a checkpoint at jabel muker which is on the edge of uh occupied East Jerusalem uh one of those who was stabbed is in a serious condition in hospital the other one was wounded the 23-year-old man was shot dead at the scene uh the Israeli Army then went to the house and arrested the mother the father and the sister of the young man now they'll be held for questioning essentially asking them did you know about this what did you know about this and if you did know about it why didn't you tell us more often than not they're completely in the dark as well the house was ransacked but this is a controversial policy because essentially this is seen as collective punishment for the family because of what someone did there is also the possibility that the house might be demolished that will be a decision taken by the courts but again this is the idea of collective punishment which has been criticized by many human rights organizations that if someone in your family does something wrong then the whole family suffers as well it's still got to go through the courts as I say but the Israelis take this Collective punishment idea because they believe it acts as a deterrent to stop these sort of attacks but the reality and the evidence proves that it really doesn't all right Alan Fisher live for us there in occupied East Jerusalem Alan thank you meanwhile the Israeli military has continued carrying out overnight raids across the
