20,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israel armed and backed by the US and European allies more fighting nearby to hasbalah in Lebanon and the houthis in Yemen among the groups involved could Israel's war trigger a wider conflict this is Inside [Music] Story hello and welcome to the program I'm Dar abuga Israel's war on Gaza has killed at least 20,000 Palestinians and injured tens of thousands more American and European allies have called for the protection of civilians while simultaneously arming the military bombardment of one of the most densely populated areas in the world as the death toll Rises so too does Regional tension and anger among Israel's opponents so what happens if the Gaza Onslaught continues could it spark a wider war in the region and do the US and its allies have any leverage over the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or does he have their backing regardless of what he does We'll be asking those questions and more of our guests shortly but first Carle takes a look at the possible dangers if Israel's war in Gaza widens into a regional conflict oh my God as bombs rain down on Gaza the reverberations of Israel's war are being felt further a field most recently at Sea with Yemen's houthis targeting ships in the Red Sea in an act of solidarity they say with Palestinians under Israel's Onslaught that's prompted the US to form what it calls a multinational Naval task force to patrol the vital shipping route within the first weeks of its war on Gaza Israeli officials say they were preparing for a possible expansion on multiple fronts Hamas called on Regional Affiliates for support following its October the 7th attacks which killed more than 1,100 Israelis airports in Syria were bombed by Israel it says to twart potential Iranian mobilization efforts there and in neighboring Iraq the only Arab country in the Middle East that's passed legislation Banning normalization with Israel armed groups many backed by Iran pledged their support for Hamas launching attacks on us bases and threatening to go further if Israel continued its War not just on Gaza but also in southern Lebanon crossb attacks and exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Iran back Hezbollah Fighters have increased in recent months Iran has sought to distance itself from accusations it's playing a direct role in the hummus offensive against Israel but it has warned of regional ramifications if Israel continues its military campaign in Gaza members of the gulf cooperation Council have presented more of a united front as the months of War drag on pushing for a ceasefire and humanitarian Aid access through diplomatic means Qatar and Egypt mediators with channels to both Israel and Hamas secured a captive change deal and brief pause in the fighting and despite normalizing relations with Israel through years ago the United Arab Emirates DFT the latest un Security Council resolution on a ceasefire Regional power Saudi Arabia has reportedly put its normalization talks with Israel on hold as a joined calls for lasting truce in Gaza calls that as of now have fallen on deaf ears as the sound sound of bombs continue to resonate across Gaza KY Le Al jazer for Inside Story let's now bring in our guest joining us from New York City is Omar Rahman who's a fellow at the Middle East Council on global Affairs he focuses on Palestine Middle East geopolitics and American foreign policy in the region over in Washington DC we have M pelled who's a human rights activist and author his book The General son journey of an Israeli in Palestine is based on his experiences as the son of a former military governor of the Gaza Strip and joining us from Brussels is Elijah magnier a military and political analyst Who as a former war zone correspondent has covered more than 35 years of conflict in the Middle East and North Africa thanks for your time uh gentlemen good to have you with us on Inside Story Omar Rahman the longer the war in Gaza goes on How likely is it that it Sparks a regional war and I know that this is a broad question but we'll drill down into the details throughout this program sure it certainly it it makes the risk ever present obviously as long as it it's ongoing uh that risk uh stays there stays active uh and anything can kind of kick it off obviously we've seen uh the northern fronts between Israel and Lebanon uh you know active since October 7th and that has the potential to escalate uh at any point uh in recent weeks months um the in in Yemen have have engaged now first firing Rockets uh and now um you know closing the Babin Mund straight to shipping lanes and that has a much broader uh global economic uh ramifications and obviously now the US uh has has um you know put together kind of a coalition a naal coalition which importantly actually uh is not doesn't have any uh Arab states with the exception of bahin which is almost a consolation prize here uh but those other Arab states even though it affects their economies as well uh can you know have not have not engaged uh in that effort and that's kind of important and telling so Omar if there is then a regional war and like you say anything could kick it off does this then by default mean uh more of the US's involvement because right now we understand the US is somewhat involved in what's going on but how how um deep would the US's involvement be if there's a wider escalation yeah the US is a is a party to this conflict uh in many ways uh first of all in its total support for Israel as it's as it's carried out this military campaign uh that includes uh you know arming the Israelis that includes diplomatic cover for the Israelis that includes intelligence sharing with the Israelis uh so in all those particular ways and then also as as you as you mentioned uh you know the US has dispatched carrier fleets to the region so it's engaged militarily somewhat obviously it's not heavily engaged militarily but but it's but it's involved uh and that's a double-edged swort because um you know in one sense it's it's meant deterrence in another sense it's a provocation it also puts military targets more military Targets in the region for others uh to attack and we've seen that uh take place and so you know the US is is definitely engaged um and you know there there's many ways in in which this can affect the region not only in terms of War but uh you know if Israel's intentions is to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip as it appears is the case you know that has effects for border states like Egypt for Jordan if go let okay speaking of Israel's intentions moo I'll come over to you do you think that there is a uh sort of a premeditated intention by Israel to widen this war or or could it just suddenly erupt out of recklessness where do you think the Israeli position is on this y that's a good question but I think we need to broaden the lens I mean we can't just look at this particular um at the particular you know events that began on October the 7th we have to look at the 75 year history of of of Palestine Israel has been engaged in the genocide for 75 years the rest of the world has been silent mostly uh the Arab countries have been neutralized either through destruction as we've seen in Lebanon s in I'm sorry in Libya Syria Iraq and so on or through normalization and Israel is free to do everything it wants it's not only America and the West that is supporting Israel Israel has over 40 diplomatic missions in Africa and we don't see the African States standing up for Palestine or or or anyone else in the world we don't see the bricks Alliance um with maybe the exception of Brazil and South Africa standing with the Palestinians so Israel is really quite free to do everything it wants and there's really nobody in the region that can seriously threaten Israel perhaps the only the only things we're seeing is perhaps the houis uh uh actions are the only ones that are that are showing some responsibility in trying to curb and respond to the genocide that's been going on so granted what's the events that began in October 7th um in which of course you know Palestinians were able to to to come out of this this this prison which is the Gaza the Gaza Strip and and paralyze the state of Israel this is a you know heightening of the savagery that we've seen by Israel perhaps it's worse than anything we've seen in the past but it's not separate from everything that's been going on since the state of Israel was established you're absolutely right I mean the context of all of this MO is is in the occupation but what I want to get to uh today and for the purposes of this discussion is where does Israel stand when it comes to widening this conflict taking it outside of Gaza well is Israel has got more air power than anybody else and so I don't think Israel is is worried about that if anybody if anybody tries to seriously engage with Israel then they will be wiped out just like we've seen in Lebanon over the years we've seen you know Israel is already bombing in Syria and so I I don't think Israel is concerned about that plus the entire world is supporting it they're getting all the weapons that they need so I don't think Israel is worried at all about this and I'll have to also say I don't think there's a strategy behind Israel's actions or a great deal of thinking I think what we're seeing is is is Revenge is just it's just destruction and killing for the sake of Vengeance because Israel was humiliated on October the 7th so I don't think Israel is worried about that as long as it's got it's it's it's able to maintain its military uh you know power it's military superiority over everybody else and like I said the Arab countries have been neutralized so who is there to threaten Israel okay uh Elijah let's bring you in and can you weigh in on this discussion and and you know we've already mentioned uh the the houthis in Yemen and the US now announcing this uh Maritime Coalition do you think that this could spark a regional War it is already enlarging because uh the intervention of Hezbollah from the second day of this conflict and the support of the Iraqi resistance attacking the American bases is sending strong messages to Israel and finally the intervention of Anar H in Yemen is even sending more powerful message to the Israelis and to their allies that this war is no longer contained in the borders of Gaza alone but it is enlarging slowly but surely this is the style of the axis of the resistance never play all the cards and I think Israel is extremely worried about it otherwise would never call for such a force in the Red Sea to come for help uh the American the French and the British would not line up in R sea uh stopping and intercepting the missiles and the drones launched by the houis it will not continue supplying the Israelis with tens of thousands of ammunition it protects Israel at the United Nation by refusing anyc fire it's offered 2,000 delta forces in Israel to support it they have American drones all the support that Israel is getting from day one is because Israel is weak and it doesn't manage on its own to confront multiple front but not only that but even Gaza after 75 days it has occupied the third of Gaza but control zero ground because today there were attacks on T Aviv yesterday again every single day there are attacks on the Israeli occupation forces inside Gaza it means Israel is quite worried about what's happening and how this war is enlarging slowly but surely Elijah can the uh what's happening in in Yemen and the Red Sea can does this uh sort of change the positions of the Israelis or the Americans could we see retaliation against the houthis in Yemen do you think well the yemeni is said already if the Americans and they are fully aware of that retaliate then the whole of Babel Mand will be shut down but it is going to be only limited to Babel Mand because that will be considered a war zone and no commercial marican company will dare to come close to the Red Sea they will all be diverted to Africa and then the hthis will launch their surface to surface missiles doesn't mean they are stronger than the Coalition but they will not be defeated but that means then the war will even enlarge even further because the question is what's going to happen to the straight of homos what's going to happen to the Mediterranean the hit will not be left alone as Gaza is not left left alone okay um speaking of not being left alone ahar rman I mean when we talk about a possible regionalization we're talking and as you were mentioning earlier about the involvement in the US that currently exists and and and could potentially deepen does that then mean uh by default uh the the deeper involvement of Iran I don't know I mean Iran is in a sense playing it safe it's it's kind of playing the strategy it has it has conducted for many years which is used using uh you know non-state actors within the region uh to carry out certain goals to put pressure in various ways so the direct involvement Iran you know I don't know is uncertain now if this if this you know really regionalize uh and there's fullscale war in certain places then I I'm sure Iran will become involved one way or the other I think uh you know it's not just Iran taking action uh but you know the United States Israel taking action against Iran and bringing it you know directly into the conflict itself so I think that is is an everpresent uh possibility and you know we'll see how that plays out uh M would Israel actually be able to fight let's say two fullblown conflicts one obviously the war going on in Gaza and then one one uh on the border with Lebanon if it gets to that point even with the US's backing yes I mean again Israel's got has got air power and the air power is the key I mean granted the ground forces are not as effective uh certainly not not when they they face the hisbah fight ERS in Lebanon or the Palestinians in Gaza but Israel got air power we've seen what Israel has done in Lebanon in the past I mean they caused massive you know millions of refugees total Destruction um and I don't really see who is who is out there that can threaten Israel with with an allout War H made it very clear that this is you know this is a Palestinian issue that it's not going to be a larger a larger wider War I I don't see how Iran can possibly get involved which not they're not going to send troops I mean you know what I mean I don't I don't see I don't see how this is going to happen I think Israel understands this and again Israel has been working very hard for decades to neutralize all of its neighbors either by destruction or normalization and nobody's got the military force that Israel has or again the hardware the capability the the the capability to cause destruction so yes there's a b you know missiles coming from from here missiles coming from there the H in in in Yemen trying to to add to this but a serious threat to Israel I don't I don't I don't see where it's going to come from and again Israel's got the ability to bomb and Destroy entire cities you know and and and again with the full support of the United States the full support of the rest of the world so I don't think Israel is I don't think Israel has a reason to worry about this um the only way that Israel the only thing that Israel does have to worry about and I believe they are worried is on the Diplomatic front is on the public opinion front is the fact that more and more people around the world are standing up for you know to support the Palestinians but in terms of in terms of War Israel I don't I don't see how what where the threat would come from and I'm sure the Israelis can see that as well and I'll say again about Iran you know I don't see how Iran's not going to be sending troops I mean logistically this doesn't really work and again Israel's strategy of neutralizing its neighbors is working very well uh in in in in in allowing it to do what it's doing and at the same time not be threatened by anyone Elijah um look I mean Hassan Nas did say in one of his speeches that events on the ground will dictate uh the group's position and what they do going forward um but for the Israelis having the Americans stationed off the coast of Lebanon right now off the shores of Lebanon uh do you think that they're sending a message to hasbalah in Lebanon absolutely not because the uh Israelis were sending several messages to Lebanon and tobah and hisbah has been retaliating and the Americans are trying with the French to uh create a dialogue where they can persuade hisbah to leave the borders but the problem is that the Americans and the Israelis have a limited knowledge about how hisbah is deployed in south of Lebanon because they are the same people who live in the south of Lebanon who are part of the south of Lebanon that are part of the society who are defending that front and attacking Israel now those who think I don't think the Israeli officials are that uh naive to think that having a superow with the air force that is enough this this is really something in the elementary school it's showed in the military knowledge but if we look at Afghanistan the Americans have the superpower Against The Afghani who has not even one Jet and yet the Americans did not defeat Afghanistan the same came in Lebanon 1982 the Israeli invaded the country and hisbah doesn't have Jets and in the year 2000 it would Barack pull out of Lebanon it was kicked out in 2006 the Israeli had a super power and they had the superiority in Air Force and they did manage to achieve in their objective and without going very far in history in 2023 in Gaza Israel has 700 Jets what the Jets has achieved so far has any of the Hamas member raised a white flag to an Israeli jet this is why they had to send boots on the ground and the solders that are on the ground are attacked and are killed and are suffering High casualty in a tiny little area in a big open concentration camp that was surrounded for all these years and yet managing to stand against what used to be called the most uh powerful Army in the Middle East that was humiliated on the 7th of October and continue to be so in Gaza every single day right um let's move on to uh Ahad for a moment Ahad do you think that the US has a clear plan as to where this war is heading and I'm not here asking you about the day after what happens to Gaza I'm asking about the actual war on the ground do you think the US wants to see a temp ceasefire a permanent ceasefire is is there a strategy well it's made pretty clear that it is uninterested in a ceasefire from Its Behavior at the UN Security Council in terms of vetoing and delaying uh un Security Council resolutions which would have a legal legally binding uh uh effect um at the same time you know obviously the US is is making statements I don't know if it's paying lip service to the civilian casualties and the way that Israel is conducting the war now it's hard to say if that's genuine concern if it's posturing while you know playing interference running interference for the Israelis whether this is some kind of schizophrenic policy in terms of you know Biden in in terms of allout support for Israel While others in his administration are wavering on that front uh it's hard to say but you know the US when where it matters where it counts is arming the Israelis it's financing the Israelis it's providing support for the Israelis on the ground uh as well as uh within the United Nations that's important and it's it's really hard to understand you know the benefit for the United States I think in every possible way this is a disaster for the United States in terms of its national interests in terms of its International standing uh even domestically I mean if you could make the argument that domestically this was helping Biden that would be one thing but his support is at its lowest possible uh and and and several polls are showing that that is also even tied to his uh his response to what's happening in Gaza so on every front uh this is this is a problem for the United States and yet uh it is continuing to to carry on along this path and support Israel um and that is that is very problematic M do you do you think that the US and other allies who are still supporting Israel have any leverage over the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at this point or or does he have their backing regardless of what he does and how he conducts this war well the answer is yes to both I mean they he does have their support right now of course um because this is Israel and Israel has always had the support of the of its allies 110% again going back historically the genocide of of of the Palestinian people going back 75 years you know nobody's ever stood in Israel's way um they have leverage of course they have leverage they could stop this tomorrow they could dismantle they could bring to the complete dismantling of the the apartheid state tomorrow and then the creation of a free Democratic Palestine from The River To The Sea they could have elim they could they could have prevented all these tens of thousands of horrific deaths of Palestinians in Gaza over the last couple of months so of course they have leverage they do have leverage the question the thing is they're not using their leverage rather than using their leverage and I agree this is strategically this is this is a huge blunder because why do you think that they're not using their leverage at this point because there's no reason to I mean there's no the public opinion is not pressuring the elected politicians to do so there's a tradition in the United States and in the west of supporting Israel a tradition that goes back a very long time and is the result of a great deal of effort by the various zionists that groups that that exist that operate in the west so so supporting Israel is something that comes naturally it's not even something people have to think about because it is so so entrenched in in in the culture and the thinking in the west that we must support Israel and so there's no real deep strategic thinking going into this it's almost reflexive I think um and so the there unless there's some serious pressure by constituents that will force elected officials to stand up and and the apartheid state and and this genocide and end this massive brutality against the Palestinian people there's no reason to expect they will use their leverage because again this is part of this is how business is done there's nobody disrupting the business as usual of supporting Israel there's nobody standing up there and presenting the case for Palestine if you will it doesn't exist there's no counterpart to the Israeli efforts to the Israeli lobbies to the various Israeli groups that operate in you know all over all over the United States and in in Europe so until such time that such you know a presence exists there's no reason to expect the United States or the West will use their leverage against Israel um Elijah look it's been described as as a genocide what's going on in Gaza by uh UN Human Rights experts uh but still as mik was just saying uh the US not using its leverage on Israel to stop this war are the Israelis actually achieving any of their strategic military objectives that they set out to do what they have announced they will never achieve but what they did not announce they are trying to achieve it so they said we will defeat Hamas and free all the hostages and the prisoners and the captives whatever so they understood they cannot release anyone without negotiation so that's objective is not going to be achieved and they are asking Qatar to mediate for the release of the prisoners and to uh El Hamas a former prime minister ahud Barat said Hamas is an ideology cannot be defeated this is why the Israelis are doing something completely different that are destroying Gaza so they are making sure that no in no people no Palestinian Christian or Muslim will ever return to the north at least this is where they are at at the moment and they have destroyed all that part now this is where everybody is looking at what's happening there and the behavior of the resistance if it is still on the same Pace because nobody wants to disturb the Palestinian cause and all the people who are supporting Gaza and supporting the Palestinian resistance to defend themselves are making sure that the war is not turning between Israel and Iran or Israel and Hezbollah or Israel and in Iraqis this is why there is a very strong Focus what's happening in Gaza and how far the Israelis are going to continue the destruction and the killing of the children and women but how delicate is the situation Elijah so that you know that turning point that could turn between with the Iraqis or with hasbalah in Lebanon or with the houthis in Yemen how delicate is it at this point it is extremely delicate because the Palestinian cause should not be diverted of course otherwise it will lose the support of the population worldwide so far who is supporting Israel is only the United States and Britain obain to vote in favor of non ceasefire therefore the rest of the world doesn't stand with Israel however it is important not to create a a conflict between Iran and Israel or Hezbollah and Israel but in the name of Gaza in the name of the children and women in Gaza this is exactly what ansar in Yemen have done and this is why they limited their action only to lift The Siege on Gaza so they not fighting in the name of Iran they not fighting in the name of whatever proxies anyone would like to call them they fighting in the name of the Palestinian civilians who are murdered every single day in Gaza by the Israelis all right we'll have to leave it there thank you so much for
