keep secret under the cover of this Research Institute in Oslo the very first negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization of yasar Arafat and Israel took place soon after the peace deal was made Arafat visited the office this is here and in the I think definely in this room so this when it was a large room his chair must have been around where my table is the Oslo Accords Were Meant To End Israel's occupation and eventually lead to a Palestinian state instead the occupation became more entrenched illegal Israeli settlements multiplied and violence increased more people today I think would be of the opinion that it might have done harm um so no we're not proud the historic agreement was signed here in secret at the government guest house after midnight on August the 20th 1993 But as time went on it became clear that the Accord was doomed to fail three decades later peace is further away than ever before but still Norway believes it's possible and learning from its mistakes has now taken a different approach after trying for years to negotiate with its key Ally Israel to abide by the Oslo Accords Norway has decided to focus on the Palestinian side instead and oo 2.0 is an upgrade uh and and and one of the adjustment to make this more relevant in 2024 is that recognition of Palestine happens at an earlier stage that what was originally planned that does not mean that we have an end of the war in sight right now but we because Israel is not on board because isra Israel under this current government uh is uh not on board but Israel is also increasingly isolated uh right now A researcher who has long been critical of the Oslo Accord says Norway's recognition of Palestine is a big shift intention from the Norwegian side and from the other European countries is to send a strong signal to the world to Israel to the Americans that look we need to solve this conflict peacefully and a two-state solution is the only bad solution we actually do have among all the other even worse one of Europe's Most sparsely populated countries trying to solve one of the world's most complicated conflicts for now Norway hopes more countries in Europe will follow it and recognize Palestinian statehood as well step fast in alzer Oslo make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
