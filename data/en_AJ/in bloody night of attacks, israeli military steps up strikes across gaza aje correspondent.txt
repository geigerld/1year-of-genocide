at least 30 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since the early hours of Tuesday Morning an Israeli air strike on Al magazi refugee camp in central Gaza killed five Palestinians three children are among the dead I speak to Tark abum he joins us from De alala in central Gaza T so more deadly attacks overnight in Gaza one of the attacks killed the sister of hamas's political leader isal hania what more can you tell us yes that's why this attack in fact was carried out in a shti refugee camp at the northern part of the Gaza STP now we could clearly observe that within the past couple of days and within the past even 24 hours that the Israeli military has been focusing on a refugee camp targeting residential buildings and other night strikes also have bounded one of the evacuation centers there Amed at least 13 Palestinians until now have been recorded killed after the evacuation Center alongside the two residential buildings were targeted in Gaza City but even that uh we have also getting some confirmation that at least six members of hania's family were killed in that attack as a part of the Israeli ongoing upscaling military operations in the northern part of the territory but the Grim reality is not not only a shti refugee camp that was targeted in the course of the past 24 hours but earlier this morning at least three Palestinians have been targeted directly by a drone attack attack in alw Street Central Gaza City they have been immediately killed and being transferred later for the Baptist Hospital to be prepared for burial while in the central part of the Gaza Strip we can see that Al magazi was targeted intensively by the Israeli fighter jets as a residential building was completely destroyed five Palestinians so far being killed as the uh Palestinian uh Rescuers managed to recover a number of children from under the remnant of that destroyed house while in the Sou part of Gaza Israel is targeting also citizens in kanun city or at least Ting so far being killed but what we have been really discovering and observing that Israel is chasing Palestinians in areas that they were designated to be safe areas and even in the north of this strip we can continue to hear from locals that they were escaping to the west of Gaza as they have been told by the Israeli Army and now the vast majority of these attacks are in the Western portion of the city there it means that the Israeli Army is trying to destroy all means of Life there ammed that recently in ASAT refugee camp in particular a number of Palestinian Volunteers started to uh fix and reer water pipes that were broken into the Israeli due to the Israeli bombardment alongside they started to partially remove rles from the destroyed roads in order to facilitate Mobility for civilians so generally what Israel is doing is destroying and attacking Palestinians who are trying to uh recall scenes of normality PR October the 7th as till now at least 30 Palestinians have been killed so far due to the Israel unrelenting circle of attacks on the cross of the Gaza Strip okay thank you for that TK Abu AUM there for us in Dar Al Bala in central Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
