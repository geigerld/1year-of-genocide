well the French President Emanuel macron is hosting world leaders and heads of Aid groups to discuss getting humanitarian help to people in Gaza uh these are live pictures uh from the scene as that conference is set to get underway the talks will address mobilizing funding and emergency assistance delegates will also discuss how to set up supply lines for essential resources and that includes of course water it includes Fuel and it includes El electricity you can see French president Emmanuel macron shaking the hands of the attending delegates let's go to Natasha Butler who joins us from the lissy palace so Natasha first start what are some of the aims and ideas being discussed at this conference well the delegates are still arriving we understand amongst them representatives of the Palestinian Authority Israel not invited but the uh Lis says that they will certainly be brief on the outcomes of this conference a conference that aims as you said to look at ways to uh provide Palestinian civilians with humanitarian Aid things like food things like uh water electricity uh medicine look at ways also to get that Aid in and uh evacuate some of the most uh injured people one of the ideas that's being looked at is something that was proposed by Cyprus which is the closest EU member state to Gaza and that would be a maritime Corridor set up a humanitarian Corridor that would use the sea in order to get Aid in Via Cyprus uh to Gaza and evacuate some of the were most wounded of course that is extremely tricky uh Gaza does not have at this stage the sort of Port infrastructure that would be needed there are also concerns that Israel would want to check all that Aid that is uh coming in so there are a number of concerns about how that would actually work in reality but those are some of the things that are being discussed as well as things like uh Maritime floating in hospitals France is reportedly preparing a ship in order to send to the region France will also be repeating calls for a humanitarian Seas far how does that Mes in with the other nations sir that's right France calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire uh and it is expected that those at this conference uh will do the same and we're hearing more and more of those sorts of calls from uh European Union countries calling for a humanitarian foruse because of course whatever happens at a conference like this whatever ideas or proposals are put forward and discussed they will be useless unless there is a a pause in the fighting to allow Aid to go in to allow people uh to get out if needed so uh that's why France is repeating this call and we're expecting to hear that as well as and I said this grow momentum amongst many uh EU member states uh for a humanitarian pause we even heard uh on uh Wednesday St the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister talked also about the idea of proposing sanctions against Israel for its bombing of Gaza but for now what we're not hearing from the majority of EU States is a call for a ceasefire uh countries like France and Germany still very much saying that Israel has a right uh to defend itself but all of this must be done in the context of respecting International humanitarian law time of course is of the essence right now Natasha they will be disc mobilizing funding and emergency assistance and so forth uh but even then it's still going to take a fair bit of time to for that Aid to arrive within G well that's right and I mean even if you uh look at something uh as I mentioned before you know France is preparing uh reportedly a helicopter ship to send to the region that would have medical facilities on board doctors that kind of thing uh and Medical Aid but we understand that that would take 10 days to reach the area and of course every day every minute counts as we've seen as people are there suffering on the ground uh in Gaza civilians of course going through uh such a terrible and deadly time so all of that is going to take time but this is the problem with these conferences it is a lot of talk it is a lot of discussion but what people uh need is action and they need it now Natasha thanks for that let's listen in because uh the French President speak was Hamas is responsible for putting many Palestinians in dangers as we speak the gazans are suffering more than 1 million have been displaced thousands injured and killed in addition to the the suffering of the Gans the suffering of Palestinians elsewhere also doubled life each life is valuable we do not have any dual standards in in the face of terrorism Israel is obligated not only to defend itself but also to protect their people and all the democracies in the world have the duty to protect civilians fighting against terrorism cannot go without rules we all realize that we cannot succumb to violence or abandon our values however weave we have shared values and common virtues that dictate we must attend to the civilians and the humanitarian situation in Gaza civilians must be protected and this is imperative it is not negotiable it is an immediate imperative and on the long run it is a key factor in our fight against terrorism the situation today is dire and it is is deteriorating every passing day to begin with we must work towards protecting the civilians that's why quick and Swift Delivery Aid is a must also we should work towards achieving a ceas fire it is possible we should allow and provide a safe Corridor for humanitarian teams for the guance and we hope that this conference will be a factor in achieving this result we must arrive at an Initiative for peace and Security in the Middle East this begins with the humanitarian aspect which we will today reach some tangible measures coupled with the security aspect together we were able to stand up to alqa and other terrorist organizations and no one can deny that Hamas represents threat to all that's why we should drain their financial sources and we also impose sanctions on those responsible for the October 7th assault we should also work to prevent other groups from joining Hamas in this path or benefit by their financing resources that's why we should start coordination the PE security aspect is significant it should it requires meticulous coordination between intelligence apparatuses among all of us that's a French president Emanuel macron uh at the meeting of Aid groups and world leaders and heads of Aid groups to discuss humanitarian help in Gaza saying that democracies of the world have a duty to protect civilians and civilians uh must be protected this is not negotiable said the French President he said the situation is dire and deteriorating every day uh we must work towards the ceasefire said Emanuel macron to provide a humanitarian Corridor we need an Initiative for peace and security so that is French president Emanuel macron
