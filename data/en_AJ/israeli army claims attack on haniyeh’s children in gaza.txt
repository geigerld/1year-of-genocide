we begin with breaking news out of Northern Gaza where Israel has assassinated three sons and three grandchildren of hamas's political leader several members of is Han's family were traveling in the camp when their vehicle was hit the Israeli military has confirmed it carried out the strike and says hania's three sons were Hamas operatives speaking to Al jazer hania said the killings would only Harden hamas's resolve he also said it would not affect the group demands in ceasefire negotiations they believe that if they kill or assassinate leaders all their next of kin that we will abandon our people that we will abandon our resistance they are mistaken this Noble blood that is spilled including my own children will harden our resolve make us more defiant more adamant to continue to march on this road the road of struggle and resistance until we win our freedom and the lawful rights of the Palestinian peoples are restored all right we'll cross over to Gaza and speak to our correspondent hanni Mahmud who has the very latest for us so hanni what more do we know about what happened yes Daren will in addition to the ongoing air strikes for the past couple hours the Israeli military uh put published a statement that claiming responsibility of the assassination of the three sons of Hamas political leader along with their children those are the grandchildren of is Hanah the political leader of Hamas now this contrary to what we know so far what we learned since the attack that these uh the three sons of Hamas leader and and their children were in their vehicle they were on their way to visit family members today marks the first day ofid after Ramadan and it's the Traditions across the grip of getting it together some form of social Gathering between family members and relatives uh when the attack happened that it struck their vehicle at least two missiles were fired by a drone uh and paramedics and civil defense on the ground describe horrific scene at the moment they were pulling out bodies from uh the car that looked pretty much incinerated and the bodies inside uh the car were also incinerated the statement published by the Israeli military joint statement between the isra military and the internal security uh talk about that they were uh targeted in the central area of the Gaza Strip and that's compared to what we know from the confirmed report they were targeted in the Northern Western part of Gaza City that's a Shad refugee camp it's different than what uh what the Israeli military uh talking about also the statement Goes On by describing the attacks happen at the time that these uh people were or the the three people were conducting conducting terrorist acts contrary to what we know also so far as they were in their vehicle visiting family members uh on the first day uh of theid okay hany thank you for that update from raah well let's find out more about what the Israelis had to say about this and bring in Rory Chalin who's joining us from occupied East Jerusalem so now there is confirmation uh Rory from Israel tell us more yeah the confirmation came in the last hour and it's come from a joint statement by the military and shinb which is the internal intelligence agency and what this statement says is that the IDF and the ISA that is shinb eliminated three Hamas military Wing operatives in the central Gaza Strip now the strike was directed uh by military and shinb intelligence and it was carried out by Israeli aircraft it says that the three men that were taken out in this strike were Amir hinia a cell commander in the Hamas military Wing Muhammad Han a military operative in Hamas and ham Han also a military operative in Hamas this is all according to uh the IDF the the Israeli military and it says that they are the sons of is hir the chairman of hamas's political Bureau It also says that it's aware of claim that other relatives of ishia were killed in this strike perhaps also a minor and the Israeli military says it has not verified that information at the moment so that's the kind of dry official language of the military and the intelligence Services I'll bring you a couple of other reactions as well from different sides of the political Spectrum first of all we've got y Golan who is uh a military man former military man the former Israeli military Deputy Chief of staff but is critical of the government at the moment he says that however Justified and appropriate this strike may be it points to a lack of political wisdom in regards to the timing chosen carrying out such dramatic actions on the eve of a possible deal for the release of the abductees constitutes another serious layer in their Lawless lawlessness by that he means uh the government another response here different very much to that one though this is from uh of the connected Alma Cohen who's far right he's part of itar benav the National Security Minister's party and he simply says is ID Mubarak you are next in line okay Rory thank you thank you for that update from occupi East Jerusalem well we can now speak to Bas Naim who's a senior member of hamas's political Bureau he's joining us on the phone Mr Naim thanks for your time with us on Al jazer so the Israelis have confirmed that they indeed were behind uh this assassination what do you think the message that Israel is trying to send out unto whom thank you very much first of all I have to emphasize one point before responding to your question that uh such actions cannot be uh taken or done uh except by someone who is deranged uh mentally uh it is not these are not the actions of a civilized state or civilized Army uh if they think that they are negotiating with us uh through killing our children or our wives after failing to achieve any of their goals by the tanks and by the a strikes or around the table the negotiations table they are delusional and uh we guarant we we uh guarantee or we emphasize that they will not achieve any of their goals uh by such uh horrific crimes what what can you say about the timing of this not only is it the first day of Reid but also as you mentioned the ceasefire negotiations are ongoing first of all I have to emphasize the information we have that these the three young uh civilians the three young men the sons of and three or four of his grandchildren are killed in a car in the uh North Western part of Gaza City in the refugee in the beach refugee camp while they were visiting their relatives because of the first day of uh second uh yes we know that Netanyahu from the beginning he was uh doing the maximum to block or to undermine any chance to reach a ceasefire agreement and uh after he has failed along the last few weeks to uh to uh to spoil the negotiations and he is under pressure from the Americans and from the International Community and from the internal uh Israeli Society he is now using all the other dirty tools by killing our children our wives by uh assassinating leaders or some people in Damascus in Lebanon he is insisting on undermining any chance to reach a CE Fair agreement but from your end from hamas's end does this affect the negotiation process at all does it change or does it Harden hamas's position look it is not easy to lose uh the son or the grandson or the grandchildren it is not uh it is not une easy news to hear such uh uh news but uh at the same time our children our wives our houses are not more uh precious or expensive uh than 3,000 30,000 or 35,000 uh women and children and innocent men of our people who has been killed by the Israelis along the last six months therefore yes it is very painful it is um it is not easy to accept or to hear such news but at the same time we are insisting on uh negotiating to achieve a ceasefire which can end this aggression this genocid against our people but at the same time yes it it will be taken in consideration such escalation what do you mean uh taken into consideration what does that mean because we are still studying uh the uh reply to reply to the last proposal received from the mediators which is in total is not acceptable because it doesn't respond to any of our demands which is the total ceas fire total withdrawal of the forces from the Gaza Strip and the free movement of our people who has been displaced along the last six months and they return back to their homes and to launch a huge and serious uh operation of Aid relief and reconstruction um until now we didn't we haven't received any serious uh answers uh nothing in the in the last uh proposal is talking about a seir uh nothing is talking about to withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and even the return back of our people to their houses is under the control of the Israeli forces on the ground Mr Naim President Biden just um about half an hour or so giving a press conference said that it is up to uh Hamas Hamas needs to move on the ceasefire proposal so what's your response to that I I think we have uh responded three weeks or four weeks ago to the uh bar to proposal and the Americans themselves have said that it was rational and very constructive and we can build on this uh unfortunately what what we have received as a response from the Israelis again it doesn't uh it it doesn't respond to the main demands of the movement which is looking for a permanent sustainable Seas fair and for the total withdrawal of the forces we cannot accept to sign by by our own hands the reincubation of the Gaza Strip and to keep two million Palestinian displaced from their houses and to keep our people under the threat of relaunching again uh the aggression after ending the temporary pause or a temporary because what they have presented to us now is talking only about a temporary ceas or a temporary POS which means that thees have the right after after the end of these days to relaunch their aggression again I think no Palestinian can accept such such a deal okay just a final question for you and so so where do things stand right now with the ceasefire negotiations uh again I I as as I said we are now studying uh the last proposal we will reply to this proposal in details after consultation in the leadership uh but again we are insisting on our demands which is again we we are not talking about you big demands we are talking about expected demands of negotiations to achieve a ceas fair when we when we are talking about a ceas fair it means that at the end we will reach a ceas fair a lasting sustainable SE fair and the withdrawal of the forces from the ground and by the way the return of the people they displace people who when they uh return to their houses this is the expected result of any such of any negotiations therefore we they should not consider it as a gesture from the Israelis that they are allowing our people to go back to their houses this is the expected result of any such negotiations okay uh thank you Mr Bass Naim we thank you for joining us on Al jaaz pleas make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
