Suddenly, if something happened to me, it happened to us. I couldn't find anything. The stones were in my water. I couldn't breathe or speak. The girl was yelling at me and I was falling into [music] Ida. I put my hands in something and looked for my mother's turnips. The rent was all gone from me, and it was all from me. I would say, oh mother, this is easy, oh mother.  Here we are alive, we don't find people voting and saying, " Follow us, follow us," and we say, "Follow us, follow us." From here, from the text, we throw it and the stones. We don't know where to go. We don't know where the truth is. Follow us, follow us, follow us. Stay safe. Get out the clothes you bought. Her name is Malika. Here she sleeps next to me and my mother. Here I give her these forbidden things.  And I pushed, I put it down and I pushed. Where did I want to put it? The house became a ruin. There was nothing left, nothing left. for you. God suffices me, and He is the best of the best. All the countries are watching. Yes, our homes have come too. Where is the soul, where is the pearl, where is the limit? God suffices me, and He is the best disposer of affairs for every one. We are released by the countries.  Israel, may God bless them. We attended the resistance until the last moment, until the last breath. We would leave our homes, even if they killed me.
