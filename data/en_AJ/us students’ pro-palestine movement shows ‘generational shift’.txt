I'm going to bring in Muhammad alas he's a media studies professor and political analyst at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies good to have you with us on Al jazer I want to talk about the ripple effect that these protests that we're seeing in the US are having because we've just seen pictures about the protests that are going on at C pole University in France we've seen other protests around the world as well all of this I would imagine being driven by the presence of social media the ability for the students say in the US campuses to be able to film what's going on and immediately spread that across the world talk to us about the impact that that's having social media has been a has been a GameChanger there's no question about it uh mainstream media in the west and if we want to look at the United States in particular is notorious for adopting the the sort of official line not because there is official censor censorship of course there isn't but because uh these Western media apparatuses like the American apparatus or the British apparatus have what media Scholars call structural constraints in place right there are these kind of filters that end up dictating what kind of news uh is produced right this is why you see such a sharp departure if you watch CNN or if you read the New York Times um from say what you get on democracy now or in The Intercept or on El jazer or in the Middle East eye and other and other outlets not only of what's happening in Gaza but even uh of what's happening on the ground with with the protest so students are able to use social media uh and remember young people are most likely to be plugged into these social media sites like X Instagram and Tik Tok so they're getting one version of reality that departs significantly from the reality that is that is being depicted by mainstream media they've galvanized support for the Palestinian cause and it's not surprising therefore to see all these opinion polls that show it's young people that are most likely to be sympathetic with the Palestinians and to be critical of Israel and Western policy Vis Gaza because they are the ones who are plugged into these social media sites it's world presid Freedom day we've been talking about that earlier on obviously as we were reporting the Palestinian reporters in Gaza being awarded for their work there I want to talk to you about World Press Freedom generally you were referring interestingly to the the structural constraints within certain Western organizations particularly when it comes to reporting certain things but what else are we seeing in terms of the kind of constraints and repressions that are being put on um the Press around the world particularly at a time when it is so important when people are protesting in in Rel to some to the war in Gaza when it comes to getting that message out M well one of the really important structural constraints that media Scholars talk about is sourcing so if you want to cover the news if you work for the New York Times or the Washington Post who do you end up talking to at the end of the day you end up talking to government officials well we know that overwhelmingly uh United States government officials for instance are supporting uh Israel officially right and they're also supported by APAC the the biggest Lobby organization in the United States the pro-israel uh Lobby so that's one of the reasons why you end up getting the kind of coverage that you get it's interesting to know you're talking about World Press Freedom Day well reporters Without Borders released their World Press Freedom uh uh index uh for 2024 it's just released within the last uh 12 or 14 hours and the United States actually uh dipped pretty sharply they're down to 55th in the world in the Press Freedom rankings and in their report it's pretty scathing reporters Without Borders is talking about how us officials are uh calling for the arrest of journalists um they're talking about the protest and they're talking about how journalists have been barred uh from covering the protests in some instances they're talking about how journalists have been assaulted and arrested so the United States is actually taking a hit here not only politically and in terms of their Global standing but also in terms of uh how they're viewed as a a center for for Global journalism Muhammad Al we appreciate you being with us in Al thank you very much indeed
