another two days of respite in hopes of seeing more scenes like this just hours before the deal expired an agreement was reached for an additional 48 Hours of calm the result of intensive mediation by Qatar we began this mediation process here in uh in Doha right after the 7th of of October and we have made a lot of accomplishments starting from then we've moved from a point where there was absolutely no chance for mediation where there is there was a refusal for mediation to both parties now every day agreeing on the lists and having hostages being released daily and we have reached a stop uh of fighting that is going to extend into almost a week uh now and I think we have to build on uh on that to make sure that we can move uh forward the extension means more trucks carrying food medicine and fuel are expected to enter the Gaza Strip particularly in the embattled north these supplies are crucial for population Shattered by War and a yearslong Siege imposed by Israel the Israeli Army says it's committed to the ceasefire but has vowed to press on with its military actions in Gaza once the deal expires in full force as we are speaking We are continuing the efforts to carry out the plan led by Egypt and Qatar who are committed to its execution over the next few days in order to bring back additional hostages our troops and combatants in Gaza are all deed and prepared for the next stages of the war Hamas wants the deal to result in a permanent ceasefire we have proposed and we've made it clear that we are ready to enter new deals in order to exchange all the captives and the prisoners but as you know in times of War it's very difficult to exchange everyone at least what we can achieve right now is that we can exchange all the women and children and enter new trues so we can continue this so that everyone can go back home and so that we can provide food medicine and fuel for civilians as we enter the winter season this is the operations room in Doha the focal point of qari mediation this is where negotiators maintain direct lines of communication with Hamas and Israel and monitor the implementation of the deal a small progress that is celebrated as a crucial step that can build momentum towards a long-lasting comprehensive deal bad mahichi alaz make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
