US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has arrived in Jordan as part of the latest diplomatic push for a ceasefire in Gaza it's blink's seventh visit to the Middle East since the War Began on Monday he met Regional leaders in Saudi Arabia and is expected to visit Israel next so let's cross to Stephanie deer who's joining us now from occupied East Jerusalem what might we see unfold on the Israeli leg of his trip then yes he's expected to arrive here this evening and will be holding me tomorrow uh the Americans are really here to two things push for a ceasefire for negotiations for the release of the captives and for Rafa not to happen this is something that they have said all along they haven't changed their position in fact Anthony blinkin yesterday saying that Israel has not given a plan that shows that they are able to avoid Mass civilian casualties when it comes to this uh potentially imminent ground offensive inaa so this is going to be high on the agenda uh they are of course in constant contact the Americans and the Israelis but you mentioned there his seventh visit to the region um they are trying to put pressure and I think these times are different now because of the imminence potentially of Rafa which is something that the Americans don't want it's something that the Egyptians uh which is going to be right on their doorstep don't want so now you're getting the regional players allies players uh getting their own interests very much being affected so you're seeing an upping of international pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister who's really Under Fire from all sides at this point tell us more about Israeli remarks on the plan to attack Rafa on the ground well interestingly you've just had the Israeli Prime Minister talking to the families of soldiers soldiers who died um during the Gaza War they are putting a lot of pressure on him to go into Rafa this is of course another sector of society because you also have you know hundreds of thousands of Israelis who are calling for an end for a deal to bring the captives home and even for a new election so he's just been talking to them and he's saying that Rafa is going to go ahead that the evacuation of civilians have already started um and that arfa will go ahead with or without a deal interestingly you have Philip lazarini speaking now he is the head of unra the UN Palestinian Refugee agency he said that this is not true that uh Israel has not started evacuating civilians from Rafa so it goes to show that what is said publicly to appease some kind of pressure of society is not necessarily what is happening on the ground where are we with the negotiations well Hamas is expected to respond to Israel's counterproposal by tomorrow night um and then it can go one of two ways if they agree uh then we'll have the beginning of a ceasefire the release of captives with the release of prisoners and some movement within Gaza of Palestinians to the north and Israeli soldiers away from certain areas in the Gaza Strip if they don't agree then according to the Israelis you're going to see arafa offensive very very soon so we're going to have to wait and see how the next couple of days play out certainly I think a pivotal moment Stephanie Dean occupied e Jerusalem thank you nor day is a political analyst and expert on Palestinian Affairs she is with us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman and so nor we see Hamas coming under pressure to accept a deal that is mediated by countries in the region that would involve a hostage exchange and also uh temporary halt hostilities in Gaza but it doesn't look as though they will necessarily make those concessions does this mean that Israel's longthree might be more imminent well I think what's interesting is that we've seen over the past few days a lot of statements you know urging and pressuring Hamas to accept and for a while there was a lot of cautious optimism up until this morning and then we just in the past uh um hour heard from the Israeli Prime Minister announcing that he would order an invasion of RAF with or without a deal in essence I think trampling all these ceasefire talks because uh uh and this is what the families of the Israeli captives had feared this is what the negotiators had feared the uh mediators had feared and and the statement comes after Netanyahu held a meeting with his most right-winged uh Coalition Partners including uh BV so we're seeing now a dance back and forth of saying we can have a hostage exchange deal but then we're still going to go forth forward with with the ra Invasion and that is not going to Bell with anybody involved in these talks and somewhat humiliating for Israel's main Ally whose secretary of state is currently in the region trying to Cobble together some sort of agreement absolutely the uh secretary blinkin is here uh in Jordan after having met with the uh Saudi officials and other uh Gulf officials in Riad he will be uh speaking with uh uh government officials here with top uh Jordanian government officials and then moving on to to Israel and it seem it's interesting because it seems every time linkoln comes to the region uh uh you know catching uh the Tailwind of some optimism something like this happens and he ends up really going home with nothing to show for all this political momentum it seems after the statement that that might be the case I know you and I have had conversations about this in in past years when you were based in Gaza of course you know the land very well how catastrophic would a ground in invasion of Rafa be for the Palestinians it would be apocalyptic because we're already Beyond catastrophic when it comes to the humanitarian situation in Rafa Rafa is one of the most impoverished areas of Gaza long before October right now it is home to 1.4 million displaced malnutritioned and desperate uh people at least half of them are children there aren't hospitals to tend to these people there isn't enough medicine uh to treat them and there certainly isn't enough food or water to make sure they're you know uh receiving proper element an invasion of RAF would be absolute uh um an absolute disaster uh Kan yunas to the north is has been leveled has been pummeled if you stand in the middle of Kan yunas now and look West you can see the the the the sea you can see the beach when in the past all you could see were buildings some quite High all of that is now gone because of the previous Invasion and to the North in there we also saw a lot of Destruction and Devastation so effectively these people would be escaping if they can to places that have no Services no food no water no hospitals because those hospitals have been attacked and as you were reporting the U attack on al- Naser Hospital in kanun is the center of uh some inquiry from the international criminal court nor day thank you very much make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
