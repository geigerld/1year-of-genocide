with our senior political analyst Maran bishara he joins us live from London Maran let's talk first then about the family of our colleague wild D who was killed in that Israeli air strike I mean he moved his family to the South which according to the Israelis was supposedly safer from danger they still got bombed they still died it reminds us Mar when there's no safe place in Gaza absolutely not South not North not East and not West it's a it's a it's amazing that in today's world a church is not safe a Mosk is not safe a hospital multiple hospitals are not safe they are bombed constantly residential buildings are not safe 2 million people in constant fear 2 million people under bombardment thousands have died tens of thousands of casualties more than a million made refugees yet again it's a it's it's such a tragedy but it's not uh divinely ordained this is a tragedy that's man-made there's an Israeli occupier there's an Israeli criminal Behind These killings there are there are war crimes they are not coincidence and uh speaking of families it is our family his family and he's been part of every family or every other family in the Arab world he's been a welcomed guest while is a welcomed guest like sharen was in every other Arab household he's become part of their families so now we are all of us countless families grieving for the death of his loved ones yeah Maran and I guess it um it underlines the danger that all journalists and their families in Gaza face day after day to tell the story of what's really happening in Gaza under this Relentless Israeli bombardment absolutely in fact uh there's a little documentary that Al jaaz produced about our correspondents in Gaza of course W unlike Tam unlike many others who left to do more journalism elsewhere W is a Cornerstone in Gaza and this documentary tells the story of w and Tam and others and how they've covered the 20 4 War and the wars after that and how these young men with their families young families have been able to survive Despite All Odds but now we see so many journalists are hurt so many journalist families are hurt and now our own W's families hurt so so marn let's broaden this out and just talk about some of the international response um to the crisis I mean we had those competing us and Russ Russian resolutions early at the UN Security Council both failed it's clear that deep divisions remain particularly between the US and Russia it seems we're back to the Cold War Days Mar one of both sides being diametrically opposed to each other absolutely crippling the United Nations security Council crippling any possibility of anything useful coming out of the United Nations especially in the face of such tragedy that's unraveling uh the occupied uh Palestinian territories and it is uh it is it is shameful and they are Shameless in the way they are handling this the cynicism is beyond anything we've seen and it's all in plain sight it's all for us to see both the tragedy both the debates at the United Nations the incapacity of these presumably grown-ups to be able to handle such simple things as reach a compromise continue with Geo your geopolitical rivalries but come to a consensus about something that is so urgent the killing the genocide of Palestinians the way it's unraveling and the way it could widen okay to include engulf more innocent lives in Palestine and Beyond Mar let me get a final thought from you before you go I mean you were talking to us earlier about how the Russian position has changed towards Israel and it now seems to be highlighting the humanitarian tragedy for Palestinians in Gaza under the Israeli bombardment what's caused the Russian position to to to to change with regards to Israel no that's that's a very important geopolitical question and let me summarize it as as follows first of all it is the framing uh by President Biden of the conflict in the world as being that on the one hand uh Ukraine and Israel on the other hand Russia and Hamas or Palestine which is completely false of course there's nothing in common between Hamas and Russia and there's absolutely nothing in common between Ukraine and Israel Ukraine being occupied and Israel being an occupier the only thing in common between them are they are allies or rather clients of the United States and hence Russia has uh Fallen back on its old positions of the times of the Cold War taking the position that isra should end uh the the criminality that it's doing but you you add to that the very important Dimension let's all remember that Russia remains deployed in Syria and now the United States is deploying its uh aircraft cares to the east Mediterranean okay in a in an abrasive uh show of force a gun boo diplomacy that certainly not to the liking of other uh superpowers so all of that is polarizing galvanizing and clearly crippling any serious response on the part of the International Community all right Maran basawa our senior political analyst there in London Maran thank you
