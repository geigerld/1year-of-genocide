hello it's 11 GMT that's 1 p.m. in Gaza which has endured a Mourning of mass killing from north to south one of the latest Israeli air strikes has targeted Gaza City First Responders and displaced people are among the Dead one strike killed at least 10 people Palestinians say the air strikes are deliberately targeting civilians there's also been intense Street to Street battles the Israeli Army says it's engaged in the heaviest fighting since it began its ground invasion 5 weeks ago the military says it's pushing deeper into the southern city of hunas gaza's second biggest city imin Kimber begins our coverage in what's being described as the heaviest bombardment since Israel's War Began almost all parts of Gaza are under attack the north the South and the central region ground battles are taking place around K Yunis in the south isra is says its troops surround the city gaza's second largest and are supported by fighter jets and war planes desperate Palestinians are fleeing to Rafa 10 km away many by foot what is left in Gaza where is the world how long will this misery last let the world watch our children lining up for water we fled from K yunus to Rafa here here we are in Rafa we do not know where to go we are sleeping in the streets the World Health Organization says the situation is worsening by the hour in Gaza and the risk of disease is increasing rapidly due to the lack of Sanitation we moved to Rafa because of the heavy bombardment because of my injury I fainted when we moved to this school and I was taken to alaxa Mar's Hospital the doctors told me I have hepatitis I'm worried I'll infect my whole family the United Nations says nowhere in Gaza can be considered safe not even shelters flying the UN flag it's not a safe Zone if it's only free from bombardment as some zones have not been it's a safe Zone when you can guarantee the conditions of food water medicine and shelter okay now I've seen for myself these are entirely entirely absent um I you cannot overstate these are tiny patches of barren land or their street corners in Northern Gaza Israel has been targeting the largest refugee camp jabalia once again Palestinian media say civil defense teams are struggling to rescue people trapped under the rubble in central Gaza another refugee camp Al narat has come under attack as have residential buildings in De El Bala and Al Zahra with dozens of Palestinians killed or injured Hamas says ceasefire talks or discussions about the release of Israeli captives cannot take place until the violence stops there will be no negotiations or exchange of captives until the aggression against our people and the Gaza Strip stops we hold Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu fully responsible for the lives of the Israeli hostages 80% of the population that's almost two million people have been forced from their homes but soon there will be nowhere left to go imin Kimber aljazera and Han Mahmud is joining us now from RA in southern Gaza and hany you know those people that are forced from their homes they're really facing some impossible choices because where did they go to they were told to go to the South where you are and we understand uh the South has been experiencing bombardment as well yes indeed very difficult situations for displaced population right now we more than half of Gaza population have been displace but within just the past few minutes we're getting confirmed reports about more atrocities taking place overnight and early hours of this morning and since we're talking about how people are trying to seek a shelter Refuge what happened a group of displaced people in in the at the center of Gaza City the old Gaza that's the Eastern side of the western part of the Gaza City we're trying to evacuate with the help of civil defense to crew when they were targeted at least 10 people were reported killed that's an example of how unsafe Gaza has become there is no safey place across the gaser from north to south even the areas that have been designated a safe area for people here are coming under constant heavy bombardment here in ra the Eastern side of Ra have been under heavy bombardment since the first week of the war I'm talking about an entire neighborhood that have been under constant uh air air strikes and artillery Shillings and the vast majority of those of of residential homes in that neighborhood the Janina neighborhood have been destroyed where people have been forced to move to the western side of Raab but the tragedy of all of this that ra is packed now there are extreme living conditions people lack the all the nas ities all the basic supplies in terms of Food Supplies Water Supplies in terms of a space now ra is running out of a space it has already been populated with people and now with more people are pouring into the city from KH unun is running for life particularly the Eastern side of Kan where the vast majority of people were forcibly displ under a heavy bombardment all the way to the center of kanun as of this report the making of this report we we' seen scores of people just in this tiny area next to a Kuwaiti Hospital people are moving with whatever they could get their hand on of belongings some just came walking all of this distance because they could not take any of their stuff H unit is becoming under heavy bombardment similar to what's going on right now in the northern part where jabalia was hit at earlier hours of this morning fua area and then block two was under heavy bombardment as as well as darel balah of early hours of yesterday's evening we're seeing atrocities tragedies and more displaced people but what is common among all of this is the misery of living the living conditions are becoming very difficult and people are are are are having great deal of uncertainty what's going to happen this is the last point that they can be they're displaced too they don't know where to go after that the only option they have is the Egyptian border which uncertain what will happen next hany and in terms of the reports that there are Street to Street battles going on where are those focused primarily and also what sort of resistance is being put up by the alasam fighters and other Palestinian factions on the [Music] ground yes the reports were getting from Gaza City and the northern part that vast majority of these battles and confrontation are taking place in a sha neighborhood where massive number of Israeli tanks and armored vehicles have surrounded the neighborhood within the past two days and had keep pushing inside the heart of the neighborhood is a very densely populated area now there is an Israeli claim that there is a an entire Kasam Battalion inside the neighborhood and they are adamant at destroying it the vast majority of of the the the residential home in that area were bombed and completely leev leveled to the ground in an attempt to provide more roads to the tanks to push deeper into a neighborhood as well as in jabalia a refugee camp fuj and Blu where it was a heavily bombardment last night and tanks and armored vehicle were pushing slowly under the uh the clearance of the the massive air strike that destroyed the the large large parts of the refugee camps we happen to watch a video by a by United Nations uh uh officials who were driving at the surrounding area of the refugee camp and we could see the sheer amount of of Destruction shown by the video with comments coming from people on the car about the shock that they are having a a they're having as a result of seeing the the level of Destruction that that they will take years uh to come to rebuild uh the the refugee camp all right thank you so much H mm reporting from in the Gaza
