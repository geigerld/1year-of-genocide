Our Palestinian map has many parts, so I was astonished when I drew it and saw that the world was asking about Palestine, and when I identified every country in Palestine for him, it existed for us, and that historically Palestine is our land and the land of our fathers and grandfathers. I love to draw it and show the whole world what Palestine is, what its land is, as long as we ask.  Regarding Palestine, what does Palestine mean to you? When I draw this map, foreigners come and buy it. I mean, not from a material aspect, from a financial aspect. It stabilizes the land. Palestine. Anything regarding Palestine. People actually began to seek it, be attracted to it, and buy the craft. I mean, we passed it down to three generations. For example, the third generation developed it and became the craft.  It will be treated as if it were a masterpiece, and this existed before the existence of the occupation. If it does not come out of my heart, I will know that this piece is not beautiful. It is not a thousand people. People have begun to learn what the Palestinian issue is. Here we are the gain, and now you have three countries that have recognized us. It will take a while. God willing, they will recognize it again and again.  Also, look at the pressures from these governments on the occupation, that it is of no benefit to these people whose existence exists, has history, and civilization, and they have their job, they have their people, they have their society, they have their culture, so take your hands off them
