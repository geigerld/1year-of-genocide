Sarah kyat who joins us from occupied East Jerusalem Sarah so the Israeli military have given us an updated list of soldiers who've been killed in their war with Hamas what have they said they've confirmed that an additional uh nine soldiers were killed in yesterday and the overnight uh raids on Gaza bringing that total to 11 soldiers this is the largest uh numbers of losses that they've had since their uh ground offensive uh in Gaza um and they released those names um what they tend to do is they wait till they have spoken to the families of the soldiers before they release those names and now that's uh been confirmed uh bringing uh the number of Israeli soldiers killed in total since October the 7th to more than 300 and uh 20 uh it's been uh they've been met with a lot of resistance from from alasan Brigade and Islamic Jihad fighters in several areas in Gaza and uh the Minister of Defense had said overnight and even this morning um that it's expected that they will have those losses it's a war and that's the price they'll have to pay um but they're trying to limit those deaths by uh using a much stronger uh uh protection from the Air Force as they're back up and Sara Israel's also claiming to have achieved its military objectives during this attack of the jabala refugee camp which is predominantly a residential neighborhood what exactly have they said yeah and as you saw in those videos those buildings are so close together it's very compact it's one of the most densely populated places in Gaza now uh the military this morning has said that it's targeted 11,000 targets 11,000 strikes and that's just in a little over three weeks um which is a huge amount and of course a lot of those that have been killed have been civilians the Israeli uh military though says that it specifically targeted um Hamas groups especially overnight they said that they their soldiers the the ones the ground troops had identified a number of Fighters they said that had barricaded barricaded rather themselves in a building in jabalia and that's how they were able to Target them um but of course as we all those numbers of Civilian deaths have been high they also said that they targeted command centers by Hamas um they haven't really given the details to that but it's an accusation they've been making for a while now um where they've said that that's why they're hitting these areas with civilians because Hamas is operating from places like schools or medical centers including Al shiffer hospital and they've accused them in jaala of being amongst residents and having those command centers they also added that they also managed um to uh attack uh the Hamas Fighters that targeted one of their tankers tanks so um there seem to be what they're saying is that they're showing a good show of force against Hamas with very precise uh attacks on them but as we've said you know the the number and the death toll of the civilians are high thank you for that Sarah there for us an occupied East Jerusalem
