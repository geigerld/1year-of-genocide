let's get a a closeup look at just how bad it is in hospitals we can speak now to Dr Hassan Abu sit who's a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who's treating the wounded at Al shiffer Hospital in Gaza joins me live from there now doctor thanks for joining us and taking the time out to speak to us uh you're at Al shiffer as I say tell us how big that hospital is how many patients there are there and and just what you're seeing the hospital's uh pre-war bed capacity was is around 600 700 as a push the hospital now has around 1,900 wounded and so these extra wounded are in trolleys on mattresses in the floors in the corridors in the emergency department everywhere that we can make space for them we have in the outpatients Departments we've created space in addition there's 150 patients on ventilators with critical injuries and after each air raid the operating room the the reception area of the operating rooms is just there are bodies on the floor waiting to get into the operating rooms wounded from the latest air strike and then you clear that and then there's another air strike and then you start all over again and it's completely just it is unremitting uh in addition there's around 50,000 people who sought refuge in the in the grounds of the hospital Andor just repeat that just one did you say 50,000 ,000 yes ,000 50,000 they live in the grounds which is the grounds of the the hospital has become a like a tented City uh they also live in the corridors on the stairwells uh uh in the lobbies of the of the different hospital buildings in chiffer compound and Doctor you are a plastic and you're a plastic and reconstructor surgeon what kind of injuries are you seeing what kind of injuries are you dealing with we're seeing Burns uh we deal with Burns uh over the last few days we've seen increasing numbers of phosphorus Burns uh today I had a a young child with phosphorus Burns that we were treating um we are seeing burns from the inary component of a lot of these blasts we have over 100 patients with burn RS more than 40% of their bodies uh um we have limb injuries we have facial injuries really traumatic disfiguring facial injuries debilitating limb injuries this morning I had to do an amputation on the foot of a a 9-year-old girl uh and I had to do a reconstruction on a one-year-old boy's foot this is our work on a daily basis between 12 and 15 cases every day uh uh and we are barely scratching the surface of what needs to be done as you're as you said in your introduction there're now 20,000 wounded gaza's whole bed capacity uh was 2 and a half thousand before the war you can imagine what kind of tsunami of injuries that's completely overwhelmed the health system which is still being denied any meaningful Aid you talk about the burns phosphorus Burns white phosphorus of course is not permitted in Warfare so is butchering 3,000 children they seem to be happy to do that regardless and so I mean I was here during the 2008 2009 War when the Israelis used phosphorus a much more uh widespread way and you remember the gold stone uh investigation and the gold stone Report with regards to the use of phosphorus the Israelis yet Again boyed by a sense of impunity that they've received from the visiting Western leaders and the Silence of the International Community really do not care about international law about what constitutes a war crime what are weapons that that are banned under international law all of these things have been thrown out the book because there's complete and unconditional support from Western given the lack of medical supplies how are you how are you actually treating people how are you providing anesthetic so there are times when the numbers are so overwhelming that there's not enough anesthetic Technic and anesthetic doctors and so we we resort to using ketamine ketamine is a very old uh drug that used to be used in wars and now is used just in for by vets uh and we're using that because it allows the surgeon to administer the the anesthetic and operate at the same time and uh uh you know when when 50 60 70 patients come at the same time and a lot of them need to go immediately to the operating room then you do that because there's no other option otherwise they'll bleed out uh doctor you're doing fantastic work we do appreciate you joining us Dr gasan Al s all we can hear is ambulances ambulance aren in the background uh your work is ongoing thank you
