okay well let's introduce me zi who's the director of golf uh studies Center at the katar University he joins us here in Doha very warm welcome to you so um how encouraged should we be about what we've heard from the US Secretary of State alak katari foreign minister I think when it comes to the war on Gaza uh there is some hope um when it comes to the response of Hamas um what's um and and here let me just uh make it clear that this is um this is the second mediation effort where the focus is on a frame on road map on how things should be done this is not the agreement so we have to differentiate between a mediation leads to um uh just a normal one like November but this one is different this one is about the basis for a serious exit strategy for what's happening in Gaza so that's the reason it took times from I think from all parties to first of all to put this suggestion onto um in reality in Paris and now to get the response from Hamas and other resistant groups so that's an important step I think this is this does give hope uh that you know there is a move towards a sort of um stop this operation in in Gaza but let's let's be clear on that and admit that the conf the whole War has reached to the fatigue stage where basically Israelis first of all they got everything they can imagine which basically destroying Gaza without achieving anything and they are now just now repeating actually this kind of Destruction on the other side the Palestinian themselves they have not reached this point because basically their uh aim has been achieved in 7th of October so the Israeli is now in the fatig stage and they have to work hard to move out from that status quo because this cost them a lot politically and economically and militarily as we heard there Anthony blinkin of course has raised the prospect of normalizing relationships between Israel and uh Saudi Arabia how much of this continues to be an attractive carrot for Israel going forward given all the domestic tensions uh in the country particularly within the cabinet there this kind of discourse is a is a something pleases Biden Administration and that is something a reward given to Netanyahu so you I mean as an expert in the region no one is ready to listen to this at the moment without stopping the war on Gaza so blinkin is his sixth visit to the region this is the second time he is talking about uh normalization uh and because he feels that that is a reward could be given to Netanyahu to give some concessions when it comes to the war on Gaza and and that could be another achievement to know to Biden Administration when it comes to Middle East foreign policy that he has actually done another agreement uh between Israelis and and and Saudi Arabia so this is the context of normalization has to deal with fixing the failure of Biden foreign policy in the Middle East and giving a a reward to to Netanyahu otherwise other parties in the region they have one interest so far is to end the war in Gaza and have exit clear exit strategy to what's happened in Gaza and West Bank so to a certain extent it mustn't be all about simply incentify this incentivizing this and offering a reward to Israel to get them to agree to a framework in that respect does the United States need to pull some more severe levers uh when it comes to encouraging forcing even uh Israel to move forward on this they they have a lot on hand uh they have the discussion now um as your correspondent talk about the Congress talk about Military Support economic support they have a lot on hand the Americans if they if they have if they want to do it they can do a lot actually uh and that is that is that is that's something to be asked to by the administration why they are not um doing enough to stop this war on Gaza and and why why Netanyahu is actually pushing them to the direction which is not of the interest of the United States any anyone the first year student in political science and IR will say everything happen now is not in the interest of the United States because it it brings hatred to the United States from the region and across the globe and I don't know how they can see the things uh uh otherwise Ma always good to hear your analysis many thanks for joining us my pleasure my pleasure
