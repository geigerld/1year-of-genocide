he had met all the regional Partners Saudi Arabia Kata Jordan UAE the Palestinian Authority and Egypt of course saying there was a clear consensus and need for an immediate sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages also spoke of the UN Security Council resolution which has been tabled by the United States which has marked change in direction also the need to increase Aid to gazi spoke of impending Israeli incursion to Rafa uh he spoke of the two State solution and much more besides uh s shuker for his part said there's no time to exacerbate suffering no room to continue War I could go on but I won't because we're joined Now by our diplomatic editor James Bay who who knows much more about these things and I do now so what was your overall assessment it seemed to me that secretary blinken although accepting there very real challenges ahead it was pretty bullish yeah it was pretty bullish and I thought the tone of the whole thing was really rather consolatory and there was not a great deal of criticism um that you know this is the sixth visit of secretary blinkin to the region since October the 7th and he had some very tough discussions with these Arab leaders uh early on after October the 7th even in the statement that comes from all of the different foreign ministers that met him today no condemnation of of the US uh they talk in the statement of the disastrous repercussions of the Israeli War on the Gaza Strip and and in the news conference yes there was the the Egyptian foreign minister raised the issue of double standards but only in response to a question it's not something he brought up on the on the other hand of course in terms of Israel there was so many criticisms from the Secretary of State towards Israel which suggest to me that his meetings tomorrow it's going to be a reversal of what it was nearo October the meetings tomorrow uh that he's going to have in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are going to be much much more difficult because he was so critical of uh the Rafer offensive he says there is a better way he said it would be a mistake it's is something we cannot support um with regard to Aid uh he said uh that there needs to be a surge it cannot continue as it is now Israel needs to do more and of course when he talks about his grand plan for the way forward he talks about a revitalized Palestinian Authority yes there are things that the Arab Nations and the PA need to do there are they is America and the US going to be happy just with a new prime minister or does there have to be more fundamental change we have a Palestinian president mmud abas still at the top who was elected in 2005 for a four-year term he's now in his 20th year of that four-year term right but it is the PA that the US want to run uh Gaza going forward a revitalized PA and then it's a two-state solution now guess what the Israeli policy or the Israeli views of current government is they don't believe the PA should be running Gaza and they don't believe in a two-state solution and in fact although he's not a absolute key player in the war cabinet basically you're running this war at the moment he's not in it Israel Kats who's the um foreign minister of Israel who if they do another news conference like this tomorrow he's going to be standing there next to secretary blinkin he does not believe in a Palestinian State and he wants to Annex all of the West Bank and he's going to be sitting next standing next to secretary blinkin so there'll be much more disagreement I think in 24 hours time than there is now can you just give us a bit of context in terms of Egypt's role in all this and why these talks are taking place in Egypt now why this press conferences has been held here what is the importance of Egypt in in the whole scene well several several factors here um number one geography Egypt has the border with Rafa and it's the only place that has access to GA to Gaza other than Israel so that makes it absolutely key clearly Egypt has a regional role in the Arab uh region uh that makes it one of the dominant players it was the country that did the first peace deal uh with Israel so Egypt I think always has felt that it it it it should be the lead partner in this and it is very much Egypt and Qatar are the two countries that are the mediators in what's going on and we have we have the venue of of of Israel with regard to this Rafa operation but the other two places that are important right now are here in Doha and the talks here Egypt and katar have been brokering them we understand that the Mossad Chief David bar he was here in Doha earlier in the week he left he's coming back suggesting these talks as secretary blinkin says the gaps are narrowing it's still difficult I continue to believe it's possible possible progress also the talk there raised which he wouldn't confirm that the CI CIA director Bill Burns might be on his way here too so I I think you know that is a key Center and the other Center of course which the Secretary of State spoke to spoke about is New York and the possibility that this draft resolution that the US have now put in blue that means put ready for a vote could be voted on and there's some talk in New York but maybe things could happen in the next 24 hours as well so it could be a very exciting um few hours coming things are really beginning to happen now so we'll see how it all pans out James for the time being thanks very much indeed at James space here in the studio uh well let's all this diplomacy is going on let's get the scene on the ground we get the very latest from T abom who joins us from Rafa in southern Gaza so tell us more about what's been happening because I understand there's been more [Music] strikes yes uh Nick in fact there has been more air strikes in the past few hours across the Gaza Strip specifically in the southern part of the territory here in Rafa the Israeli FY Jets had targeted AR res had targeted an agricultural land in the uh western western eastern part of the of the of Rafa district with no casualties has have been report have been reported in the past hour but also we have been seeing more attacks on the anarat refugee camp where a residential building was completely flattened where uh two Palestinians have reported injured and those injuries had been transported after long hours of rescue to the AL AA hospital to receive medical treatment but yet till now the bombardment in the Gaza City sounds really critical and unprecedented where the Israeli forces had blowing up a number of residential houses on the vicinity of aifa hospital where battles and confrontations are raging till now and did not stop as the Israeli military had been stating that they have arrested 300 Palestinians at least till now and killed uh 140 others since the beginning of this operation TK thanks for that to T Abu Zoom there speaking to us from Rafa in southern Gaza
