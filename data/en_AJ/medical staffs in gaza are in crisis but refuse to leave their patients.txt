Peace be upon you. I am Al-Hakimah Warda Al-Awawda. I work in Al-Aqsa Hospital, the nursery department. Nursery care. Fakfak. Al-Aqsa Hospital includes two departments, an intermediate care department, an intermediate nursery and an intensive care department. Now, with regard to women giving birth during the Al- Aqsa flood war, we noticed a high admission rate in the care department. There is no case in the Han department, a child care department. We are forced to receive children according to the intention of children who were bombed, there are families, there is no mother or father, there is no one for them, but we know who they are. We also deal with these children, and also in terms of care, we always have a family of one or more, meaning the future of more cases than the number of existing beds, except that there is a supply transport.  There are certain medical supplies for basic and necessary treatments. This is in danger. If this treatment is lacking, there will be a problem. This means that this will have a direct impact on the lives of premature patients, heart patients, children, basic care. Sometimes there is no soap. There is no paper in which we wash our hands. We make breastfeeding for premature and full-term newborns. There is some sweet water to boil.  We have a problem with births, as we do. I mean, the care is almost always divided on our behalf. Even if I tell you, there are more beds than necessary. We worked one eighth of the cases on six incubators. Eight cases were on six respiratory machines on six incubators on our behalf. This child, Hassan Mishmish, came to us about a year ago.  During the days they took him from under the rubble, from the presence of his martyred mother and father, his mother and father were martyred. They brought him from under the rubble. We made him a full bath. It was all lead ashes, and God willing, even his brother was also in the childrenâ€™s section. Six people were sleeping with him. Is there anyone for this baby so far who is free to hold him
