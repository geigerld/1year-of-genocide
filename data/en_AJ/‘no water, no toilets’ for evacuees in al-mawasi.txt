well let's go live now to Gaza T Abu AUM is in Rafa in southern Gaza Forest so T how difficult is it for Palestinians to get to and survive in these safe zones yes uh Al maasi area which has been now designated by the occupation uh forces as a safe area considered to be very uh difficult uh for residents inside of Gaza to reside and due to the full absence of all civil infrastructure and all kinds of humanitarian needs that will help any human being to survive or to C with the aftermaths of the Israeli uh attacks across the territory now this area had uh no kinds of toilets no kinds of uh of humanitarian facilities that would help Palestinians to live their am more growing concerns of the spread of infectuous diseases among residents especially with the clear absence of the the hygiene uh conditions and the unaffordability of the uh say the U standards of cleanness and safety in that region while the bombardment also continue across uh the territory the people who had uh delivered and have been transported there in order to be safe uh narrates very uh catastrophic conditions as they are no longer able to C with the situation there and they are only want to move to more further areas in order to be protected and safe and an are that would have more kind of facilities that would help them to survive away from the Israeli bombing so this area is considered to be safe from the Israeli perspective but literally on the ground as Palestinian have a more growing mistrust in terms of what Israel says they have no other safe place across Gaza where all the territory have been under Relentless bombing since the early beginning of this round of fighting and T we we understand there have been attacks in the town of De Bal in central what what are you hearing about that yes der is one of the areas that had been under intense Israeli bombing we're talking about more than uh uh 15 uh Palestinians have been killed in separate air strikes in this uh town uh which has been under intense Shilling from the Israeli artillery now the Israeli attacks on darel balah continues alongside with separate areas across the territory where the occupation and it's the new phase of war that had witnessed more expansion of military operations seeks to split and divide the Gaza Strip into three areas uh to help the Israeli troops to control all access of Gaza and to uh help the maneuvering troops to attack uh and to destroy more targets Affiliated to the Palestinian Fighters now uh the the north of the territory also had been under heavy Relentless bombing as according to the latest updates by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said that that the the attacks on the territory by the occupation forces during the last 24 hours had claimed the lives of more than 200 Palestinian and uh with uh more numbers of victims who are still trapped under the rles and they have not yet been evacuated by the civil defense team due to the uh absence of essential equipment and due to the uh Furious uh numbers of Israeli air strikes that had destroyed uh several residential areas across Gaza and T from the point of view of uh Hamas we know that their um military win Elan brigades have put out a uh statement uh in the last couple of hours and I'm going to read some of that to you now neither the fascist enemy and its leadership like the corrupt Netanyahu or the senile old Galant nor those who support them or middlemen among the zionists in the white house will be able to get their prisoners back alive without an exchange and negotiation and without meeting the demands of the resistance pretty defiant statement there from uh the representative of Elam brigades what else did he say yes uh this had been said since the fighting as they have a clear tactic in terms of the number of uh the captives who had been in their hands uh while the occupation forces are trying to carry out different secret operations in order to uh redrive the captives from the hands of the Palestinian Fighters now also they have said that they have attacked different Israeli soldiers who try to uh push deeper into hunas where they have eliminated one of the Israeli force that consist of 15 soldiers as they have been hit by different explosive devices and they have later uh displayed a number of videos that had shown the Israeli soldiers who had been attacked and the number of artillery armored vehicles where they have been hit by several drones uh which had dropped different explosive devices over them so the confrontations according to the an a statement of the uh spokesperson of the military wing of Hamas continues as they saying that they are destroying more artillery tanks uh across the axis of fighting and they are trying to block the entry to the vital areas uh and which considered to be an active areas for the Israeli uh uh operations now they have said also that there are all kinds of efforts made by International uh allays for Israel wouldn't uh be fruitful until they met all the demands of the Palestinian uh uh uh resistance as they have stated before and this is the clear tactic that has been adopted by Hamas since the early beginning of this round of fighting that all prisoners must be released according to negotiations and ceasefire exchange which can help to release more Palestinian prisoners from the Israeli jails AB in off for us thanks very much we hope you stay safe
