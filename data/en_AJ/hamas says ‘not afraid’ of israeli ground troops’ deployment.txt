joining us now on the phone is gazi hammad who's hamas's spokesperson and member of hamas's political Bureau he's on the phone from Gaza Mr Hamad thank you very much for talking to us um can I get you first to respond to Israel's prime minister's comment and message that he is going to crush Hamas and that this will be the end of Hamas what do you respond I think it's is a big joke it's not the first time not the second time than 100 time that he repeated all the time since many years that he want to crush Hamas and to crush the Bor of the Hamas I think that the problem is not in Hamas I think there is What's called the fian people about 14 million people who are fighting for freedom I think he's very solid very crazy when he think that he can destroy the Palestinian people Hamas is part of thean people so I think we are still have this strong now to fight and to fight and to fight right until we reach the point of the freedom and for people I think is dreaming they think that by military power they can destroy the Palestinians by some International pressure but I think they will fail they will get nothing maybe now they want to make any kind of Victory by raising the number of other people of w people demolishing HS there the area but I think this will never give Israel any kind of Victory Israel is planning as you know sir what many believe will be a massive ground invasion of Gaza they've mobilized over 300,000 reservers you say Hamas is ready to fight how is Hamas preparing for that how are you going to respond to Israel's military might when so many of your Fighters have already been killed look uh first of all we are not afraid of We Are Not Afraid uh is ever since 194 till now they committed the crimes they inv the a strikes massacr Collective punishment we are not afraid we are strong people and we have a strong determination to continue I think in Gaza even in the W and are ready to face the isra cation Invasion we have a lot of Fighters a lot of people who are want to support us I think even people in the borders in Jordan in Lebanon in everywhere I think they want to come here and to penetrate the borders and to come to fight with us I think Gaza is not is not a garden is not a B for isra I think it is very clly for them a bigest price are you expecting support from outside uh I'm sorry to say that the position of the governments is is very bad the International Community is very bad I think they give kind of umbrella and leg legitimacy for the cles of Israel I I I I just hear about status but nothing is done on the ground uh but I think that we only on the and God help us and second on our people I think our people is very strong and they have the ability and the capacity to support the Palestinian resistance I think Israel Israel is very country you know since the beginning of this operation we sent just 400 fighters who succeed to to to to this destroy the image of Israel the security of Israel the intelligence of Israel that is all the time is a super power I think that I think the vict ra number ofs homes that's all but what is the end game for Hamas here what do you do you want to see things look like when this is over the understand the world to understand that there is occupation occupation is a source of all kinds of evils pain tragedy killing instability we want to get the attention of the world that these people are living under for long time we want to put we want to for Thea for 17 years living like slaves we want to stop building in stor people we want all to understand it's the longest the brutal ucation in the world why commun support financially military Poli against Russia certainly Al for certainly Mr uh gazi hammad this has put the spotlight once again on the occupation the Israeli occupation and the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied territories but it has however also put the spotlight on Hamas and what some would describe as Hamas brutal tactics we seen Israeli uh citizens killed Hamas has taken a number of hostages can you tell tell me uh about these hostages how many does Hamas have how are they being treated because Israel has accused Hamas of brutally uh killing hostages there have been some reports of Hamas killing babies and so on just just just tell to give us one picture as the Prime Minister M said give us one picture that Hamas killed the cians Hamas killed the children Hamas Ked women kill so Hamas did not kill any any civilians no no we we don't kill civilians we don't kill civilians now theost so the person India they are fully protected we everything and protection it is part of our ethics of our Islam it is not like the occupation who are who are torturing our people in the prison for many many so who are the hostages then so who are the hostages that Hamas is holding captive right now and will you releasee them under what circumstan I I don't have a specific number and sta about the but now we as Hamas we have Tak a decision not to talk about the hostages or or anything unless they could that this daily B in GAA is stop we want now to focus in this big tragedy in G are deleting fames killing people we want to stop first this is our priority now and second is to allow for humanitarian Corridor Anda because now everything is cut here water electricity Serv everything hospitals are paralyzed we want to focus in the in the problems and TR OFA but the world now all of them are just concerned about the about small numbers of of hostages and they want to protction but they foret about two and half million people under targeting now there are negotiations uh you mentioned the humanitarian situation Mr hammad there are negotiations reportedly uh with the Egyptians to open um the the Border uh the Rafa Crossing and let people go to Egypt what is the status of that would civilians be able to leave Gaza and head to Egypt if this Israeli bombing campaign continues if the ground Invasion happens I I think we still have contact to the Egyptians with the c with United Nation Representatives last yesterday and every day and they prom us we are working together and to impose more andde now to open a to but nothing is done on the ground I hope that that that International Comm to open his eyes for the in Gaza okay but as I said that nothing is done in the ground real no people in Gaza could not outside go inside assistant could not be rich Gaza so everything is now Mr hammad one last question if I may before we let you go what would it take to agree to a truce right now as you've said it's a people of Gaza who are suffering the civilian populations who are under constant bombardment who have little food left no water no electricity what does Hamas what would you agree to in order to achieve a truce right now at this point want two things two things to stop add and attacks on Gaza to stop this daily this on Gaza to stop this military strikes on Gaza second point now to open to open this C to Gaza to for people in Gaza to receive the human this is the most important two things now Mr gazi hammad thank you for taking the time to talk to us
