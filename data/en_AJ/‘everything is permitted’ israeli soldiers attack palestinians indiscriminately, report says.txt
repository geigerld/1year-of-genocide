and six Israeli soldiers have described being authorized to open fire on Palestinians indiscriminately they told Israel's plus 972 magazine they had executed civilians who strayed into so-called noo zones Two Soldiers said commanders gave permission to burn Palestinian homes to the ground after they'd occupied them one reservist recalled firing bullets into the sea or into abandoned buildings because because he was bored Orin ziv is a journalist and commentator at plus 972 magazine he joins us now from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so first of all let me ask you this the Israeli officials say no they they have rules of of Engagement and any violations their exceptions to the rule which are investigated from your understanding of speaking to soldiers are we talking about a few isolated incidents or are we talking about a general standing shall we say operating procedure that is prevalent in the Army thank you for having me first of all it's important to say that in our investigation on 972 magazine we spoke to six soldier from different units who were serving in different times across the Gaza Strip what we could learn from them that the opening f regul ations were not very strict some of them didn't even get proper order from their commanders and from higher up and in general they said they told us they testified that there were no limits they could fire almost at everything and we're talking on operation from the ground and even when we are talking about sensitive targets as they call it schools Hospital public institutions they said they had to ask for permission but it was almost a bureaucratic thing and it was always approved they said that even if you had a very small sense of fear or danger you could shoot and some of them even testified they were shooting out of being bored or just for fun to the sky to open areas but also to in populated areas as you mentioned one of the soldiers testified that there was a Red Zone around the area H the soldiers were positioned inside the Gaza Strip in between houses and neighborhoods and everybody any Palestinian armed or not armed who crossed this line it was allowed to shoot in order to kill he said that every man between the age 15 and 50 was considered a fighter even though if he was in civilian clothes or without weapon he was considered a fighter or potential fighter and was allowed to shoot in order to kill I think the general feeling the soldier described is that there was a big sense after the October 7 attack of Revenge and we heard it also from Israeli official from the Prime Minister and Senior ministers and this approach went down to the commanders on the ground and also to the very simple soldiers that just felt they can do anything a sense of Revenge they told us the the statement that there no innocent people in Gaza that everyone involved with Hamas that everybody celebrated the October have an attack and therefore they wanted to punish them let me jump in Orin and and you said the feeling of Revenge some of what's quoted in your article quotes soldiers saying it is permissible to shoot at the center of their body mass not in the air it's permissible to shoot everyone a young girl an old woman from speaking with these soldiers did you get the idea that shooting at young girls or old women might result sometimes in investigation or repercussions or being called or held to account in any way so one soldier mentioned that although he said he was trying to avoid that and he said that that might cause some internal questioning or investigation but on the very low level of the commanded commanders inside G it wouldn't go out and higher up and in general other soldiers told us that they felt that everything is permitted so sometimes when things happen commanders would investigate it but again it wouldn't get to a court or to a proper investigation from what I understand and part of this article also has some disturbing accounts about blowing up and destroying Palestinian civilian property after the Israeli Army um had occupied the building talk to us about that to clarify soldiers were position as we know in Palestinian private houses and when a specific unit or a group of soldier decides to move on or order to move on H they had a a order or regulation to burn the house down meaning they would gather all the furniture and the mattresses in the middle of the house and set it on fire the official explanation the soldier were giving told by the commanders is that if some military equipment or sensitive materials was was left there it will be destroyed and also mentioning that they didn't want Hamas to use the houses but of course between the lines we understood that this was also a form of prevention to prevent Palestinians to go back to the houses this was done as a command not as a private initiative and also other things like that vandalizing houses graffiti stealing and looting this was done with commanders on the ground noticing that and ignoring it and not taking any action on these matters Orin I've got so many other questions to ask you but I think we're going to have to save it for another day thanks so much Oren Z journalist and commentator at plus 972 magazine thank you so much for having me make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
