Israel has carried out multiple strikes in Gaza killing more Palestinians from the north to the south of the strip at least 14 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a residential home in the nerat refugee camp that's in central Gaza the Palestinian civil defense is working as you see there to recover victims from under the rubble dozens of wounded people have been taken to the alaa hospital in daral Bala in a separate attack in nerat the Israeli military bombed a school housing dis placed Palestinians many of them are still trapped inside during Israel's war on Gaza its forces have repeatedly struck schools hospitals and mosques housing displaced Palestinians alaz hanim Mahmud is in deral Bala outside alaka Hospital hany what more have you been able to find out about these attacks on nerat yes just within the past 30 minutes the tragedy started to unfold about the overnight attack on this particular residential home in a NRA refugee camp that has been under heavy aerial bombardment for the past week but this particular residential home it's a three-story building uh full of displaced families have been Sheltering inside the building for the past months but more recently newly displaced families moved to this residential homes seeking shelter uh when it was bombed yesterday one particular family has been inside inside this residential home evacuating all the way from ra City to a refugee camp seeking safety and protection we're inside this residential home now we talked to eyewitness who described the house fully packed with people including many children's entire families they assessed that the number is very close to 100 people were inside this home and just from talking to family who are remaining family members who were waiting for civil defense crew members to uh remove bodies from under the rebels they're talking about it close to 40 people who are still trapped under the reubel so far five of these people have been removed by civil defense crew by paramedics they all transferred here to Ala Hospital there are still more people under the rubel the talks right now is about the difficulty that the civil defense crew members are facing and removing these large pieces of concrete and help those who might have survived the attack and the fact that there is a there there's a newly displaced family under the rebels just one more proof that this really military Narrative of safe zones and evacuation orders have been largely contradictory and misleading people end up within days sometimes within hours being killed inside the the residential home they are taking as a shelter and a protection to provide protection for themselves and their family members on a separate attack Israel military attack also an evacuation Center that's a school that has served for the past months as as a as a shelter humanitarian shelter for displaced families who did not find a place in the Central Area particularly in nor refug Camp to stay in that's what's going on up till this moment we're still waiting for more from the civil defense crew members on the ground who as I stated they're finding it quite difficult to remove uh rubbles and help those who might have survived the attacks has been close to 7 hours or a little over 7 hours right now so the chances are very slim right now meanwhile the Israeli military keep pushing deeper in eastern part of raah city and right now the entire Jan District as well as as Salam and the Brazil neighborhood are under military uh under the control of the Israeli military as they push tanks and armed vehicles in the area those neighborhoods they are at the eastern part of RA City but they are at the western side of Salah Road and that's put put the central part of raah city as well as the western part where hundreds of displaced families are still there inside their tents they put their life at risk as more evacuation orders reach the Kuwaiti hospital where medical staff were ordered by the really military to evacuate the hills facility right away and honey the injured from the attacks that you described earlier many of them have been brought to alaa hospital where you're reporting from we know hospitals are really low on fuel on power how is aloa doing are they still able to provide care and treat patients quite difficult situations inside the hospital just a few minutes before uh I I came for this report I did a brief walk around the hospital and within its corridors and I I could see how overcrowded the corridors let alone the rooms inside the hospital where literally patients and injuries are on the floor of the hospital I could see the exhaustion on the faces of the medical staff who are have been working tirelessly for the past months trying to provide a medical support and medical uh help for the injuries and the patients but the hospital right now is it's working Beyond its capacity it's running out of space and right now the tragedy is it's running out of a fuel and with the ongoing closure of The Crossings and no fuel no other basic necessities including medical supplies and food supplies and also Water Supplies are not being allowed to enter uh the Gaza Strip right now there is a risk that this Hospital uh not only it's shutting down major parts of its services and department but the risk right now is going to reach to the ICU and operation room rooms in which doctors are not going to be able to sustain operations and provide necessary medical intervention to save lives the hospital is hours away from uh being shutting down completely all of its services and this is very consistent with the statement we heard from the Gaza European hospital that is warning within hours it's going to also shut down all operations because of lack of a fuel that prevents it from continuing to provide any medical intervention necessary right now to save lives Al here is honey Mahmud reporting from darl biologist outside alaka hospital where they uh the situation as regards power is critical thank you very much honey make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
