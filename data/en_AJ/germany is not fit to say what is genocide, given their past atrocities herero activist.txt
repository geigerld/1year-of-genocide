now Bangladesh and Colombia have now joined South Africa in claiming that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza Namibia has also criticized Germany for supporting Israel in the genocide case at the international court of justice brought by South Africa in its statement on X Namibia accused its former Colonial ruler Germany of committing the first genocide of the 20th century between 1904 and 1908 more than 70,000 indigenous ero and N people were killed in the massacre namibia's President says Germany is ignoring the lessons of its past atrocities he accused Berlin of supporting a genocide in Gaza while disregarding Israel's killing of Palestinians well let's speak to Israel Kano about this he's a Herrero activist and a member of the namibian NGO Alliance no Amnesty on genocide joining us from Berlin thank you so much for your time a pretty strong me yeah a pretty strong reaction there from namibia's president to Germany's decision to support Israel in in the genocide case brought against it first of all for our International audience who may not be aware about the the past the history the context tell us more about why Namibia is challenging Germany so strongly why you believe that Germany is not fit to tell what is genocide and what isn't genocide yeah first firstly I just want to confirm that South German Namibia was the the the German Colony 1884 to 1915 so it and and secondly this this was the first Cent the first the 20th first 20th century uh genocide it means our land was occupied by the German kaisa troops military confiscating our land Force Labor uh raping and of course the F uh um um concentration camps in our in our country former German Southwest Africa yeah so our the problem is that Germany is still not recognizing us officially as as genocide and um and we are demanding we have three pillars what we are demanding apology um uh recognition of genoside and reparation and up to now Germany is refusing all these three points I my understanding was that sorry to interrupt you but and correct me if I'm wrong my understanding was that in 2018 they had uh apologize for the massacres and announc a scheme for reparations did did that not happen yeah no it it well we as when you read the The Joint declaration in this declaration no word reparation is mentioned no no genocide is is mentioned in this joint declaration that's why we as as Herrero organizations and the opposition parties in Namibia we reject this joint declaration because they don't even mention the word reparation in this declaration right in the statement that the President issued uh he said that Namibia I mean the namibian president said that not only Germany uh committed this first what it says is a first genocide of the 20th century in Namibia that but that many of the horrific tactics which were used against the herero were repeated later on during the Holocaust can you tell us a bit more about the the Herrera experience during uh those massacres they died I understand in the most inhumane and brutal conditions yeah exactly they they died some of them they have to to flee the country to to another country like Botswana and and as as I said many of them died in concentration camps and uh and and of course the you know and today the heras and namas they are demanding their land back which is still occupied by the German settlers 60 to 70% of of of our land is still occupied by the Germans this is our our demands we want our land back we want reparation from Germany because of all these atrocities what we call genocide so these are the most important think that even we were not the the Heros and namas were not involved in these negotiations in Berlin in 2015 yeah and just coming back to the case uh yeah you want U reparations uh and that's understandable but just coming back to the case that's in front of the international court of justice right now on on what's happening in Gaza do you think do you feel Germany support to Israel's defense will have will have uh weight will carry weight will it make a difference for Israel or will it hurt Israel yeah Germany is trying to dodge because they know if South Africa succeed in this case so they they then then the next is Germany because we are we we are we are going to to to through Germany we are not finished with Germany so our solidarity is also with the Palestinian civilian in Gaza and the Palestinian people because their land is occupied and we we had this this experience of occupation and atrocities in in in German Southwest Africa this is what our brothers in Palestina and and Westland you know are now experiencing so this is our solidarity and the government of Namibia is you know is so is also supporting the the South African step to this kind of to the case at the international court of justice thank you so much for your time we really appreciate you talking to us about this Israeli from the namibian NG Alliance no Amnesty on genocide joining us there from Berlin thank you very much for your time okay thank you thank you very much
