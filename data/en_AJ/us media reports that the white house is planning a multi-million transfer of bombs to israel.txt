well the Biden Administration is planning a multi-million dollar transfer of bombs to Israel that's according to the Wall Street Journal the $320 million package includes Precision guided weapons and follows a $42 million transfer of the same weapons back in 2020 well last week the House of Representatives passed a plan providing 14.5 billion dollars in military aid for Israel including $4 billion to replenish its Iron Dome missile defense system us is already receiving $3.8 billion a year in military assistance that's under a 10-year plan that began back in 2016 and Washington's given Israel more military assistance than any other country since World War II providing Aid worth more than $124 billion and all this as the US is deploying a second carrier strike group and other assets to the region including a nuclear powerered Ohio class submarine as a warning to is Israel's adversaries okay let's bring in Glenn car who is a former deputy National Intelligence officer with America's Central Intelligence Agency he's in Boston and with us live a very warm welcome to you now forgive me if I'm stating the obvious but submarines like the Ohio class that's now in the region I gather off the coast of Iran are designed to remain hidden so why are the Americans so adant now that it be seen and by who well they're designed to be hidden from hostile parties uh so that they can't be harmed certainly that's the case in this instance uh it's only the second time in recent years at least that the United States has announced the deployment of a submarine to the Eastern Mediterranean or to what we call in the United States military terminology the central command structure and it's been announced publicly as a deterrent to say here is another another big stick that uh is potentially is there for potential use and that message is sent directly to tan uh saying do not uh expand this crisis beyond the horrors going on in Kum and does Iran one of the so-called axes of resistance countries need to believe that the threat is credible for that deterrence to work oh of course this is is always the the uh fuzzy murky aspect of deterrence is that the the potential opponent has to believe that you the uh person announcing the deployment will actually use the the tools or the weapons that are being sent but in this instance uh the messages have been particularly explicit repeated and direct from the top us leaders and the the deployment of resources of military capabilities has been uh pretty noticeable pretty strong I was we're talking about US military uh Weaponry of course being used in the region we are hearing the sounds of gunfire uh in Gaza uh I mean the region of course is bristling with American Weaponry at the moment on top of uh this uh submarine you've got two strike carrier groups the Ford and the Eisenhower and the Eastern Med how helpful is this gunboat diplomacy when it comes to refusing tensions well I think people will are focusing understandably on goodness look at all these weapons going what why is that that's a very dangerous thing the the perverse reality however is that it is dissuasive and so far it has been quite successful the US has done a number of things or not done a number of things there have been 27 attacks since October 7 by surrogates of Iran on on American uh forces throughout the Middle East there's only been to my knowledge one uh response quite limited however all of that uh lack of action or restraint is combined with uh Stronger deployment of of potential forces to use and the explicit message don't extend to Iran to not extend the conflict now I have to say that tyan has been pretty clear also that it does not want to see the conflict expand into a a regional at the least War so while they continue to send messages to the United States in particular about don't interfere with our capabilities our Iranian capabilities so both sides actually have shown uh happily um that they don't want this to expand while uh sending messages that uh they will act strongly if something happens they crosses a red line which is always fuzzy a red line there seem to be a lot of fuzzy red lines at the moment Glenn car former deputy National Intelligence officer with America CIA many thanks for joining us pleas have
