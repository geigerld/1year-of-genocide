well the director of unra Affairs in Gaza spoke to my colleague Sami Zan earlier from Rafa and says they need a ceasefire in order to deliver the aid the resolution Falls well short of what we need uh here in Gaza we need a uh ceasefire a ceasefire that will stop the killing of civilians uh and the destruction of civilians uh civilian infrastructure in Gaza but most importantly to enable the conditions on the ground here so that we can effectively deliver Aid to the people of Gaza Thomas just to be absolutely clear here as a new day dawned there in Gaza after this resolution are you in any position to increase Aid deliveries because of this resolution or or not at this stage we're waiting to see what will come from the resolution in terms of the amount of Aid that we can bring into Gaza uh but we remain very concerned here that once the aid is in Gaza the ongoing conflict is preventing us from delivering that Aid it is very difficult we are restricted from accessing the population in the north by the Israeli Army but the level of insecurity here means it's very difficult for us to access many of the population and in fact you know at sites where we should be protected our Aid workers should be protected uh they're at risk uh we had one of our staff who is hit uh what by what we understand as tank fire uh into a tractor he was operating at a dump site the other day uh and down on the border itself at the Rafa border crossing we've had three drone drone strikes in recent days so we need to be able to have safe and secure access for Aid workers the convoys that we have to access populations across Gaza are underw facilities the schools that you run your staff any safer today because of this resolution look time will only tell what I can say is that you know we've had 180 of our installations in Gaza many of them hosting people seeking safety uh people seeking safety under a un flag have been hit uh over 200 people have been killed uh in those installations but as the UN Security Council was meeting the other night at the same time messages were being passed to the community in the middle areas of Gaza telling them to evacuate this is telling more people uh to move many of them who' been displaced before to an area that cannot provide them with shelter so at the same time we we were discussing things at the security Council uh the Israeli Army was telling more people to move and signaling a broadening of the the offensive here in Gaza
