the ceasefire is in effect in Gaza and an Airy Cal not seen in seven weeks hangs over the strip the north is in Ruins water and food are in short supply so realistically how much humanitarian Aid can be distributed in Just 4 days this is Inside hello welcome to the program I'm Tom McCrae a ceasefire between Hamas Fighters and Israeli troops is in effect in Gaza at the core of the agreement is an exchange the release of 50 Israeli women in child captives held by Hamas for the freedom of about 150 Palestinians detained in Israeli jails in addition for the 4-day pors and hostilities desperately needed humanitarian Aid will be allowed into Gaza Hamas says about 200 trucks carrying food water medical supplies and fuel will enter the strip daily now that's a fraction of the aid brought into Gaza every day before the war then there are logistical challenges large SES of the strip have been reduced to rubble and many roads are impassable and most of the population has been displaced and the time frame is tight there 4 days long enough and will this Aid make a difference especially if Israel resumes its attacks when the ceasefire ends we'll explore this with our guests in just a moment but first this report by Kaa Lopez hon a break from the Relentless Israeli bombings and air strikes Palestinians in southern Gaza make their way back home shortly after the 4-day ceasefire between Hamas and Israel comes into effect entire neighborhoods raised to the ground with communities managing loss and destruction as as best they can we are full of Hope optimism and pride in our resistance we're proud of our achievements despite the pain this caused we feel pride and dignity 7 weeks into the war families forced into mixhi shelters and Tents are hoping this temporary pause will lead to a permanent ceasefire living like this they say is not sustainable there's little food and widespread hunger there's a lack of management order and safety prices have skyrocketed people have fled from the north with nothing how can they afford anything under the deal Hamas says about 200 trucks of humanitarian Aid will be allowed into Gaza daily carrying food medicine clean water and fuel to power Hospital generators and dis salination plants all basic items that have been inured Supply since October the 7th I came here to get the flower because there are 11 people in my family and we've taken in 40 displaced relatives and friends the relief however may be shortlived Israel says it will resume its bombardment as soon as the ceasefire is over control over Northern Gaza is the first step of a long War we will focus on planning and fulfilling the next stages of the war 2.3 million Palestinians live in Gaza most were dependent on humanitarian Aid before the war now the UN estimates 80% of the population has been forcibly displaced and with the threat of more attacks questions are being raised about whether 4 days of limited assistance will be enough and whether it will reach those who need it most Kia lope oan for Inside Story let's bring in our guest now in rala is nabal fak the spokes person for the Palestine red Cresent Society one of the eight organizations coordinating relief efforts in Gaza in Tel Aviv is AA Elder a political analyst and columnist for the Israeli newspaper heret and also in rala is no OD a writer and political analyst a warm welcome to you all thank you very much for joining us here on inside story nabal if I can begin with you please as I mentioned the red crison helps distribute Aid uh into Gaza can you just give us an update on how that has gone on since the ceasefire began what you hearing from your teams on the ground have there been any issues at all at this stage in in getting Aid in good evening thanks for having me so these four days pause will allow the p and red grass and teams along with honor to receive more humanitarian Aid through RAF crossing water that include fuel food water medical supplies as well as medicine the expectation is to receive around 200 drugs truck although since the beginning of the entry of a humanitarian Aid the daily average is only 45 uh trucks and let's remember that before the escalation the number of a trucks that were're getting into Gaza Strip is around 500 trucks although there there will be an increase of receiving aid it's still a drop in the ocean compared to the humanitarian catastrophe that is uh in Gaza taken into consideration that over two million civilians now are lacking food water medicine and fuel as well our teams will do their best to distribute the aid and deliver the aid to the most uh areas and vulnerable areas to support the Palestinians who are now uh internally displeased in south of Gaza Strip the situation in south of Gaza Strip is disaster many Palestinian hundreds or thousands are in streets with no place to go to others are backing in schools or even at hospital so this Aid will support those Palestinians try to elevate their suffering a little bit by supporting them and providing them with food water relief items as well basically that now it's a huge struggle for every Palestinian in the South to find food or water to the family because the the market after seven weeks of continuous escalation and after over a million and a half Palestinians fled to the south of Gaza Strip is now almost completely empty as we've heard time and again this is nowhere near enough even with the increased in Aid during this ceasefire nor there are so many moving parts to all of this to the ceasefire it's obviously extremely complicated and and very very delicate how difficult do you think it's going to be to enforce all of the different aspects of it especially uh getting Aid to those most in need getting Aid I think will be the most uh sensitive and the most complicated um this all depends uh basically on what Israel allows in um and once the aid goes in and as we heard from thebel it will not be nearly enough but it will be an increase from uh uh the trickle that was coming in over the past 6 weeks um the question will remain on whether enough Aid will be able to reach people in the north where the situation is quite dire and where they haven't uh they've been cut off from the world basically for all those weeks um that I think will be one of the more important tests of this tenuous ceasefire yeah Kea you're in Tel and and we know that the the captives has been the biggest issue for Israel now that the ceasefire is underway has how is all of this being viewed there does the humanitarian situation in Gaza and what is happening to the Palestinians inside the strip does that even get a mention at this point in time um well Tom I think that most Israelis are actually hijacked by the Israeli if you like propaganda and uh if you like it's the reality and the reality since uh October 7th is that there is not enough compassion in the hearts of the average Israeli for both the Israeli captives the thousands of people that are living nearby uh the the victims of the uh vicious attack you know like around my house where I'm sitting right now in half a square kilometer there are two families who lost their sons and one family that uh uh doesn't sleep a minute because they wait to see uh what are the whereabouts of their son a young Soldier 19 years old uh my neighbor visited Washington already twice met with President Biden and uh I I'm afraid that for the first time even people who belong to the Israeli liberal left Merit Labor uh are afraid to speak up their voices you know the only newspaper that really covers it isit and uh the minister of communication just uh submitted a bill to stop advertising uh government a ads in in our newspaper and uh to stop the uh subscription of the all Ministries to Har newspaper this gives you an idea to of the the atmosphere when it comes for it comes com to compassion for the Palestinian refugees okay thank you for for giving us a better understanding of of I guess the the the sense and depth of feeling uh there in Tel Aviv nbal I just want to say uh that Oxfam described the aid that's attached to this ceasefire as a bandaid on a gaping wound That's how little is getting in do you think that enough priority uh has been given to the amount of Aid that was included in this deal so uh as for the humanitarian Aid that was allowed to get U into Gaza Strip up to this moment and even with this increase of aid is it still doesn't fulfill the needs of both first the humanitarian needs which mean the Urgent needs for over 2 million who are in need for food water fuel as well and also doesn't fulfill the need of the health sector after uh most of the hospitals went out of service now only nine hospitals out of 35 are still operating all hospitals are in desperate need for refuel as well as ambulances we are in urgent need for refuel to continue providing our life saving Services through hospitals as well as ambulances the amount of fuel is absolutely not enough and most importantly during these pause uh there as a palant were not allowed to transport the aid to north of Gaza only Ona for example will be today um transporting two Aid trucks to two un facilities in a other than that all hospitals have completely went out of service in Gaza City and north of Gaza and up to this moment even with the humanitarian pause we are unable to transport medical supplies medicine and Aid to north of Gaza and Gaza although hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are still there in Gaza Strip I know in Gaza and the North many will be able to evacuate themselves during these four days how however many they will not because basically there's elderly people people with disabilities people who are sick they will uh be unable to go uh four hours or five hours walking to evacuate themselves to the South and those are in urgent need for medical services they have the right to find a hospital to receive them unfortunately now if you live in Gaza or the North there is not even a single hospital to treat you yeah just heard from the World Health Organization that say that they are deeply concerned about the situation for the 100 or so patients and staff that remain at elifa hospital uh in the north nor do you think that this is a deliberate tactic by Israel to to limit uh access for Palestinians to go back to the north and and also indeed getting Aid to those people that are still stuck there absolutely look the humanitarian um disaster in Gaza is um uh very deliberate and Israel was very clear from day one that they will create This Disaster that they will starve Gaza out of food water medicine and all uh you know fundamentals of life and they're making it extremely clear by deconstructing uh debilitating completely the health system in the north of Gaza that they intend on making Northern Gaza uninhabitable and to give some perspective to the viewers Northern Gaza Gaza City and the northern part not only were the are the most densely populated areas in the in the Gaza Strip but they were also the center of Life the center of Commerce of Education of uh you know Civil Society so to make that part unlivable is to make the Gaza Strip uh unlivable and what we saw was a normalization of that the world watching as a shifa hospital was bombarded late sieg to as patients died inside and as patients remain languishing now unable to get access to medical evacuation we saw the Indonesia Hospital also uh uh um attacked and made to go out of service by Firepower by force um all of that is happening this this humanitarian disaster is not the result of a natural disaster it is man-made and it is maintained by political decision yeah and many would say Obviously deliberate ke as we we've alluded to there's always been the accusation that Israel uses Aid as a mechanism of War as a way to control the population in Gaza is that how you see it is that what is happening here what's Happening Here is uh that uh some Israelis see this humanitarian disaster uh and uh the loss of lives of children women people who are not involved in violence as collateral damage uh but the other on the other hand former Major General the head of the NSC wrote an article in a leading Israeli newspaper arguing that uh a plague and humanitarian disaster is serving Israel's interests because it deters other Arabs other Palestinian not to mess around uh that uh Israel does not stop uh when it comes to uh destroying an enemy and uh you can hear Israel is comparing Gaza to Dresden and mentioning the fact that after World War II or during World War II um the Allies have uh destroyed um German cities and they didn't have have mercy so uh Mercy uh is not very popular these days and uh uh I can some of my best friends whom I considered Liberals are saying well we know that the Hamas were hiding behind civilians they're using hospitals and we saw the footage so we can't take the risk it's other our soldiers that have to come in and clear the area or the Palestinians so it's their responsibility this is the argument uh for the loss of life and the humanitarian crisis after what they did in October 7 so it's kind of a race who is the real victim here yeah that narrative interesting that it has permeated almost all parts of Israeli Society at this point in time uh nbal Netanyahu has said that he was surprised as well as disappointed that Aid organizations hadn't set up uh sheltered full full camps within so-called safe zones within Gaza but is that because there's a worry that they could turn into full-time permanent settlements which would I guess effectively just further displace people within Gaza none of the humanitarian agency enjoyed safe access into Gaza Strip basically we are facing great challenges implementing our humanitarian Mission into Gaza Strip starting from emergency medical services provider who are under attack paramedics healthcare workers ambulances are under attack even the uh icrc as um when tried to transport the aid to north of Gaza Strip and to Gaza was under Target from Israel military so basically this is a huge challenge for or humanitarian agencies in Gaza Strip just to ensure the protection of our workers so we can a able to provide our humanitarian Mission okaya I want to uh get on to what might happen next if this ceasefire continues as it is at this point in time uh being successful I mean Israel's defense minister has said that the overall war is war could likely continue for two months after this uh ceasefire ends I mean is there any appetite at all for being extended within Israel uh first of all uh What uh Israel has in mind right now is to rearrange its forces for the uh next round and uh at the same time to try and get out more captives and uh while Israel is penetrating deeper into Gaza and uh the chances of finding them alive is uh decreasing uh the United States is also joining the scene uh and putting pressure Russia on both sides including Qatar Egypt and uh uh even there are some kind of uh connections with Iran to stabilize the uh region because uh just to remind you Tom theah is part of the deal of the ceasefire and if we go back to the to escalation in Gaza um there might be at the same time escalation in other Frontiers including also the West Bank which we didn't mention but there are zills in the Israeli settlements that are taking advantage of the chaos uh while we are talking about a humanitarian crisis in Gaza uh there is not a humanitarian crisis but uh there is more and more violence and and a kind of uh silent transfer from Palestinian Villages and if the United States will not deal with all those Frontiers comprehensively simultaneously Gaza is not going to be the top of uh the agenda on top of the agenda we are going to see Regional war no in light of that and if this ceasefire is successful I mean it could be start of further negotiations as we've heard extensively especially from the qataris how would they be negotiated in the days and weeks ahead do you think and how difficult will it be to keep these sides together I think pushing the negotiations into a more um uh detailed uh uh um nuanced uh direction will be very difficult and I think that's primarily because there isn't enough um uh inter interal pressure there isn't I I think enough of an international vision of how this monstrous war will end um as Akiva was saying this is not just about Gaza what is happening in Gaza even the humanitarian crisis there is a product of a political crisis and without talking about a political solution that will treat the situation in the entirety of the occupied Palestinian territory that will calm tensions with Lebanon that will uh um make sure that this doesn't spill over into a regional war after the four days and even if they extend to six or eight days we're looking at a further deterioration at a situation that is far worse than the five or six weeks that have already passed um but it doesn't up until now I don't see many signals of an American Vision for how this should go or an American willingness in the Biden Administration to push the sides in that direction I think there would be enough Arab pressure uh on Hamas and maybe other Palestinian actors but I don't see the uh Israeli government feeling enough heat to talk end game and an end game that is acceptable that is sustainable not an end game where you would see people forcibly displaced or an end game where you would see the side of Gaza shrink or an end game where you would see the rest of the West Bank devoured by the settlement regime that's I think what is now imminent and what uh uh the international attention should be focused on okaya do you think that Netanyahu is is isn't really feeling the heat at this point in time because we have heard plenty about his political W I mean how is he viewed now now that the ceasefire is underway and how uh it goes how could that influence what actually happens next uh first of all netan has a clear interest uh to make sure that uh this ceasefire is just a kind of a break in a very bad concert that uh you are forced to go back and listen to it after the short break and uh as long as uh the uh uh guns are shooting uh the uh political arena is quiet um he will not be removed before the war is over and you know the still the the court is waiting for him uh the uh Israeli public opinion is fed up with him there will be an inquiry about uh the disaster of uh October 7th and uh the main question is how long will guns and uh his colleagues from the uh Center center right party uh will offer him the backing it it will not be very popular to leave him alone just first of all because we don't trust him and uh second of all because Israel the Israeli public wants to see unification the people can see everywhere those Billboards together we will win and this works for netan and uh uh I think that it might even take as long as a year before uh we will have to stop or before the International Community will get involved I read very carefully the opad by President Biden but I I do hope that he also read what he wrote Nal we've only got a minute or two a minute or two left as we heard the the pressure from the International Community on those making the decisions in Israel is potentially the most important thing to make sure that this ceasefire holds and indeed continues what is your message to those around the world uh that want to see this piece last I have sent and along with my organization the palestin red Cresent um hundreds of messages to the world leaders to the International Community unfortunately nothing happened unfortunately the world has turned their back to us and we are still struggling trying our best to save other people's life to support Palestinian civilians in gasp who have been under continuous bombardments that is taken place day and night there's no safe place in Gaza we have been under attack under Target I have lost four colleagues 24 others were injured and unfortunately Ely nothing happened from the International Community even we are discussing the situation of hospitals Israel was a strategically targeting hospitals from the first moment of this escalation they have issued 24 evacuation orders for hospitals in north of Gaza we have refused the evacuation what happened they P the hospitals they attacked the hospitals they open fire at the hospitals they denied access of humanitarian Aid and medical supplies now their goal is is implemented No One hospital in Gaza and the north is working all out of service my last call for the International Community they should stand up for Humanity this escalation should put into an end we need a complete ceasefire an end for this war because basically Palestinian civilians are paying the cost of this continuous escalation none of one palestinia has not been affected by the world either you lo you lost your loved one you lost your home or you became internally displeased in Gaza this suffering has to be put to an end well let's hope that uh the world is listening
