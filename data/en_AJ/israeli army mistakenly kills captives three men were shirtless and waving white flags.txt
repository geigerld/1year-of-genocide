well to discuss the Israeli military report on its soldiers killing those three Captain I'm joined Now by military analyst Elijah maner good to have you with us sir uh joining us from Brussels can we just talk about Israel's Rules of Engagement and what they are because now we're seeing civilians Palestinian civilians being shot killed and targeted and now we're seeing Israeli captives also being shot and killed without any sort of questioning of who they are it seems well I think the is really version of the army was not ready to see its uh soldiers that were in captivity walking around is quite silly it depends on the objectives and the professionalism and the respects of international laws that are taught to the Army in engaging in a battlefield so if the objectives were to liberate not to execute the host ages as it happened the Army would not flood the tunnels and would not go and kill anyone who is moving even civilians or their own soldiers carrying White Flag or they will not reject the ceasefire which take us to the professionalism of the Army and the instructions giving to the Army from the professional point of view it is obvious that the psychological effect of the Warfare being exposed to such an intense combat situation is dearly affecting the psychology of the soldiers increasing their anxiety paranoia we've seen how the special forces the Golan Brigade went in the shua and in the last 48 hours they've lost 20 men including the head of the unit and several officers so we understand from that that the soldiers are on edge they no longer confident they are afraid of the effectiveness of the Palestinian resistance Mr Man can I just can I just jump in there we certainly get a sense of what you're saying just a few days ago we saw uh IDF footage of them parading half- naked Palestinian men with their hands on their head um uh searching them for weapons a and paraded as captives there the Israelis felt they were safe that had half naked men some in their underwear and no threat yet these men were also half naked walking across uh a battlefield with white flags and yet they were treated very differently you you talk about professionalism there's incompetence here as well is there not it's a very high level of incompetence and also depend on the circumstances those the Israelis have shown us half naked they went into the school and arrest them and ask them to strip off so they knew who they were dealing with in this case the three soldiers they are professionals they understand that they have to take off their shirts to make sure that the Army understand they not coming with bombs and suicide bombers they're not going to attack them and they're raising White Flag the situation is completely different the first one is at ease the soldiers went in and they understood their old civilians and the second case they were confronted with a real Battlefield and they showed how their lack of training how their lack of confidence but above all what you rightly mentioned at the third beginning the rule of Engagement so what is the rule of Engagement that are giving to the Army in the battlefield kill anyone who and indeed does does this sort of behavior breach the Geneva Convention or does Israel work on a different premise one being the Hannibal Doctrine the Hannibal Doctrine would apply when the Israeli know that there is a a certain route or a location where there are the hostages and uh the kidnappers in this case it doesn't apply because they are confronted with a situation where they if had they respect international law and the Geneva Convention they would have acted in a very cold approach asking the three soldiers to be on the floor and come and inspect them or even from a distance to understand who they were dealing with but because they are killing indiscriminately any person in Gaza and that is the objective of the operation is not to liberate the prisoners as bam nany said but to destroy Gaza and its inhabitant because had the objective were rightly as nanyo said at The First beginning we want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hamas capability and liberate our prisoners that the Army would not have shot the three men because they were in looking for the prisoners and not looking how to execute them El man joining us from Brussels thank you so much for your analysis so let's bring in Nadine Madi professor of media and communication at katar University he's also author of the global media coverage of the Palestinian Israeli conflict could have you with us back on the program let's just talk about the media coverage of this particular incident because okay now you've got the Israeli media really focusing on their own being killed by their own and there are media organizations and countries across the world who have you might say been a little bit more sympathetic to the Israeli uh position who can't ignore this and we'll have to report that the Israelis really didn't know what they were doing and kill their own I mean this is this is obviously has nothing to do with professionalism it has to do with revenge and the way um the Israeli government and its media apparatus are trying to Market or kind of disseminate information about this this this this act of Revenge um all of the civilians we've been seeing on on International Global um um screens I think it does remind about it does remind about the war in Iraq the war in Afghanistan and the way civilian people have been kind of dehumanized when they were stripped off their clothes there are lots of accounts of families and women who said how they were men were separated those people are civilians there is no proof for the Israeli government to show that those people any of them has been carrying weapons any arms or they are threat to anyone but there is a level there is a level of incompetence is in there here in the sense that absolutely you do not brief your soldiers correctly in even recognizing potential Israeli captives in a war zone as they as they describe it who may become free and and that option that alternative in briefings just wasn't even considered no absolutely I mean and this is not by the way the first mistake or the first kind of catastrophe by the by the Israeli Army I mean there are many many of them there are now accounts that on this 7th of October there was also another catastrophic event where Apaches they actually hit Israeli uh settlers uh where Hamas people and other and others invaded the uh the place so I I think this is this is not the first the first instance I think there are lots of instance but this is an accumulation of the malf functionality not only between the communication but also the lack of professionalism in the Israeli Army we've been kind of hearing accounts of this is the most professional Army in the the world the most well-trained army in the world and we have proofs in front of us they couldn't even capture one uh person from the people who are wanted by the by the Israeli government and so now we go back to you might say the negotiating table because we're now seeing talks between uh Israel and interlocutor Qatar to talk about either release of captives or another ceas fire how are you reading the situation right now well I think it's complex and there are there is a kind of conflict information to be honest I mean we we hear we hear a message from the US from the Biden Administration also we hear a slightly different message from the Israeli government but for sure that the Kat broker they they are doing their best to kind of come to a certain uh conclusion to the catastrophe that is befalling on the Palestinian people the Kat government has been kind of behind the scenes doing a huge amount of diplomacy kind of networking and works between the US the Egyptians but also the the Israelis in general and we know and we see it I mean whether in the media and whether on on on on other platforms so I think the unfortunately the picture now is still vague but what we know exactly for sure and what we see on in front of us whether on social media and so forth is is is is the continuation of the bombardment the annihilation of Palestinian people whether in Gaza or in the uh West Bank and other Palestinian cities or we be imp picking more of what's going on certainly as the evening progresses for the moment nin Madi thank you for joining us thank you
