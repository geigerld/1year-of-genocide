in a way the Palestinians do represent the whole world and I think through immense Carnage and unspeakable sacrifice maybe Palestinians watching all of this can change the entire [Music] world taking Center Stage today is Peter oborn a respected journalist and political commentator he's authored a number of books including the rise of political lying and the Triumph of the political class he was the former Chief political commentator of the Delhi Telegraph and writes a political column for Middle East eye in today's episode he discusses the role of the media in shaping The Narrative around the war on Gaza and the growing divide in the west between the political stance and the public opinion Peter oor uh thank you very much for joining us for Center Stage it's an honor to have you here um I'd like to start this conversation on off with a few of your words now you said at times of Crisis the job of the Statesman is to resolve problems not inflame them to show wisdom and to ignore popular clamor to remind all parties of their obligations under international law so my question to you is how have Western governments handled this situation since October 7th I'm afraid the uh West governments have disgraced themselves um being British uh to see a Rishi sunak the British prime minister go to uh T Aviv after leading Israeli politicians have started to make really terrifying genocidal statements and say we are unequivocally with uh with the state of Israel of course it was right for Mr sunak as British prime minister to go and express his immense sympathy and and love for the uh the people who died and express his shock and horror and express support but just given unequivocal support um was the wrong language he should the a Statesman would have gone and said look you have to respond but no uh be wary don't commit war crimes don't kill innocent civilians uh and that is what the uh British and other Prime Ministers around the world did the President Biden has been particularly has been a tragic figure I'm afraid in this uh business where he's questioned the statistics of the people killed in Gaza he's um gone on giving sort of un sort of immense sort of military aid He has blocked I mean I think this last few days have been horrible the blocking of the humanitarian ceasa by the US president uh I think this is turning into one of the darkest moments in American history well they do have the elections coming up next year as well for 2024 how will this affect Biden's Run next year well I'm not an expert on American uh politics but you read well you also have the UK elections next year we have we do indeed um well let's in that case just have a little brief glance a at Kama the labor of the opposition which is the great um Progressive Party in Britain and of course uh sakir is a very distinguished uh human rights lawyer and this disastrous moment which I think will come to haunt him for the rest of his life when he was asked if he supported Collective punishment um which the Israelis were talking about very early on you know deprivation of food water and he said yes they have the right to do that it was horrifying to hear K stard he had an opportunity as the leader of the labor party in Britain to be a standing rebuke to Rishi sunx slavish support for the for the actions of the IDF and the Israeli State and he and he didn't take it he didn't know how to take it and so there is it was a matter of Despair at that point for the conduct of the British political class and of course the British media class the newspapers as well well let's talk about the um the political class and the ongoing divide with its people and I think what's been interesting to see is that you have hundreds and thousands of people in support of Palestine but when it comes to the political class it's the total opposite so what's this saying about the gap between the politicians politicians or the the government and the people and not just in Britain but in the Western Hemisphere yeah I've been on uh the March marches my wife my daughters have been on the March is and to be called by a British H secretary soel bravman hate Marchers um is unforgivable it was framed uh as the Palestinians were terrorists uh the enemies of all everything that is decent and all we were doing was Marching for peace and so that I mean we've seen the horrific images and you know marching so that babies wouldn't be killed bombed and to be and so there is a and this kind of language by sella braan the Home Secretary was supported by um by the Prime Minister it was and if you read the newspapers it's reported there you know the the Marchers get vilified a tiny little episode you know every March that ever been attracts some people who go slightly you know behave badly and that gets massive they'll focus in they'll zoom in on that one who's acted badly and then tar a brush with the rest and it's unfair so what you have if you look at the opinion polls is you know you have 70% of of people wanting a ceasefire British people very sympathetic to the uh plight of the Palestinians and yet the mainstream media it's almost 100% behind the Israeli bombardment and the mainstream politicians are 100% that labor and Tory behind the Israeli bombardment and this shows a a a terrifying Gulf it it reminds me in some ways of the Iraq War um and uh when when we got these magn these marches then against the invasion of Iraq a and these were very powerful moments and uh Tony Blair of course the ven prime minister paid a a very high price in terms of his reputation and I think Briton paid a very P high price for being slavish to the United States but nothing's change well we are well we we are paying that price again because we are clearly I'm very proud to be British or I was and uh I felt I always believed that being British means being decent fair-minded observing the rule of law and actually the thing most of all is supporting the underdog yes the Brits are known to go for The Underdogs whether it's in life sport anything but on this occasion it seems to be the total opposite and so what our government is shocking um and I don't think they represent the British people people but they do represent Britain I listened very carefully to Antonio G Gutierrez and of all the other speakers but what he was saying he was so angry about the ceasefire that the UN had been General Assembly had been ignored and he said he's going to go on trying but what I think he was doing was saying to Biden this is on you let's imagine that the Law Courts decided decide it's a genocide President Biden's decision to veto a humanitarian ceasa would mean that America has aided and abetted a genocide Now isn't that a moment of total shame it should be well it will be I mean I we can't say I'm just and so that was a terrible moment in American history the same I'm afraid I was a Brit I didn't like Britain abstaining it's an act of moral CES so why why did they I mean they know that their people aren't happy with what they're doing so why why aren't they listening to them they see they see what's happening but they're going against it what they say is uh there's two things let what they say is that the statement should have had a condemnation of of Hamas as well but look think of it like this as we speak and it's so horrifying I can't sometime as we speak there are children dying in the rubble it's chaos Carnage in Gaza and yet because of a little technicality the British the British can't what is effectively technicality in the in the face of there Calamity happening at the moment the British have to abstain because of the the lack of any sense of morality from Britain and the United States it's a very uh profound moments I think I want to turn our attentions to the role of the media the media the public and politics now um when you're watching the coverage I just want to know what you've been fearful about what what are your views on it when you've watched I don't know Al jazer CNN BBC well how has it played a part in again contributing to The Divide I mean we've seen an increase in people being attacked they've been anti-semitic or islamophobic it's there's been no say no peace but I suppose the media could have played a part in there I mean what do you think about the role of the media in that respects look this is an ancient this is the long ongoing problem is that the media vilifies uh minorities um and we have seen a rise of of anti-Semitism and also islamophobia or anti- Palestinian anti-arab uh stuff and and it's inflamed this is inflamed by politicians above all um the conservative Home Secretary sella braan who just sees her job or saw her job before she she was finally got rid of as inflaming hatred that is not the job of a why would she we're already in a sensitive time situation why would a politician do something like that what could they possibly gain well it is unfortunately very easy to see what they gain return to the C this is a I mean this is about the suffering of the people of Gaza and Palestine but the is also this terrible crisis has highlighted a a moment of collapse in in Liberal democracy the global system which has has governed the world since as a whole since 1945 and something very frightening is happening the attack on liberal de democracy is not coming as before World War II in the 1930s when it was the axis p uh molinis Italy Germany Japan which which took took down the global world world order it's actually the liberal democracies themselves now which are taking down the global World Order and what you're seeing in politicians like braan and there's other ones of generic others members of the cabinet they're encouraged by the British prime minister sunak who isn't strong enough really to deal with this and across Europe of course uh what you're seeing is the the the emergence of a new vicious right and in Britain we're seeing an attempt to capture the conservative party by a a group of people who are much closer to the afd in Germany or the for National in France how do you close the gap I mean look the fact that it sounds like politicians are using this for their own game like it'ss like it is a game to them how do we close this Gap how do we stop that I well we I think first of all we need to wake up to the fact that and and Gaza has has sh has shed a huge light on this there is a a a there is an assault on human rights democracy everything we fought for for so long across the world but but and we have a fight we have a fight in Britain I feel this we have a fight on our hands to preserve the kind of De relatively look I mean as you know there's plenty of faults in Britain uh but the a political structure which was pluralistic and decent and or tried to be and which will and stop it been captured by very bad people and it's not obvious that we can win this fight but this is what we've got on our hands you can see the same thing going on in the states I mean where it's it's almost terminal I'm going to to finish how I started and again with your words you said I pray that I'm wrong but I fear Western leaders are now establishing the political Foundation that would leave us complicit in massacres indiscriminate bombing and ethnic cleansing now we all know that you know hindsight is 2020 how will history look back on the western governments in this conflict well I I think I wrote that very early on in after after October the 7th and unfortunately those words have been completely Justified and I think the enormous unbearable suffering of the Palestinian people can in a some way you I think in a way the Palestinians do represent the whole world the suffering of the world The Underdogs the the poor the hope the people who are op pressed rest and I think through sacrifice maybe the Palestinians watching all of this can change the entire world and make us learn something let's hope so um Peter oborn I really appreciate you being here Center Stage today thank you so much conversation
