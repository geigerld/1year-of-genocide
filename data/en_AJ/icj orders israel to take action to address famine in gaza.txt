joining me now in the studio is Mustafa bouti the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative party thank you for joining the program Mr buti so I wanted to start by getting your reaction to these new measures that have been introduced by the icj in order to get more food Aid into Gaza do you think it's going to make a difference the situation on the ground it's an important step and it should be followed actually by another uh resolution uh to enforce uh complete and total cessation of all military activities by Israel which means an order from the international court of justice demanding immediate ceasefire in the language that they usually use which is secession of military activities or or hostile activities uh I think this is now uh very important to achieve and uh I think this would have an impact at uh at many levels but it is clear that Israel will not stop unless sanctions are imposed on Israel unless punitive acts are taken to force Israel to stop Netanyahu wants to proceed with this terrible war and he is now even promising a EI even a much bigger Massacre by attacking grafa the reaction from the International Community to the last icj ruling which was back in January was muted in fact the day after the focus of many countries was on pulling funding out of are you disappointed in how the International Community has reacted to the events in Gaza of course we are disappointed especially by Western governments and especially by the United States which by the way tried to even mute the most recent decision of the security Council resolution by creating a debate about whether it is obligatory or not obligatory I mean and and this was not part of any discussion of course any Security Council resolution obliges all members of the United Nations to implement it or to respect it United States is playing a game here and continues to support Israel and of course uh that has created a very dangerous moment at the International Community this particular uh aggression by Israel this particular genocide that Israel is practicing and the fact that so many Western governments are providing protection to Israel allowing it to continue is going to disturb the whole International order it simply sends a message to the world that there is no more international law that's very dangerous we did finally see a vote pass at the UNC calling for a ceasefire uh does that give you hope though that that something has changed just a little bit that the International Community is now finally starting to wake up to what is happening in Gaza yes but what gives me hope really are not these governments that have been so lazy and so much delaying the decisions they should they should have made five months ago but what gives me hope is the people of the world the people who forced many governments to change their position the public pressure that made Canadian government suspend and stop supplying Israel with military equipment the same public pressure that is taking place now in Britain and France and Europe everywhere in the world and that public pressure in my opinion will lead now to wide range of sanctions and uh and punitive act against acts against Israel sanctions and boycot this is what worked in the case of South Africa and this is what would work in the case of Israel and look at what's happening there they are having some sort of collapse internally they are even unable to make decisions because the world is fed up with their crimes you are from Gaza originally uh I believe you've already lost some family uh during the course of this I'm from West Bank not from Gaza but but you have family in in Gaza U apologies how how do you feel when you look at the images on the screen of the children that are now starving uh and the suffering that people have endured how do you look at it all and and take it in it's beyond shock uh this morning I was talking to my colleagues we have 32 Medical Teams working there uh one of of them was describing to me what happened they've been besieged for 11 days by Israeli tanks his brother was killed the children of his brother were killed he had to take uh a big risk by running away from his house and he told his children either we will be die while we are staying here because they are bombarding us or let's take the risk and run away he told me horrible stories about families being burned inside houses completely burned at killed families totally eliminated 23 one family lost 23 another 116 another the whole place around shifa hospital is completely destroyed now it's very huge pain because the people who are dying are people I know uh some of them are people I've worked with some of them have have done wonderful work in their life to help their own people and now they're dying and what hurt most is that I was talking to one journalist whom whom I didn't speak to for about since the beginning of the war and I was happy to hear his voice and I asked him how are you doing and he said you know I'm okay I lost my wife and my child and I said oh I'm very sorry I feel very sorry for that he said it's all right many others have lost more people it's really so painful to hear such a thing or to see that baby who is 5 years old who lost both of his hands asking his father father will my hands grow again when I grow up this is the kind of atrocity and the kind of suffering that many leaders in the world refuse to see and sometimes I ask myself have they lost any ability to feel the Pains of others Mr bakti Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative initiative party thank you for your time thank you
