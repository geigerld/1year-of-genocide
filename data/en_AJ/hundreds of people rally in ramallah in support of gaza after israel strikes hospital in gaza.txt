now the hospital Massacre has triggered protests in the occupied West Bank with hundreds of Palestinians rallying in ramala demonstrators again turned out to show solidarity with the people of Gaza this comes after people took to the streets on Tuesday night and were confronted with Palestinian Security Forces H Abdul Hamid joins us live from romala so take us through first of all the state of the streets right now a sense of anger definitely a sense of anger and that voice being louder and louder every day as we speak now uh Osama might turn the camera and show you there's a protest here on Manara Square which is the center of ramala it's been going on for a few hours now but by and large it's been uh peaceful they are uh Palestinian security forces and the surroundings uh but they are keeping away and there's no interference between them and the protesters which is a completely different scene from what we have seen last uh night when there was a lot of chaos on the Square was sound grenades and tear gas being fired also exchange of gun fire between the Palestinian security forces and um uh gunman uh we don't know who they were but certainly that happened well today's a completely different scene we did hear reports about uh protests also in other towns uh around the occupied West Bank we know that there was some tension between the Palestinian uh security forces and protesters in nablo but we haven't heard about any sort of of that evolving into something bigger at this uh stage uh certainly the message coming out of here is in support of Gaza if I could jump in because we we understand there also been calls for Mahmud Abbas to step down how much of a difficult position does it put the head of the PA in well there have been a few chance last night and today sprinkled in the middle of other slogans that they have been chanting Mahmud Abbas is in a very difficult position he's been at a difficult position already before uh this crisis you know the major majority of the population here in the occupied West Bank is very young and they feel that somehow Mahmud Abbas is a bit out of touch are they're infuriated that uh he keeps on wanting to pursue a peace process these ords that they don't know about they were actually born after that was signed and they haven't seen any fruits of Peace since the beginning of of this crisis he had been by and large silence he hadn't shown himself until last night um he was in Jordan when the the news about that attack on the um Hospital there in Gaza it started spreading and the protesters came to the square and it's at this stage that he decided to pull out and return immediately here and that's when the first time he addressed the Palestinian people I think he had no other move really at that stage and no other choice but to come back here and to be among the Palestinians all right Abdul Hamid there thanks so much
