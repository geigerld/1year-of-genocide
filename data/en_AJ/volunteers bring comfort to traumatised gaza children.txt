a brief moment in the heart of the war zone where the Tran of Gaza can play just like others their age elsewhere we fled the war and taken shelter in this school building today we're very happy we had fun with clowns and toys this school in Rafa is one of many Sheltering Palestinians forced from their homes there filled with children trying to escape the horrors of Israel's Relentless attacks as the Israeli military prepares for a ground offensive in the city where they're seeking Refuge our house was destroyed and we were forced to leave today we had the chance for some fun we played with our friends and had a wonderful time Israel's military assault on Gaza is already having an unparalleled effect on children not only do they account for the majority of civilians killed many survivors are severely traumatized which some volunteers are trying to help them overcome we're a team of volunteers trying to listen the suffering of our children those who were displaced from the north our charity has been active in ra since 2017 this is our duty especially at this dark time of War for hundreds of thousands of children across Gaza their wish is simple I hope the war ends and we continue to play like today more joy and more happiness to come Julie dger Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
