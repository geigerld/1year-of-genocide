we begin with breaking news just north of Rafa two in southern Gaza two Al jazer journalists have been injured in an Israeli drone strike correspondent ishma Abu Omar and cameraman Ahmed Mata were both hit Mata we understand is in serious condition they've been transferred to the European hospital for treatment mean while in Khan yunas the Israeli Army has destroyed the northern gate and the wall of the NASA medical complex it's besieged those buildings for weeks NASA is the biggest hospital in gaza's South Israeli forces have told everyone Sheltering inside to evacuate the premises it's thought that hundreds of displaced Palestinians are there well let's go straight to our correspondent on the ground hanim mmud he joins us now from Rafa in the South honey do we know how ishma and Ahmed are talk us through what happened yes well another tragedy against a journalist on the ground covering what's going on within the past 45 minutes our colleagues in Al jazer Ahmed Abu Omar Al jazer correspondent as well as his cameraman Ahmed mat in Northern rafah particularly in morage area that's in the northern part of rafah City they were in a fieldwork documenting the living conditions of this place Palestinian displaced families in that particular area and documenting the horror that they have experienced and lived through within the past 24 hours as massive air strike targeted a major parts of Rafa City where close to 100 people have been killed they were directly targeted by a the missile fired by a drone uh directly targeting uh them as they were uh right there covering the Palestinians family in tents and inside residential homes and in evacuation zones both of them were rushed to a naar hospital that's in central RAF about 15 to 20 minutes away from the side that they were targeted but the fact that a naar hospital is a midsize Hospital doesn't have the sufficient uh medical uh staff number of medical staff to conduct a proper medical intervention uh to treat them they were transferred both of them were transferred right away a big to a bigger health facility uh in northern part of the city that on salahadin road that's the Gaza European Hospital way where they uh underwent a immediate surgeries unfortunately uh a colleague ahed Omar abar uh went through the surgery where his leg had to be amput mated as the shrap Nails fracture uh the bones of his legs to the point that it was not it was not attached properly they had the doctors had to amputate his leg just to save his life oh goodness Hy as you were saying this isn't the first time that journalists have been targeted in this war dozens of journalists have been killed in Gaza since October the 7th and so many of our colleagues have also lost their families yes this is not the first incident definitely not the first one and we're expecting this is not the last one there is ongoing systematic uh almost consistent attacks on journalists and uh there are more than a 100 journalist since the beginning of this war have been targeted some were targeted individually others were their families were targeted and killed we have colleagues from Al like for example mfi who lost his entire family we have colleague Sam from Al jaaz as well cameraman who lost his life as he was covering doing coverage of situations on the ground along with the the director of Gaza Bureau Al jaaz Bureau in in Gaza we have who experienced the same huro when his family was targeted and later on his son was killed as well so these are the just examples of the ongoing direct attacks to the point uh it seemed it looks like there is a certain Joy taken by uh the military when it inflects so much pain and so much uh difficulties uh on the life of everyone here including a journalist and just um for our viewers who who might be joining us that the pictures that you're seeing to the left of your screen are indeed of our colleagues and um just moments ago you saw one of our colleagues there lying on the ground very very clearly wearing a flat jacket marked press and we know that that multiple journalists wearing press markings throughout this war have indeed been targeted some killed some injured hany just the last time we spoke what a couple of hours ago you were telling me that you yourself have been fearing for for the safety of of you and your family there in Rafa give us an update on the situation on the ground at the moment no one clearly is feeling safe absolutely no want to surf and as we said that repeatedly in the past and we're going to say it one more time there are no terms to this genocidal War everyone is a target so far we've seen a the patterns of killing the pattern of Destruction that uh reachs to everyone the elderly the women the children and also the babies and those who are suffering from critical Health complications happen to be also the target Target of the Israeli military and its intense bombing campaign it's just people Sheltering inside residential homes or those in the streets and Mak Chef T have been also the targets of the ongoing uh bombing campaign to the point it feels like everyone is a target this word is not directed to a certain group or a certain uh set of people but it looks from the pattern of killing the pattern of Destruction that everyone is a Target and has been a Target either by being eliminated completely or by uh turned into a disabled person or just turning more children into orphan as we've seen the examples of the more than 11,000 children who have been killed or those that 177,000 have been separated uh from their families due to the ongoing uh pounding the situation RA are getting very very tense by the hours and there is an expectation as more drones in the skies of R there would be more bombings and more destruction within the coming hours so you are watching these images to the left of your screen there of our colleague ishal Abu Omar as we were just hearing from hany he's had to have his leg amputated in order to save his life after this strike we know that it's not just journalists who've been targeted you've been watching the medical staff there working very hard to make sure that they they can save ish's life we know that medical staff and hospitals have become Target in this war to
