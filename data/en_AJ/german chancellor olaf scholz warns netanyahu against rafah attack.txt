well the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against his plans for that ground offensive and Rafa the two leaders met in West Jerusalem and Schultz urged Netanyahu to protect civilians in Gaza and also highlighted the need for humanitarian Aid he says the world cannot stand by as Palestinians risk starvation the longer the war lasts the higher the number of Civilian casualties Rises the more desperate the situation of the people in have become the more this backs the question no matter how important the goal can it justify such terribly high costs or are there other ways to achieve your goal take the ground of fensive in Rafa the military logic is one consideration but there is a humanitarian logic as well how should more than 1.5 million people be protected where should they go we've just had uh uh I think a very serious conversation an important conversation among friends uh you express your concern for two things one protecting civilians and second uh provision of humanitarian Aid and I explain that these are our concerns as well uh because we agree with both goals leaders and Egypt are also warning against Israel's plannned offensive and Rafa Egyptian president Abdul fat CI met the European commission president Ela V Deion in Cairo there she announced an8 billion Aid package for cash strapped Egypt some of that money will be used to secure borders and to limit the flow of migrants we are all extremely concerned about the war in Gaza and the unfolding catastrophic humanitarian situation Gaza is facing F and it is critical to achieve an agreement on the ceasefire Rue now that frees the hostages and allows more humanitarian Aid to reacha and we are very concerned about the risks of full scale offensive in ra that would be devastating for vulner civilian well let's bring in rck Brookner he is a professor of European studies at Stanford University in Berlin he joins us live from there now oric it feels like we've seen quite the shift from V and I remember when she flew to Israel in those days after October 7th and then also given the history very strong words from Schultz what is behind this shift is this about public opinion no I think one has to differentiate from the very first beginning we had more than a year of a European Union criticizing what's going on in Israel and in Nan's government in particular about Democratic backsliding and there were criticism about corruption cases and the criticism kept going and the differentiation was always present when either the foreign minister of Germany or the chancellor talked to high officials of the Israeli government and the way it was portrayed in Arab media was its black and white Germany stands side by side with Israel and backs whatever violation of international law this is not the case so therefore it's not a swing to the other end but maybe the tone became much more explicit but the differentiation has always been part of the German and the European Union political position well it was interesting to see the tone of this press conference that just took place Netanyahu was saying this was a and I'm quoting it serious but important conversation amongst friends what is actually being said behind closed doors how much influence does Germany have right now on Israel well unfortunately the influence is not very strong there is no such thing like a dependency on delivering weapons compared with the United States influence it's really small and given the current situation in which the netan government is fighting for survival with the support of the divided Society in Israel he probably doesn't care about trade relations or access to the European single Market this used to be a leverage in peace times but at the moment I don't really see that there is much leverage so all Schultz can do is naming and shaming if things go in the wrong direction and it clearly goes in the wrong direction because a military solution a military strategy that is so short sided that that it doesn't have a plan what to do afterwards and what the humanitarian costs of this is is simply a political loss that will last much longer than any potential victory that one can claim like mission accomplished you say naming and shaming is there do you think an increasingly unified position amongst European allies there have been deep divisions during the course of this war well I wouldn't call it a deep division there are some countries that simply have more room for maneuver to openly criticize if things go in the wrong direction Germany always used a more diplomatic position they underlined the right of Israel for self-defense but they also underlined that it has to be proportional what Israel is doing and in a situation in which the most densely populated part in the whole region is subject to a massive military attack there is not much of a proportion not to speak of a plan B what to do with the people this is of course a terrible situation for the Palestinians in the region but everyone in the wider Middle East has to ask ask him or herself what is my contribution to make people less suffer and not only point the finger at Israel let me ask you within the context of of what we're seeing in the Gaza Strip now what do you make of the aid promises from Europe we've also been hearing criticism that this kind of parallel Aid infrastructure the air drops the the maritime Corridor is making to some extent these other countries complicit in in allowing Israel to continue its War well what would be the alternative to watch people dying and then writing a chapter in the history book of a terrible disaster that keeps going that we watch people dying because we didn't do anything so I think this is part of a package in which the few things the European Union can do to use diplomatic initiatives like what yep Morel did a few days ago to invite the world community to put pressure on everyone in the region to find a two-state solution and provide as much as possible as humanitarian Aid with air Bridges with a delivery from Cyprus and to reach out to countries in the region to support people in need this is what counts the most you say there were no other options left I mean the other option would have been to have Israel open the land borders now the US potentially has the leverage to do that the European allies of the US clearly have some influence there is this basically an acknowledgement that that Europe has no influence over over Israel when it comes to requesting humanitarian access well as I said in the beginning The Leverage from the Europeans is very very limited compared with what the United States theoretically can do but Biden is under pressure because his country is divided between strong supporters of the Palestinian point of view and a very strong Jewish lobbying group and it's an election year so theoretically he could do much more than anyone else practically it will fire back and it will have a high cost if he only takes one side oric bner there professor of European studies at Stanford University in Berlin always great to get your thoughts and Analysis on aler thank you for joining us again or thanks for having me
