well we're joined Now by Mark oen Jones associate professor of Middle East studies at hammed bin Khalifa University in Doha good to have you on the program we'll talk about President Biden's dilemas in a moment let's just talk about the icj ruling at the moment um to let more Aid in unhindered and there should be a ceasefire I mean what are the chances of this well let's look what happened last time the icj ruled provisional measures in January uh actually there was a decrease in the amount of Aid getting into Gaza after that so just because the icj have have have put this ruling forward doesn't necessarily mean that Israel are going to comply uh and let's not forget that the am overall amount of Aid has been peace meal we're looking at um a third of what is required pre-war um the only thing that will increase or has seen a spike in Aid is essentially a ceasefire so without a ceasefire we're unlikely going to see more Aid going into Gaza so the ceasefire needs to really come before that otherwise what Israel's response is just is just rhetoric I'm afraid from what we've heard from our correspondents just now is the bombing continues the snipers are still firing at Palestinians and the brutality of the Israeli forces is quite evident on screen with that recent footage that we showed in the last 24 hours of two unarmed Palestinians being shot on a beach and their bodies being buried uh it seems by a bulldozer uh in the sand it's caught the attention of the Americans they've been commenting on it today is it just a comment well actually I think it's a really interesting point because we know as you said that Americans I think are increasingly uh frustrated by how Israel are Prosecuting the war some completely hostile and the polling suggested we've actually seen a shift in public opinion in the US uh to people opposing the war and let's also not forget that for Biden Democrats even opposed what Israel were doing in Gaza uh 3 four months ago now that number is increased but it's also increased among Republicans precisely because of the videos as you mentioned these brutal Vis videos of for example Israel's bulldozing unarmed civilians so that's important but we have to also reflect of there was a recent high-profile or kind highly publicized resignation of a state Department official this kind of thing is also telling the administration the Biden ad Administration that it's not just Americans and our potential constituents who are opposing this war who we have to listen to but now actually having people in our Administration coming out saying we are unhappy with the way our own government our own employer is actually Prosecuting or supporting isra it has to be said that various State officials State Department officials have been resigning over this last six months this is nothing new but there seems to be some traction on this nothing new but the public nature of and as sheine the official said that she many other of her colleagues had expressed to her that they would like to resign they just couldn't do it so she was actually doing this in a very public way as it happened in October so I think this publicity is key it's not just that there have been these murmurings and signings of signatures someone is actually going out there putting their future career on the line as sheine stated in order to make this point and we can see that this has been getting a lot of coverage in the US and this is definitely going to I think embarrass Biden and make him more likely to to kind of pressure net y in the upcoming meeting let's talk about that meeting in the last 48 hours you know we've had that turnaround from apparently the prime minister's office saying that we do want to reschedule the meeting that we postponed because you didn't veto a UN resolution that we weren't happy with I mean one wonders what that Dynamic is because the big talking point here is that Rafa incursion that the Israelis want to pursue and the Americans are trying to re them back on yeah exactly I mean I think nah who initially threw his toys at the pram with the US veto he uh he obviously wasn't happy about that and he wanted to demonstrate to his constituency that he was being firm with the us but clearly Netanyahu knows that the ability to actually go into Rafa but also existentially for Israel relies on American Support American military aid and so he needs to go to to the US to do damage control not only to try and convince the Biden Administration that they have a so-called plan but actually to Biden to probably tell him hey this is not going to happen or this can't happen and then Netanyahu will want to come back to Israel to make it look like Biden is the one who is kind of snubbing netanyahu's efforts to go into Rafa because Netanyahu is trying to cling to power here and he doesn't want to look weak so if he can sort of push this onto Biden and say Biden's the one who stopped me then it helps him save face somewhat and Saving Face is Going to Be essential for what n needs to do well Saving Face is very important for President Biden let's turn to him because genocide and starvation are two words that the US Administration do not want to be associated with uh but it's something that President Biden can't get away from I mean the new phrase is genocide Joe has to go I mean this is what Americans are saying saying at the moment those that are um certainly protesting against him as we saw on Thursday night it's something he can't get away from as we continue to head towards November and that presidential election of course and we've also seen the protest vote in Michigan of people basically refusing people who had previously voted Democrat voted for Biden places like Michigan saying they're not going to vote for him or at least not voting for him in those primaries because of what he's doing so this is a really important thing but I think what the icj is saying this is a reminder to not just Israel but to people uh around the world to countries around the world that they have an obligation to try and prevent genocide and the US by delivering Aid by air by bridge to Gaza have basically acknowledge that not enough is being done by countries so they're implicit in it and we also have to remember that the US are actually refusing to use their own laws which require that any country that's actually interfering with the provision of us Aid to a people should also not necessarily be given arms right so Biden is in a really difficult situation because he's not only continuing to fund Israel and us have laws the Le laws for example that would actually obligate the us to stop funding a state that's engaged in human rights abuses but also they're interfering with the provision of Aid right so Biden is kind of up against the wall here because he knows he's banged to rights going against US law in his continued support Israel so he's going to be really struggling to to to try and sell this to to the US public if he wants to get elected in November we shall see what happens certainly as we have been in in the coming weeks and months ahead Marco in Jones thanks very much
