absolutely none that hisb was responsible for this attack which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by hisbah indeed hisbah has repeatedly fired rockets at Israel since October 8 with Iran's support and backing flouting Security Council resolution 1701 hisas attacks have displaced more than 100,000 civilians and no member of this Council should or would tolerate attacks such as these therefore we call on the security Council to send an unambiguous message to hisbah by standing with Israel as it defends itself against hisbah repeated attacks second hisbah is not the only Iranian back group in the region that has taken advantage of the situation in Gaza to undermine Regional peace and security the houis are brazenly violating international law with their attacks on Commercial and Merchant vessels in the Red Sea attacks that have affected all of us Iran's support for the houis clearly violates the arms embargo in resolution 2216 and these attacks flagrantly disregard resolution 2722 Iran's arming of terrorist groups in Syria Lebanon and Iraq is similarly destabilizing and contrary to efforts by the security Council to deescalate Regional tensions colleagues Iran must abide by the council's resolutions and failing that the security Council must consider additional measures to enforce its resolutions to hold Iran accountable and address repeated actions by its terrorist proxies and partners that threaten Regional peace and security third the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismael hania indeed we have no independent confirmation as to hamas's claims regarding his death fourth and as secretary blinkin noted earlier today it is best not to speculate on the impact that recent events May have on peace and Security in the Middle East a broader war is neither imminent nor inevitable although the opportunistic attacks by Iran and its network of terrorist proxies and partners across the region have repeatedly brought us closer to a regional conflict for our part the United States will continue to lead the way in diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza and reduce Regional tensions we will continue to work hard to prevent a broader Regional war that starts as secretary blinkin reaffirmed today with finalizing an agreement for an immediate ceasefire with the release of hostages in Gaza as called for in resolution 2735 a ceasefire agreement is the shest way to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people and unlock the possibility of broader stability and so the United States will continue to work in partnership with Egypt Gutter and other Regional Partners to seek to deliver an agreement we have also made clear to all the parties that we want to avoid an escalation of fighting along the blue line between Israel and Lebanon we remain committed to a diplomatic outcome to restore calm along the blue line that would allow citizens on both sides to safely return to their homes again we believe that there is still time and space for a diplomatic solution we encourage members of this council with direct influence over Iran to increase pressure on it to stop escalating its proxy conflict against Israel and other actors indeed every member of this Council should call on Iran to stop arming advising and financing terrorist groups and to reign in the actions of proxies and partners who threaten Regional peace and Security in this dangerous moment it is imperative that we work together to reduce tensions in the region rest assured the United States will continue to do our part and appreciates the efforts of other Nations who share our commitment to support lasting Regional peace thank you make sure to subscribe our channel to get the latest news from alaz
