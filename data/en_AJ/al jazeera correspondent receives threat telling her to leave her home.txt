well after 24 days of intense aerial bombardment the number of Palestinians killed has risen to more than 8,36 and that includes at least 3,000 children that equates to one child being killed every 10 minutes in the occupied West Bank 121 people have been killed and two Palestinian prisoners died in Israeli custody Israel says that was due to natural causes meanwhile the Israeli government says more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in hamas's attack on the 7th of October in the last hour gaza's Health Ministry spokesman said Israel is deliberately targeting hospitals the Israeli occupation have repeated threats to Al hospital that belongs to the Palestinian red Cresent and they attacked the vinity of the hospital and they called the director of the hospital to evacuate a and here we need to know to say that the Israelis have intention bloody intention more than the situation in the Baptist Hospital let's go to yumna Ala now she is reporting from inside Gaza as well and yumna safwat was just telling us that a number of people have been receiving messages from the Israeli Army warning them to leave the area you've received one of those messages tell us what it said yes um the message or the phone call that we received was from a private number he literally said uh he he he gave my husband full name and told him that this is the Israeli Army we are telling you to evacuate South because uh in the coming hours it's going to be very dangerous in the area where you are uh my husband told him that we know that there are uh inclusions or an Israeli tank and other tanks in salahadin street and that's the main street tying Gaza to the South and he said I can't answer you on which route you would take but Main Street could could be relatively safer you should find out which one yourself but you need to move now so um my husband asked him should we make this journey now yumna yumna if you are able to tell us what you're hearing now these are bombardments just around our neighborhood um you can hear how loud they are our building is literally shaking now we can see a black smoke everywhere from the window so these air strikes by the way have been going for a while now extensively in the area of Gaza City I don't even know where exactly they are as I see smoke from uh more than one direction y as you said they sounded incredibly close incredibly loud if you can answer just one more question as to what you're going to do now in the midest of all these bombardments I don't know how much safe it could be that we could actually take our car and leave and drive under these heavy bombardments I mean it's very risky it does not seem safe at all uh we've been hearing the past days and seeing videos of cars cars that were directly targeted while they were on the street going to the South and this has happened many times so it's really a very tense situation I don't think if I risk uh my life and the life of my kids to take this journey now this could be a right decision and at the same time they warn us uh directly they call us directly and they warn us telling us to leave and evacuate now but the bombardments are Relentless how are people like me or all those people who got the calls should be able to leave and how many people are we talking about yumna you where you are in your apartment building are the apartments full of people there are six families more that have returned to their apartments in my building so we're seven families all together some of the families have their relatives with them as well so we're we're talking about uh like roughly 100 sorry yumna if you need to go please go and find a safer area for you and your children and your husband I'm I'm just inside the room and uh it just felt so close it sounded close yes so as I was saying we're roughly 100 person um in this building where we are yumna what are you going to do as you said you've got your children there there are six other families in that building these bombardments are so close that you can feel the building shaking the Israeli Army has told you to get out and to move South but you don't know a safe route to do so and if the bombardments around are surrounding your building how do you even leave the building let alone know what route to take it sounds as if you're trapped that is exactly how the reality of the situation is and also Laura I when I tell you that none of the other families in the building got that I mean that call was made directly just to my husband we usually get these calls from numbers uh that say is let say Israel um and the number usually starts with 04 054 but uh this number that called my husband was a private number so I wasn't even able to know what the number is to uh to to get back to this number or to have like any more information he was clear that we need to evacuate and that this area is going to be under heavy bombardment but it's already under very heavy bombardment yumna I mean it's it's extraordinary that we are talking to you as we can hear those explosions going on around you around your building I just want to commend you for continuing to talk to us and staying on the line thank you for doing so what is causing those explosions can you see can you hear what is the nature of them what kind of explosions these are yes we we we're usually like when we hear these kind of explosions they have been going all uh through all night and um uh are saying that these are F-16 meiles these are the they are the ones that this amount smoke and this kind of uh bombardment now these uh F-16 missiles of as I've just mentioned have been going on since last night so it was basically the same sound through the hours of the night and this morning and until now so these are aerial bombardments yes yes of course and we we we hear the air Jets very loud in the sky around us the Israeli War war jets are everywhere in the sky you can hear the sound of the war jets in the sky and we've been reporting we've been hearing reports of Israeli ground operations expanding towards Gaza City reaching the outskirts of Gaza City as you said there are tanks on the Salah Aline road which joins North to South Gaza blocking that route of Escape for you from Gaza City to the southern areas what are you seeing in terms of this operation and an intensification perhaps of the fighting well I think that since their inclusion has happened especially in that center part where they're uh um separating the northern Gaza from the central and southern Gaza uh just to uh to make it easier for the Israeli military as it goes into the Gaza Strip and infiltrates more into Gaza City that that area now is going to be h a very dangerous and risky area we don't know how far we should expect these tanks to come closer to the city um but again we're talking about a very small territory so basically it's not it's just a couple of kilometers from Gaza City to Al where these tanks are and these tanks in previous Wars like the 2014 war and 2008 War they said people said that they entered until the T haa neighborhood so um basically now T Hawa has been completely bombarded it's something that it's like it was uh um you know like uh Paving the road for this inclusion to happen where there are no more High residential uh Towers in that area as they have all been destroyed and it's so much easier for the tanks to be seeing and the and the air uh Jets the war jets to be seeing exactly what is on the ground around them yum you said earlier that you are there in your apartment building with your children that there are six other families also in that building with you can you tell us where the children are right now and what you are telling [Music] them um now we're always together with as Neighbors we never leave each other because it's very it's safer when we're together and um especially hearing such bombardments the kids get scared a lot so I'm in a room alone and they're all outside in living room together with the neighbors families and I'm like in the room alone so that I can get some some quiet space to be able to speak especially that I know that's my little one always screams when she hears such bombardments yumna I know this is especially uh hard for you to talk about the children because these of course are such innocent victims in this war and we're hearing of a huge number of child casualties but just give us sort of just one more update on how many children you've got there and the sort of Ages that we're talking about I have four children I have elen she's 12 Muhammad he 11 I have sine she's eight and hband is Judy she's five year old years old and uh she's the most person who's always terrified um I think the other three they they get really terrify at at the night hours and when the bombardments are very excessive like that but they try to show me that they're strong enough and that they're not very much worried especially when jry starts to scream and cry okay yumna amazing amazing job thank you so much for talking to us through that bombardment as we heard those explosions around the building that you are in yumna El our correspondent inside Gaza City Sheltering there in her apartment building other families there all the children huddled together in the stairwell set separate from where Yuna went to a quiet room to talk to us as that Israeli ground incursion we're hearing is spreading deeper into the strip towards the outskirts of Gaza City the intensification of air strikes from Israel heard for us there as yumna brought us that report this was just moments after Yuma's husband received a message warning her and her family to evacuate from from Gaza City and to move South they asked how they how do they do that when the main road has tanks on them and it is not safe and when there is bombardments going on outside their apartment buildings and they got told we don't know you just have to move that is something that yumna has said she can't do she and her family are trapped there in Gaza City amid the ongoing bombardment that has taken so many lives of so many palestin Ians
