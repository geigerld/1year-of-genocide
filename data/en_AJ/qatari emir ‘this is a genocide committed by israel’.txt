brothers in Gaza the and the occupied Palestinian territories all the political ethical and humanitarian values have been violated by the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation forces and the crimes against humanity unfortunately despite the fact that the magnitude of crime had has been exposed and Grassroots of people took to the streets many find it too much for the Palestinian to se to seek a seize fire it is a disgrace on the international human International Community to allow this heinous crime to continue for more than two months where systematic and purposeful killing against innocent unarmed civilians continue including women and children entire families and households were wiped out of the Civil register the already frail infrastructure were destroyed W food water fuel were used as a weapon hospitals schools and other vital infrastructures were destroyed with a pretext of self-defense despite the fact that self-defense cannot be undertaken as a pretext by an occupation force and this is a genocide committed by Israel the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against the Gaza and the gazans deepen the sentiment of un Injustice and absence of international legitimacy however the other Co side of the coin is the steadfastness of the Palestinian people holding to their just cause it was it could have been possible to steal away from all these tragedies if Israel and their backers could have understood that the Palestinian cause cannot be sideline and the time of imperialism is gone and no solution can be achieved without just and Lasting peace without a just Co solution to the Palestinian cause peoples worldwide ask about the International Community and is truly there an entity the International Community why have the International Community turned their back on their Palestinian children adopting dual standards this has become a trend which means the international Legacy is one of the victims to this barbaric War we renew our condemnation of killing civilians of all ethnicities nationalities and religions stressing that due protection must be provided to them under the international law and international humanitarian law and we call on the United Nations to initiate an in international investigations on the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian People based on our film conviction of humanitarian Endeavors and peaceful solutions to crisis and by the grace of God the mediation efforts initiated by the state of qar managed to establish a truce and the release of certain captives and Deton on both sides the Israelis and the Palestinians and the delivery of Swift humanitarian Aid we are still working to renew the same and to alleviate the sufferings of our people yet at truth is not an alternative to a permanent ceasefire and renew my appreciation and thanks to the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States for their close cooperation to have this truth established we will continue to make effort with other Regional and Global players in order to have a permanent ceasefire established and all the aggression against the Palestinian people come to a Hal the struggle in Palestine is not religious or it is a war on terror it is a national cause struggle between the occupation the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian people reeling under this occupation it is a part of imperialism rejecting any Common Ground solution with the OB original people of the land therefore the challenge for solving this Gaza as if it is away from the Palestinian CA that require security and Military measures the solution lies in ending the occupation and resolving the cause of the Palestinian people and within this context we call on the security Council namely the permanent members to live up to their legal responsibility to put this war barbaric War to an end and force Israel to come back to genuine negotiations in order to reach a justce solution under the International resolution and the Arab peace initiative through the two State solution which solution was agreed upon by the Palestinian and Arab states as well as the International Community there is no room for further dodging or manipulation in order to keep the negotiation an open-end process this can no longer be tolerated the illegal settlement painting Jerusalem entirely Jewish continue and unjust Siege to Gaza the crisis facing certain our brothers countries in Libya Sudan represent threat to Global to social peace and security and we call on all the conflicting parties in these countries to give precedence to the National interest and transcend above all tribal divisions steer the people away from in fight and listen to the voice of reason for resolving their crisis and differences ambly there are certain calulated measures whereby the relationship of a citizen and state are governed rule of law and that rest in the hands of the state any dispute will result in nothing but chaos Anarchy and Civil War once again I welcome you to the your second homeand and I pray to God Almighty to guide our steps forward to the best interest of our people and their prosperity thank
