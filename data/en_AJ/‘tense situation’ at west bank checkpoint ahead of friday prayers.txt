joining us live from occupied East Jerusalem Let's cross now to nther Ibrahim she's at the kalandia checkpoint in occupied West Bank where people are trying to cross from the occupied West Bank to get to where villain was outside the al- AXA Moss compound and neither it is the first Ramadan since the war on Gaza began people hoping to get to alaxa are facing even more restrictions yes they are and we are closer now to prayer time we're talking about 45 minutes before the prayers start but people here are still hoping that they will get a chance to enter through ala MOS compound from one of those Gates this is a different gate than the one we were at uh this morning but still we are at the kalandia checkpoint where Palestinians who are above 55 for men and above 50 for women can enter but only if they have a valid entry permit this is basically a new new uh uh restriction that has been imposed by the Israeli forces that hasn't been imposed earlier and Palestinians were saying that some of them they didn't even know that they needed that valid permit so they're trying other people are just trying their luck saying maybe maybe the soldier will let them in but indeed we've seen people being turned away and we're seeing also Israeli soldiers surrounding the area here so it remains a tense situation for the Palestinians who are waiting to see if if they can get inside again when it comes to women in previous years they did not have age restriction when it comes to praying at Alamos compound now they do and they have to be above 50 but men used to be uh needed to be older than 40 or 45 to be allowed in now they have to be above 55 so this just tells you about the situation here about people who are hoping and dreaming to go and pray in Al loas compound specifically at the first Friday of Ramadan yes is of course so important to people there isn't it NE just how worried are people there about a further escalation of tensions with all of these new restrictions that they're trying to navigate yes they are trying to navigate these new restrictions that also include that Palestinians when they leave they either have to submit their papers at the checkpoint or even take a selfie through one of the applications that belong to the government to the basically the Israeli activity the the Israeli entity that deals with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank imagine like taking a selfie to be able to prove that you exited uh Jerusalem but also we're talking about Palestinians you know the numbers if compared to previous years they're a trickle of what we used to see when Palestinians would gather here by the thousands in these areas trying to get in but some of them we're telling us that it's hard to make the move from different cities from the occupied West Bank and make it here because of the Israeli military checkpoints because of the situation of settler attacks against them so we're talking about a very tense situation people are also scared that the situation inside Alamos compound might be tense with Israeli restrictions with the tense situation that has been unfolding there nther thank you so much for your reporting nether Ibrahim live at the Candia checkpoint
