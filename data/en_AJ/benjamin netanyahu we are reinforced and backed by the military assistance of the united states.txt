sufferings however we never knelt down we were never brought to our knees our fortitude is what makes us Stand Out among other peoples [Music] Saturday the 7th of October will remain carved in the memory of our people and all other peoples dark painful day it is the darkest and the most dire day in our people's history not only because of the atrocities we have witnessed those reminiscent of the atrocities perpetrated in the past but also of the pain inflicted on all of us I have met no one who doesn't know another person a relative a family member we all have lost loved ones killed

and good in dark and in light we have created this precious state and turned it into a beacon for hope we built our state by hand and by the other hand we brought our enemies to their knees lighted prevailed over Darkness survival triumphant over anything else fellow members I said a while ago that the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas are reminiscent of those of the Holy caust however the difference is we are not kept behind the ghos or concentration camps we are on our homeland let's remain united we have been always remembering and P in in the past the left and right did not come together each Camp remained steadfast on its position and the ultimate today we are here today on our homeland and despite what all what is been said every time we are faced with a terrorist operation and every time we find our people killed at the hands of Hamas or any other organization I always said if a single isolated incident or on a bus all these events remind us that a big event is coming they have malicious intend intentions against us but today these m memories are back to our memories we must remain united we must March for victory we have a robust State Mighty Army and above all we have a mighty people we have a mighty power with a firm conviction and unshaken faith those on Forefront will fight with all power until we bring our enemies we we will rebuild all the destroyed state

up as our Holy Scripture says at the end of the day there will be light and I'm certain there will be light we will exit this plight more robust more strong more powerful we are hand in hand shoulder by shoulder we will win our Victory our Triumph and we will prevailing the bylaws I would like to tell you in the name of the Kess all will be in line with the terms of the Constitution on the 7th of October because of this is a war of necessity imposed upon us from Gaza Strip and in order to save guard the Safety and Security of our people I say according to Kess many of the members joined the government according to Article 15 and as a result the government has decided to amend the situation the position Minister government seeks the endorsement of the speaker of the K with thank well that was uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking at Israel's knesset where he announced Israel's formal declaration of war against Hamas we're going to bring in Maan Bashar now he is Al jazer senior political analyst he joins us from Paris and M on two main points from Netanyahu there the first to unite Israel behind what has happened over the last week the second main point which he spoke about at length was to absolutely destroy Hamas yes these were um The Confident words of a wartime leader that Netanyahu has become the only days after his uh major debacle by allowing uh such an operation to take place under his watch He's certainly trying to changed the narrative about his failure and that of the Israeli military establishment by rallying the spirits uh of the public opinion about what is coming uh which is a long and painful War as he put it and clearly uh he's trying to unite the Nations behind this new so-called uh Unity emergency government in order to launch that war that every expert in the world agrees is going to be quite bloody long and costly notably to the Palestinians with some putting the estimate at tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of casualties to build the case for war I think he's uh almost manufacturing a certain uh atmosphere that is parallel to that that we've seen after 911 meaning 9112 2001 that's why why his entire references or at least most of his references go back to 911 and the war on terror comparing uh Hamas to Isis and certainly drawing parallel with alqaeda and saying certainly you cannot negotiate with these groups like you couldn't negotiate with Isis hence only war is our only path and clearly delting the kind of U us ver versus them are you with us or With the Enemy kind of logic from the Bush Administration after 911 all to um justify the kind of invasion that we've seen of Afghanistan and Iraq in this case starting against Gaza so I think there's an entire narrative being manufactured now on the basis of this is like you know of being compared to invoking the Holocaust which is you know we've always been warned that let's not just compare anything with the Holocaust this is a total disrespect to the Holocaust but I can hear now the Israeli Prime Minister himself undervaluing and disrespecting the Holocaust by comparing this very operation of few hours on Saturday with years of ethnic cleansing and genocide of Jews in Europe where 6 million people were killed Germany's Hitler is not Hamas trying to liberate its land despite its unsavory methods last last weekend the colonial situation in Palestine is not Nazism in Europe and Palestinians trying to liberate their land and instill Justice is certainly not another Holocaust but as I said the prime minister is invoking a whole set of terminologies and scenes between 911 2001 and the attacks on New York and Washington and the Holocaust in order to ensure the rallying not only of the Israeli people behind him but of that of the western public opinion and Western governments and as you know Tom most of these governments have provided the Netanyahu government with unconditional support to do whatever it wants as long as it wants to fight and finish off hamus yeah moan you're saying that he is building a case for war here but everyone that we have spoken to inside Israel whether it be our correspondents or analysts from from inside Israel say that the country really is United uh after this attack so is this going to work for Netanyahu that he will unite the country and uh is Will successfully build a case for war that to allow him and his new war cabinet to do whatever it likes uh when it comes to the inevitable well potential ground Invasion or the escalation uh into Gaza look to be clear there are already some major voices in Israel although they're still in the minority calling for his impeachment and trial and and definitely saying he's a feared leader and should not be a wartime leader but yes in in a in times of Crisis the Israelis unite as they have done for since the past 70 years 75 years there's nothing new there they always do that regardless of who's leading the country they tend to uh coales together under whoever is there in charge and that's for the time being and and Natan would like to prolong that as much as possible even if that's through war in his own personal agenda but the two new Generals in his cabinet in the War cabinet have not personal agendas per se they have National Security agendas in say and they know apparently quite well and that's why there is a new emergency government is the next few weeks and months are going to be quite bloody and as I said earlier there seems to be an understanding that tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of people or casualties will result out of this war and we don't know even what the result of this war might end up being and how many Israelis among the Israelis will suffer or die in in the midst of this war so this is a huge responsibility to a man who's proven to be a liar a corrupt leader a failed leader and so on so forth but here we are at this Junction and as Israel amasses 100,000 soldiers on the southern border with Gaza as it recalls 350,000 military reserves this country is at the brink of War its defense minister has already called for an invasion after uh the the persistent indiscriminate bombing of Gaza or War crime as it were and hence now we are just basically going to be in a countdown uh motion towards uh the war which frankly Tom I don't think anyone knows what is the end game out of this so they say it is to dismantle Hamas and they could probably you know possible that they will be able to dismantle the military and the political and administrative structure of Hamas and Gaza but they're certainly not going to be able to crush the idea of Hamas as a resistance movements against occupation the occupation would still be there of Palestinian occu uh territories uh Palestinian refugees in their Millions will still be there and the day after they finished cleaning up as it were Gaza from Hamas what then will they be the occupier of Gaza again providing food and fuel to the PE to the two million people in Gaza will they bring the Palestinian Authority to rule there knowing the failures of the past will they really sacrific thousands of Israelis in order to bring back the Palestinians to rule I certainly cannot see that so what then what happens after this genocide takes place in the weeks and months to come what is the end game if if it is not an end to occupation because in 9/11 and in the Holocaust we knew what the end games were total destroying of al-Qaeda occupying in Afghanistan and 20 years later well America is out of Afghanistan humiliated and the Taliban are back to rule Afghanistan in Europe we certainly know what happened there there was a second world war and Nazism was definitely defeated and Germany was definitely occupied because it was aggressor that ended up killing tens of millions of Europeans including 6 million Jews this is nothing to be compared with a colonial setting called Israel Palestine where Israel is not the Jews of Europe being slaughtered by the German Nazis it is the occupying power and to continue to speak almost in in in a in a totally inhumane way about Israeli suffering while totally totally ignoring Palestinian suffering and we are all watching those images coming from Gaza about the hundreds or the thousands of casualties the destructions of property the displacements of people the hunger and starvation that is coming The Cutting of food electricity that every other European and American leader called it when it happened in Ukraine to be a war crime and Terror but when it comes to Palestine they call it Israel defending its people the hypocrisy is Just Breath thick okay Mar thank you so much we really do appreciate your insight into this that's Maan bashara our senior political analyst for Al jazer well let's speak to haa abdalhamid who is outside the knesset in West Jerusalem where the Israeli Prime Minister was just speaking a short time ago announcing the formal declaration for War hter as we heard Maan saying there he's Netanyahu is building a case for war will that be widely supported around Israel I think indeed it would be widely supported because we had heard many voices saying that the government and the military really need to deal with the situation once and for all I just want to bring you to speed though that while to what has been happening here on the ground while the Prime Minister uh was talking in the knesset that building behind me here while on the other side of town in occupied East Jerusalem uh there has been a an attack we have at the moment preliminary information we know that there has been a an exchange of gunfire we are hearing that there's also a number of wounded and the Israeli Army saying uh that the attacker has been in what they call neutralized which means that he has been killed too so we will update you be on that but going back to what the Prime Minister uh was saying certainly he wants to show and convey the message that now that he has this um emergency Unity government uh he returns to be that confident uh the Prime Minister who has always uh led the country and who has always promised um the Israelis uh security and that's why they trusted him so much but it might be much more difficult this time because actually a re a poll that came out today uh so 6 days after uh the attack last Saturday says that n 84% of Israelis believe that the Saturday's attack was a failure of the political leadership and 94 of the Israelis believe that the government is responsible for the collapse of the defense system around and in the Gaza Strip so there you have very critical voices uh uh towards uh Benjamin Netanyahu many Israelis saying that this is actually October 7th being The Darkest Day in the history of this uh young country something that the prime Min had prime minister here inside has reiterated uh but the people outside the wide Israeli public are pointing the finger at him and we were heard earlier in the day our correspondent uh was at Tel Aviv airport hundreds and thousands of people are trying to get their way out of the country this is also an indication that the the trust in the political leadership and the trust in the defense uh system has crumbled somehow uh since over the past uh week and that many people now prefer to leave the country which is something that hasn't happened in previous Wars granted this is going to be a much bigger War there's going to be probably a land Invasion Israel could come under more rocket fire not only from Gaza but also from uh Lebanon if that is the case but it's something that Israelis were used to um that they knew how to cope and they trusted blindly their uh security apparatus they trusted blindly that military that has somehow crumbled that is breached and that is something that the the people are still coming to grasp with and it's something think probably the prime minister is aware of but doesn't understand the extent of the breach that has happened there between him and the rest of the public okay thank you so much for that H we really do appreciate it that is H abdalhamid who is outside the knesset in West Jerusalem
