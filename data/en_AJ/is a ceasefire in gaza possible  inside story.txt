yet another round of talks to reach a truce in Gaza repeated attempts have so far failed to end Israel's six-month war on the strip with both Israel and Hamas sticking to their positions will this round be any different and is a deal even possible this is Inside [Music] Story hello again I'm James Bay the latest round of negotiations on a ceasefire in Gaza is resuming in Karo an Israeli delegation is taking part and Hamas has also sent Representatives after months of talks the US President Joe Biden is reported to have written to mediators in Qatar and Egypt urging them to pressure Hamas to accept a deal but the armed group says it won't deviate from its demand for a permanent ceasefire something Israel has ruled out can the two sides reach common ground this time and what leverage do the mediators have to secure a deal we'll discuss all of these issues in a moment with our panel but first this report from Victoria gon B pressure is mounting on Israel's government to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza and secure the release of Israeli captives that's as another round of negotiations with Hamas is resuming in Cairo this country which is very good very strong will not will not survive this prime minister maybe 6 months so it is imperative that we will be election very very soon the Israeli government's also under pressure from the United States US President Joe Biden is demanding an immediate ceasefire and he's reported to have sent letters to mediators in katar and Egypt urging them to pressure Hamas to accept a deal after months of negotiations let's not discount the impact of Israeli military pressure that is clearly what is helping to bring Hamas to the table uh on the one hand Hamas has no way out I'm sure the Egyptians and the kares are are talking sense to them on the other hand uh Netanyahu really has no way out at this point Israel's war on the besieged population of Gaza has killed more than 33,000 people and pushed Palestinians to the brink of famine particularly in the northern part of the strip Hamas says it won't deviate from its demand for a permanent ceasefire when we are negotiating a ceasefire it means that the troops the Israeli troops which invaded Gaza after October 7th has to leave Gaza SL when we talk about this ceasefire agreement it has to it has to mean uh that the people after the ceas fair agreement have to move freely inside the Gaza Strip during the last round of talks in Qatar Israel said it wanted all Israeli captives released in the first stage of a deal Hamas indicated it would only release women and children the two sides also disagree about the release of Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails the talks in Cairo could result in some respite for Palestinians in the strip but finding some form of agreement between Israel and Hamas is taking time time the people of Gaza don't have Victoria gon B Al jazer for Inside Story on this program we're aiming to explain the obstacles to a Ceasar agreement with our panel in ten Aviv we've got Dan Perry he's the author of The ask questions later blog and newsletter on the substack platform in occupied East Jerusalem munia nusa is a professor of international law at Al koods University and in Ciro haa halawa is a political consultant and non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute thank you all three for joining us all three of you let me start with a very quick question to each of you which is how optimistic you are about the chances of a deal haa what do you think are the chances that they could get a deal this time in the city where you are Caro uh very briefly I'm uh I'm not optimistic I don't think much of the parameters around a hostage deal have really changed nor have the uh the sort of entrenched positions on on both sides in that regard Dan your thoughts on this do you think there is a chance of a deal here I think Hamas wants a deal where Israel pulls out of Gaza essentially capitulates in exchange for all the hostages and the chances of that are extremely small whether they can do a partial hostage release or temporary ceasefire is entirely up to I you mun your thoughts at the start of the discussion about how optimistic you are there could be a deal unfortunately I'm not very optimistic because I think the cap the Gap is quite big between both uh uh parties uh the Israelis have set really huge uh goals uh for this uh genocide and uh and I think that if you know they don't want to stop it right now okay well we start from a pretty pessimistic Place having heard all of your initial views on this Hava let's let's first look at uh the mechanics of this who is attending we have the CIA director we have the Prime Minister and foreign minister of Qatar we have the intelligence chief of Egypt and we believe we have the mosad chief and the shinb uh Chief and then also um you're going to have a senior representative of Hamas who won't I don't think be in the same room as the others but all of these people have been negotiating for a long time they all know each other pretty well now indeed we've had rounds and rounds of these talks and I think part of what the challenge is uh particularly for those sort of non-combatant sides not the Israelis nor Hamas is that the the terms the parameters of the deals simply don't change uh hamas's asks remain the same Israel's asks remain the same and that daylight that Gap that Monir very rightly pointed out between the two sides hasn't diminished in fact if anything it's entrenching on on both sides and we've reached the point where there is very little uh understanding of who and how these two parties can meet in the middle to engage in in a in a ceasefire Arrangement and a host hostage for prisoner exchange deal that would allow for significant rest bite in this conflict or at least and even possibly leave us to a more permanent uh state of ceasefire where we can rebuild some of the aid infrastructure in Gazza uh reinstitute and reconstitute un activities there as well uh because they are the only major Aid delivery mechanism and really begin to try and help uh the millions of people that are stuck there in in in Gaza and do important recovery as well as return hostages and have prisoners released to their families Dan just staying with the mechanics of this just for a moment so we can explain it to our viewers we have a senior Hamas official Hal ala who is in Cairo for these talks but my understanding you'll Pro probably know more about this these are indirect talks Israel and Hamas don't sit in the same room the mediators the Egyptian mediators and Kat mediators go between the Israelis and Hamas is that explain to us how how you think it works yeah I mean is yes Israel and Hamas will not sit in the same room and it's all a little bit silly and farsal and I think this is one case where both sides are equally to blame uh but but that's okay I mean I don't think that this is a dynamic where the Israelis and hamnik by sitting in the same room we're going to develop some sort of camaraderie and that will help the negotiations so the Egyptians uh and Americans uh uh cies for their Pirates as well and throughout these talks have done great work and Incredibly important work now I I agree with the other panelists uh the asks on both sides simply haven't changed uh and you you you need to look at what the parameters are the variables are and figure out where there might be some potential for movement um I I I can only repeat what I said before a partial uh hostage release for a temporary ceasefire seems to be uh all that we can hope for I know that the Israelis would agree to this I'm pretty sure um and and perhaps more pressures needed by katar and Egypt on Hamas uh to do the same I I I don't see another way out now there are other variables including uh does Israel insist on Security checks of the people that they let out of Rafa to go back North to hanun Gaza City uh they insist on it I don't think they're going to give up on them so I I I'm not terribly optimistic for these reasons on the other hand there is a lot of pressure on the Israelis to uh the Israeli government uh from within Israel to find some way to do a deal that is true that is true uh and indeed there has been talk of Netanyahu not giving enough of a mandate uh to the trio of senior people he has there the head of the shet head of the mad and it's not alone a general who could e have been a chief of staff and under a slightly different scenario so these are very serious people and um Ehud Barack yesterday the former prime minister on television urged that they be given a true mandate to come up with the best deal that is uh attainable and to bring that back to the government uh for approval or rejection without the government micromanaging uh and there is of course in the background here because of the Myriad skull duggies swirling around Netanyahu suspicion and even more a suspicion that um he is trying to drag his feet and to play for time uh for his own political purposes and I don't discount that may be true but but as I look at the actual variables of the situation uh what I see is that as I said the conceivable transition solution to a permanent ceas fire runs through uh uh a gamut that requires pressure on Hamas in this case and not Israel okay um you you've heard there that um Dan has talked about some of the parameters for a deal let's run through some of the things that have been discussed because I mean we're not getting a running commentary on any of this but we're getting leaks repeatedly and some of the things come up repeatedly um a six week Ceasar is what we hear uh and then a phased release of those that are being held by Hamas and other groups um and we're talking apparently about the feemale fale sick and elderly captives being released first is that your understanding of of of the first part of the deal um I don't know actually what is going to be the first part of the deal but what I know for sure is that we as a I'm part of the Palestinian civil society and what I would say is no matter how many phases this deal is going to take what is very important is that it ends with the ceasefire the ceasefire is certainly the answer to to uh and and and is the only way that the genocide can stop this has been cleared by uh um you know understanding the way and the language of the international court of justice uh um measures provisional measures this is also clear from uh the security Council resolution that also called for a ceasefire so the ceasefire is certainly a necessity in order just to interrupt there the question is the timing of the Ceasar the security Council resolution actually refers to a ceas fart during Ramadan as and as you know Ramadan is running out it'll be over in a few days uh the Israelis seem to be offering a six week Ceasar or certainly that's been offered in the negotiations by either the Israelis uh or the US side Hamas are saying a permanent ceasefire what is the point you're making what what do you think Palestinian people are demanding certainly permanent Seas fire Gaza has been destroyed and people to return back to their homes we've we've exper experienced the temporary uh poses of fighting H during the first exchanges of prisoners and we saw that Israel during that period uh prevented Palestinians from returning to Gaza City and to the north of Gaza City not only to go back to their homes to live but even to go and pick up some stuff in order to go back to the South with more of their stuff later on Israel destroyed and burned more and more houses and more and more facilities in the north of the Gaza Strip what we see now as Palestinian Civil Society is that what Israel is doing is that it is emptying the north of Gaza totally from its residence this is totally dangerous if uh poses are only happening for the exchanges so that the fighting will return be later on um in order to completely destroy the Gaza Strip and completely displace the Palestinians who continue to live in the Gaza Strip as it has been cleared to be the plan of the Israelis that has not been even hidden it has been you know published and talked about it within with within Israeli media uh this is something that is not acceptable we as Dan sorry you want Dan Dan wanted to pick you up on something there Dan well I mean that is not the Israeli point the Israelis one need not over complicate there is no big conspiracy theory Israel wants Hamas to be deposed in Gaza that's what they want and they want the H back there's no plan to depopulate Gaza although some extremists in Israel have been have published their wishful thinking that way no that's not the plan I would ask you munir do you want would you agree as a Palestinian to a permanent ceasefire that changes nothing from the current status quo meaning it leaves Hamas in charge in Gaza is that for you and Israel pulls out Hamas is in charge depleted the minut but in charge you would be happy with this with these do you have an answer to his question and then I'm going to continue answering the questions uh Palestinian leadership should be only chosen by Palestinians and not by by anybody else not the Israelis and not anybody else in the world however what I want is that Israel pulls out immediately of the Gaza Strip I want life to return back to the Gaza Strip Israel has destroyed the Gaza Strip in a way way and has continued with genocide that not only the uh court has found plausible but also the special rur on occupied Palestinian territory has said that it is actually happening the genocide I mean there is all the evidence in the world that there is a genocide I want the genocide to stop now this is the most important that we have as Palestinians please stop the genocide you know the genocide definition of genocide definition of genocide is not a lot of people died definition of genocide is that there was an intent to destroy a people or a religious group and that is Nott these are important questions these are important questions Dan but they're not the questions that we are we're looking at a possible we're looking at a possible deal in Caro so Dan let me ask you this question um in terms of the Israeli side obviously there's so much pressure on prime minister Netanyahu to get the people that are being held by Hamas to get them free and we don't know they're all held by held by Hamas um give us your understanding of how many people Israel believe are alive at this stage they believe they have a pretty good idea um and they believe that over half are alive how much over half I'm not sure they know there are some they know are dead some they think they know are alive and there's a gray Zone in between but certainly a good number of them are no longer alive and yeah there's huge pressure on nanahu you have to remember that Netanyahu is an unpopular prime minister uh 75% of the Israelis in all the polls say they want new elections very soon and they want them gone uh two-thirds roughly appear to be ready to vote for parties that are not in the current Coalition if you remove the H Ultra Orthodox religious extremist parties from the equation because they're automatically on his side the numbers I just mentioned tell you that of the others including Israeli Arabs 90% wanted gone so that's a kind of pressure he's under but on the other hand it's not a presidential system it's parliamentary and uh in a parliamentary system you might think that a disgraced government that is failed catastrophically uh and and is clearly unpopular would resign but technically speaking as long as the 63 uh uh highly obedient Coalition uh uh members that he has voting for him in the 120 seat Parliament stick with him he can he can things out until 2026 but the pressure is mounting and the US plays an enormous role here because the US has leverage over isra and the US by the way has presented something really really interesting that may be a a a way out of this sort of Highly tactical discussion here of who is released what week there's something bigger going on the US is proposing that Israel stop playing games in a way that it's playing games and agree to the Palestinian Authority returning agree something that Israel itself has been demanding since 2007 agree perhaps to multinational force and Arab force in Gaza uh agree to talks that could last a long time on a two-state solution and in return be part of a Sunni moderates uh Western us NATO umbrella uh in the region an alliance against Iran and it's and let me let me bring in haa on all this because um we're talking about the Cairo talks those are all things that are being floated by the US they are not things I would have thought that are going to be in the scope of the discussion of what's going on around that table in Ciro are they well actually well let's hear let's hear h on this I I think the you know the talks have been going on for so long James that everything is kind of blending into itself and such as the lack of movement that with every round of talks we get a new proposed peace plan and and and Dan is not necessarily incorrect about what has been suggested and what has been thrown at at a collection of the regional uh partners and states I think it's um it is uh it is perceived certainly as incredibly demeaning and condescending to have the United States and Israel concoct plans shop them to Arab leaders and tell them that these are the only options at their disposal that is certainly how the Public's perceive them whether or not leaders uh from from as far as you know from from Egypt across to the UAE want to entertain those that will be their own uh prerogative and they will face and they are facing their own forms of accountability and challenges domestically at home however the the primary the primary purpose of why all of this begins to blend in is because there is real um acknowledgement at least I think that there cannot be a ceas fire Arrangement until there is or at least in terms of the permanent ceasefire Arrangement until there is some kind of uh resolution on the question of the day after and what that looks like and there is a fundamental refusal and a fervent Arab public refusal to see Israel militarily occupy uh indefinitely the Gaza Strip and uh either condemn Palestinians to uninhabitable conditions and unlivable conditions that nobody would wish upon themselves in Raf in kanun for those who remain in GDA City and other parts or offer them this long held belief that any other Arab Nation can simply take them and should take them and this constant push pull over the Sinai border or other parts of the region that can or should and beyond that who governs Gaza how is Gaza governed is inherently a part of these ceasefire talks these ideas about Arab multinational forces and stuff you know we know that these are serious ious plans being taken very seriously by the Americans they were shocked part of the reason blinkin was across the region uh just uh 10 days ago two weeks ago was to shop this exact plan to the Arab State leaders uh the Egyptians the jordanians the Saudis and the qataris and the emiratis who were all in Cairo or maybe the kataris weren't I can't remember but uh but the point being is that there is this unrealistic expectation or unrealistic uh understanding of how this conflict is playing out in the region not just Visa gazans themselves but looking further Beyond to occupied East Jerusalem to occupied West Bank the continuing dispossession I think Dan is mistaken to say that this is merely a uh a question about Hamas and a question about the Gaza Strip there is a wider opportunism at play regarding annexation and regarding occupation that is continuing such that b uh netan and his allies would like to wait this out as long as possible I think the only uh shift in this discourse and dynamic will come dependent on what the Iranian response is to the bombing of their Embassy in Damascus a few days ago and it's been made uh certainly from what we understand clear that the Iranians will strike and will strike in retaliation and the Americans seem to be wanting to take a step back and uh and avoid any direct us Iran confront ation now whether the broader risks of of regional configration things we've talked about James for over a year sorry for over six months in terms of the risks uh of this roding out into a wider Regional confrontation now seek to become reality or now start to be put into motion and that slows down the military effort in the Gaza Strip and gives us a de facto uh lessening of the uh of the conflict uh dynamic but nevertheless increased urgency on the humanitarian landscape is one possible scenario that would allow a delay of ceasefire talks or would encourage maybe the Israelis and even Hamas to delay such talks as they beyond the region if I can bring you in to comment on the developments of the last couple of days we're told there was a very tense phone call between Biden and Netanyahu where he put real pressure um on the Israeli leader also you've got these promises from the Israelis that they're going to reopen The era's Crossing they're going to have a temporary use of the port in ashdod how are these seen as Palestinian by Palestinians and are they seen as related in any way to these Cairo talks I mean diplomats talk about confidence building measures but m in my experience Israel prefers to use sticks rather than carrots yes but it's also Israel that is now starting to see carrots and sticks by the rest of the world uh two days ago only the Human Rights Council uh in Geneva the United Nations Human Rights Council uh issued a resolution calling for states to uh not to export arms and weapons to Israel and this is very important they also created a mechanism to see who is exporting weapons to Israel this is also following the findings of the international court of justice looking at Israel as a state that is plausibly conducting genocide side in addition to all the other evidence that we have we have a very active legal work not only against Israel but also against countries that are complicit with Israel in the next few days you will we will all witness the Nicaragua versus Germany case in the international court of justice which actually blames Germany for exporting weapons to Israel while Israel is conducting genocide this is actually a lot of pressure not only on Israel but also on the United States and on all the countries that have been complicit in the Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip so this is very significant in my opinion it does apply pressure not only on Israel but also on the countries that are supporting Israel and this means that they will apply their own pressure on Israel now you can see there are several parliaments around the world that are calling their states to stop sending weapons to Israel let me just bring in Dan towards the end of our discussion now Dan on the Press pressure on Israel because on prime minister Netanyahu there's internal pressure as well huge protests taking place um across Israeli cities particularly in Tel Aviv and the body recovered of one of those that was being held uh in Gaza how much pressure is the Israeli Prime Minister under and do you think that in any way plays into the talks in Cairo pressure on him is really uh from public opinion that might at some point reach the break point with his Coalition that could happen he's generally unpopular he was unpopular before October 7th because of his effort to putine the country but I think mon you're sort of looking at the wrong tree if not marking up the wrong tree uh the icj is highly political and has no enforcement mechanism they can say what they want this is not a genocide the Human Rights Council of of the United Nations is a bit of a joke generally run by dictatorships that don't respect human rights no one pays attention the real pressure points on Israel are something you alluded to at the end which is Canada uh effectively uh slapping arms embargo talk of such a thing by some people in uh in uh Britain and particularly the letter by 36 Senators this week calling on uh Biden to put the squeeze on nanyu which he did but it won't go the way that my panelists are talking about what Biden uh and the West want uh is for nanahu to say yes to the deal that by the way H was not concocted by Israel the us because Israel opposes it but by the US in the west and that deal might create real pressure on Israel if Israeli Society sees that any offing uh is this Grand Design that includes peace with Saudi Arabia then the pressure on Netanyahu to succumb to hamas's terms might become irresistible but even then I doubt it and in any negotiation you have to know it's important to the other side you want to convince Israel of anything you have to know what's important to them now Netanyahu is nahu and he is a global historic Singularity but to the people of Israel there's pretty much consensus that they cannot have Hamas in charge in Gaza anymore because Hamas spokesman go on Arab television and say we're going to do October 7th again and again and again it ended the discussion so Israel needs to know that Hamas will be replaced by the PA n may not want this but that's what's going to happen anyway if it is if there a structure is created to enable that so honestly if I was katar and EGP eypt and any Arab of good faith and any human being of good faith I would be maximally pressuring Hamas to stand down and accept an exile deal where they go wherever hopefully Kar can okay some some pretty controversial comments there I'm afraid we don't have time to pick you up on them though thanks to all our guests Dan Perry munia mber and Hala haa halawa whatever the outcome of the latest
