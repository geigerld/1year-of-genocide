so hamas's October the 7th attack has been described as Israel's 9911 US President Joe Biden by US President Joe Biden while supporting Israel's right to defend itself he also publicly warned prime minister Netanyahu not to make the same mistakes the US did in response a warning that was echoed today by the UN special reporter on counterterrorism and human rights let's explore this further Christen salumi is at the United Nations in New York Kristen what mistakes are they referring to well you may recall that after the Attacks of September 11 2001 which killed some nearly 3,000 Americans the worst attack on us soil in history uh that led to the war on terrorism the so-called war on terrorism a war that was waged according to special rapur folad Alan uh with violations of international law specifically she talked about uh the rounding up of Muslim men uh many of whom were tortured and sent to Guantanamo Bay prison facility without due process a facility that continues to exist she said and continues to uh meet standards for violating international law specifically uh for its degrading treatment uh cruel and inhuman treatment of the people who have been held there but what was really interesting is that she said these actions didn't have the desired effect if anything uh the attempt to crack down on terrorism just made it worse have a listen for yourself to what she said what did we learn from 911 that the response was in deep and profound violation of international law and the cost of that was the perpetuation of the cycle of conditions conducive to violence it wasn't an end to violence it provided the basis for fur further radicalization further extremism conducive to terrorism it provided um a a global nomenclature of quote war on terror which was not only profoundly ineffective in preventing terrorism but actually spawned Decades of serious and egregious violations of international law and Christal what was her reaction to Israel's response to hamas's attack well she was unequivocal in condemning the attack Itself by Hamas which led to the deaths of 1400 Israelis many of them civilians um but she also echoed what the UN has been saying all along that any response has to be in line with international law civilians must be protected hospitals must be protected Aid must be allowed in otherwise it will not end the cycle of violence that we've seen in the Middle East for so long now all right Kristen thanks for that Kristen sui at the United Nations
