reports are emerging of Israeli atrocities during a Siege on gaza's alifa hospital that if proven would constitute the most highness of war crimes according to a statement released by Hamas and based on witness accounts Israeli troops carried out horrific executions of civilians dozens of decomposing bodies have been found in the medical compound local officials say around 300 Palestinians were killed there are reports and I've got to stress that these are unconfirmed at this time that some of the victims had their hands tied and they were buried alive and others according to eyewitness accounts were crushed with tanks and what appears to be an attempt to cover up evidence the most agonizing moment is when the Israeli soldiers shot dead civilian men before our own eyes some were shot dead others were buried alive in ditches most of the dead bodies were bulldozed and buried by the Israelis I saw many young men handcuffed and blindfolded thrown in a ditch and buried with sand we witnessed it all it happened before our own eyes Abu aashi's director of the Palestinian medical Relief Society he's joining us from the site of the alifa hospital in Gaza City we're going to be talking to him uh through a translator sir thank you very much indeed for being with us on Al jazer I hope you can hear me okay can you describe to our viewers first of all what it is you can see and hear and possibly smell as well because that is a sense that people cannot get watching on TV aler I am a Palestinian citizen I lived through this war and even before what happened at alifa hospital is beyond description the Israeli occupation forces stor a civilian Hospital a medical facility catering to civilian population the Israeli soldiers stor the hospital and opened fire indiscriminately on all those inside the hospital this is a war cry this is unprecedented in history and isra as an occupation Force opens fire executing and killing patients the wounded and even the medical staff this constitute war crimes punishable under the international law and the humanitarian law and as I said the medical staff were assaulted and this is highly condemned by the entire medical staff and this is not the first time the Israeli occupation forces storing hospitals before they totally destroyed seven hospitals and medical centers all across centers namely in the north part of Gaza sir can I interrupt you there I'd like to get your opinion please on what it is that you are seeing and hearing at alifa hospital while you're there so it's I hope you can hear me it's Rob Matson I said that we as a medical staff the entire Health Ministry and medical staff we condemn these crimes committed by the Israeli occupation forces sir could I ask you please there are reports which have not yet been confirmed that some of the victims had their hands tied and they were buried alive have you seen any evidence of that that's true absolutely true I was present at ala hospital at at 6: a.m. this morning I myself witnessed victims handcuffed behind their backs blindfolded and buried in this Hospital yard in the emergency unit we found dozens of dead bodies all of them were handcuffed behind their backs and blindfolded this were utter war crimes these are unprecedented throughout history we have never seen anything like this in any other War Sir we have heard reports that there were attempts by the Israeli troops to cover up the evidence by using tanks and bulldozers to cover over uh the ground have you seen any evidence of that that's quite natural the ultimate living evidence to this is that they have laid tight seed to the entire Hospital compound for 15 days during all this time they have been trying to cover up for their crimes they have rounded up tortured and executed some of the medical we have spoken to many of the survivors they themselves witnessed for their own eyes that they have witnessed many Palestinians being executed including the patients another living proof is number of patients before the hospital was teed we had figures of the total number of patients after after The Siege this this number has dropped sir can you tell me what has happened to the people who had been Sheltering at the hospital and the remaining medical staff many of the medical staff were detained some were released and some were executed as to the patients as I said the total number of patients before the SE before this attack was high only now 187 were found as I said many of the patients were executed many of the medical staff were executed others detained and the rest were released even the civilians who took shelter within the hospital compound they were subjected to the same fate many were killed others tortured and the rest was released we have seen pictures of the level of Destruction that has happened at alifa hospital can you give us an indication of anything that is remaining on or is the entire hospital now not working unfortunately I regret to say what you have witnessed is only a tipe of the iceberg the entire hos hospital is R you have seen the buildings charred and the traces of flames but you did not see what's inside all the medical appliances all the medical equipment all the medical supplies were torched destroyed and set fire on by the Israeli occupation Soldiers the hospital in its entirity is out of operation and out of service we are appealing to the international community health organizations human rights organizations to inter to act swiftly in order to save the lives of those patients whose lives are hanging by a threat as you know this hospital was catering to the people of the north and now is out of service Dr Muhammad Abu alash was is Relief Society he's been talking to us from the site of the alifa hospital in Gaza
