welcome to the newsour we begin in Gaza where at least 23 Palestinians have been killed in overnight Israeli strikes several areas in southern Gaza are being targeted at least four people have been killed in Rafa including two children scores of the injured have now been taken to hospital in carun at least 13 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes that targeted residential areas around the al- NASA hospital and al- Amal area and a deal has now been broken by katar and France to allow a limited supply of medicine and other Aid into Gaza now the deal will see Palestinians who are facing famine likee conditions receive some humanitarian aid while medication will be sent for 45 of the Israeli captives being held in Gaza we'll get more on that Aid with Stephanie DEA in a moment who's an occupied East Jerusalem but first let's cross over to hanni Mahmud who's in Rafa in southern Gaza and hany it has to be said that there's no letup in the daily bombardment of the Gaza Strip so just bring us up to up to speed on the overnight raids and how that's impacted the search and rescue and Recovery operation to a certain extent yes well the ongoing intense bombardment just uh making it very difficult for uh a civil defensive crew on the ground in conducting their work and search for more people trapped under the rubbles overnight intense bombardment here in rafah City again confirming what people have said in the past this place is not safe and increasingly becoming risky for the 1.9 displaced Palestinians been squeezing this into this small part uh of the Gaza street but we're looking at two separate air strikes targeting two residential homes the vast majority of those reported killed in the Nar hospital that's in central Rafa where a a children and and women we're looking at people who have been evacuating from one place to another in Khan Unis where much of the intense bombardment have taken place resulting in the death of more than 13 people in western side of kanun is an area that has been largely designated as safeer for internally displaced Palestinians this is not the first time has been attacked repeatedly coming under heavy bombardment since the beginning uh of the war but more intense since the beginning of the ground Invasion maybe the highlight of what happened is the fact that under heavy coverage of aerial bombardment Israeli tanks and armored vehicle pushed deeper into the vicinity of Naser Hospital uh technically in an area between uh the Jordanian field hospital and a couple hundred meters away from ner hospital that's the vicinity of the area very crowded area with uh lots of residential uh homes but blocking the road that leading to the main road of the hospital and on their way those tanks and armed vehicle destroyed the vast majority of the infrastructure much of the residential home on the sides uh of the main roads leading to the hospital where snipers took position on the remaining high-rise building around the uh the hospital and shooting at every moving object of course in the Gaza Strip where uh within the past two days the military announced that ended its operations but it continued contrary uh to what the statement said the bombing continued yeah my apologies there hny of course there is a delay uh between me asking the question and you hearing it as well so forgive me on that one uh but we do know obviously there's this announcement by Qatar and France to deliver Aid humanitarian Aid into the strip uh at a time when the UN is saying that every single person in Gaza is hungry and we're seeing evidence of that in the pictures as soon as an aid truck comes in in is completely surrounded by many many people uh because the need is so desperate yes indeed desperate needs for Food Supplies water and medical supplies as the situations here in the southern part where the 1.9 displaced Palestinian are struggling uh in finding food supplies and Water Supplies just to keep their families alive and survive the horror of the ongoing bombardment but the situations in the northern part are far worse where there is literally famine going on where people haven't had food for a while now and if reports are coming from the northern part of Gaza City suggest that there are people there is a risk of people dying of this ongoing famine right now so the deal right now is is is is very important in in in in terms of an emergency intervention in terms of of helping people at least to counter the famine going on and particularly the most vulnerable among of what we're talking about are the children and women and those with a chronic disease or lifethreatening condition let's just point out that there is no functioning health facility in Gaza and the northern part and the fact that there is famine going on right now just increased the difficulties and the the uh the uh uh the the chances of of of surviving uh the horror of the what's going on in the nor Pond and again there is winter there's rain cold weather increases Al the chances of the spreading of diseases so humanitarian Aid Food Supplies are very essential right now to help people survive this horror mmud for us in raer thank you let's cross over to Stephanie Deco joins us now live from occupied East Jerusalem and Stephanie you know it's always a relief to hear the aid is going in the problem and the constant criticism is the process and the speed by which that Aid gets in or not as the case may be yes I mean we know from the start of this war there's been a severe delay lengthy security process by Israel to clear the trucks to enter the Gaza Strip so what you see entering uh on and off these days is really just a drop in the ocean of what is needed uh in Gaza remember even before this war Gaza Palestinians in Gaza were hugely dependent on Aid let alone under these um unimaginable circumstances now this deal so just to remind you also we're seeing another element of it today which is a significant lengthy negotiation that has come uh to fruition which allows the increase also particularly of medical uh supplies to the Palestinians is medicine to the captives 45 hostages um will be receiving specific prescription medicine to them this is a deal brokered by qar they've been dealing with Hamas in Israel and France who's been dealing with the intrinsics of the medicine of which hostage needs what there are chronical conditions we understand um and Hamas has had an issue with this throughout these negotiations concerned about potential tracking because you're going to have medications enter the Gaza Strip and have to go to specific hostages you also uh have the families of the hostages demanding proof demanding proof that these medications will reach um the captives that they are intended for but certainly uh this has been an ongoing negotiation since October it is the first time since the collapse of the ceasefire that Israel and Hamas have managed to uh to get some form of agreement on something just to update you of course this government also very keen to be showing that it's doing something uh to get the captives back to improve their conditions uh because what Hamas is saying is that it won't negotiate until this war is over uh and Israel says it's not going to stop the war so very difficult situation certainly for the families the hostages who want their loved ones back as soon as possible Stephanie deor is there in occupied East Jerusalem thank you
