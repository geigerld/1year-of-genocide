while diplomatic efforts are continuing around the world European leaders are meeting in Brussels they're expected to call for the establishment of humanitarian corridors and pauses in the bombardment of Gaza well let's speak to step vasson she's live for us now from Brussels step humanitarian corridors and pauses but no mention of a ceasefire no mention of a ceasefire at all and also no condemnation over the thousands of civilian death in Gaza after Israeli bombardments so what's happening here is that the EU leaders are very much divided on how to respond they were very quick to condemn hamas's attacks on October 7 but now they've been struggling to find even the right words to put in their final communic which they want to release later today they have been uh fighting over humanitarian pause or humanitarian paes and now they have decided on the latter because according to to Germany and Germany plays a very important role here because of its history and also the Holocaust its position towards Israel is unconditional support and they are very much pushing for this humanitarian pauses instead of pause because that would be too much of a ceasefire uh sounding like a ceasefire and that would hamper Israel's right to defend itself so it's going to be it's a very watered down version our humanitarian fores corridors which basically means that humanitarian Aid should be able to reach people in Gaza in between LS in the bombardments it's something like that and there's still uh debating it for the rest of the day but this is of of course very painful for the European Union which is started as a peace process they're not talking about peace they're not talking about ceasefire uh they're very much only talking about a very small measure that they want to be implemented Steph I understand that Ukraine was also supposed to be on the agenda today but it it seems to be very much overshadowed by all the events in the Middle East yeah what the leaders here really try to do now is to make sure that Ukraine gets all the attention it deserves they want to stress that the Middle East is not overshadowing this whole Summit uh president sansky will speak later via Zoom but of course the reality is it is overshadowing it's only about the Middle East and the response that Europe has and it's been criticized heavily for this response and it was interesting what charl Michelle uh the president of the European Council had to say when he entered uh the the summit he said uh we are not uh having doubled standards here he was asked about it he was criticized over why Europe normally responds very clearly if there's any conflict in the world about human rights abuses of violations of international law and now they have a very different response but he said that's not true we are still holding Universal principles of Human Rights and he also says that he feels that some are trying to attack the European Union on it and that they are questioning their credibility so it's a very uh difficult situation and that's also what he described it for the European Union here today step vasson there for us in Brussels with all the latest thank you step
