let's look a little bit more closely what's been going on really uh in the last 24 hours with our senior uh political analyst for Al jazer M Bashar joins me again um we listened to Hass Nala for a very long time uh basically giving us analysis about a revision of history as you suggested and discussed in the previous newsour but it was right at the end where he really talked about what uh hesah would intend to do they'd buy their time and they hit back when they wanted to but Al gave us an understanding really of the connection between Hezbollah and Iran as well absolutely so in terms of um hezbollah's response to any future scenario clearly it's steadfast in its warning to Israel that if you widen the war if you attack Lebanon you will pay the price Israel will pay the price hisbah of course is far more potent stronger more powerful than Hamas and I think the result for Israel would be in fact dire if it opens another big front uh with Lebanon though Beirut will indeed pay a very very high price like Gaza and we haven't heard from neither hisbah nor from is hania their own accounting of human suffering today or tomorrow because the human suffering in Gaza is just incredible and while they are at war with Israel I think we need to take count of the incredible human suffering that's going on in Palestine and that will probably visit Lebanon if the war widens now having said that and talking to your point since Zena and our other colleagues have covered the specifics of the Lebanon Israel issue well yes we need to talk about the framework that Hassan nah presented with us tonight this framing of the conflict with Israel the Hamas hisbah AIS as part of a larger Regional axis under the opes or the pinage of Iran if you will is something that Israel is already paying attention to is worried about and we've heard from the Israeli defense minister saying that Israel is in fact now waging a war on seven fronts to their word I think most of these fronts do not really pose much of a danger to Israel today but Lebanon could in the future and Yemen huthis are kind of doing certain skirmishes there in the Red Sea now why this framework or his or or NASA's framing is essential and it's a bit of a departure from the usual because he once again underlined [Music] the direct relationship with Iran and he spoke only about the axes of resistance under the the patronage of Iran basically neglecting indeed not even mentioning for once the Arab world because the axis of Evil the AIS of the aess of resistance is actually functioning in the Arab world Yemen Syria Lebanon Iraq and so on so forth right and to my mind what he said today could be quite disturbing to a good number of Arab capitals while you expect now that is under such genocide that the Arab world needs to unite in order to help the situation in Palestine but the speech from noala today did not Bridge with the Arab world with other other Arab countries in fact he deepened the rift with other Arab countries why is that important because let's remember the past few years the so-called Abraham Accords the normalizations of relations between a good number of Arab countri countries especially in the Gulf as well as Jordan and Egypt have happened with Israel for fear of Iran in part in part again in part for fear of Iran right so for for for Nala to once again basically scare the other Arab leaders by underlining the axis of resistance as the manufacturing of Iran that it aided that it trained that it that it armed that it helped uh them even produce their weapons and so on so forth will create a certain anxiety in a good number of Arab capitals so once again I think what theah needs to do and nah needs to do while he's doing apparently things that will be commended by Hamas and other Palestinians meaning opening another front and relieving Gaza from this incredible Israeli assault but dividing the Arab world today for pro Iran and against Iran is not helpful for Palestine what he also sort of suggested was that you know Hezbollah as well as the houthis in Yemen weren't on a direct telephone line per se to listen to tahan's edict you know he was saying that don't think that tahran picks up a telephone and tells us to do this we do this independently out of our own Consciousness is that is that a piece of new information a new way of looking at the relationship between these sorts of groups and Teran because he was saying that the narrative that the West likes to um present to the world is that everybody is at Tan's beckon call and Nala sort of overturned that absolutely I think that's why was important it was a bit of also Overkill a bit of an oversell if you will but I think you tried to reinforce the point didn't it that's why it was so such a oversell absolutely absolutely but that's also because last Wednesday the Iran revolutionary guards came out with a statement that uh as if the FL the AL AA flood the the attack of October 7 was in Revenge to the assassination of kasum slani the occasion of today right so in in discussing that uh memory of slani the Iranian revolutionary God themselves insinuated that this the act by Hamas was not a nationalist Palestinian resistance act but rather a revenge for for the killing of slman so today NOA not only said basically this is not true already the Iranian revolutionary guard have walked back that statement but he's saying is while Iran arms and finances and helps and backs all these so-called groups of the uh of the axis of resistance but they are in fact uh a network that function under what we call spin segmented polycentric ideologically Network groups meaning they all think basically the same they have the same enemy the same priorities although they are in different countries backed by the same Regional power Iran but they are segmented and polycentric they function according to each of Count's National interest the yenes the huis in Yemen the syrians in Syria the Lebanese and Lebanon each has their own National prerogatives and each have its own National leadership and they function according to to their own National interest not according to dictates from Iran according to Hassan Nas it's a bit of an oversell but interesting Revelation nonetheless for the moment Marin bashara thanks very much
