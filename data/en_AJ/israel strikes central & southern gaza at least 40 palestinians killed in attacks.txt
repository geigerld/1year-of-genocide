meanwhile at least 40 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since Saturday evening the casualties include children in the cities of hunis and de albala the injured have been rushed to barely functioning hospitals the military has widened operations with aerial and ground attacks across Central and Southern Gaza and there have been more Israeli overnight strikes on Gaza 10 people were killed after Israel bombed a house in Kan yunes let's go to Honey Mahmud who is live for us in Rafa in southern Gaza the strikes coming in in the South thick and fast what more can you tell us yes well the the bombing hasn't stopped since last night and all the way to early hour of this morning and just within the past 45 minutes we we have confirmed reports of an attack on a residential home at Alia area that's at the western side of kanun City a border line area with Al maasi area an area that people have taken as a refuge since uh the beginning of the war as they were told it's a safe area by the Israeli military but the fact that this is happening more than just one time we've seen in the past two days our residential home near here Western ra close to where people uh uh resided and and and and built and set up their tents uh seeking Refuge from the horr of this war it's happening one more time there are three people reported killed in that particular uh area and just important to point out that the al- maasi area is the area stretches from Western of Dar bah along the coastal line all the way to ra City at the Gaza Egyptian border area has been described largely safe but unfortunately we seen these repeated attacks uh on on displ Palestinians just shatter shatters any sense of Safety and Security uh and protection uh for them but the attacks continued in khun in different parts including the Eastern side of kanun and the southern part and the central part of kanun an area that is very close to Naser hospitals uh the the only remaining functioning health facility in that in that area including the Jordanian health field hospital within the same vicinity but the fact that these two facilities have been very the attack been very close to these two facilities just making it very risky and dangerous not only for for residents but also those who are trying to evacuate and the medical team and staff who operate under these unusually difficult circumstances but we're talking about at least 17 people in KH units were killed overnight and early hours this morning as paramedics and civil defense were able to get to the targeted area and pulled people from the area many people people were pulled from under the rebels including women and children all reported to uh Naser Hospital including the several critically injured uh people but in central area which is the the devastation uh at its at its height rate now particularly after a statement made by an Israeli military official who described the central area as a crowded refugee camps full of terrorists a lot of people see this as a sentiment in a preparation for more mass killing and more more crimes to be committed in the Central Area Rafa has well took its share of the bombings almost the Central and the southern part of Rafa and the western side where many people are are happen to be displaced in these areas and hany what do you make of these claims by the Israeli Army that hamas's Command Center in the north of Gaza has been completely destroyed is well this is one of the many allegations that go uh goes on its challenge uh and particularly at this at this time when whenever the the Israeli military is is about to commit something uh an atrocity or expand an operation it come up with some of these allegation that to support uh its position and its uh uh its strategy uh throughout this War we've seen this in the past a lot when there was an allegation about a shifa hospital that is used as a command center uh without offering any substantial evidence whatsoever no concrete evidence where offered to support the claim other than the fact that the health facility the largest in the go was completely destroyed and pushed out of out of service we' seen this also one more time when there were talks about the destruction of many of the uh uh Hamas control tunnels in the nor part and and Gaza City but within hours or days of that statement we seen a barrage of rockar being uh are being fired every time there is an allegation unfortunately goes on a challenge it the Israeli military doesn't offer any substantial evidence whatsoever so far the statement talks about some 8 8,000 Hamas operatives or Associates have been eliminated yet if the concrete evidence in the statement just doesn't doesn't indicate that the statement is a credible and and can rely on and that's why the vast majority of people in Gaza they actually care less about the Staten uh uh but they care much about the level of Destruction that has caused to their life and to their residential homes we're talking about an entire northern part of Gaza being destroyed completely and we're looking into years ahead of of of our time to for it to be rebuilt for schools to get back for colleges and universities for industrial zones to oper for it again but to talk about a statement while at the same time seeing it being a challenged by actions on the ground just it's another claim that that lacks a substantial evidence by the Israeli military okay thank you for that hanim Mahmud there for us in Rafa in southern Gaza
