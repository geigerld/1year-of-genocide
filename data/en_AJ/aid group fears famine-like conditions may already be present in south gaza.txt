sjia has leukemia and needs urgent treatment appr but Israel's war and blade on Gaza is a stopping that his mother can only watch as her son's condition worsens my son s was a normal boy he was a very good student he fell sick two months ago I took him to the hospital and they diagnosed him with leukemia he can't walk and started using a wheelchair two weeks ago he is in constant pain we give him a dose of morphine to relieve his pain and to let him sleep he now lives on painkillers Yin is also suffering from malnutrition at Al AA Hospital in Dar balah he's not alone there are malnourished children everywhere here and doctors say they can't cope there is no food no healthy food no proper uh health services in all Gaza Strip this leads to more complicated cases the says children are starving as Israel continues to block the entry of a humanitarian Aid into Gaza according to the UN more than 20 children have died of malnutrition in the north alone and 31% are acutely malnourished as a result of Israel's war and restrictions that completely contradict intern national law gazans again are on the brink of famine as malnutrition among Palestinians continue to spread so fast due to the lack of all kinds of basic humanitarian and medical supplies where disease and even malnutrition are a deadly compination T abum Al jaaz darl balah Palestine Alexandra sea is head of humanitarian policy and advocacy at save the children she says the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza could and should have been avoided Gaza is witnessing the worst some of the worst levels of malnutrition of child malnutrition especially worldwide right now and it's what's calling is that it's entirely man-made um children in Gaza are being starved they're being deprived of Clean Water they're being deprived of um adequate medical assistance and this is all being fueled by the systematic obstruction of humanitarian Aid and the ongoing hostilities to give you an example there was a medical point in t Sultan that was um addressing malnutrition and that had to close this past week due to the um attacks that we saw in the area um and so because of the ongoing hostilities because of the ongoing bombardment and because of the uh uh systematic uh and continued obstruction of humanitarian assistance we fear that there is now going to be an acceleration of deaths due to malnutrition starvation disease and dehydration possibly even higher than what we are already seeing already what we're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg the numbers that have come in of children who have died of malnutrition these are just the numbers of children who have managed to reach medical points and have had their deaths recorded we actually fear that already the situation is much worse I mean back in March the UN warned of famine and uh we have not as humanitarian organizations been given the access to save off that famine and so we expect the situation to get worse and in the South we fear that the famine likee conditions that we saw in Northern Gaza earlier this year are making their way and may already be present in southern Gaza make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
