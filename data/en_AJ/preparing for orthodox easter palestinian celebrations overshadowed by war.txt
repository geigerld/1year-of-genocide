Orthodox Christians in occupied East Jerusalem are preparing for the annual commemoration of what they believe was the resurrection of Jesus Christ like other holidays during Israel's war on Gaza Orthodox Easter celebrations are scaled back this year a tour guide tells us ordinarily this time of year would be the peak season for visitors it should be loaded by people now but simply due to the situ a we've got nothing as a tour guide I've got no work nothing to do and we're surviving as much as we can in previous years these streets have been packed with thousands of people now they're deserted typically around 150 to 200,000 pilgrims are in the Old City for orthodox Easter celebrations but like other holidays this Year festivities are muted overshadowed by the war on Gaza Palestinian Christians say the war isn't the only challenge they face this uh Saturday we'll celebrate the holy uh light ceremony and we celebrate it with many uh restrictions imposed by the Israeli police where worshippers and Christians will not be able to reach the church as we used to do in uh uh in the past this year no Palestinians from the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip will be allowed into the city to pray but despite the Israeli restrictions Palestinians say they remain hopeful because Easter is a celebration of new beginnings Hamas Al jazer occupied East Jerusalem Palestine make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
