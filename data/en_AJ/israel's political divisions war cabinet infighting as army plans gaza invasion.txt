it's been more than two weeks since Israel began deploying forces to the border with Gaza many senior commanders and politicians have promised the outright destruction of Hamas but as Victoria Gaton reports the divisions within Israel's political leadership are creating challenges of their own a show of unity from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior military leaders we are working together as one fist for one goal to eliminate Hamas we back up each other and we back up the IDF our Fighters and commanders the infighting in the wartime cabinet has dominated Israeli media amid the lengthening weight for the planned invasion of Gaza in the meantime a show of force from the Navy on board is Israeli defense minister yav Galant who's called for patience keep preparing for our operation it will happen soon we are preparing thoroughly for the next step a multilateral operation by airr and see do your work get ready we will need you rows of tanks are lined up at the border with Gaza most standing idle for the moment as Israel plans and prepares for what could be a far wider War small teams of troops are already operating inside Gaza during the night there were raids by Tank and infantry forces these raids kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for the next stages of the war these are that take place deep past the contact line but the relationship between Israel's military and its civilian government has grown complicated opinion polls show the prime minister is far from popular and many Israelis want him to publicly take responsibility for the security failures on October the [Music] 7th this Israeli soldier angered by the failure to prevent the Hamas attacks was removed from an army base Netanyahu was visiting Israel's military is making it clear that it's ready to fight conducting live fire drills as it waits for the country's fractious political leadership to give the goahead for the next stage in its offensive Victoria gonb Al jazer Gideon Levy is a columnist at harat's newspaper you're joining us from Tel Aviv Gideon it's good to have you on the program give us your thoughts on the divisions within Israeli Society which were very apparent before all of this began uh weeks and weeks months in fact of protests against Netanyahu for completely different reasons but the divisions were apparent your thoughts on how this could impact how the Prime Minister chooses to conduct this war not sure it will impact his conduction of the war but I have no doubts that once the war will be over his time will be over I don't see him recovering ing from the Fiasco I don't see people just getting used to the fact that he will continue to be prime minister after this Fiasco the big change right now after all those months of protest against him is that the protest is much wider now even though outspoken because more and more right-wingers say in closed rooms they don't come out yet but they all say the same we cannot continue with this man and the failure is so clear and him not taking any responsibility for the failure will have to exploit I guess it will wait until the war will will be over but if God forbid there will be another Fiasco like it was on the 7th of October then he will have to go at once I mean his time is now very very limited and my guess is that that he knows it but you say it probably won't change the decision making from Netanyahu in the short term yeah because nobody everyone agrees that that's not the time to change prime minister even though one can also put doubts on this assumption but let's say that's the general assumption and if so he have until now at least a card blanch to continue don't forget that there is as far as I can judge quite a clear majority in Israel with all the the eagerness to take reveng over Hamas there is quite a c lanch for the Army to act including a ground operation people I think most of the people are supporting it and he can continue with his policy but as I said not forever and not in an unconditioned way is the prime minister is Benjamin Netanyahu still on the same page as all the other major figures who are decision makers in this war particularly the Army Chief no no look there are two real decision makers in this war from the side of of Israel one is President Joe Biden and the other one is the prime minister Benjamin nany and I'm not even sure that they share the responsibility equally but in any case it's about netan nany was always is very authorative and quite lonely in in in decision making and this is also the process now I don't think he trusts anybody around him I don't think he takes advises from anyone around him he leads it for the good and for the bad what is the Israeli public being told about the next steps in the military operations we are being told that the next step will be the ground operation we are being told that it might take long what we are not being told is what will be the day after because nobody knows what will be the day after we are not being told except of a hollow cliches what is the goal because you know the goal of crashing Hamas is a legitimate goal but we all know or at least we are supposed to know that this will never be will be achieved ask the Americans who try to change regimes in so many countries in the world it always failed and it always ended with a terrible War ask Israel who try to change regimes in Lebanon in in the occupied territories in Gaza it doesn't work and for sure not by force but in the current atmosphere in Israel when there is this eagerness to punish Kamas which I understand and to take revenge nobody can stop it Gideon Levy it's great to have you on the program today thank you very much for joining us uh columnist at haret Israeli newspaper thank you very much Gideon thank you
