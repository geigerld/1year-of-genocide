Maran even as I was listening to you I was getting the information that we have a Hamas statement that has just been put out and so I'm glad that I'm talking to you because I'd like to read it together and then get your uh reaction to it here is the statement Hamas has rejected allegations that it committed uh crimes against women and children these are this is the quote some Western media Outlets continue to spread Zionist slander and lies about our Palestinian people in their resistance which falsely and slanderously promoted allegations that members of the Palestinian resistance beheaded children and assaulted women without any evidence to support their lies and claims Hamas strongly condemns the baseless allegations Maran let's let's talk a little bit about this um this is significant because those um those AC accusations are something that have grown louder and louder over the last few days um now Hamas is clearly owning up to the fact that it killed deliberately killed um hundreds and hundreds of Israelis but it seems they're saying there's a red line and that we did not do okay so let's start with the the latter part there is no doubt according again to the two Scholars we just heard on inside story that isra that Hamas Hamas is in breach of inter interational humanitarian law that the way it it took its action uh in Black Saturday against Israeli civilians and so on so forth is in breach of international law there is no doubt about that and it could be defined as a terrorist act did it be HD children and rape women and so on so forth no because the news that first came out from the Los Angeles Times have already been retracted so now it's just being uh you know used as uh as fake information on the web and of course as you know the web especially under mosque you never know you know how how how it will multiply and mutate throughout the world but clearly there was no beheading of children and there is no such thing but I think those who are trying to make the case for land Invasion and for the anation not only of Hamas of the or even of the Palestinian people as animals they are the ones who are already equating the you know 710 with 911 right they're saying that what happened to Israel is 911 and Hamas is like alqaeda and Hamas beads children and Hamas is trying to be slick like Isis and Hamas hates the Jews and as Biden said its sole reason for existence is to kill Jews so already there is a demonizing process by Israel and its pundits and its NE conservative allies in the United States and elsewhere to make the case for repeat of to the 2003 war or the 2011 invasion of Afghanistan basically saying that Hamas is something like the United States has already experience and we know what the results is and hence there is no diplomacy or peace with Hamas Hamas has to be dismantled and it has to be defeated and it has to be ended that kind of comparison is first of all wrong second it is sensationalist and third it will lead to the wrong decisions because Hamas unlike alqaeda unlike Isis and so on so forth had a very particular nationalist agenda and it never acted outside of the borders of Palestine it didn't doesn't have an international agenda Hamas has always functioned within the parameters of historic Palestine and even though it did take actions that are certainly could be defined as terrorist actions this is a nationalist movement that used unsavory tactics but they always stayed within the logic of resistance against what they call their occupiers of the past 55 years and Marwan I think I think this is a really interesting and important point because Hamas has not spoken that much since the beginning of this War and what they have said their statements so far um have been about military things um the the bombardment of Gaza uh they publicly said that they would start killing um people that they're holding captive if uh targets civilian Targets in Gaza were hit without prior warning that has been their communication so far this statement the one that I just read you and that you've been talking about tells us one very very simple thing in addition to everything you've just said that Hamas cares about its Public Image yes they have killed hundreds of people and they clearly own up to that they're not denying it um and they have claimed responsibility for that attack there is zero doubt about that but they care about their Public Image absolutely um you know this is a nationalist movement that Pride itself of being uh you know the protector of its people the representative of its people let's not forget that back in 2006 they won the legislative elections and uh they have remained popular although they're not as popular in Gaza but they are more popular in the West Bank so the fact that their leaders have sacrificed once and again and they spend uh decades in jail uh it's still appreciated by a certain segment of the Palestinian people I'm not sure all Palestinian people support the action of last weekend I'm not sure how many do we haven't conducted any surveys but I'll tell you what it is in the eyes of Hamas and its supporters this was a collective suicide attack because all 14500 Hamas Fighters that went in did not leave right they all been killed so this is in so many ways a collective suicide attack that took with them more than a thousand Israel or a thousand Israelis which is all in by itself is is just of course horrific and tragic but in the end of the day they have not bombed Israel from from the air they have not stayed safe these people sacrificed their lives to kill civilians and soldiers and so on so forth so they are involved on logic gorilla logic a symmetrical Warfare logic of resistance against occupation and they've said for years we've tried other ways and means they did not work and according to them they are this they are left with no other option but to resist Israel with uh you know with with force with violence they took that decisions and now they're taking the responsibility for it unfortunately a lot of people in Gaza in addition to those in Israel are paying the price and I think as you and I were speaking before blink um you know went on air that the predictions about hundreds of thousands perhaps uh tens of thousands perhaps hundred thousands of casual of deaths in Gaza of course is something that we all in this world must stop uh must try to stop anywhere and to to to the last point about just before I forget which is the point about uh safe passage right because this again goes to your point on about Hamas I'm not sure what do they mean by safe patches so they're gonna what let out uh a million gazin into the Sinai where they going to go in the Sinai what are they going to do in the I mean what are you going to do exactly like ship out a million people to where Cairo and and what what guarantees that they will be able to go back because the entire tragedy of this called Palestine started with the idea that Israelis threw them out and when they won't let them back in so what guarantees as soon as you make a safe passage is that these Palestinians will be allowed to come back not to their homes but to their alternative refugee camps and and and Villages and so on and so forth in Gaza second I'm not sure Hamas is going to allow it because it's afraid of exactly that expulsion this will be a safe passage right but it's a pretext to expulsion because that's what Israel does it wants to ship as many people as possible and third no one in Palestine including the Palestinian Authority and Hamas do not want to make uh Israel's job easier for the Israeli Army right because now it's not exactly that they're hiding behind civilian population they are part of the civilian population this is not a professional army they are the young men and women of Gaza and they are fighting occupation so their parents and grandparents and cousins of of these Fighters and so they live there right so that's their families there that's what makes this conflict this asymmetrical conflict so complicated and so tragic and Israel knows that and that's why we keep talking about the fact that there is no military solution to this even Hamas once it's destroyed militarily and administratively how they going to destroy the idea of Hamas the idea of Hamas is apparently more popular in the West Bank and in the Palestinian Refuge camps then it is in Gaza and once you destroy Hamas how are you going to destroy that idea of Hamas in Gaza which is the idea of resistance until Justice is attained Nam
