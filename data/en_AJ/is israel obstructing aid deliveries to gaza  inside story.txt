is Israel obstructing a deliveries to Gaza the UN says Palestinians there are on the brink of starvation that's even after the international court of justice ordered Israel to allow humanitarian assistance into the trip so who can force it to comply this is Inside Story [Music] hello welcome to the program I am Hashim aala the United Nations is warning that Gaza is on the brink of famine Israel is accused of preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians and unra the main UN agency operating in the strip may be forced to stop all its operations unless donor Nations that suspended funding resume their contri contributions all this comes just weeks ordered Israel to allow and I quote urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance into the strip so what if anything can be done to force Israel to comply with the ruling there's plenty to discuss with our guests but first this report looks at the situation on the ground in Gaza Palestinians in Gaza are living in Desperate conditions the children of North Gaza are dying of hunger there is no milk for them there is no sugar for them there is no rice for them there is no flour for them hunger is killing us I ate only little pieces of bread today we are reduced to eating grass on January the 26th the international court of justice ordered Israel to take immediate steps to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance into Gaza but those living inside the territory say the ruling is little more than empty words there's nothing except Shing and bombardment and hunger my children cry because they are hungry we did not receive any humanitarian Aid a day after the Court's decision Israel accused 12 employees of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees Ana of taking part in Hamas attacks on Southern Israel in October the staff were fired and an investigation was opened but it wasn't enough to reassure some donor Nations about 20 countries have suspended funding to unoa or said that they would reassess future pledges the UN agency has warned it may not be able to continue its work after the end of February which would cut the only Lifeline to millions of Palestinians if the Palestinian people lose un's assistance were As Good As Dead As Good As Dead We have nothing but unra were already living in the streets there are three border crossings into Gaza two with Israel and one with Egypt although Israel inspects all people and goods coming in or out of the territory through Egypt both countries are accused of holding up Aid deliveries CC did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in I talk to him I convince him to open the gate the Egyptian government vehemently denies it as the war drags on un leaders have described the volume of Aid entering Gaza as a trickle in comparison to the Sea of humanitarian need Veronica Pedroza Al jazer for Inside Story we will talk to our guests in a moment but first let's listen to Fidel araj who I spoke to earlier she's the gender justice and Protection Officer of the charity oxir Fidel joined me from Rafa in southern Gaza where Israel is threatening a large scale ground offensive I began by asking her about the humanitarian situation there the humanitarian situation in Rafa is worsening by the minute um we are talking about a very uh limited geographical area housing more than 100 1 million and a half idps uh most of which uh are saying intent um there is a very severe lack of access to water drinking water domestic water uh severe uh inability to access food uh this all comes into uh a very cold winter where the living conditions are very deteriorated um we have a very huge need for medical care for health for Health Care Facilities which are overburdened to start with and the burden on these facilities is increasing especially after last night's attacks that took tens of lives and left um hundreds injured and even in more grave situation um regarding their their shelter many people lost their their meager shelters last night and we unfortunately we expect that to to worsen even more in the upcoming days and weeks if this is not the Israeli Army is preparing for its ground offensive in Rafa give us a sense of the risks for the civilian population if that operation starts we are fearing uh for our lives basically then there's the prospect of having to relocate yet again uh to seek a safer place and as I said before ra is very limited geographically so there is barely any place to go to that would be um away from uh from that Brandon Kian way if it happened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered to promise to offer Palestinians in Rafa a safe passage to Northern areas would it make any difference given the fact that in the past those safe passages were bombarded by the Israelis relentlessly everywhere you walk in Raa you you feel you have the feeling that tents spring from the ground and and are erected as you walk this is how crowded it is so I would really like to see what what's a safe passage will look like where would it lead us I don't think it's possible at all the Israel is under obligation to comply with the international Court of Justice's orders particularly when it comes to allowing immediate and quick aid into this trip as a worker there could you give us a sense of the aid which is now trickling into Gaza is it enough actually it's nowhere near enough it's um it's hardly a drop in the ocean of all of the needs I'm I've been working um as a humanitarian for the past 18 years and to start with Gaza has been under siege for 16 years and it's always been a challenge to get um supplies into Gaza but what we're witnessing now what we're living now now is unprecedented we barely get anything we barely could get any trucks of Aid f as you said you've been working as Aid worker for many many years in Gaza i' would like to ask you a personal question you have your own family have your children what's next for you if the ground Invasion starts in Rafa actually it's not a very easy question to answer since I've been asking it to myself for the past month or so uh I've been thinking I'm a mother of five kids and of course I feel responsible for their life for their safety but I really can't decide what to do um I try to plan to find a safer place or a less deadly Place let's say because safer is very exaggerated word I don't know actually to be honest if I will find such a place and if I find such a place how will I manage a shelter what would I do um build up a tent uh how will I move there um will I be able to move for example last night we thought it was a landing care gy and I was faced with my children waking up at 3:00 a.m. and they were just panicking like let's move let's move and I honestly froze I didn't know how to move where the where the the the strikes we coming from do I take the risk to go in the streets and move or do I stay and wait and and risk being hit so it's very very difficulty question that we keep asking ourselves every day every day and we just hope that we that they will manage someone will manage to stop all of this before an actual ground Invasion because it's really it seems like the end of the line for everyone here in Rafa let's bring in our guests from New Haven Connecticut we're joined by arim SE a professor of international law at quin's University and author of United Nations and the question of Palestine and in London is Chris GES former spokesperson for Ona who is speaking to us in an independent capacity welcome to the program Rd Israel has until February 20 the3d to report to the icj has done to comply with the six orders it issued today we're putting more emphasis on the humanitarian aspect do you believe that Israel is doing all it takes to ensure steady consistent delivery of Aid into the strip well thanks for having me Hashim uh in short no uh since the provisional measures order of the icj was issued on the 26th of January there have been 17 massacres committed in the Gaza Strip 2,000 killed 2,000 Palestinians killed of course had obviously a severe intensification of the situation in the South we now have 1.4 million Palestinians um pushed towards the South uh on the border with the Egyptian uh Sinai and the prospect of uh permanent forcible transfer of this community into Egypt uh either through direct bomb bment uh and inertia that you know that is compels that result or over time through starvation used as a method of War uh and the uh cutting off of humanitarian Aid and assistance to this community looms large um the situation on the ground is is tremendously difficult uh on the order of a NECA of the sort that we saw in 1948 and Beyond Chris you would expect that under the orders issued Ed by the icj the focus would be pretty much on delivering Aid ensuring that the situation is contained however Israel appears to be now preparing for its ground offensive United Nations Secretary General Antonio G said and warned that the Israeli Invasion would exponentially I'm quoting him increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare what would be next for Gaza if that operation starts well to be very clear we are already seeing starvation on a mass scale Martin Griffith the most senior humanitarian in the UN system has said and this was several weeks ago that 400,000 people are literally starving and to be clear starvation is a slow motion Massacre Ry has mentioned the number of massacres that we've seen since this provisional measures order but the bigger Massac is the starvation and to be clear those member states who are presently defunding unra are complicit in that slow motion Massacre they were already complicit in a violation of the genocide convention which makes it an obligation on state parties to prevent genocide the clue is in the name the convention on the prevention um and Punishment of genocide but there are three other illegalities first of all as Ry has quite rightly said it's a violation of the provisional measures um thirdly it is a violation of international humanitarian law which is very clear that food cannot be used as a weapon of war and there are many other by the way IHL violations that we are now seeing including Provisions for the protection of civilians in time of war and very fourthly it is a violation of humanitarian principles neutrality and impartiality which is why I say that the um illogical illegal immoral defunding of unra needs to be ended immediately and the civilians need to be got out of Harm's Way now you know this Israeli offer to give them safe P passage to the north we know what Israeli safe passage means it means further killings on an industrial scale what needs to happen is that the netive Israel as the occupying power needs to protect the population which is not just under its protection it's under its bombs it's committing what the icj has called a plausible genocide against 2.3 million people what needs to happen is that Israel needs to open up and give protection to these people immediately AI activists have been saying that since the icj is there to referee disputes between nations because of the Relentless bombardment the targeting of Healthcare facilities ambulances the access roads this could be a strong case for the IC to prosecute Israeli soldiers officials for atrocities committed against the people of Gaza are you of that view should that be a case to be prosecuted I am but we know that uh we know that the office of the prosecutor has a file opened he's investigating the situation in Palestine sadly he's been taking a horribly long time inordinately so but all of the events that we've seen unfold in in the occupied Gaza Strip and indeed in occupied Palestinian territory since 7 October and before are now increasingly before his team in in ha um and so there's no reason to not to believe that the matter is more uh more urgent uh for the office of the prosecutor which which he should be moving uh as soon as possible I think I'd like to also offer the following um there are about seven border crossings of the Gaza Strip uh generally one into Egypt and six others into Israel and the point that was raised by Chris is an extremely important one that is to say if the Israelis are so concerned about the million the million and a half people or more in the Gaza Strip who may be subjected to bombardment and want to remove them somehow and provide them with safe passage not only is the Nega of the obvious place for them to go but viewers need to understand that upwards of about 80% thereabouts of the population of the Gaza Strip are themselves not from Gaza they are Palestine refugees registered with unra and they originate either original refugees or their descendants they originate from those refugees who were ethnically cleansed in 1948 from areas in what is now Israel including the neev and so it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the Israelis to allow those people back to their homes indeed it's a requirement under international law for the Israelis to allow those people to return to their homes and in this case under bombardment the world is on its head all a a result of the complete disproportionate unnecessary response to the October 7 attack against Israel Chris the against guess the backdrop of the apocalyptic situation that you can see unfold in Gaza activists have been saying basically that you need more than 500 trucks to be Crossing into Gaza on a daily basis to cope with the massive demands of the people now US President Biden took the World by surprise when he said it was him who convinced Egyptian president CCE to open the Rafa Crossing then the Israelis are saying at the at the same time they have their own unit the Kat which liaz is with the United Nations when it comes to the delivery of Aid and which basically says that the reason why we are uh we are being meticulous is that we'd like to ensure that food deliveries don't end up being in the hands of Hamas practically we're talking about people who have to wait weeks and weeks and mons because the mechanism itself is not working is it politically motivat thing if that question's addressed to me hasham I would say an unequivocal yes of course this is all politically motivated and to be very clear this is the political agenda of the far fascist right in Israel you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist you can just Google it look at the things that are being said about ethnically cleansing Gaza about destroying um life in Gaza preventing um any kind of return to Gaza so make no mistake what lies behind this is the notion that if you destroy anra if you destroy Gaza then somehow you're getting rid of the Palestinian refugees and their right of return now to be clear on the getting rid of unra it is the UN General Assembly which hands down unr's mandate as a an organ of the a subsidiary or organ of the general assembly and only the general assembly can change Unis mandate um but secondly the Palestine refugees are people they have inalienable rights both group individual and Collective rights and those rights uh also include the right political rights of self-determination of course as refugees they can make three choices including the right of return integration where they are or safe passage to a third country so you know getting rid of unra forcing these refugees to another part of the world that does not get rid of the big problem here for the Israeli fascistic right which is that they are individuals they are people with group and Collective rights and getting rid of unra or pushing them out displacing them to some other part that doesn't change the fact that they are people with rights the right to dignity the right to Justice the right to accountability the right to prosperity and the right to self-determination and that remains they're h human beings aie you see the pictures of the people suffering in Gaza and then the question begs itself once again who is to be held accountable for the uh the slow delivery of Aid into into the strip is it the isra Army is it the the neighbors is it the International Community or is it just simply bureaucratic hurdles yeah I mean in the first instance Hashim it would be the Israeli uh as occupying power in the Gaza Strip uh they have an obligation to this sounds rather odd in the circumstances but their obligations under International are to protect the civilian Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip not bombard them indiscriminately and use starvation against them as a tool of War so in the first instance under international law it's the Israelis who have the obligation to protect that population including through the provision of humanitarian Aid sufficient to scale and so on as per not only the icj provisional measures order of 26 January but general public international law law uh uh bulr occupation the Fourth Geneva Convention and so on but in addition to that you have third States who have an obligation to quote ensure that Israel respect the terms of humanitarian law common article one of the four Geneva conventions as well as under the provisional measures order of 26 uh January they have an obligation as Chris said earlier to prevent the commission of genocide and that means providing means uh and ways to ensure greater humanitarian support to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip not less and therefore the defunding of unra runs counter to their obligations under the genocide convention I just wanted to offer the following based on what Chris had just said though we have evidence three days after the the provisional measures order uh was issued by the court we have clear evidence in the public realm of a conference taking place uh by the Israeli farri in Jerusalem called the quote unquote return to Gaza conference at which um at least I think 11 Ministers of government appeared and 15 members of of government uh um of cabinet forgive me they were there and in this conference there are open calls by multiple members of the of the Israeli uh uh body politic as well as governing structures saying that basically we want to return that is return Israeli settlers to the Gaza Strip after we ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip lost in these four-month period of coverage over the Gaza Strip is the simple truth that Israel is using the events of 7 October as a pretext to ethnically cleanse 2.2 million Palestinians or as many of them as possible out of the Gaza Strip This is a strategic goal of Israel they've been open and public about their interests in doing so and their actions on the ground their mil Ary actions and so on now the subject of a provisional measures order under the genocide Convention of the icj Bel or demonstrate all of that so the the story really is about how to Stave off to stop the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip and even worse the possible genocide of the people there Chris the when you look at the orders issued by the icj it was it was I mean obvious that two key components were facturing when it comes to the decision-making process basically the they wanted to make sure that there was no genocidal intent and that Aid goes to uh Gaza what's next for gazans and this is why I'm not ask you about Ona how do you see the future for Gaza now that the humanitarian Aid Lifeline onra hangs by a thread well first of all on this question of the ICC the icj I see accountability as a very broad canvas so yes there's the icj which adjudicates disputes between states there's the ICC which can bring cases against individuals but there's also the work being done in National jurisdictions just today we had or was it yesterday we had a ruling in Holland over um arms supplies um it's clear that there's economic pressures turkey recently downgraded the economic relationship um with Israel so there are many other things going on um across the board I think as far as the people in Gaza um are concerned I think the future is Bleak and I think that while you have a situation where the International Community countries like my own Britain the United States Canada are prepared a on the one hand to continue supplying weapons as well as diplomatic and political support through the United Nations we've seen this in the security Council also but at the same time defund the very organization established by um the United Nations to bring humanitarian relief and assistance to these people then I think there is um a real problem but to be clear the Palestinians been here before these are people with extraordinary resilience I hate to use that word resilience in the face of a plausible genocide but the fact is that you cannot rob a people of their dignity you cannot rob a people of their identity and their Destiny frankly and you cannot do that simply by subjecting them to what's going on they will outlive this terrible terrible as it might seem at the moment uh since both of you mentioned the moral legal obligations of the third parties I'll go to AI first AI South Africa lawyers are hoping to return back uh at the end of this month to the icj and say that basically given the record of the icg refering disputes between nations there is the potential for them to say wait a second if the Americans the Brits the the the the Europeans are not able to use their leverage uh with the israelies in terms of telling them it's about time to stop the war it's about time to deliver Aid that could be a case for them to prosecute those Nations for that inaction and not willing to move forward could that be a practical case to follow yes uh in short yes uh as I said earlier all signatories to the uh all parties to the genocide convention have an obligation to prevent and the moment that they were put on notice by the court on the 26th of January of the plausibility of genocide taking place is the moment that based on the Court's jurus Prudence they their their obligation to prevent is triggered now to the ENT that those third States uh Canada and and others uh the UK France and others Canada the United States do not take effective measures to prevent they expose themselves to to to uh possible cases brought by other States including South Africa but not exclusively to South Africa other parties to the convention can bring claims against them before the court basically saying that you failed in your duty to prevent the Nick ragins for instance have have now attempted to join or rather to intervene in the South African matter uh with Israel that's just an example so um it is possible that you can have further litigation before the court it you know it would depend on this third state in question some of these states have sort of objected to the uh uh jurisdiction of the Court uh with declarations submitted before the court that predate the the South Africa matter but there are some states who are exposed um that is that is a possibility absolutely thank you thank you unfortunately we're running out of uh time I really appreciate your time r m and Chris gunnes thank you very much indeed and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by
