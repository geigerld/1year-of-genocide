welcome to the program we start in Gaza where Israel's month-long bombardment shows no sign of easing several homes were destroyed after an air strike hit a residential area north of the nuset refugee camp in central Gaza in the southern part of the strip at least eight people have been killed in an attack in Rafa and multiple casualties have been reported after Israeli bombs hit a neighborhood in Khan Unis Let's cross over to hanim Mahmud in Rafa in southern Gaza with the very latest a lot to focus on because various parts of the strip have been hit yes and we're looking at a situation right now where the entire Gaza STP has been equally bombed I mean there is no lit up in the attacks no signs of slowing down here in Rafa City just within the past half an hour with the scenes of parents and remaining family members pouring into a Kuwaiti Hospital taking the bodies from last night attacks transferring them to Nar Hospital preparing for barrier but the scenes of the children wrapped in white sheets is still dominating uh the scene right here uh those people who were killed uh last night in their residential homes that they they were Sheltering in wether here in the western part of raah city where uh nine people were killed six of them were children who suffered extreme devastating Burns and just within uh like half an hour of their arrival to the hospital they just died uh because of of the uh the attacks on the residential because of the burn that they sustain and the injuries of of last night attack also another attack in eastern part of RA that happened half an hour before the second attack where one lady was killed one young lady was killed the other one uh the other injuries were the vast majority made of of his children and people from the the vicinity of the area just causing a great deal of panic as people were Sheltering inside a preschool facility when a nearby residential home was targeted and destroyed the D from the falling debris and and shrap who fell and directly hit hit people uh in lights of growing the threats of expanding the uh the ground Invasion uh is right now at at a point where people do not have where to go what to do there's a shattered sense of of security and it's important to point out that ra has been a major size of Relentless attacks either by air or land from the initial weeks of this War I mean uh the talks for the vast majority of people here the talks about expanding the ground Invasion serve as uh as a distraction while at the same time the Israeli military through the Relentless air strike continue to pound uh across the city whether the eastern part the central part or the overcrowded western part of city where evacuation zone is located yeah while that focus is on Rafa right now in the area where you are hany there's also been a great deal of focus on Kan nunis and net overnight as well just briefly tell us what's been happening there as M well ever since the Israeli military announced it uh it had completed its oper military operations in Khan unun or the central area we did not see any sign of slowing down the air attacks on these two areas particularly n refugee camp and and just new fresh air strikes happening within the past hours and early hours of this morning in the N refugee camp also the central part of the central area just causing great deal of Destruction and causing further civilian casualties that are all transferred reported to alaka hospital that is already exhausted suffering from the extreme shortage of medical supplies uh but the tragedy is the people who are still under the rebels from the time the Israeli military was operating aggressively inat refugee camp the northern part of the Camp itself where people are still under the rebel this is the third the fourth day uh with inability of of the Civil defens crew or paramedics to remove these bodies from under the ground within the past two hours an attack on a residential Block in kanun evacuation Zone that's Al Maas evacuation Zone where the vast majority of displaced families and evacuees were ordered by the Israeli military at the initial weeks of the war to go and shelter there to avoid being bombed but right now we're seeing this is this has been happening repeatedly uh they are attacked inside their tents from the debris from the the falling shrap nails or sometimes they are actually directly hit while inside their tents uh there reports of multiple injuries right now but there is a difficulty of transferring these injuries as the presence of a quad captors these are attack drones and surveillance and drones make it very risky for paramedics and civil defensive crew to do their job and help and save people who need help right now Hal Mahmud for us in Rafa in southern Gaza thank you
