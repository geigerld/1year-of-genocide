Maran bashara Al jazer senior political analyst he joins us from Paris via Skype uh just that that tweet there just illustrating that even though we we heard uh that support that clapping to Netanyahu as he began his speech there are still about 50 Democrats who are not attending uh this speech what does that tell us about how much division there is within the Democrats uh towards uh prime minister Yahoo well there certainly is a division among the Democrats and certainly it is but um still a majority Democrats certainly majority of continue to Pander to continue to Pander in fact to a fanatic fact Israeli government uh those who had some courage did not show up they wouldn't want to be complicit in a in a theater of the Absurd welcoming and sharing a war criminal while for tending to uh promote peace and stability and ceasefire so on so forth in the Middle East this was in every possible way a um you know a dramatic dark moment in American history and the fact that those 50 or so Democrats refused to show up is to their credit because those who did show up to cheer as we've been hearing just the first few minutes all this cheering is really in every possible way and I won't say shameful it's Shameless because these hundreds of American legislators know all too well what this war criminal has done over the past 10 months he spoke of dozens of Israelis but he let it to mention thousands dozens of thousands of Palestinian children mothers nurses doctors Engineers students professors and so on and so forth that were killed by his military in Gaza one or two former captives showed up in Congress but the thousands of children that he killed wouldn't be able to make it to Washington maybe one survival from a family in Gaza showed up with Rashida but the tens of thousands who were killed and continue to be killed I can't tell you how many dozens of Palestinian civilians how many children died since Netanyahu arrived in Washington probably already some Palestinians were killed in the past few minutes as those Congress people and senators were cheering a war criminal and given everything you've just said uh this is his fourth us Congressional address how do you explain his influence on Washington lawmakers Israel well look there is something called an Israel Lobby it's a very influential very powerful Lobby made up of a number of elements including Christian evangelicals some desist Jewish organizations some billionaires and part of the military industrial complex that has a lot of investment in Israel Israel Once Upon a Time could have been considered an asset to the United States today it's a burden there is absolutely zero strategic reason Logic for why uh this relation continues other than the Pander into the Israel Lobby all of these Congressman Senators there few of them are ftic uh religious Fanatics ideological Fanatics like for example the Congress uh a speaker uh Mike Johnson he's like a benv of the United States religious fanatic who's more than happy to see kingdom come in the so-called holy land where it's very Unholy nowadays in order to uh please uh his religious uh fanatical following in the United States so the Israel Lobby is the one who B and brought a lot of these people into Congress today so the So-Cal Citadel of democracy in fact is no more than uh the market place of and I I'm going to have to use this expression I I realize it's a bit explosive but this is an utter political prostitution whereby those people have been bought and sold by the Israel Lobby by the billionair supporters of Israel in order to support their election campaigns come November they support Netanyahu they're not even supporting Israel for God's sake because most Israelis do not trust this man the absolute majority of Israelis want this man out this is not a sh of support for Israel this is a sh of support for a fanatical fascist government that continues to carry genocide in Palestine okay Maran stay with us uh we will return to you I just want to give get a sense of what is happening outside uh the White House we can go to sh Hy who is with uh many thousands of protesters in Washington DC outside the capital who are protesting Benjamin netanyahu's speech and visit to the United States Maran what's happening where you uh shab what's happening where you are it was quite the dros because at the very time we saw those members of Congress greeting Netanyahu with with the Evas and the warmth the people those members of Congress were representing who are out in the streets and their thousands outside the capital were being pepper sprayed we were at that very moment we were with a bunch of people who were pepper sprayed by the capital police it was we kind of knew something was up anyway because they already had many of them already had their gas masks their Shields their batons already out they were very very jumpy they've also been augmented by scores as far as we can tell of NYPD New York Police Department cops and by the way this is the same Capital police who did nothing thing when the January 6 protesters tried to storm the capital they stood aside but a few Palestinian protesters a few thousand Palestinian protesters outside well the pepper spray is already out but the violence hasn't gone who are good and evil all the way from new you when the police already spraying yeah that was very concerning I saw some a lot of people on the side of the road and I was like oh my God one person was laying on the ground and he looked like his skin had been impact Ed I was telling my kids something happened here like no they're just hot and I was like no they're itching a lot I'm a medical Prof their arms out like this yeah they definitely they were definitely pepper straight why was it so important to be here to the risk oh well we're here to tell Netanyahu that he's not welcome here he's not really welcome anywhere the only place that he belongs is behind bars and I don't think there's more risk more important than the children's lives that are being taken every single day I'd risk my life every single day for those kids in in Palestine you well they're all being paid by APAC unfortunately members of Congress at least oh yeah definitely I mean like it was said before it's very well known now every member of Congress has an apack man Cara Harris six I believe it's 600,000 from from APAC but I it's interesting I mean there was that Unity about not voting for Joe Biden genocide Joe now that Cara Harris between those who tget terrorists she got a power absolutely not she's completely complicit in every single Biden policy and every single thing that was signed off every eight pack package that was sent all the bombs she was she never stood up once and said no this is enough like this is not right where silence is an action it's an action in itself you doing nothing and being biasing crime okay there are many crimes where if you're just standing there you're going to jail for that and that's the way that we feel about her and she get our votes let's make that very clear the Solan family from from New Jersey stay safe the marches okay okay I'm afraid we're GNA we're going to have to uh leave it there sh had Brans there for us at those protests in Washington DC let's return back to Marwan bashara Al jazer senior political analyst Maran what do you think prime minister netan is hoping to achieve with this speech to Congress today let me just uh if you can our viewers can get where is speaking and I have heard all his last three speeches to Congress and he's usually consistent in the way he makes his speeches into some kind of a dramatic theater look at the dozens of pages in front of him these are dozens of pages this is not a four five page speech these are dozens of pages that contain dozens of sound bites cliches and lies this is not a speech that is meant to formulate a vision or an idea this is meant as a Public Relation a marketing campaign for his government for his War for his vision of an a Israel dominating the Middle East through the War Machine and trying to bring the United States with Israel as he said together we win we win against whom against the children of Gaza who did Netanyahu and the United States Nan and Biden whom did they win against the last 10 months but the children and their mothers and fathers in Gaza who exactly was beaten the last 10 months but dozens uh of thousands of children and mothers and fathers and as I said before and engineers and doctors and civilians of all sorts of Life the total Destruction of uh the infrastructure of more than two million people these are the people he won against and he's trying to sell his war effort to the people who have already been unconditionally supporting his genocide his war crimes in Gaza and why I continue to say Shameless not just shameful because these people already have caught up with just the last few days the last few weeks the last few months of reports from Gaza air CBS News ABC News CNN and so on so forth and they know the cost of this war to Palestinians to the people of Gaza and and that cost has been mainly in its absolute majority against the civilians in Palestine they are the one who suffered and America has been complicit in these lives and from the outset of the speech he started by repeating debunked myths and lies about what happened October 7 there's no doubt October 7 was gruesome but the beheading of babies the beheading of men in front of their children the killing of children and men and all of the sort of stuff that he kept repeating the burning of children alive these have been debunked but he continues to repeat them 10 months later so all in all he's trying to sell a genocide to Congress and they are cheering him on okay thank you for that Maran Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst speaking to us there from Paris make sure to subscribe to our channel to
