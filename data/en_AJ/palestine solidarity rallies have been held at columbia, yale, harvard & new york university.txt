well for more on all of this we're joined Now by Kristen salumi who is at New York University Kristen can you just talk us through what is happening there right now and how much momentum uh is Behind These protests well NYU demonstrators have been going at it for hours here in a park that's actually just off of the NYU campus they've been here since a few hours ago uh after getting kicked off of their own campus uh due to arrest 133 students and teachers were actually arrested on campus last night the university claiming they were disruptive and a danger to the students there but as news spread of their arrests so have demonstrations around the country at other colleges and universities police moved in after dark to arrest demonstrators at New York University where over 100 students and teachers defied orders to leave a school Plaza or face consequences there were arrests at Yale University too dozens of them these students and others across the country coming out in protest of Israel's devastating war on Gaza and in solidarity with Colombia University students there the so-called Gaza solidarity encampment has been re-erected after the school called in police to arrest more than 100 students and dismantle it last week we demand that all Columbia's faculty joined protesters to condemn the move initiated by the University president who canel in-person classes Monday to address security concerns the president's decision to send riot police to pick up peaceful protesters on our campus was unprecedented unjustified disproportionate divisive and dangerous they are outraged not only by the arrest but also by President namat Manu shafi's testimony before Congress while conservative Representatives called for shafi's resignation for not doing more to crack down on demonstrators the school Senate consisting of students faculty and administrators is expected to vote to censure her as early as Wednesday it's very important for faculty to um defend the university in a way that our president did not before Congress student demonstrators including Jewish student demonstrators deny accusations of anti-Semitism at Columbia University they even stop their protest to celebrate the first night of passover they describe their movement as peaceful and blame any antagonistic inflammatory statements or actions on Outsiders from California's state Polytechnic University on the west coast to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College on the East the demands for school leaders are the same we want Emerson College number one call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza number two to disclose all financial investments in Zionist organizations number three to divest from those organizations number four to drop all charges against students for disciplinary actions attempts to silence the movement only amplifying its call Kristen salumi Al jazer New York and speaking to demonstrators here today I was struck by how many of them were actually wearing masks and covering their faces they say that they're concerned about blowback and discrimination against them for supporting this cause but say that they will continue in fact many have left the park here to join demonstrations up at Colombia University and support uh other schools in the city uh a school by the name of the new school also seeing demonstrators here in Minnesota the state of Minnesota the state of Michigan the state of Pennsylvania today have all added demonstrations with students there the uh mayor of New York has expressed concern that these protests will attract uh agitators who are looking to do harm while he defended the students right to protest he said that they had concerns that there would be uh more violence and action although the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful at this point uh the demonstrators I spoke to here said that absolutely they were peaceful and intent they're not anti-semitic they say that things only got out of hand when the police arrived okay thank you so much Kristen Kristen salumi for us there outside New York University protests have also been held in Tel Aviv where pressure is mounting on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu relatives of captives and their supporters taped their mouths with the message 200 days and nothing has changed talks on freeing captives held in Gaza have stalled as Israel has refused to accept a permanent ceasefire and my brother-in-law is back there in Gaza and with with 32 more people it's too much this needs to be end we need to have our peace and the families need to have peace and this country need to have the head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees says Israel's recent attacks on the group are part of a push to remove the organization from the Gaza Strip in January Israel accused some un staff of involvement in hamas's October 7th attacks but a review of the agency's operations released on Monday stated that Israel has not provided supporting evidence for its claim well the authors of that review made a list of recommendations to ensure accountability and the neutrality of unra earlier my colleague Rob meon spoke to the agency's commissioner Philipe lazarini he began by asking him if he thought that would help restore confidence and honor I really hope that the report will help us to restore the confidence of our partners and the donors uh the Secretary General and myself have welcomed the report we have welcom also the recommend and you might have noticed that the report clearly indicated that the agency already have a number of robust mechanism to deal with a neutrality issue and that this mechanis are above I would say the standard of many other agencies or International noos but because of the nature of the conflict we are dealing with and the complexity of our environment it is is needed to do even better and this is the reason why uh we Embrace and I embrace the recommendation made by Kine Cola and her team and we are now preparing a response plan to follow up on this recommendation MH uh during your press conference you gave a long list of uh the level of of damage to unor property and of course the the effect that this has had on on staff the arrests that have been carried out and so on what is the morale of staff at Ona at the moment of course not just in Gaza but in all the areas that it operates when it must I would imagine feel that is under constant pressure yeah un is under constant attack constant pressure constant call of dismantling a constant administrative harrassment and also constant I would say sometimes social media uh assassination and this has definitely an impact on our St you might also have seen over the last few days there have been an opinion poll and also within the population in the West Bank and in Gaza there is a deep anxiety that if the the agency is dismantled that this would also put an end to the two-state solution I was at the security Council uh last week and basically I told the member that the attack on un have nothing to do with neutrality issues but in reality they are motivated by the objective to strip the Palestinian uh from their Refugee status you also mentioned in your press conference that within 24 hours of the allegations originally being made by Me by Israel about members of Ona allegedly taking part in the hamus L October 7th attacks in southern Israel 16 to 18 countries have pulled their fund How concerned and how worried are you that countries are prepared to pull funding so quickly before allegations are actually determined to be founded that that shows also the unprecedented crisis uh and Challen the agency is currently uh facing and dealing with uh it is true that 16 country within 48 Hours announce their PS but the good news is that since most of the countries have reviewed the decision and have reinstated the contribution to the agency at the time they took the decision uh it had uh the the agency basically had no visibility anymore about its uh Financial contribution today thanks to the fact that most of the donors have come back and new donor have also joined uh the agencies we have slightly more visibilities and I can't say with some comfort that we have enough resources to keep our activities running at least till the end of June uh and go into the month of July but it's very precarious and we continue to function uh Mouse to hand to Mouse make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
