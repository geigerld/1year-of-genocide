war on Gaza comes on the 106th anniversary of the ball declaration which changed the lives of Palestinians forever so it was that declaration well for centuries the Ottoman Empire controlled Palestine until it was conquered in 197 by advancing British troops during the first World War the British foreign secretary ARA balur wrote a letter to a prominent member of the British Jewish Community saying his government was in favor of the EST lishment of a in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people well at that time only 8% of palestine's population was Jewish the letter also said nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine but after the war ended in 1918 the newly created League of Nations mandated Palestine to British control with the language of the balfor Declaration written in it and in 1948 after the second world war British occupiers left Palestine the newly formed United Nations declared the creation of the state of Israel more than 700,000 Palestinians lost their land mahjub zi joins us here in the studio he's a professor of Middle East politics at Qatar University good to have you with us so when you look back on this it's hard not to say that Bal for laid the foundation of conflict in the Middle East isn't it absolutely Sami there are three major events if you put them together they basically lay down the whole issue of what soal total Palestinian cause one is uh bord declaration 1917 and before that was sepu agreement 1916 and the last one was Simo agreement in 1920 those three events together they put the what soal today the idea of of having a a home for Jewish in in in Palestine uh the Declaration itself is fascinating because uh um the British they have no right no control in Palestine they gave what they don't have to to to people they to the people they don't have the right actually to to uh uh occupy the land so that was significant but at that time we have to remember there were three main powers at that time Russia British and the French and and the and the three count together they have all of those arrangements behind the closing door and we found out later about them looking at it the ball Declaration was it really a colonial project a European colonial power promising to give a land to a movement primarily comprised and led by European non-natives yeah the the the idea was a clear Sam at that time the debate in Europe was about how to divide the Legacy over what so-called the sick man of Europe which Ottoman Empire at that time and the debate was very clear how can the three countries divide that Legacy in a way that serves Colonial interest not in a way that really serves the context is colonization those three forces the three power are a colonized power and they divided the land of what so-called the Levant in that context and they live they left pal Palestine in a way that in a without a political uh status so they can facilitate the project of establishing uh state for Jew it's a jarring contrast to the very high anti-immigrant sentiment sweeping the UK and European countries when you look back and see actually they open the door at that time they open the door they facilitate for mainly a lot of Europeans to go and establish a state something definitely European powers wouldn't like to see anything along those alone just immigrants coming to live peacefully let alone establish a state in you know in the second week of this uh uh battle now uh the um I think uh the the one of the secretaries in the UK was asked by the media um out of the media Outlet about whether they would allow gazam people to come to the UK he couldn't say yes he said UK is different UK and he was actually escaping from the answer so it was obvious that you know the double stand stand it's was okay for us to give away for Middle easterners to have to accept we wouldn't want even one% of nothing can can describe this but the dehumanization and disrespect to the others nothing can be understand do you think the current UK government is living up to its moral obligations given this history when you look at the positions taken by Rishi sonak the Prime Minister it was obvious that um since the the UK basically left the European Union everything is is is falling apart economically politically and Corona has you know did have a great impact did did did affect all of this it's obvious that there's a lot of debate now about the UK when it comes to the foreign policy they are following the Americans 100% And and there is also economic problems and there's a lot of debate about where the UK is going with all of this uh you know this Legacy of being a colonized power since we're talking about countries failing to live up to their moral obligations we got to talk about an interesting development that happened we saw one Arab country um withdraw its Ambassador for Israel but we've seen three South American countries withdraw their ambassadors or cut relations Is there also something to be said about the jarring contrast here about and the weakness of the Arab diplomatic absolutely I mean those countries who have a diplomatic ties with Israel they have a perception of what's happened in in Gaza the perception is Hamas is involved and Hamas what's Hamas Hamas is an Islamic movement ham is to the Muslim Brotherhood and the and those countries they already looked at Muslim as terrorist organization so it's about a perception and which dominate the political decisions Palestinian people are much bigger than absolutely I mean it's obvious the PLO was rejected uh Communists were rejected liberals were rejected it's the idea of resistance resistance is not accepted is rejected and as long as someone resisting even if he's a liberal he will be rejected right all right thank you so much M coming in
