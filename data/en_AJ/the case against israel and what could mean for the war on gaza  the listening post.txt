a landmark legal case over a devastating War Israel gets taken to court on charges of genocide in Gaza chaos in Guan K gang violence in Ecuador live on TV and tens of thousands killed Millions displaced why is the story in Sudan not in the the international court of justice has concluded its preliminary hearing in the ha on South Africa's genocide case against Israel the icj judges are now deliberating over whether or not they will order an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the global media this case will or at least should govern how this story is reported what kind of terminology should apply if the un's highest court suspects Israel of carrying out a genocide side then who are journalists to say otherwise by continuing to describe the utter Carnage in water down terms geopolitically the stakes could not be higher because a ruling against South Africa signals to the world that what we have witnessed over these past 3 months in Gaza the collective punishment and indiscriminate bombardment of civilians is permissible in the eyes of the icj but a ruling in favor of South Africa will let Israel and its powerful backers know that when it comes to genocide no one not even Israel and its American Allies is above the law this is a potentially pivotal legal case one laced with historical irony the government of South Africa the country that invented apartheid taking Israel which still practices apartheid to the international court of justice accusing it of genocide in Gaza the first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real time in the desperate so far vain hope that the world might do something South Africa's lawyers chose their words carefully the challenge facing Israel's lawyers is that since October 7th Israeli leaders have not we will exact a price that will be remembered by them and Israel's other enemies for decades to come the difficulty Israel are facing is that every single day there are more and more statements uh that are genocidal including the increasing talk about not only the ethnic cleansing of gazans but also bringing Jewish settlers in Gaza we hear about the elimination of the population from Gaza raising the different cities and towns to the ground and then building honorable new settlements that are Jewish all the genocidal rhetoric that has come out why was that allowed to be AED to proliferate if indeed this was totally out of sync with the intentions of the Israeli state it behooves you to clamp down on that that was not in fact something else happened which is only after Israel realized the international court of justice is a serious thing that they will have to contend with then you suddenly see the order going around sh keep quiet don't say that stuff anymore and if you have said that kind of stuff walk it back Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists not the Palestinian population which is what the Netanyahu government was doing right up until the day before the hearing but all those previous statements inflammatory ones by Israeli officials matter because as stipulated in the genocide convention passed by the UN in 1948 Declarations of intent are evidence it's an entire nation out there that is responsible it's not true this rhetoric about civilians not not aware not inol it's absolutely not true so Israel has tried to roll back the clock to October 7th but I am obliged to put before the court today some small fragment of the scenes of unfathomable cruelty showing the icj judges some of the same images of hamas's gruesome attacks that it showed journalists foreign governments and the UN that may have proven effective in the court of public opinion but it does not constitute a legal defense for for what has happened since propaganda does not work in a court of law for while Israel will argue to the court that Hamas attack on uh uh Israel on October 7 amounted to genocide of its own sort regardless of an attack on a state's territory no matter how atrocious it does not justify genocide the fact that Israel has landed at the icj in the ha by way of South Africa has to do with two countries with similar histories and shared experiences of Oppression we are also particularly mindful of Israel's institutionalized regime of discriminatory laws subjecting the Palestinian people to apartate on both apartheid era South Africa and Israel were both highly militarized countries with societies that were racially segregated both were political Paras isolated by their neighbors Israel needed oil South Africa provided it South Africa faced with an arms embargo needed weapons Israel helped Supply them the respective resistance groups thec and the PLO forged an alliance of their own given that history ANC leaders have always backed the Palestinians as Nelson Mandela did from the moment he came out of prison such as in this encounter with the US Network ABC in 1990 you've met over the last six months three times with gaser Arafat are these your models of leaders of Human Rights one of the mistakes which some political analysts make is to think that their enemies should be our enemies from the get-go in this current uh situation in Gaza South Africa has been completely Pro Palestinian now there's a moral claim that thec and the South African government sees the gazans and the Palestinians more generally as being part of the oppressed group of people in the world they're involved in a struggle against colonialism and therefore to some extent it's seen through the same lens as a struggle against a parate the anc's support for the people of Palestine did not start an end with former president Nelson Mandela that solidarity and support continued under the era of tabuni under the AA of former president Jacob Zuma and we see it unfold um under the presidency of C ramapa South Africa has historically stated that Israel is forced resettlements its um mass incarceration of Palestinian people is reminiscent of the apath regime in South Africa from a more cynical point of view we're going into an election year in South Africa in the next few months and thec is determined to deflect and distract attention from its multiple domestic failures this icj case is an opportunity for South Africa to reclaim the moral High ground and so I think there's a combination of struggle history deep cynicism and to a degree opportunism behind the South African case if the judges rule against Israel and Order its bombing of Gaza to stop while the court determines if this war is in fact genocidal the legal implications would apply not just to the Netanyahu government but to all countries that are signatories to the un's genocide convention for failing in their legal duty to prevent that genocide moreover media Outlets everywhere would be robbed of any excuse they have conjured up to avoid calling this story what it is instead of labeling it the way humanitarian groups and various NOS have as a genocide in progress they have minced their words resorted to euphemisms and mischaracterizations that reflect the language of their governments not the reality on the ground happening this is a genocide happening in front of our eyes we have we that word is as you know incredibly emotive and the Israelis as you know will be saying that they are targeting Hamas only that they don't Target will South Africa's case against Israel have a gamechanging effect on the news narrative because it could use one so the inter of Justice rule that there is a risk of genocide this will also put on notice and to shame all of those who have supported uncritically the war in the last 3 months whether it's States like the US the EU or the media in the west that have been promoting supporting aiding and abetting genocide in Gaza so hopefully this kind of ruling would prompt a critical self-reflection on the part of the western media as well as a change of course on the part of uh Western governments a lot of the media coverage has been through the lens of retaliation that Israel was acting in self-defense to what happened on October 7 but if the icj makes a finding that Israel is now a suspect in a genocide case it changes that lens and it changes the narrative and that shifts things geopolitically in many ways it's just worth stepping back for a moment and not giving a free pass to the Israeli media you have literally had people sitting in TV studios as expert analysts and commentators saying I think we should have killed 100,000 in the first few days and I remember Rwanda and the way actually the media played that role and they were gone after as well so the media is not on trial in the court but we shouldn't give them a free pass either 20 countries have now stepped up to back South Africa putting their names to the case against Israel not one of them is from the West for all their talk of Western values all their moralizing not a single so-called leader in North America or Europe has supported what analysts agree is the best chance to secure a ceasefire to save Palestinian lives history will judge them accordingly come the time those writing their obituaries should do the same Ecuador has been in a state of emergency for the past week as the government there battle an epidemic of drug gang violence one of the most shocking scenes came from a TV station that was stormed by gunman T NAFA is here with more Richard what viewers of Ecuador's TC television saw on Tuesday was like something out of a narco Thriller Mass gang members breaking into the studio in the middle of a news broadcast armed with guns and explosives firing at journalists and taking hostages the police put an end to the attack before it went any further but the Breakin was only the most visible case in this latest escalation of gang violence in Ecuador it began last Sunday when one of the country's most notorious gang leaders escaped from his jail cell triggering uprisings in multiple Ecuadorian prisons where guards were held hostage and reportedly even murdered by prisoners since then gang violence has killed at least 10 people the country's newly elected president Daniel naboa has declared a 60-day state of emergency saying that the country is fighting Narco terrorism and a tough stance on criminal gangs was a core piece of nao's election platform but it's been an uphill struggle earlier on in the campaign nebo's opponent was assassinated just days after pledging a war on criminal gangs and as the attack on TC television made clear media Outlets covering the story are also targets death threats against journalists are common and several broadcasters have been sent explosive devices that has intimidated many reporters into silence on this story thanks TK moving on now to Sudan where the Civil War and resulting humanitarian crisis continue unabated and largely underreported news audiences may remember the images from the capital city carum from April of last year when fighting erupted between two factions of Sudan military hun since then this conflict has engulfed most of the country claiming more than 10,000 lives displacing an estimated 7 million sudanes the international media however are no longer paying close attention a lack of interest that began long before what happened on October 7th getting this story out to the world are Sudanese journalists inside the country and abroad people like Ismael kushkush a Sudanese American writer who left carum just as the war broke out and Yasmin abdal Majid an author broadcaster and editor at the website eyes on Sudan the listening post spoke with both of them on Sudan's year of Crisis and why the news media have failed to convey the scale of this story so do you feel like the story of Sudan has been forgotten H the story of Sudan looking back from the end of 2023 is one that I find really dispiriting actually the that I left that I last saw in 2020 will never exist again not only are we dealing as Sudanese people with this with the weight of the country collapsing but it's also having to deal with it in relative silence in an international media context where there are other Wars that people are paying more attention to and it feels like the sudes people are mourning and grieving Alone 7 million people have been displaced over a million people are now refugees in neighboring countries the amount of death uh that has been recorded uh according to un numbers um at least 10,000 probably higher so I think we we do have one of the largest um catastrophes of of last year still unfolding and still ongoing this time 5 years ago we were witnessing the beginning of protests that would hail the end of the Bashir regim Reports say that Sudan's military has forced president Omar Al Basher to step down ending 30 years of rule and there was this real period of excitement it felt like ah finally we were going to to be known for something apart from a genocide in that for apart from the longest Civil War on the African continent Sudan's December Revolution really um caught the world's attention as one of the most outstanding largely nonviolent uh movement in in recent decades um it provided images that I thought were very Unforgettable many in the world will um remember the image of Alat Salah the Young sudane woman who mounted a car raised her hand dressed in a traditional Sudanese [Applause] Tobe the one image that that for me that remained in my mind of that era really was April 6th a few days before the removal of Al Bashir was to see the amount of protesters uh in front of the Army Headquarters I thought that was a game Cher to me that signaled that the end um of of of government was [Music] near during this transitional period um After the revolution of of 2019 I think uh you could look at it and see this kind of Game of Thrones like situation between two components of the military establishment they then you know turned against each other and that's what we saw in April 2023 fighter jets circling overhead firing missiles gunfire interrupting a live television broadcast the two main belligerant as we like to call them are HTI who's the head of the rapid support forces and Boran who's the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces both HTI and Boran worked together in 2021 to overthrow the transitional Council and declare that they were protecting the revolution of course they were not it was about returning Sudan to a military autocratic regime once the two generals overthrew the the civilian Le government then it became well who's going to be the top dog the rapid support forces that are this irregular paramilitary militia essentially that came out of the Jed the jeds which roughly translates to Devils on Horseback were responsible for the genocide and D 4 that happened 20 years ago in some ways the easy story is to say that it is a tale of two generals or a tale of two belligerant I myself use that framing sometimes because it felt like a way to quickly talk about what was going on but of course that's that's only The Superficial Story the real story is about a challenge that Sudan has faced B over the the decades since Independence and that is how do you govern a country like Sudan without being a general people have lots of different ideas for why Sudan doesn't get the attention internationally that other conflicts do part of it is because it's in Africa and and honestly it is the fact that in the international media stories of conflict in Africa aren't seen as that interesting they're seen as part of the course another reason I think really does contribute to the lack of international media is the challenge for journalists on the ground in 2022 there was about a, 1,100 journalists working in Sudan and this was a great moment actually because under the Bashir uh regime journalists were really really suppressed a recent report that came out of a UNESCO supported um survey said that about 90% of those journalists are unemployed now the displacement of sudanes that has come with the the War uh includes of course journalists and their families according to a recent report by reporters Without Borders uh 26 newspapers have stopped production 10 radio stations have stopped the news coming out of of Sudan by Sudanese journalist has taken a hit and that includes journalists who normally work with International media Outlets ground producers fixers translators Freelancers but there are of course some new Sudanese news outlets that I think they are still doing some good work radio Danga has become really an important uh source of information Sudan tbun of course these are news outlets that have um bases outside of Sudan so I think that the role uh of the the diaspora does play an important role um in covering um there's quite a lot of pressure on those particular journalists to communicate what is happening to the world especially those who are reporting in English I mean there's there's the case of Y who was doing a report on displaced people in Port Sudan who ended up seeing one of her relatives in the in the crowd and as the crowd Parts but that's my uncle that's my uncle it really sums up the challenge for journalists in Sudan trying also to report to the rest of the world it's not just a distanced thing it's not just a theoretical story and as we enter 2024 um we we've starting to see a trickling of U interest in Sudan again trying to keep attention to what is happening in Sudan is something that's important especially that many of us think that as bad as the situation is in Sudan it still can get worse it is moving into a situation where Sudan could easily become what Somalia and Afghanistan were in the 90s um a complete collapse of the state and I think that would just simply be a disaster situation I spend a lot of my time feeling like I'm in two selves there's a self that lives in London that is physically safe that has coffee with my husband in the morning and there's the self that is in the conflict that is watching the news that is seeing the images of you know babies dying in orphanages left alone because nobody's there to save them of women that describe awful abuses that have been visited on their bodies and also feeling this pressure to really do something about it because that responsibility is real and I think there is some sense whether it's asper saviorism mentality whether it's you know the idea that that we want to be able to just fix it but you have to be able to just focus on what is within your control who are the individual people you can help who what are the individual stories you can share that will that will move the needle if all it is today is sending a message to every single one of your family and checking that they're alive that's important too that has a place too in closing frequent viewers of our program will have noted that that peace on Sudan and our previous mention of the situation in Ecuador are the first stories we have done since October 7th that have not been about Israel's war on Gaza and we still have some more catching up to do on developments in other countries and regions stories rich in media angles the kind that we've covered in the more than 15 years of doing this show that is not to say though that we're turning our back on the Gaza story we'll stay on it from the court case in the ha to the devastation on the ground and all of the geopolitical aspects we're not moving on just trying to keep up with the rest of the world we'll see you next time here at the listening
