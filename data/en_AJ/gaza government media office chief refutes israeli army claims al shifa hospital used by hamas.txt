go to a press conference that's being held at the asifa hospital earlier on it was suggested by Israel that Hamas had been using the hospital as a base let's listen into the Press confence speaking in a non-palestinian accent and after due verification the Israeli occupation forces have been using technology to fabricate audio records and to fabricate images the Israelis have failed to provide a single piece of evidence to prove that this facility has tunnels underneath or sent any Command Center underneath this is home to more than 60,000 people taking Refuge within the compound in addition to thousands of patients and victims let alone thousands of medical personnel the false fabricated evidence made by the Israeli occupation forces are so naive that a six grader can fabricate ones like these and we can make similar ones I repeat and I reiterate these are false fabricated allegation raised by the Israelis that constitute no valid evidence the Israeli Recon War planes and drones have been hovering above our heads for 20 days and for years before yet they failed to provide a single piece of evidence to prove that this facility has tunnels and Command Center underneath another lie by the Israeli occupation forces is that the fuel provided by onor is stolen it is a fabricated lie it was refuted by the general commissioner Mr Philip aarini when he was asked today in the press conference about the allegation that f is stolen he said verbatim there is no evidence that fuel coming to the Ona was stolen he added the fuels reached are very limited and cannot even provide for their operations to the south of Gaza even he posted images of the fuel tanks at Rafa Crossing which are current Curr ly under construction these facilities as we speak did not receive a single liter of fuel even these empty tanks were falsely a Accused by the Israeli occupation forces as depos Depot for fuel the Israeli occupation forces targeted those stanks another lie propagated by the Israelis the Army spokesman about calling the gazans to move to a safe area namely to head to the South we thank him for his ethics at the same time this is utter rudness utter hubris the Israeli are calling people and instructing them to head south yet they are shelling those safe areas from the beginning of this pleasance the Israeli occupation forces targeted the uto marketplace where more than 70 people were killed it is a series of false lies a series of fabricated reports fabricated and alleged by the Israeli occupation forces and even as we speak the Israeli is bombarding the south of Gaza Strip more than 65% of the victims killed to the south of Gaza are 3,423 Palestinians more than 65% of all those killed since the beginning of the Israeli 568 people were from those who followed in the false claims by the Israelis and moved to the South and even as we speak the Israelis and their spokesmen are still propagating false reports a fifth lie is the red marked areas as marked by the Army spokesman these areas are purely medical facilities within Al shifa Hospital compound the first one is the emergency unit where we are standing now this one is the Outpatient Clinic which is now turned it into shelter and also it part of it has transformed into operation theater for surgery this third area is the Intensive Care Unit and other specialized units the fourth one is the clinic for dialysis the last one is the incubator for newborns all these are purely medical facilities emergency unit intensive care units incubators for baby borns and dialysis and other units there is nothing true in the false fabricated claims alleged by the Israelis even this incubator is home to dozens of new baby again the Israeli occupation forces are falely claiming that alifa hospital containing military facilities for the past 70 years we stood our ground and we will continue to stand State fast this is further reinforced by the belance of the Israelis the violence the indiscriminate killing of our people will turn us more resolved to stand our ground therefore I reiterate all these medical facilities are operating on 170% occupancy now I will give the floor to the head of the facility to give you further details about these facilities I would like to point out that the Israelis did not stop at this point yesterday the representatives and the United Nations demonstrated a piece of video clip showing a heinous crime by a sharp tool yesterday Russia [Music] Today posted a report refuting the claims of the Israelis this report refuting the false accusation was presented to the public it is an old video and it was posted on the internet months before October 7th this is a living proof that the Israeli occupation forces continue with their lies continue with their false reports continue with their fabricated evidence and the last of which was today by the Army spokesman alleging that this facility has tunnels underneath before I leave I will give the floor to Dr Muhammad abuya the head of the facility to speak in details about the particulars of these units within the compound the Israeli Army spokesman threatens to strike hospital he is not only threatening us he is threatening 2.2 million people this facility is serving them all the specialization surgeries and all the medical treatments are provided by this Center we are catering to all the gazans even from RAF simply it is a death sentence again is 2.2 million people we are standing in the emergency unit it was opened only four months ago it was built by the unor and they know exactly from even the concrete pillars underneath up to every single Brick by which the hospital was built and we do not believe that an international organization would build a terrorist facilities this hospital is serving and Catering to all the Gans patients victims pregnant women and even baby born even as we are operating above our occupancy rate we are operating everywhere even on the floor and emergency unit it is home to thousands of victims in addition to thousands of medical Crews we have other five intensive care units more than 70 cases on respiratory artificial respiratory apparatuses any act will put these life to dangers we have 50 Baby Bones 50 Baby Bones who were born with less weight and they are put in dedicated incubators those babies cannot be abandoned they cannot even be moved from one room to another we do not believe there is any hospital or medical facility capable of receiving those baby born as we are running out of beds and Facilities we are operating on the on the floor the dialysis unit has 57 apparatuses the entire Gaza Strip does not have any similar facility it is catering to more than 150 kidney patient every day I two days ago we were visited by the representative of the International Red Cross the red crescent on Nora and the representative of the World Health Organization if they believe there is any form of threat or danger they wouldn't have come here in addition we took them around and we have them visit and inspect each and every corner of the hospital they told us we have seen and heard about the atrocities but seeing this in reality is a different story this facility is catering to the entire Gaza Strip it is the lifeline of the 2.2 million people living in Gaza we are trying to cater to our patients and victims the Israeli Army spokesman is propagating false lies and fabricating reports we are open to the International Community come and see for yourself and we call on the media Representatives present here to show around we insisted that this press conference is held at this very part of of the hospital it is the emergency unit and it is an example of each and every corner of the compound in the face of the false lies perpetrated by the Israelis we warn that what is being falsely propagated by the Israelis is a precursor for striking this medical fac faity it is a precursor to perpetrate yet another Holocaust another Pro program this is the usual practice of the Israelis this is exactly what happened when they bombarded alahi Baptist hospital they falsely alleged that the resistance fighter are using facility I reiterate these are false reports they executed their threats and shelled the Baptist Hospital killing 500 people on the spot I warn the whole world I Ring the Alarm Bill there is imminent danger hovering above the medical facility about 80,000 lives 80,000 lives patients victims medical personnel and people taking shelter in the facility all those lives will be at RIS if anything happens to them your their blood will be on the international community's hands this medical facility ities is supervised by the UN wh or Nora and other International organizations and all those organizations are responsible for the safety of every single life in this facility it is not responsibility it is an obligation this flagrant threat comes by the Israelis as they intensify their air strikes targeting the food supply stores and other infrastructure including bakeries water tanks even small supermarkets this also comes with another threat to service facility of the municipality serving 1 million people which means this the municipality will be totally out of operation and this facility as a result the lifeline of the health sector and the lifeline of the service sector will be to reped we are left with very few Food Supplies and very few bakeries which were at hand before this pleasur it is nothing short of genocide it is a death sentence against 2.2 million people in Gaza if alifa Hospital Falls the entire Health sector will fall the entire Health sector will collapse once again we reiterate amid the threats voiced bluntly by the Israeli occupation forces turning a blind eye to the war ethics human rights or human values they continue with yet another crime the whole world and international organizations must live up to their obligation let the Israeli occupation forces allow representatives of the international organization into Gaza the Israelis continue with their false lies if those representatives are allowed in they can come and refute the false fabricated reports propagated by the Israelis this is the reality we are standing in alifa hospital we and all you see behind me are victims to the Holocaust perpetrated by the Israelis for the

nothing to hide we are catering to save lives it is the only Lifeline left to Gaza and the gazans yet again to their huis the Israelis are threatening to strike these facilities now we call on all representatives of the media to take an inspection tour throughout all the facilities mentioned and falsely accused by the Israeli Army spokesman to refute the false report propagated we will Lively
