Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the icj ruling his office has issued a joint statement with the foreign Ministry saying the charges of genocide brought by South Africa against Israel at the international court of justice in the ha are false outrageous and morally repugnant he goes on to say Israel has not and will not conduct military actions in Rafa that create conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population well Israel has banned Al jazer so our correspondent Imran Khan's joining us now from Jordan's capital Aman so we heard that reaction from the foreign Ministry and Benjamin netanyahu's office what other reaction is coming out of Israel this morning well that reaction from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu came as a direct result of an emergency meeting that he called with the foreign minister Israel cat also with Benny Gans who's a member of the war cabinet and the government's top uh judicial adviser that's how seriously they're taking this icj ruling also we heard from the Finance Minister bet theel smrd he said the state of Israel is is at a war for its existence in sad times in history we couldn't stand on our own today the Jewish people have the independence and ability to protect their lives we also heard from avigor Libman he's the leader of the Israel bet betu party he says the court decision proves that the United Nations organizations have turned into aiding terrorists in the world and we've been hearing that word that term a lot aiding the UN is aiding terrorists and that's really likely to be a lot of the thrust of the other reaction coming through from Israel but while all that reaction was coming out uh there was another key move by the United States it had a phone call with the Egyptian leadership where they agreed to open the Rafa border crossing for humanitarian Aid that's a key part of the icj ruling is it a a coincidence well uh if you're listening to isra political commentators uh what they're saying is this is America coming to Israel's rescue this is the first part of the of America turning around to the icj and saying okay the things that Israel can do it will do remember Israel has to respond to the icj within a month if Rafa is open that's certainly one strong response that Israel will have uh the so if you're taking a look at all of this then it seems to me that the uh Americans are actually trying to force the Israelis uh to at least take this seriously but they're not going to stop giving them weapons they're not going to stop giving the money indeed uh the Americans have been absolutely clear Israel has the right to defend itself and it has the right to go after Hamas uh and that's something that will put them on a collision course with the international uh court of justice Imran Khan in Jordan's capital am man Emon thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al zer
