a global gathering in Jordan calls for Aid to be accelerated into Gaza it comes more than 8 months into Israel's war but how is providing more Aid possible without a ceasefire and what have Regional countries done to help Palestinians this is Inside Story [Music] hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle Israel's war on Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian disaster a conference in Jordan saw a push by world powers to get more Aid to those in need but a major relief effort will likely depend on a ceasefire and an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip so could Regional Powers be doing more to help and how serious are the latest proposals for a ceasefire we'll present these questions and more to our panel in just a moment first this report by Finton Monahan Jordan and Egypt organized the biggest Gathering yet aimed at coordinating a humanitarian response to the war on Gaza there was a consensus that Aid must flow but that the only way to end the crisis is a ceasefire excellencies the horror must stop it's high time for a ceasefire along with the unconditional release of hostages please raise their hand a US ceasefire proposal recently got the backing of the UN Security Council Hamas wants amendments but says it's engaging positively with the plan Israel hasn't publicly accepted the proposal but its us allies say it is on board when I met prime minister Netanyahu uh yesterday in Israel he reaffirmed his support and his commitment to bringing this proposal across the Finish Line as negotiations drag on the people of Gaza are suffering more than 37,000 have been killed and there's famine in many areas Israel is blocking aid supplies and is widely accused of using starvation as a weapon of War it is necessary for Israel to end the state of Siege and stop using the weapon of starvation to punish the people of the Gaza Strip and to remove all obstacles to the immediate sustainable adequate access to humanitarian and relief Aid to the Gaza Strip from all Crossings the conference reflects a broad agreement in the International Community that Gaza needs Aid and the fighting needs to stop but making that happen will require cooperation from all sides Vinton Mahan Al jazer for Inside Story well let's bring in our guests now and Ender Al Bala in central Gaza Isa Mana spokesman for the international Committee of the Red Cross and red crescent in a man Jordan tahani Mustafa senior Palestine Analyst at the international crisis group and ramala in the occupied West Bank Mustafa bouti Secretary General of the Palestine National initiative a very warm welcome to all of you at tahani everyone in Jordan agreed that more Aid must get into Gaza but the question is how does that happen well that's right at the conference there was uh the emphasis on the need for more Aid given the dire humanitarian situation there um we heard King Abdullah uh talk about how Jordan uh would commit to more a sorry air drops uh the need for some kind of land Corridor to guarantee the entry of more sufficient Aid uh which is what we have not uh been seeing going into Gaza uh but again you know this is really two Arab states Egypt and Jordan that are playing a very delicate PR game in terms of the logistics in terms of the the the actual operational elements to make all of that possible I mean none of that was really substantially discussed uh what was more is the fact that the the pledges that Jordan is making are really just sticking plasters here uh you know really ultimately a distraction from the more you know pressing issue of the fact that you do actually need land corridors you have sufficient land corridors but there was really no emphasis on on how to actually get that guarantee from Israel there was no emphasis in the fact that Israel has not been a good good faith partner in trying to ensure that sufficient amounts of Aid go in uh and neither was there any mention of the fact that Egypt actually allows Israel to dictate uh its policy on its Gaza border danan plenty of points to pick up on there in this discussion first of all I just want to get the view on the ground from the Gaza Strip Hisham to what extent can this conference improve the humanitarian situation as it stands there right now thank you Laura for having me yesterday the president of the icrc Mrs Marana sparich uh delivered two main asks in The Summit in the DC the first one was to call for an immediate uh implementation faithful implementation of both the spirits and the letters of the Geneva conventions and uh that part the conflict are committed to uh facilitate the implementation of the agreement that would eventually lead to First ensure the protection of civilians secondly um ensure that all those deprived of their Liberties can be treated humanly and eventually the um the full release of the hostages the second main ask was that a political agreement that would should come in effective um must ensure that a functional humanitarian system would be put in place considering the fluctuation of the humanitarian Aid the tremendous challenges that are facing humanitarian workers in Gaza to get that urgently needed assistance into Gaza and deliver it to the thousands of people who are desperate for it and also um to ensure the protection for the humanitarian workers uh working across the Gaza St I thought it was very interesting just to jump in there because we heard the icrc president saying that the status quo cannot hold and yet it seems that people outside of the country are quite happy to let things go on as they are but it's worth remembering isn't it that this is a situation that is not sustainable absolutely stat can because it's very much dangerous people have been suffering from this fighting since um since last since the October 7th 2023 for8 months now thousands of people have been killed vast majority of the G is now brought to Rubble including infrastructure homes residential buildings hospitals and uh they cannot rebuild their lives as the used to do after each round of conflict of violence in the last 15 years this one is completely unprecedented and we fear that this dangerous tolerance with the violations that we witnessed um could actually shape the future of uh the next Wars or Warfare witnessing in this world so it's it's very much important to achieve a breakthrough the international committee Red Cross stands ready to facilitate any agreement that would be realized once it's announced and we stand ready to uh continue providing our humanitarian assistance okay Mustafa BAGI I mean the only real obstacle to Aid apart from Egypt controlling its side of the raff acrossing as toan said the only other obstacle is Israel's blockade of Gaza but what do you make of the fact that Israel wasn't even at this conference well of course uh the main problem is Israel not anybody else and the main problem is that Israel is continuing this terrible War these terrible massacres this terrible genocide against the Palestinian people and uh the first thing that one has to say is that there is no substitute to land passages uh all these talks about air drops and this port that there are many so many question marks about will not solve the problem the only way to get Aid to Gaza is to lift The Siege and allowed all the land passages from Jordan and from Egypt to to to to work and the one from Egypt would not be able to work as long as the Israeli Army is occupying the the passage and occupying the RAF Crossing but more important in addition to that even if all land passages are working this will not alleviate the problem the problem will not stop getting deteriorated unless there is a complete and total ceasefire unless Israel stops this terrible War we are talking here not only about the fact that there are 47,000 Palestinians killed if you include the 10,000 who are under the Rabel and with no less than 16,000 children probably and more than 84,000 people injured many of whom will not be treated because there are no medical facilities left since Israel destroyed most of them but in addition to that even the land passages will not solve the fact that there is no water supplies no clean water one of the problems we have our Medical Teams at Medical relief has to deal with is that we have a huge number of people now with infectious hepatitis an epidemy that spread because of lack of Clean Water we have to deal with 1.3 million people who are sick now with gastro entries with with other problems and with many people who are suffering from starvation there are at least 35 children who are just about to die because of starvation because of lack of baby milk because of lack of support to their families so I don't think the solution will happen unless the world Community exercises immediate sanctions on Israel okay to force before we go there before we go to that let's look at the ceasefire prospects because as we just before we were going to record this program we did hear from the US Secretary Anthony uh blinken Secretary of uh state of isra sorry the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin in K alongside the Qatari prime minister they were speaking because they are looking to bring both sides back to the table talking about Biden's ceasefire proposal the qari Prime Minister said that he senses a shift in the conflict toan do you agree that there is a shift right now in the conflict and that a ceasefire Could Happen relatively soon unfortunately I don't share that optimism uh I think at the moment we are still facing uh two sides that have uh two mutually exclusive demands here Hamas want to see the withdrawal uh of Israel from Gaza they want to see uh a total cessation of hostilities a permanent ceasefire uh before all other conditions can then be be worked out uh on the other side you've got Israel that is still going full maximalist in terms of its objectives of destroying Hamas not just militarily but as an administrative body uh a political social entity uh which you know so far we know it has not been able to qualify where Israel has claimed to destroy Hamas it has managed to reestablish itself as both a military entity and as an administrative body so unfortunately uh I think it's very unlikely that we're going to see a ceasefire anytime soon it's just it's completely unrealistic and we I mean we've even seen that in terms of Israel not even being able to actually we've seen Hamas come out and say that it's willing to accept that proposal on the condition that it gets serious guarantees from either Israel or or its us mediator but we haven't seen anything similar from the Israeli side if anything we've seen statements that have completely undermined this proposal well tan let me put it to you then if you don't see a ceasefire on the horizon anytime soon and Israel is not at the table when talking about an an urgent need to an increase of humanitarian Aid what is the point of having a conference like we had in Jordan I mean this is two two uh Arab regimes that are dealing or or playing a very delicate PR game here at home uh Jordan is in the Jordanian regime itself is in a very precarious situation on the one hand it has tried to balance its rhetoric with regards to this war it its image in terms of providing things like air drops and Aid and medical convoys but at the same time the fact that Jordan has been able to provide in some ways some diplomatic cover for for what Israel has done in Gaza the fact that it is still um in many ways engaging in economic and security ties with with Israel has not been lost on its population at all uh and this is also coming against the backdrop of a time where the Jordanian regime even prior to the 7th of October was in a real frictitious precarious uh uh relationship uh with many jordanians uh and so this this really is just a matter of public postering and the same thing with uh with Egypt Egypt is again in a very very delicate situation here uh where public sentiment at home is just simply not jelling with Egypt's foreign policy Hasam I want to pick up on uh what is actually happening inside Gaza we saw the Raffa Crossing closing about a month ago go and that blocked off an enormous amount of Aid and really made delivery of Aid across the Gaza Strip incredibly difficult how now does it get in and how is it distributed throughout Gaza thank you for this important question uh since the start of the Israeli military operation in Rafa uh in in the on the sixth of of May um we have witnessed a significant decline in the amount of humanitarian Aid entering Gaza and eventually reaching the people in need especially after closing theak Crossing which was the main gateway for not only for the humanitarian Aid uh that's entering Gaza bya trucks uh but also with the humanitarian workers including surgeons doctors nurses Specialists and infrastructure uh it also prevented uh many casualties and and and and and patients who were entitled to receive medical treatment abroad because it's not available in Gaza and they are now in much vulnerable situation so they are actually in um in facing uh the imminent risk of of losing their lives because they're not receiving that treatment um also we are receiving reports coming from norn Gaza Strip that people are still struggling with finding sufficient amount of food and they are um sleeping on empty stomachs um this has tremendous uh uh impacts on their uh on their Healthcare on their and their well-being as well there are many casual and Northern G strip and like barely functioning hospitals who are scheduled for surgeries that are not performed because there's no capability of doing that and they need to be transferred to sou Gaza Strip so there is no efficient humanitarian system at the moment that would allow urgently readed response including health care including clean water including hot meals to be uh to reach the people in need and this has to change immediately not just in the framework of political agreement but this is more of a legal obligation on parties to the conflict and Israel as occupying power must ensure that civilians um reach uh all Necessities that are needed for their own Survival including food including water including healthare and on top of all Safety and Security in addition to that humanitarian workers have been living and facing what the majority of the people are facing in Gaza our icrc staff members are living literally intense and they are challenged with the daily challenges that are faced by uh facing the whole population and yet they start to they they show up every day to work but there as as the ICC president mentioned yesterday the the entire humanitarian system is being pushed to a point of collapse if there is no breakthrough uh uh foreen in the very very near future Mustafa when you look at what can be done we know that Israel has taken control of the Palestinian side of Rafer it's also taken control of the Philadelphia Corridor this buffer zone between Egypt and G now that was a red line for Egypt so why haven't we seen Egypt act on it put more leverage on Israel well I don't know what the Egyptians should do but uh it's not just Egypt I think it's the whole world that is not doing what it should do uh let's remember that the icj the international court of justice decided and made a resolution or an order as a matter of fact to Israel to stop the military operation in Russ this was never fulfilled Israel continues the attacks on RAF and they continue the attacks in the north and they continue the attacks in the center there is no safe place in in all of Gaza and uh as I said as long as this war continues this this this this humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate and that's why I think now we have to look at the real picture I think Hamas has accepted the UN Security Council resolution they've even accepted practically Biden's proposal which he claimed was an Israeli proposal it is Israel that did not accept them yet if we look I want to jump in again Mustafa because if we look if we zoom in a little bit on the region yes the world has failed to take Israel to task but one would expect more of the Arab nations in particular because they stand on the side of the Palestinians but what exactly have they done to help them in my opinion all Arab countries and all Islamic countries should start by imposing immediate sanctions on Israel and uh this call for sanctions should go should go also worldwide but yes it is the responsibility of the Arab countries and and Islamic countries in particular who are the brothers of the Palestinian people and who say that they are supporting the Palestinian CA to start by themselves in my opinion Netanyahu will not stop without sanctions he will not stop because his goal and his aim is to extend this worldall till till maybe the end of the year hoping that Trump will be elected and then he will get much more support from the United States of America and he has to be stopped and he can be stopped only by imposing sanctions on him or threatening him with sanctions okay but this whole humanitarian terrible crisis will not stop unless the ceasefire is there but let me just one last point it is must it is very important to clarify that the Palestinian side accepted the UN Security Council resolution and engaged in negotiating about it it is the Israeli side that still rejects it absolutely and we we we'll have to wait in the coming days to hear more on the Israeli response to that ceasefire toan I just want to pick up on the sanctions issue so far we've only really seen turkey taking action against Israel cutting some of its trade or most of its trade with Israel why are we not seeing Jordan doing that why are we not seeing Egypt doing that or the Gulf Nations why so little action I mean these countries are very dependent if you talk about Jordan and Egypt these are countries that are entirely dependent on on primarily Western Aid uh they simply don't have the capacity to to take a stance even if they could uh Jordan is a really good example of that where Jordan doesn't even have entire sovereignty over its uh Land and Sea space the fact that it has signed numerous memorandum deals with the US for instance has given the US practically free reign to to use Jordan as a as a military base to however it sees fit which is what we have actually seen um in the last few months when we had the Iran Israel um scuffle where uh effectively it was largely uh us and and and the Israelis that were using their air defense systems to to shoot down missiles and drones and what was worse was that they were doing it over populated areas you know places like the the administrative Capital here um you know that has not again that has not been lost on their populations the fact that these countries have absolutely no capacity to take a serious stance if anything in some cases countries like Jordan and even Egypt had provided the Diplomatic cover very early on when uh you had the Arab League trying to uh take a resolution of of cutting uh all economic diplomatic and and security ties with Israel it was these countries that had normalization deals and were also in uh dependent on Western Aid that blocked that resolution at the start of this Onslaught uh and since then they have not tried to leverage any of their normalization deals to to try and uh push for anything positive for the Palestinians in the last eight months hhan when you talk to people there to what extent is there a sense of Abandonment by not in the region but the World At Large you can hear that in every um every moment uh you interact with anyone in Gaza despite their age their sex their background um everyone in Gaza wants to stop this war everyone wants to go back to their homes even if they have no home left even if their entire neighborhood is destroyed they just would would go back and live even in aemp but they just want this to come to an end and uh there's a general sense of abandon abandonment uh indeed uh and uh this has created even extra pressure on the humanitarian workers that who have been shouldering responsibility of um making sure that people receive the aid that that they are in need for and they are entitled to receive um from our experience we have been in Israel and the occupied territory since 1967 and we have been part of this community for decades uh what we have witnessed since the last since since last October is completely unprecedented and from the icrc experience in armed conflicts we ABS we are absolutely sure that humanitarian solution cannot be the solution for ending the humanitarian suffering military actions cannot achieve that as well the politic agreements could eventually put an end to this Bloodshed so we are not involved in the political discussions or negotiations as humanitarian intermediary however we remain fully ready to start implementing any agreement once it's realized between the you know the departs the confli and this is part of the effort that the ICP is actually pursuing um including its president uh with both you know we have spoken directly to both Hamas and Israel we have spoken to third party countries and authorities who have influence on both um but I can assure you that people cannot continue to survive they cannot live on the survival mode for for any longer they have invested everything in their capacity and just as a reminder Gaza has faced the brunt of 16 years of restrictions on the movement good of people for 16 years the amount of the level of um um um food insecurity for example at population level has exceeded 80% then October 7th happened so people could not even afford to rent a transort transportation or a bus or a car or even a drag you know C by donkeys to move their belongings because they have to go to a safer place after receiving evacuation orders they have been living like that for for eight months now and there's no way any human being can continue living like that so we cannot actually keep you know bidding on how people can cope and mitigate any longer Mustafa the Palestinian president abass there in ramala he was at the Jordanian conference but otherwise he's been largely sidelined throughout this conflict how dangerous is that for Palestinians at large I'm talking about uh those in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank well West Bank itself is subjected now to terrible atrocities by Israel I mean in the last 48 hours the Israeli Army killed 14 Palestinians in different parts of the West Bank and they continue their attacks and uh the life of a Palestinian is is worth nothing for Israelis whether in Gaza or in the West Bank but the Palestinian leadership is also facing a grave challenge because Israel and the United States of America to some extent and some other countries are try trying to take away from Palestinians their right of self-representation and the o leadership can only save the situation by accepting our demand of creating a unified Palestinian leadership within the ranks of the PLO including everybody what the world must see and should see is a unified Palestinian front a unified Palestinian leadership and a new interim government that should be a consent National consensus government that should be interim and that should promise the people to organize elections once once this war is over one of the very most and most important issues here is that the Palestinians have the right to choose their leaders freely and democratically and it is not Israel or United States or any other country that have the right to impose on us who should lead us about I'm talking about next I'm I'm just going to bring the the conversation just back to the president if I'm apologies for interrupting we just got time for one more question I just want to put it to tahani in the absence of a ceasefire you pretty pessimistic about getting a little earlier how does this urgently needed Aid get into Gaza because something's got to get in well look Aid organizations themselves have said it King Abdullah himself said it uh there is no substitute for land corridors you have them they are there uh the problem is Israel uh is is the one dictating uh what goes in and what goes out so unless there is actually any serious substantial pressure from Israel rather than these uh kind of distractive um sticking plaster mechanisms of air drops and and and trying to deliver Aid through the sea where already we've seen that it is in completely inefficient has cost lives Palestinian lives has not delivered anywhere near the the required amounts of Aid and has actually been far more costly um there really is no substitute to that there really needs to be pressure on Israel here there needs to be some sort of concerted International effort to get Israel to allow Goods sufficient amounts of goods to go in through existing land Crossings okay there we have to leave our discussion
