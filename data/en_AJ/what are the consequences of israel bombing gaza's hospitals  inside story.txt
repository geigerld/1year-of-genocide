Israel bombs gaza's hospitals attacking an already crumbling Health Service their place is protected by international law where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter what is the state of gaza's health care System ravaged by Siege and War this is Inside Story [Music] hello again I'm James Bay there are limits to War as defined by international law such as the protection of hospitals and places of Refuge these have had no apparent effect on Israel's Onslaught in Gaza early on news of hospitals being attacked prompted widespread International outrage with Israel accused of war crimes yet more and more hospitals have been targeted other health services have been hit to ambulances bombed for example repeated attacks on the same place rules out the possibility of accidental strikes all this has further battered a health system crumbling after years of blockade and War what fuse stocks of medicine and basic supplies that remain are dwindling so how can Palestinians get treatment in such dire circumstances and how do medical staff cope we'll be discussing all that in a few moments with our panel of guests but first hanim Mahmud reports from KH Unis in southern Gaza well Stark Dreadful and incapable or as the Israeli media Outlets describe it it's a war to end all the wars but so far Israel is using it sophisticated attack Jets and heavy artilleries destroying residential homes hospitals schools and public facilities creating a tsunami of casualties and killing thousand of civilians so far Palestinians are asking a question how many should die before Israel stop this blood bath Han mm City for inside his story on Friday and Saturday the Israeli Army intensified its bombardment of hospitals everyone from medical workers on the ground to the World Health Organization is warning it's putting hundreds of thousands of lives at risk Alexandra bers explains to start with 16 of gaza's 35 hospitals or nearly half are no longer functioning and the casualties are mounting every minute those still operating are overcrowded and doctors say conditions are catastrophic two of the biggest the Indonesian hospital and alifa are at risk of running out of power gaza's only cancer hospital was also attacked and suspended operations after it ran out of fuel basic supplies are hard to come by Dr have had to use vinegar as a disinfectant screws and sewing needles others perform surgeries in crowded corridors without anesthetic the health Ministry has warned babies and incubators are at eminent risk in addition to the patient seeking medical treatment displaced families have turned to hospitals for safety and shelter hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are camping out in the surrounding areas and so far Israel has bombed at least five hospitals the health Ministry says more than 130 medical staff have been killed and at least 25 ambulances targeted since the beginning of Israel's war on Gaza deliberately targeting Medical Teams and hospitals is a violation of the Geneva conventions and the Palestine red crescent society says Israel's actions could amount to war crimes for more now let's bring in our panel of guests in Gaza City with we have Dr Ahmed mol laati the head of the plastic surgery department at the alifa hospital it's the biggest medical complex in Gaza and was targeted recently in Israeli strike in rala nebal fasak a spokeswoman for the Palestinian red Cresent society and in Alexandria and Egypt it's mads Gilbert who heads the emergency department at the University Hospital of North Norway he's also a professor of medicine who's worked in Gaza for many years including in the 2014 War thank you all of you for joining us I think we should start by going to Dr Ahmed there in the shifa hospital uh you are an Irish Palestinian uh surgeon who is there on the ground in Gaza City um you have seen many things in the past gaz's had four Wars before this one but did you ever think you'd see a situation as bad as this so thanks for for having us actually it's my first war in Gaza yes I moved to Gaza last February from London I was in S Thomas Hospital uh but what have everyone described here is this is one of the worst they have ever seen this horrible situation uh the the the atmosphere here is there is no safe place at all there is no one safe at all there is no way that we see any any light by the end of this tunnel so there is there there is nothing we can expect would improve the current situation in hospital which is 700 bit capacity in the first few hours we received more than a thousand casualities in this Hospital what's happening now all the hospital uh beds are full patients are on the ground they are all over crowded we have more than 50,000 people in shifa hospital uh refugees or just evacuating in sha Hospital assuming it's one of the safest places the weapons they have used are totally different from the old ones I'm a burn surgeon I deal with burn patients the kind of bur and the depth of bur we've seen is is totally different you can see this fly this part of the very crowded place that everything is let me say not that sip aseptic there is no way that you keep can keep anything clean in this hospital so back the burns are really severe extensive burn and you keep the bride in cleaning the burn and then in a few days you get again deeper layers of burn so uh the whole system I I think it's collapsing or it's collapsed already because when you have hospitals full icus are full theaters half of the theaters are functioning only because the patients are crowded in the recovery rooms uh the supplies we get uh has almost finished what we got As in the last few days is is very minimal for what we need what we consume in Gaza now in one day is more than what we used to consume in a month time so we are running out of everything electricity now we work on in sh Hospital which the main hospital in the secondary smaller generator where many departments they they don't have electricity they don't have lights maybe here I'm in a theater theaters and ICU are still running as well as the emergency department but we are at what at any point at the risk of running out of the fuel the water you hardly get water we we had really difficulties getting good drinking water or natural drinking water the one we drink is very weird taste for that we don't know where it's coming from there is no mineral water remained in Gaza at the current time for the Dr ahed let me just interrupt you there Dr Ahmed let me just interrupt you there because on top of all of this uh we had on the afternoon of the 3rd of November an attack on a convoy of ambulances that were going to take people to Rafa for medical care in Egypt um when they left alifa and then they came back to alifa because they came under attack and the Very hospital that you're in right now came under attack yes exactly you know what happened yesterday exactly that uh the shifa hospital is overcloud we have more than 2,000 patients now in the hospital and thanks to the Egyptian they approved to get us uh less than 100 patients to be evacuated to Egypt so the icrc and the UN everyone refused to arrange for these patient transport as where the international law and then we found no way here to get the patients transported from shifa hospital to raah borders so from the middle of Gaza to the south of Gaza so the ministry after a few days of waiting has decided that we will move this group of ambulances and we will inform everyone that these ambulance will move at this certain time from shifa hospital through Rashid which is the beach the main Coastal Road uh down to Rafa borders and they informed everyone what happened they start moving from shifa hospital in two or three minutes time in ansar roundabout they just uh bombed the first ambulance and then the holy group decided to go back to shifa hospital when they arrived to shifa entrance they bumbed another hospital another ambulance and we got at least 15 people killed in that attack and 7 where were where were you at the time Dr Ahmed where were you at the time I was really lucky 10 minutes before the attack I was there at the entrance trying to find something to eat so it's the entrance of the hospital it's more of a small Market where everyone try to get something to eat there so there are like food street food there there are many shops with with selling you know few things not shops like small places to buy something so I went there trying to find something to eat I was there with two of my colleagues 10 minutes before the attack and we're super lucky you know that you just we got Escape that one because when they bumped that place it's super super crowded I think we were lucky that the strike happened between an ambulance and another car otherwise the shr would have killed at least two or 300 people it's super crowded there and what we believe this is chipa hospital this is part of chipa hospital it's it's the entrance of chipa Hospital which assumed to be one of the safest places for the people here nebal you are from the Palestinian red crescent it was your ambulances that were bombed let me just tell you what the Israeli military said they say it was an air strike on an ambulance being used by Hamas and a number of Hamas terrorist terrorist operatives their words were killed your reaction our reaction was happened yesterday was um a war crime intentionally targeting a group of ambulances while they were trying to conduct their humanitarian role transporting critically injured patients to go to Rafa through Rafa to go to get treatment uh in Egypt unfortunately as the doctor said we were only in our way hering towards the South to transport the wounded people we were five ambulance es one of all of them for the Ministry of Health one of them is for the Palestine red Cresent and during that time due to a block a a blockade on the street because of the bombardment we had to return around and then when we are returning around in AR Rashid Street the first bombardment took a place which um Target the Palestine uh the Ministry of Health ambulance and then we were continued towards aifp when the second bombardment happened uh and um it has resulted to the damage of the Palestine ricent ambulance as well as two colleagues were critically injured what um Israel is saying is just a justification for multiple attacks against medical missions and Medical Teams this should not be acceptable the healthare Workers Health Care personnel as well as health care facilities should be Pro protected according to the international humanitarian law up to this moment the Palestine Crescent have lost eight ambulances went out of service due to a bombardment from Israel occupation forces most importantly we have lost four colleagues who were killed while they were trying to conduct their life saving Mission trying to save other people's life at least 21 other um 21 other colleagues were injured while also trying to save other people's life this is um unacceptable it's just horrifying to see healthc care workers should risk their life in order to save other people's life while according to the international humanitarian law health care facilities and Personnel should be protected we are let me bring let me bring in let me bring in Dr mads now and I don't want to spend all of the discussion assessing Israeli claims um because we could do that and I think we need to concentrate on this on the situation the D situation in Gaza but I am going to bring up one because it's persistent and that is the claim that the alifa hospital where Dr armad is right now and you know it very well Dr mads is the main Hamas command and Control Center built underneath that hospital let's just address that because they keep bringing that up uh thank you and I'd like first to express my deepest respect for the work that Dr Ahmed and the nurses the paramedics and all the volunteers are doing in the in the hospitals in gasa in North Gaza in particular and in ch in particular they are enormously courageous they have been working night and day for more than three weeks now and it is under the most challenging and dangerous circumstances they stand tall beneath their patients they don't leave their patients the conditions are horrible they are getting sick themselves the water is absent the brackish water is used electricity is gone to be a work a health worker under these conditions with um you know 2,000 patients and then being attacked it is a burden it is such a situation that these people deserve over deepest respect now to the claims uh from Israel that shifa is a Hamas Command Center first time we heard this was in 2009 and it's been repeated ever since so they had all these years 16 years to to prove it there is absolutely no proof and um I have been walking freely all over shifa I was working in Shiva shifa during the attack in 2009 and 12 and 14 I take pictures I film I write books I do research on shifa U I've never seen this commanders or this Command Center and had I seen it I would not have worked there because I work according to the Geneva Convention so I I urge the Israeli propaganda people to show the proof my understanding of these allegations is that they want to take the media attention away from the main problem namely namely the massacres of civilians and the attack on healthc care so the journalist will ask again and again and again like yesterday they say oh these were Hamas ambulances without any proof so these constant lies has the function the political function of taking the media attention away from the main course which well you're right so let's take the immediate attention back to actually what's going on on the ground in Gaza with Dr Ahmed and just looking at the problems you're facing there in your hospital I don't really know where to start the lack of medical staff the fact that so many Hospitals and Clinics have been bombed or closed the lack of medicine the lack of surgical supplies The Limited water the fuel that's running out but let's start with with with doctors and nurses I mean how overworked are you because I assume some of the doctors and nurses have been killed or injured so so just to start with you know we're working in totally unsafe atmosphere and and the whole situation is that no one knows where to go to be safe or where to keep their families safe and being in a shifa hospital we assume that this is the safest place but it's the most like threatened place to be bombed and just coming to the big massacre at the AL Hospital which is at Sher hospital we thought that would be the last place to be bombed in Gaza being a hospital f and being a church hospital and 150 years old hospital with the refer with their reference in in UK but what happened that there is no place which can be protected so uh I think the numbers of the uh Medical Professional skills are more than 100 35 were killed more than 20 uh ambulances were uh bombed or just you know uh stried so what we feel there is no place which is safe and don't forget we have our families we have our people so what happened to me that most of my family are in UK and Ireland so I live alone here H I have to bring my family my two my three kids and my pregnant wife to my office here in a small closed place and we mainly mainly have the uh the cans or the noodles to be our main food we hardly get fresh food once every three or four days we get big challenges to get water so what happened now I work with only 30% capacity of our health professionals it's not only me it's all the whole hospital and if you go there you see just yesterday I got only two doctors with me who have to see 200 patients under our list and we have to operate for at least 10 cases per day so the whole situation is collapsing the people are worried we have our plastic Sergeant Dr mam who got killed on I think the day 10 of the attack when he went to go and have some rest in his house we got uh like just this morning one of our doctors his brother is a very in a very critical situation in the in the middle of Gaza where he thought it's like a safer place to evacuate so he would not be able to function you know greatly one of our cleaners the main cleaner his father uh was killed like three weeks ago and then he continued the same day and he's the main cleaner who stayed with us yesterday his cousin was killed as well just he stopped for one or two hours then you have no time to stop so the whole personnel has been you know just suffering and we work with not more than 30% of our capacity regarding the equipments as as a burn surgeon I run out of the blades used for skin gra and I have to I found a box of old things what we called humpy knife which used to be the main knives used in the 70s or 60s uh and they are my my main knives now which I was never trained to use them now so you run whatever you run out of it will not come back the amount of consumables we use are really too much when you go to the hospital you will find the emergency department is full of I I think 250 injured patients on the ground in the corridors there is no place the evacuated people with very bad situation where you are afraid of endemics I have been having flu for the last two weeks you know cuffing and having runny nose for two three days then cuffing you don't know what's happening it's never a healthy atmosphere to work in you will find the flies in the hospital you can't keep the St atmosphere in the hospital because of the gush of cases you get imagine the emergency department of CH Hospital who has to deal with 300 casualties at one point which already full we have the red area the green zone and all this stuff the the red zone now is full they hardly can get two bits free for the critical red zone is the intensive care of the emergency department where we receive the critical patients it's full now with patients we can't keep the patients you know to take their care so we put them in the ground we start working on them the anesthesia medications they are not as needed we have very little of these things the fuel will run out at one point I don't know why the people are looking at this this is a war crime this is a genocide you can't imagine you know when earthquake happened everyone would run just trying to help the people to evacuate the patients okay let me bring in let me bring in let me bring in Dr Dr mads now um Dr mads you are in Egypt you're trying to get to Gaza if you're given per permission to go in there um you have been in the alifa hospital many many times before you've been in that hospital when it's been at War but do you recognize the conditions that you're hearing here the fact they're having to treat people not in beds but are lying on Floors I've heard that in some um places in Gaza doctors are actually using vinegar to disinfect wounds well it's always been very hard to work in shifa during bombardment because it is so insecure and limited as Dr Ahmed is telling but what we see now is unprecedented I have never ever seen anything like it and I think his description is very precise there is barely space on the ground to place patients I mean we've had to put two operating tables in one room we've had crowded places in the Ws but this is beyond anything we have seen before and when you add to that the lack of fuel we know that yesterday they had to stop the oxygen machines that makes oxygen the concentrators they had to stop the sterilizing machines and they had to turn off the air condition for the morch where the where the dead ones are in addition to to not having water and supplies this is a manmade extremely evil situation first you bomb the civilians you injure them then you take them to hospital and you bomb the hospital and you deny the internationally protected people who take care of our wounded uh brothers and sisters whoever they are they deny them the tools and the supplies they need to treat and to rescue people and don't forget that the majority of these patients are children among the 25,000 in there are 7 and a 12,000 children and many of the ones that Dr adid are talking about the burns are children so this is not an earthquake this is all manmade it's meant to be like this because the occupiers the Israeli Army have turned off through the siege of Gaza the water and the fuel and the and electricity and they've turned off the uh medical supplies and we who want to come in Waiting in Egypt to come in are not allowed in so this can I bring you in on the issue can I bring you in in on the issue of fuel I mean fuel is running out there's not very much left how worried are you of fuel running out completely because Israel's not allowing it in and what will then happen we are completely worri regarding running out of a fuel we have already three palent ambulances were stopped because running out of gasoline the situation in our hospital is also catastrophic as highlighted we are running shortages of medical supplies and medicine and most importantly fuel now all hospitals in Gaza have turned into not only a place for wounded people and patients they are a shelter for thousands of civilians we are uh under intense bombardments the Palestine redent run alz hospital alotz hospital for the past days have been under intense bombardments that is taking place all over the hospital which has resulted to complete damage of most building in the surrounding area of the hospital as well as a severe damage for the building at least 42 civilians those who are internally displaced and they are they sought Refugee inside the hospital most of them are children and women Dr Ahmed um we've talked about fuel there's also apparently according to the UN only 5% of gaza's water needs currently being met how worried are you that there could be an even worse well compounding everything we've got um even more bad things coming in in terms of disease I see one official from the IC icrc saying there's a risk of chera diarrhea Hepatitis A and typhoid around the corner listen I've been in in a strictly let me say uh aseptic uh places during my work before moving here and when I moved here I was trying to the same thing what's happening now you can't keep these aseptic sterile conditions at all so the corridors are full of people even the stairs the streets tents the bathrooms are really busy with like loads of people waiting for their so the personal hygiene will be very low because of the lack of water lack of places to get shower or just to clean yourself and then the food and the places so what's happening now it's the best area to get all these colera or pandemics things to happen and it will happen at any point I'm telling you flies are filling the hospital you will see worms in all the wounds very strange you know very like FK let me say like a lot a lot of patients with worms coming out of the wounds it's disgusting to see that I've seen one of the patient with 40% burn who I was doing dressing for the patient daily and then he was full of worms I brought the patient to the theater we watched the room the patient for more than one and a half hour shower with all atic things we use vinegar we use the soup we use the washing what whatever you find there we use because we run out of the usual things and I I put sugar as well on most of the wounds so I use everything I mean the patient at 10:00 in the evening the next day 10:00 in the morning the patient was Again full of worms the situation is you know is really horrible here I don't know what the people are waiting for they are killing the people as they said they should go to South South is safe they killed them on their way they said go to South it's safe they bombed there in South in the UN schools now in the hospital everyone feels that it's unsafe but the people will use it as shelters here so it's full of patients it's full of people it's totally aseptic it's it's totally septic places it's totally crowded places can I ask you very very briefly what would be your one message to the International Community right now from Sha Hospital in Gaza City the kids we see the children we have seen we have been killed in Gaza and not allowed to get the treatment as well and we the basic the basic right of anyone in a catastrophe is to get support from the people outside the medical health professionals are you know we are collapsing we are really tired we can't tolerate more and more it's it's almost a month now for me I've been in the hospital for the whole of a month I can see the people they can hardly work with these circumstances we we are thinking that someone should come and stop this thing and at least we should have support what we believe in everyone should at least help us to evacuate the patient to get more Health you know doctors nurses to support us in what we do what we Face here is like killing us slowly we know the mortality rate is very high for all the patient we can't give them Best Care the care we provide to the patient is very minimal because the equipments are not there the consumers are not work we are really exhausted we are tired I think the system is collapsing it's almost collapsing we feel we are still strong we are fighting we are Fighters the G are known for being Fighters the doctors we will not not leave leave the patients but the situation is catastrophic everyone should stand there and stop this genocide they should stop what's happening to the health system to the people to the kids simply what's behind each child is a sad story I can tell you 70% of the relatives who are coming with the V are not first degree relatives I will ask the how are you related you will not get you know sister or mother or father they would say like you know the whole family was wiped up and we got only you know I am the cousin I'm the far cousin of the kids so what we see here is horrible sometimes I prefer not to ask about the details not to ask about what's behind the story of this CH I just operate on and just carry on because if you keep asking you can't continue operating and working in this catastrophic places so everyone should just stand up and say this is this is a war crime this genocide this has to be stopped Dr Ahmed thank you very much a very harrowing discussion but thanks to all our guests Dr mads Gilbert Nebel farac and in Gaza City Dr Ahmed aati please stay safe to you if you want to see this or any of our other programs again at any
