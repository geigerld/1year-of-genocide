stford Al Z it is 1316 GMT we're taking you to uh the Dead Sea uh conference center in Jordan it's hosting a summit discussing the Urgent humanitarian response for Palestinians in Gaza this is US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin virtually everyone in Gaza depends on Aid to survive most of gaza's Sanitation systems been destroyed fewer than a dozen of gaza's 40 hospitals are open and as we know and have heard more than 270 humanitarian workers have been killed one of those humanitarians uh was Jamal Abu Kwak a longtime UNR staffer in Gaza who for years was the United States main local contact and for many a friend he was killed last month after evacuating Rafa he was looking for shelter for his family he survived by his wife and his four children the single most effective step we can take to address the Urgent humanitarian challenges in Gaza is to reach an immediate and ultimately enduring ceasefire 11 days ago President Biden set out a comprehensive proposal to do precisely that in its first 6 weeks The Proposal would provide for a full ceasefire the pullback of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza the release of a number number of hostages including women the elderly and wounded a dramatic surge in Aid deliveries the return of civilians to their homes or neighborhoods in all parts of Gaza and it would also initiate negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire the second phase would see the release of all remaining living hostages the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza the implementation of a permanent cessation of hostilities and the Final Phase would launch a massive reconstruction effort in Gaza when I met prime minister Netanyahu uh yesterday in Israel he reaffirmed his support and his commitment to bringing this proposal across the Finish Line the same day yesterday the United Nations security Council adopted a resolution sponsored by the United States in support of The Proposal 14 members voted for it not one country opposed it it's just the latest vote of support the proposals received from around the world from B everyone around this table the Arab League countries throughout the region today as We Gather one and only one thing stands in the way of this deal happening and that's a us so my primary and first message today to every government to every multilateral institution to every humanitarian organization that wants to relieve the massive suffering in Gaza get Hamas to take the deal press them publicly press them privately and Hamas should not require much convincing after all the proposal is nearly identical to one that Hamas itself proposed on May the 6th having said that uh we're gathered today because all of us I believe recognize the imperative of taking bold immediate actions to help civilians in Gaza and to do it now and here are a few thoughts on how we can do that going forward first give more Aid you've heard this already from our colleagues at the UN only onethird of the current United Nations appeal is funded that leaves a shortfall of approximately 2.3 billion every country can help fill this Gap yet some who've expressed great concern over the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza including countries with the capacity to give a lot have provided very little or nothing at all it is time for everyone everyone to step up and for those who have already given and given generously give more the United States has for decades been the largest single country provider of assistance for Palestinians today I'm announcing an additional $44 million in new Aid to Palestinians in addition to the the more than $1.8 billion in development economic and humanitarian Aid that the United States has provided since 2021 second let's work together to ensure that more Aid gets into Gaza and once it's in Gaza reaches the people who need it the most by land by air by sea this has been our intense Focus since the conflict started particularly in recent months Israel has taken some important steps to open more Crossings to address obstacles to the delivery of assistance but it can and must do more as we convey directly to the Israeli government it is crucial to speed up the inspection of trucks and reduce backlogs to provide greater Clarity on and shorten the list of prohibited Goods to increase visas for Aid workers and to process them more quickly to create clearer more effective channels for humanitarian groups to deconflict with IDF operations to Surge life-saving medicine and equipment to provide everything necessary to repair water and sanitation systems and Israel must take further steps to reduce civilian casualties even as it confronts an enemy that started this war with the barbaric Slaughter of civilians on October 7th an enemy that conducts operations from schools from hospitals from camps of displaced families an enemy that s cynically hides behind or underneath the people it purports to represent I think we all know there is no time to waste given the hell that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are enduring every single day 10-year-old Aban lost his parents his brother and other family members they were killed in an air strike that was targeting terrorists he said when my mom and dad were alive I used to sleep now I can't sleep anymore there's an acronym that has become increasingly common for children like Abbot in Gaza WC NSF wounded child no surviving family members 6-year-old FY had cystic fibrosis uh when the conflict began his parents could no longer get the food and medicine that he needed to remain healthy before he was evacuated to the United States from Gaza just last month he was so severely Mal malnourished that his legs could no longer support the weight of his body 11-year-old dunia she lost her parents her brother her sister when their home was struck in conun she said this I lost my leg I lost my family but I still have dreams I want to get a prosthetic leg I want to travel I want to become a doctor I want for this war to end and our children to live in peace these three children Abid fat dunia and all the Palestinian civilians suffering in Gaza we know they're not numbers they're not abstractions they're human beings they're children they're women men who all want the same things that we want for ourselves and for our loved ones just like the people who were murdered in Israel October 7th just like the hostages who continue to be held in Gaza to this day so we all have to recommit to doing our part to ensure that these individuals cannot merely survive but that they can live in peace they can have their rights respected they can have an opportunity to realize their dream dreams and we have to commit to something else we have to commit together to try to extricate the poison in our Common Wealth the poison of dehumanization the inability to see the humanity in the other when that happens when Hearts Harden to the extent that they have on all sides then the worst becomes possible and the best very very difficult to achieve but but if we can see the humanity in everyone and commit to do everything we possibly can to uphold that Humanity then everything's possible so let's do more than just call for a better future for Palestinians and Israelis Let's help build that path to the Future do it together and we can start by maximizing all of the efforts that we're engaged in to help the people who need it and help them now thank you very much thank you Mr secretary if I may call his Excellency Deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister of
