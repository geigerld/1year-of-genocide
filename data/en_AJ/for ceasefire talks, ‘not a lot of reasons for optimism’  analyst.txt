let's go to Gerson Gerson Basin he's a former Israeli negotiator was involved in talks with Hamas he joins us from West Jerusalem thank you for your time Mr Baskin are you hopeful at all about a ceasefire deal at this point particularly now that Hamas are sending a delegation to Cairo I mean a few days ago that seemed like that was a no-go it doesn't seem like a whole lot of reasons for optimism at this point um the Israelis submitted a security plan to the Egyptian and after back and forth with the Egyptians the Egyptians said that they would give it to Hamas but I understand from Egyptian sources that there's a very small chance that the Hamas will agree to the Israeli security plan which is mostly focused on the Philadelphia CA the 14 kilometer Road um border road of Gaza and Egypt this is one of the sticking points one of the many sticking points between Israel and Hamas I really think that uh since there's an urgency to and this war and since it seems quite clear that Mr nany is the reason why we're not able to reach an agreement hamash should probably consider a different strategy than the one they've been using now and that's by putting down on the table an agreement that would appeal to the Israeli public to put pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister because it seems like the negotiators on the Israeli side the military and the intelligence and Israel are in favor of reaching a speedy agreement and yet it's Mr Natan who seems to be holding off and telling people that there is no deal on the table right so if Hamas did put a deal on the table and made it a lot clearer I think we would have a lot more support in Israel in society to push the prime minister right if they were if they were the ones pushing forward uh yeah I mean that's a good point I mean in terms of Israel compromising at all can you see them uh compromising at all when it comes to the issue of the netsim and Philadelphia Corridor in Gaza the Army in the Ence say that we that Israel can Israel can withdraw from Gaza Israel can end the war that the uh issue of the Philadelphia Cora needs to be dealt with on the Egyptian side of the Border perhaps with American oversight to make sure that the border is in fact sealed there needs to be an acceptable A Palestinian control of the Rafa Crossing perhaps with International supervision there was an agreement like that signed back in 2005 and we can go and revisit that agreement and see how that could be made workable and this war has to end there are too many people getting killed the 109 Israeli hostages are getting killed in Gaza and we have a a a need to end this and bring them home and there is a majority in Israel according to the weekend polls who want a deal to be done and they want new elections in Israel and they want a commission of inquiry nany is gaining a little bit in the polls of his base but the majority of Israelis are not with him and do want this war to end what about Egypt I mean how much influence have they uh got over Israel given Israel is currently violating a long-standing peace deal by having its TR troops on the Philadelphia Corridor I think the the most influential party in Israel is obviously the United States and not Egypt or Qatar the Egyptians and the qataris need to use their influence over Hamas while the Americans need to use their influence over Israel and of course they have the Doomsday leverage which is notifying the Israelis that the United States of America will no longer fuel the war in Gaza I believe that the US will tell Israel that we have your back if you're on tax if his BAH tax but we're not going to provide bombs anymore for dropping on Gaza and this would make Israel consider much more seriously the need to end this war quickly which is what has to happen and this is what the United States should do okay thank you for your time gersan Baskin former Israeli negotiator involved in uh talks with Hamas in the past uh speaking to us there from West Jerusalem thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
