US President Joe Biden is to visit Israel on Wednesday in a show of solidarity Secretary of State Anthony blinkin made the announcement after overnight talks with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu lincol said they had agreed on a plan to allow Aid into to civilians in Gaza the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor Nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza and them alone including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of Harm's Way It Is critical that Aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible we share Israel concern that Hamas May seize or destroy Aid entering Gaza or otherwise preventing it from reaching the people who need it if Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself will be the first to condemn it and we will work to prevent it from happening again let's talk now to our correspondent in West Jerusalem Alan fish and Alan what more are we hearing about this Aid plan look at the language Anthony blinkin was very Broad in what he said long talks with the Israeli War cabinet the president and also the Prime Minister and at the end he doesn't have anything concrete he said we would look to find ways to deliver Aid and saying that there is a need for Aid in Gaza but there's no guarantee that that Aid is going to get in and also they were talking about how they would examine ideas for safe zones again nothing concrete so Anthony blinkin has spent a long time with the Israelis he's delivering a visit by Joe Biden which is good politically for Benjamin Netanyahu and also for Israel in general but he hasn't got any deliverables that he can turn around and say yes there's definitely going to be Aid this is when it will be delivered yes there's going to be safe zones this is where they're going to be remember he said that that they were going to open the Raffa Crossing it was bombed again yesterday and there are still thousands of people waiting to get out still hoping that they can get out Al as you said that Joe Biden set to arrive in Israel today Wednesday what's he hoping to achieve well many people speculated that he of course was on his way on Monday when he canceled an event in Colorado uh he was later pitchered speaking to his National Security team the reason they were talking to the National Security team was to talk about whether or not he should actually travel to Israel now he's decided that we will come here on Wednesday but there's political risks because the political wisdom would suggest Joe Biden won't agree to come to Israel if the ground war is underway so therefore they're looking for a possible delay in that and we know that the Israelis are building up towards it the other thing is while he's showing a great deal of support uh for Israel and that will play politically well at home he can't be here if there is body after body pilot ing up in Gaza so he's got to have what they call in diplomatic speak deliverables he's got to be able to say when he comes here yes we will get Aid into Gaza he's got to make the very broad speeches of Anthony blinkin something concrete something different so that there isn't a huge humanitarian crisis because he realizes how that will play worldwide so Israel is of course building up for this ground offensive tell us how America is supporting that militarily well of course they sent in a carrier group into the Mediterranean they're second sending another aircraft carrier in and overnight it was announced that there would be a rapid reaction force also based in the area that's 2,000 Marines and also Sailors who are coming into the area now when you consider that last weekend when they announced that they were sending the carrier group that was meant to act as a deterrent it's clear that that isn't working now Iran has said that if the bombardment of civilians in Gaza it continues then there's the possibility of fighting in other fronts the Americans want to contain this and they're aware of that and that is why they sent the carrier group in the first time but it's almost like a small child don't do that again and then being told don't do that again so they now sent a carrier group another aircraft carrier and now this rapid reaction force they're hoping it's acting as a deterrent it doesn't seem to be having the effect that the Biden Administration would like okay Alan many thanks for that update Alan Fisher reporting from West Jerusalem
