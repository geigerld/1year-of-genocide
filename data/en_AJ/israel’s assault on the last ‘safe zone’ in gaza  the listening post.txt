hellish scenes in the Gaza Strip as Israel's Onslaught continues into the last supposed safe Zone in the South cooking tips from the front lines Israeli soldiers gorge on stolen food as gazin starve patriotic lessons in the classroom and Military activities after school it's what happens when Kremlin propaganda is part of the curriculum for more than 4 months the world has watched as Israeli forces have mowed their way down the length of the Gaza Strip the last major hospital nasar hospital in Kanan Yunis was stormed this past week details of what's taken place there are horrific further south more than a million Palestinians have been crammed into the city of rafah where the threat of an Israeli ground Invasion looms the stated goal is to eliminate hamas's leadership and rescue more hostages but there's also the Spectre of Palestinians being forced over the border into Egypt the fact that this war has reached this point where the almost complete depopulation of Gaza is a real possibility and where even an order from the international court of justice seems unable to prevent it reflects a global failure to hold Israel accountable Western media Outlets which minimize Israel's atrocities and amplify its propaganda exemplify that failure all eyes are on the south of Gaza and Rafa the question is how much longer will the annihilation go on raah at this stage in the war represents the distillation of a concerted strategy on the part of Israel to effectively depopulate the Gaza Strip under the pretense of self-defense and a war against Hames prior to October 7th Gaza was described as an open a prison today I don't know if there's really a description for it besides a very very very densely populated concentration camp and that concentration Camp's name is Rafa in a war of Horrors the images from Southern Gaza have given new potency to the very notion of horror the coring of a desperate population 1.5 million Palestinians in the city of Rafa has the air of an end game the majority of people there are refugees from elsewhere in Gaza they're living in tents any possibility of safety has evaporated there are bombs from the sky a looming ground Invasion and even in supposed non-combat zones there are targeted drone attacks such as the one on two Al jazer journalists in Rafa a wretched situation for gazans has become much more so Israel has killed nearly 30,000 Palestinians thousands more are missing under the rubble more than a million Palestinians are now stuck in ra a so-called safe Zone but Israel is bombing there we have Palestinian Ians who are displaced from their homes they're diseased they're living under tents in the cold without limbs without family members and they're just staying there with nowhere to go you've had these people in Gaza being penned closer and closer into a corner and you can sense that there's an endgame where I mean either the Palestinians will have to be pushed out to the sea or into Egypt right those are really the only two options it seems in the sense is that you are now while putting Palestinians in a Kill Zone the ethnic cleansing being carried out by Israel has been Justified domestically and internationally by an endlessly looping Narrative of a battle for survival against Hamas prime minister Benjamin Neta who showed up on American news channels last week making the case for the invasion of Rafa we've already destroyed 34 of the Hamas organized terrorist battalions 3/4s 18 out of 24 we're not going to leave the other six it's like you leaving a quarter of Isis in Iraq Place netanyahu's talking points were packed with stats about Hamas losses that no one has been able to verify and of course there was the Trope created by Israel since October 7th of Hamas being the same as Isis obviously Isis would reestablish itself Hamas Isis would reestablish itself too a fundamental piece of the war narrative that Netanyahu reiterates virtually every time he gets in front of a camera is of the October 7th operation by Hamas against Israel put yourself in Israel's shoes uh we were attacked unprovoked attack murderous attack on October 7th for many Israelis October 7th is not something that just ended on October 7th every single day almost 24 hours a day the coverage is is all about what happened on that day there's constantly new testimony from from victims from survivors from those now that are coming back from being hostage in Gaza and those stories are constantly being shown to Israelis um and very much it's still part of the discourse it is Israel's quote unquote 911 the worst tragedy that has befallen Israel since the Holocaust and that ju the position of the Holocaust on October 7th it's a strategic decision that marries those two narratives and explains that the only way to avoid a future holoc cost for Israel is this war it doesn't matter how far we've traveled in terms of days uh and weeks and months or even in terms of how much change has happened on the ground the costs of lives to Palestinians nothing equates with the losses of October 7th the laser-like focus from Israeli news outlets on the October 7th attacks has a flip side an almost total Erasure of the suffering their army has inflicted on the people of Gaza the situation in Gaza is largely absent from the coverage altogether that it's just focused right now on the Israeli narrative on what the idef is presenting of what's happening in Gaza and not necessarily about the civilians are being impacted if you do have some sort of coverage about the civilian situation in Gaza it's usually at minute 40 of the first hour of the main news broadcast Western news outlets have a habit of downplaying atrocities committed by Israel's military last week the IDF launched a bombing raid in Rafa which they said secured the release of two Israeli hostages big news also late last night the Israeli military rescuing two hostages from Southern Gaza in a special forces operation this is the hostage rescue dominated the headlines relegated to the the margins was the fact that more than 70 Palestinians were killed in the process the reporting Falls within a pattern that has repeated itself across the Decades of the Israel Palestine conflict and has been glaringly evident during this war it's clear that Western media's coverage has been I have to say lacking and of course you know I say this and and I'm a member of that Matrix of the western media but at the same time if you consider the way this has been done the language that we use right the stories that we amplify Etc I mean the main picture you get of course is is that the suffering of Israelis is more important right more significant there are so many factors that contribute to the bias that we see every day things like using emotive language calling uh the killing of Israelis a slaughter a massacre but the killing of nearly 30,000 Palestinians is not described as such we look at the AP headline where they call children minors there's a deliberate omission of Palestinian in humanity in Western media and it needs to be questioned and these organizations need to be held accountable the culmination and the outcome of this type of sustained coverage that actively humanizes Israelis and actively dehumanizes Palestinians is the fact that it cultivates uh sensitization for Israeli loss and a complete desensitization to Palestinian loss so we can continue to see Palestinians be killed in mass and not bat an eyet because what a Palestinian is good for is to die you know but on the contrary Israeli lives are lives to be rescued the continued arming of a military that does this to Palestinians is Justified on the grounds that it is saving humans from non-humans the United States has been Israel's Chief sponsor and support not just during this war it's a relationship that has spanned decades Israel is the military power it is today thanks to the aid the US has supplied amounting to $300 billion since the country's creation since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October last year President Biden has opened the coffers even wider bypassing Congress to send tens of billions of dollars more in weapons and ammunition with no restrictions on their use those actions speak louder than the statements of concern from Washington as Israeli forces close in on the Palestinians in Rafa the the major military operation Raa should not proceed without a credible plan a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than 1 million people Sheltering there they need to be protected there is a performance of concern for Palestinian lives and at least an implication that there is some dialogue between the Biden Administration and the Netanyahu uh government over the conduct of the war um whether that is true or not in fact nothing has changed on the ground I would argue the B Administration has actually doubled down on trying to help Israel I mean for weapons deliveries that's all being fast-tracked I mean often times it's happening now without Congress so this situation really encapsulates I think the schizophrenic nature of what we see from the US Administration where on the one hand you know we will have these you know occasionally let's say you know probium filled uh statements saying that Israel must do better blah blah blah and then on the other hand you see them really ramping up support and diplomatically they're Shoring it up and if you look at sort of the images that come out of it's the desperation that now seems to be much more than before you know there's a sense that really it's the end then there's nowhere else to go is Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza some Israeli officials have been quite open about it which made a story this week in the harat newspaper about Israeli soldiers feasting in Palestinian homes all the more sickening Nick has more on that story as you say Mina Northern Gaza is facing a famine however the article profiled Israeli soldiers who have made themselves at home in Palestinian households cooking meals with the quote delicious ingredients they find the article reads like a life style column not something written in the middle of a war zone and what it does not say is that those Israeli soldiers are in kitchens belonging to displaced Palestinians and the food they are eating has been looted the article did say that the soldiers had mixed feelings about what they were doing but made peace with it because quote the better we ate the better we fought but again no mention of the latest figures from the world food program which says that many Palestinians are now eating half a meal every two days the taunting of hungry Garin has become habitual in Israel for months soldiers have been posting videos of their meals the kitchens they've pillaged and even the food stores and supplies they've destroyed Israeli businesses have made promotional videos of the food carts they've sent to troops on the front lines Israeli activists and settlers have physically stopped food aid from entering Gaza but the fact that haets a paper that once had a reputation for being left leaning and critical of their occupation is publishing this kind of content shows in the Israeli media there are vanishingly few voices of Reason thanks Nick onto another War the one that began in February 2022 with Russia's invasion of Ukraine since then the Kremlin has invested considerably in managing domestic perceptions of the war including amongst younger citizens digital mainstream and alternative media are used to disseminate partial facts sometimes even outright fiction School textbooks have been Rewritten too ever since he came into power in 1999 Vladimir Putin and his government have invested in indoctrinating the youth reforming School curricula patriotic narratives in the classroom and youth armies all of these have been long-standing elements in moscow's campaign to mold the Next Generation with the war dragging on the government's youth propaganda has escalated educational institutions have become part of an orchestrated effort to shaped loyal militarized nationalists and passive media consumers the listening posts Tark NAFA now on the use of Education in the kremlin's propaganda [Music] machine we see a very typical representation of a Russian School child she's she's white she is ethnically Russian she's dressed in a perfect little dress and perfect little pigtails she is the Putin government's representation of a sort of average Russian little girl so what we see in the video are a number of myths and outright lies and conspiracy theories that explain that the war is really about Western Powers using Ukraine as a as a puppet regime to get Russia March 3rd 2022 one week after Russia's fullscale invasion of Ukraine 13-year-old TV presenter and singer sfia Kenco is giving a lesson called Defenders Of Peace broadcast online by Russia's education Ministry it's an introduction to the kremlin's official narrative on the war aimed at Sophia's peers school children since the start of the war Russia's youth have been a key Target of the state's messaging last September when students returned for the start of the school year they found their history textbooks had been Rewritten and a new class had been added to the syllabus mandatory patriotism called important conversations every Monday first lesson in Russian schools uh is dedicated to conversations about patriotism millions of children in Russia unfortunately are forced to listen to false arguments about politics about patriotism about war about how important it is that Russian soldiers are in Ukraine and how Vladimir Putin is the only solution to all the problems in in Russia the new school history textbook is aimed at students who are about to leave school and students who might go on potentially to join the Army so history for them is a really vital part of educating them as future soldiers and as future regime supporters what we see in the textbook is the Russians as victims surrounded by enemies desperate to undermine Russia and children are taught that they should be suspicious of so-called foreign agents that they should be suspicious of any non-official media because everything outside of the state everything outside of Russia is full of lies and myth truths education is one of the most important vectors to try to spread the information and Russian government understand that this is a prolonged conflict and they are trying to spread their message to the younger people to cement this message across the country the school children are encouraged to only trust the official sources so it is quite an important proportion trying to encourage certain one-sided consumption of news but also it encourages people to just tune out of of the news a more nationalist vision of schooling that sees educ ation as a carrier of patriotic values has been years in the making in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union moscow's oversight over education was tested there was a lack of funding a lack of vision some schools tried to westernized their curriculums others embraced a more Regional approach and began teaching in local languages everything changed When Vladimir Putin took office in 1999 control over public education was gradually centralized a new federal curriculum was introduced and extracurricular nationalist groups were created with the aim of fostering a state centered national identity Putin's government recognized from the very beginning the importance of co-opting the youth so so to speak uh during the 2000s there were the popular youth movements uh Nashi mardia those who proclaimed the support for Putin and then uh during the 2010s uh they were trying to lure younger people into government jobs and trying to present this option of if you're not outspoken against the state you're fine you can have your beautiful life we asked Russia's education Ministry for an interview they never got back to us since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 Russian Society has been transformed fundamentally virtually all independent journalism inside the country has disappeared dissidents have been exiled anti-war protests outlawed which leaves Russia's youth with nobody to look up to but voices endorsed by the Kremlin they are being told to conform starting in the classroom who is and who should be their Heroes um are of course the representativ of the system are of course the representatives of the state the government for example Thea kandelaki she is a diva style anchor on a TV program for the kids she is talented she is bright and she is absolutely Pro Kremlin media literacy means understanding that the states media and the states reality is the only media and the only reality that can be trusted that children are told that figures like Alex noal yarina Schulman other opposition leaders mik kovski for example are working with the CIA with America seeking to undermine Russia and what children learn therefore is that their job is to repeat what they hear instilling young people with a sense of loyalty and dedication to the state is not just an ideological exercise Russia is a country reliant on new conscripts and undisclosed number of young soldiers have been killed in Ukraine the Kremlin wants to increase its combat Personnel by 30% a more malleable militarized generation of Russians will help with thata what across the country the state has introduced War museums and memorials in schools there are currently 22,000 of them in operation it's part of a Putin directive to open museums in every region of Russia they are places of commemoration but of a distorted history where young Russians are told that true patriotism comes with self-sacrifice one of the more disturbing trends that we might see in Russian schools is plaques being erected to graduates of high schools who have died in the so-called special military operation hailed as models of the best kind of Russian you can possibly be so what we see with the museums that are being erected is that these are places of pilgrimage where Russians pay tribute to the sacrifices of the past and the sacrifices of the present and in particular the supposed Utopia that's going to come from a future victory in the war against Ukraine and against the West these museums are having just one main goal they're trying to teach children that this war in Ukraine right now is something similar to the Second World War uh the Great Patriotic War the problem is that in the Great Patriotic War Soviet Union was saving the world from fascism and right now Russia is on the opposite side that's why they're having such a big campaign because it's really hard to explain what the hell is going on and why Russia is killing ukrainians and why Russian soldiers are dying in closing a postcript to our lead report on the situation in the south of Gaza there was a lot we could not include in that story images of Israel killings of civilians that are too graphic they serve as records of a war that has shattered multiple laws of combat and human rights all of them need serious trigger warnings before we put them on the air and yet what we showed in our report and what this network broadcasts from Gaza on a daily basis is significantly more than what makes it onto many other outlets we're approaching 5 months of this war and while we will keep an eye on stories around the world our Focus will remain on Gaza as the campaign to displace and ethnically cleansed Palestinians reaches its most dangerous phase this is not the time for journalists to turn away we'll see you next time here are the listening
