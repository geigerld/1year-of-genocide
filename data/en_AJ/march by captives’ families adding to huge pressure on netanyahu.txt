well at least three people have been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon the strike we understand targeted a vehicle traveling on a coastal Road in the Border Town of nura well let's speak to vill Marks he joins us with more from occupied East Jerusalem villm still no more comments from the Israelis on on what happened in nura no just in the last few minutes nasia they have responded they are looking into this incident that took place very very close to the Israeli border four or 5 km just north of that border nura small small town on the coast there is the kind of essentially the last settlement in that part of Southern Lebanon on the coast a road then travels East from there all the way into the interior more or less skirting that border we've seen these kinds of incidents in the past the Israelis typically have not commented on these kinds of strikes on moving Vehicles what we do know though is that Hezbollah yesterday claimed six separate attacks on Israeli for forces and separately one attack on an Israeli drone and V you're in occupied East Jerusalem I understand there is some kind of a a March being organized by the families of of captives being held in Gaza obviously we've seen mounting pressure on the Israeli government to to change their their stance or or do something more over the last few weeks and months this has been a central issue throughout this conflict particularly domestically in Israel it's an increasingly vocal and politically influential movement led by the families of those believe to be held captive inside Gaza they're going to be uh meeting around 20 km north northwest of the city of Jerusalem around 1:00 today Gathering and then marching into the city for a rally this evening and as you say this is something that is placing a huge amount of pressure on Benjamin netanyahu's government it's something that he has said regardless of whether there's a ceasefire or not he wants to to bring those captives home but in terms of those conversations around the ceasefire those negotiations involving Egypt Qatar and the US between Hamas and Israel it's a very thorny question as to how many of those individuals are still alive inside Gaza Netanyahu just a couple of days ago saying he would not want to move forward with these peace talks until they have more information they have the names of those that are still verifiably alive nstasia vill marks there with the latest for us from occupied East Jerusalem we'll keep an eye on on that March for you as well thanks so much f
