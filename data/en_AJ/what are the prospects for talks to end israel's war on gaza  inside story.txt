while Israel continues its Relentless war on Gaza Palestinians pin the hopes on talks which have paused in Doha before resuming in Cairo on Thursday Israel and Hamas are studying proposals from mediators Qatar Egypt and the us but what are the chances of Peace this time this is Inside Story hello welcome to the program I am Hashim AAL a pausing talks for a ceasefire in Gaza but no pausing attacks from Israel 18 people from one family among the latest victims killed by air strike the war has now killed 40,000 Palestinians with many others dead under oh hopes for a ceasefire rest on Talks brokered by Qatar Egypt and the US Israel's biggest donor and weapon supplier after Israel began its war in October it took five months during which 32,000 Palestinians were killed before the US and EU finally called for a ceasefire at the end of March since then Israel has ignored a un Security Council vote but International pressure to end this war is intensifying the horrors for gaza's people continue daily while the nightmare of Israelis whose loved ones are held captive in Gaza goes on too so what could make or break these talks is there a real Prospect of Peace this time we put there to Our Guest shortly first OMS sh has this report in the 10 months since the Israeli military launched its war on Gaza it killed more than 40,000 Palestinians wiping out % of the strip's population and flattening most of its homes and buildings for those who are surviving it's a battle against hunger disease and for basic human dignity the plight of the Palestinians has led to Global calls for a ceasefire but for months now International mediators have not been able to agree on one now US president Joe Biden says an agreement is closer than ever after the latest round of talks in K's Capital Doha further discussions to end the war will be held in Cairo next week I'm optimistic not far from over just a couple more ises I think we got a shot are you more optimistic now than you have been in months past yes why I told you that I give away what's going on when would the ceasefire begin if you can get a deal That Remains the Same the US Egypt andq say the latest proposal Bridges remaining gaps between Hamas and Israel mediators have been seeking to finalize details of a framework initially outlined by President Biden in May which he said Israel had proposed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on mediators to pressure Hamas to accept the plan Hamas has rejected what it called new conditions from Israel in the latest draft dozens of rounds of indirect talks between Hamas and Israel have failed to reach a deal Netanyahu has said that uh he has no plans to end the war anytime soon um and that as soon as the hostages are released he'll go back to fighting and that Hamas uh wants a permanent end to the hostilities uh and an end to the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip so that is a very fundamental thing that has not been bridged at all and we don't know how um that is going to be overcome in this new deal on the ground Israeli strikes have continued in Gaza killing more Palestinians on Friday the Israeli military issued orders to forcibly displace people in Central and Southern areas previously designated as so-called safe zones Israel's war on Gaza is also fueling instability with fears of a wider Regional War mulsum Sharif Al jazer for Inside Story let's take a closer look at the SE fire proposal that's been discussed the first phase would be a temporary truce during which Hamas would release women the elderly and wounded captives in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons the second phase would include a permanent end to the hostilities and the release of all remaining Israeli captives and the third phase would be the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased captives to Israel let's bring in our guests in Tel Aviv we have Alan pinkas former Israeli Ambassador and previous government advisor in Boston Rami huri distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut and in Washington DC Nile stanage White House colonist for the publication of the Hill welcome to the program Alan do you genuinely believe believe that a breakthrough is still possible in the Talks brokered by the Americans the Egyptians and the qataris uh no Hashem unfortunately I don't um I am not optimistic at all I look at the fundamentals of the deal this is a deal that could have been done six months ago or four months ago or two months ago or two weeks ago and it still hasn't happened and it hasn't happened for a reason it did not happen because Israel doesn't want the deal and it appears that Hamas is not interested in the deal in fact the one thing that Hamas and Israel have in common right now is that they don't want the deal now let me add one more thing um in in the graphics that you uh displayed a moment ago Hasen describing the deal uh there are two things that are missing in the first phase there's also a 42 day six week um ceas fire that's Mr netanyahu's problem with it now the second thing leads to me being uh pessimistic about this is that in that plan this is this has nothing to do with your graphics this has to do with Biden uh President Biden presenting the plan which parenthetically was an Israeli plan um there is absolutely no mention to post war Gaza political governance postwar so-called the day after uh Power vacuum uh in Gaza so that leads me to uh um very very little optimism if at all all right Ramy let's break down the the the the the very structure of the of the of the deal itself so it was the based on the same idea that was presented by President Biden in May Hamas came in July the 2nd and said they they go ahead with the with with with the with the agreement which is based on three phases phase one six weeks phase two six weeks phase two three six weeks except that Hamas came out yesterday and said we don't believe there's going to be a deal because the Israelis are not genuine about deal number two they say if there is no permanent ceasefire complete withdrawal of Israeli soldiers complete exchange of prisoners and the right of people to return back to their homes in the north we're not going to commit ourselves to any agreement is this something that could undermine any chances for a potential agreement there's very little chance of a real permanent comprehensive agreement because I think fundamentally what the Americans and the Israelis call an agreement is very different from what the Palestinians and most of the rest of the world calls an agreement the Israelis and Americans basically want to perpetuate direct or indirect Israeli control over all of Palestine security control economic uh issues and things like that demographic issues uh so it's very difficult to talk about this agreeing you might have short-term agreements about a cessation of fire exchange of prisoners and uh hostages that is likely to to happen uh and the Israelis getting out of most of Gaza the Israelis want to stay in part of Gaza and the Palestinians saying no you have to get out all the way it's fascinating we hear Less Talk these days of the Israelis saying well after the fighting ends and we move out we need to maintain our ability to control what goes on and who governs Gaza and security issues uh that's probably being discussed as well but it's being pushed down the road so the chances of a real breakthrough are pretty slim but the fact that they're still trying is significant n the fact that they still uh trying to continue the talks they will meet in Egypt could this be an indication that they are willing to overcome some of the sticking points particularly when the Israelis are saying that we need to have some sort of control over the Philadelphia Corridor but at the same time would like to maintain checkpoints in narim uh the narim junction particular to ensure that those who will be able to return back to their homes in the North have to be screened for the potential of carrying weapons to the north it could but that doesn't necessarily mean it will be that I think as your previous guests have indicated the really big overarching question here is are these negotiations taking place in good faith in the hope of reaching a deal or are they really a shell game that is intended just to buy time and that won't change anything in a fundamental sense so issues like the Corridor for example yes maybe there is movement on that if you assume that both sides are interested in a peace deal I personally think yes there'll be eventually there has the fighting has to stop somehow but I am not persuaded that Mr Netanyahu in particular is interested in a peace deal right now for various reasons including his own relative lack of popularity in Israel the likelihood that there would be inquiries into the security failure of of October the 7th and the fact that he himself is H has engaged in this rhetoric of total Victory I notice he's been criticized by the Israeli defense minister yov Galant for that because total Victory is one of those terms that can be expanded endlessly if you want to uh create a rationale to continue a war so I think those are the kind of factors that undercut any belief that this is really a good faith negotiation Alan if a deal takes place is it good news for Netanyahu could it be his opportunities to somehow outmaneuver the far right come back to his people and say listen I've killed Han I've killed uh shuker who's the top military commander ofah and I have the deal and I have the captives back home could it be a good news for him no hypothetically yes but practic practically I'm sorry for the reasons that Niles just uh enumerated uh it's going to be bad news because Mr netan is going to face not just uh demonstrations and protest in Israel he's also facing a criminal trial his Coalition is fragile he is seen as responsible and the main culprit for the the bacle of October 7th in the Hamas terror attack um in consistent polls 7070 70% want him to resign um over 70% see him directly responsible therefore he needs to be held accountable something by the way which he hasn't done until now now the war the prolonging the extend the extending of the war extension rather of the war enables him to distance himself from October 7 and and feeds into his um wild U alternative narrative According to which this wasn't just a Hamas terror attack this is a civilizational war it's a multi front War Iran is at the uh uh Center of of this uh Coalition that's fighting against Israel on the other hand the world is trying to superimpose a Palestinian state which is nonsense no one can impose anything on anyone certainly not at this stage and so for him he needs the war to go on and you know hypothetically I take the premise here I take the premise of your question or remark rather ham uh U hypothetically this is exactly what he should do he should say I was let down by the military I I I did what I needed to do I stood up to world uh pressures I even stood up to the American president I killed whoever needed to be killed in is hania and so on um we have exhausted the usefulness of any military operation in in Gaza now let's stop and do some uh um recalibration but that would assum a level of rationality of a decision maker that Mr n just does not have Ramy the deal is yet to be Inked if ever it gets a chance to be ined in the future in the meantime if Iran and hisbah decide to retaliate against the killing of fad shukar and is Hanah would that change the Dynamics perhaps uh but that again a limited short-term issue I think the problem with all of these discussions about peace agreements and ceasefires and the day after is that they tend to zero in on today tomorrow and yesterday they don't look at the bigger issue um alone gave a series of very good reasons why he's pessimistic but I think there's a deeper reason that the world has to come to grips with and Israel in particular and the Jewish people have to come to groups with which is the nature of Zionism and this is really a big sticker item it's not going to be resolved in a peace process because as all of this stuff is happening with Iran and hisbah and Hamas and Gaza you have the settlers in the West Bank burning Villages and and burning people in their cars and this government of Israel and the Army is protecting them so you still have the late 19th century Zionist settler Colonial uh process continuing physically taking over homes and in Jerusalem and and and the West Bank and other places and trying to drive out the Palestinians and in Gaza and in the West Bank unless Zionism is defined and contained in a way that satisfies the Israeli desire for their own Jewish state which is a reasonable desire but it's not reasonable if they put the state on my land and the Palestinian land that's forcibly taken from us so that has to really that's the big a big long-term issue uh in the short term of course Iran andah and before that Saddam Hussein these were all issues that came up but they tend to hide the bigger challenge that all of us face n President Biden said that we closer than we've ever been uh as far as the deal is concerned what kind of Leverage The Americans still have when it comes to bring narrowing the differences between Hamas and Israel well they have enormous leverage but the question is will they use it I mean you mentioned in your introduction about the degree to which the United States has underwritten Israel's effort both politically and diplomatically and militarily we just recently had the announcement of approximately another $2 billion in armed sales to Israel so there is leverage there but whether it will be used is the bigger question we are just a couple of days away here in the US from the opening of the Democratic National Convention which is expected to attract thousands of pro Palestinian demonstrators objecting to uh President Biden and by extension by vice president Harris's commitment which they have described as Ironclad to Israel President Biden has paused only one armed shipment throughout the past 10 months now that's a whole other conversation in one way there's some suggestion that vice president Harris has been at least rhetorically a little more sympathetic to the suffering of the Palestinians and has said that she will not be silent about it but to get back to your question the United States has leverage it has less willingness to it it seems to me Alan there are many many questions that need to be answered uh particularly the one about what's next which you've talked about earlier in your first answer what's next for Gaza we know that the Americans the israelies the EU and many countries in the Gulf region are looking forward to new architecture in the region without Hamas in Gaza do you see this as something that could potentially happen in the near future if Hamas continues as a strong military faction no well Hamas is not a strong military faction right now but what it does have is residual political power um amongst other reasons because Israel rejected and is reluctant to entertain any ideas about a post-war Gaza uh um and and about the Palestinian Authority extending governance to Gaza which by the way is the exact reason why Mr netan worked so hard to strengthen Hamas um and if you look at it from a um you know from a broader perspective uh Hamas may be the Palestinians tragedy but Netanyahu is equally Israel's tragedy and the combination of those two and the combination of those two um does not lend a lot of credits to any ideas of a uh of a settlement now there is one thing though that you know it it sort of came up uh uh throughout this conversation between the four of us you know there's one thing I look at this after Decades of being involved in these talks and observing them from the outside you reach the following conclusion the one thing that the Palestinians and Israelis have in common is that they um repeatedly um agree to blame America it's always America's fault the president wasn't involved enough the president was too involved the Secretary of State didn't come here often enough he came here too frequently there comes a point where it is it really is our problem it's us and the Palestinians um and and this this needs to be resolved without pointing fingers at a certain president or a certain Secretary of State and I'm talking about the last 40 years not about the last 10 months I me could it be that because Hamas understands very well that any future for Gaza where they won't have a say means that if they decide to put their signature on this agreement for the ceasefire it would be the biggest mistake they are ever to commit in that since they were established and this explains why they are very skeptical about this whole talks I wouldn't go that far you know there's too much emphasis on Hamas itself you don't want to destroy it you want to keep it out of any future government you want to do this you want to do that you know before hamash became powerful there was fat there was the PLO as a whole um there were other movements and they come and go it's important to understand hamas's relevance is not the arms it has or its position today or who leads it its importance and its power and its legitimacy come from the fact that it reflects widely in its political aims not necessarily its means but its political aims the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of Palestinians and Arabs in terms of Palestinian national rights and the overwhelming majority of global public opinion in terms of implementing International laws and legitimacy and un resolutions related to Israel and Palestine that's why it's powerful and and and it does what uh it does they don't particularly they didn't want to run Gaza they could have run Gaza years ago they didn't want to they ran an election they won in 2006 uh and then the US and Israel boycotted them and they eventually had to take over uh so I would I would look at the bigger picture why is Hamas still there because it reflects widespread Palestinian national goals those National goals include repeated offers to Israel to coexist uh in peace um in a mechanism that gives the Israelis their National rights and the Palestinians their National rights the Israelis and Americans have consistently refused to respond to at least a dozen uh overtures from Hamas the Palestinian national movement to do this um and so this is why I got back to the issue we've got to this what is what is Israel what is Zionism what are its legal borders its physical borders and its demographic uh borders and this is why most people today are so skeptical of the Israeli and the American uh positions and so it's a very it's a big problem but it has resolutions if courageous enough to get to the course NY when you look at the phase three which talks about a phase of perhaps 6 weeks that would then Usher in a new era that could continue for like from three to five years with the Reconstruction of Gaza but here is here is a problem with this particular phase and here is where we don't have any sense of clarity who takes over Gaza who's going to police Gaza are we going to have a Palestinian Authority rejuvenated reinvigorated to take over is going to be Saudis having much bigger say and the ities than ever before unless you get a sense of clarity how can you put together an agreement that could just collapse in six seven months from now well yes I I agree with that I think that is a completely valid question the other thing is how would a uh authority of whatever kind imposed by or with the acquiescence of Israel have any moral legitimacy with the people of Gaza who have been killed in very large number have had enormous suffering visited upon them it seems to me that almost any Authority that was uh imposed in that way would struggle mly the other point is just briefly if I may before we get to phase three we have to get through phase two where President Biden has said there could be a permanent cessation of hostilities so long and these are his words as Hamas lives up to its responsibilities the direct implication there is there could be a permanent ation while hamamass is in existence I no evidence that Mr Netanyahu accepts that at all he continues to to talk about the elimination ofas as we're near the end of the program I appreciate you can give me some short answers let me start with Alan Alan if there's no agreement War continues what would be the reaction of the public in Israel is it fair to say that because the majority of Israelis support the war therefore there's absolutely no problem for them as far as the war continuing for as long as it takes no not no no no not at all they they support the war and they justify the war in response to what had happened um on October 7th in the Savage Hamas um attack that doesn't mean they like what they're seeing that doesn't mean they understand why it's taking 10 months they that does not mean that they see any tangible achievements um now per your questions and you asked me to be brief about this um if the war goes on there is a good chance or good likelihood that it would escalate I mean there there seems to be a case of connecting vessels here between Lebanon and and Gaza uh the Americans know this that explains some of their involvement the the idea to that the Paramount interest not idea the Paramount interest of preventing escalation now if there is no deal and the Americans are um convinced that it was Mr netan who undermined it who uh uh made sure it would happen who derail a last minute opportunity I think that un unlike uh um what they have done in the last 10 months uh they will stand up and rebuke him harshly if that happens you will see Mass demonstrations in itel but you will also see um major opposition coming from the uh Security Branch of the intelligence branches the security branches and the military itself so uh this is very bad Mr There's No Deal uh arami are we closer than ever to a wider military confrontation in this part of world um we've had wider confrontations in this region over the years and uh they come and go but the fear now is that this if there is a regional war with Iran and hisbah and the US and others that this would be bigger scale causing much more damage than ever partly because of the nature of the Weaponry that's uh available but mainly because there's a whole new reality of geostrategic balance the Israel is not fighting the army of Syria and Egypt and Jordan as it used to do before it's fighting this new uh constellation of mostly Shiite some Sunni Arab forces mostly some Iranians uh that have created this tremendous new powerful force uh the so-called axis of resistance and Israel knows the capabilities of these groups and the US and Israel together have and and and the UK have been trying to stop thear the huis and Yemen from ship attacking ships and and they can't stop them they keep doing it so that's the big big question if how do you how do you uh neutralize that fear and the only is to have a ceasefire and a peace agreement very briefly n if you mind how how do you see Gaza playing out in the US elections it splits the Democratic party I was going to say say up the middle in fact the majority of the democratic base is now sympathetic to the Palestinians that is not reflected in Democratic elected officials and the danger is that that could sap H Democratic enthusiasm and turnout particularly in some key States like Michigan which has a very high Arab American population gentlemen I really appreciate your Insight Al Stanish thank you very much indeed looking forward to talking to you in the near future and thank you too for watching
