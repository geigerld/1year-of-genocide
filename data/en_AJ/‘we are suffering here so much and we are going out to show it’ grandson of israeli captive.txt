well the Israeli military says it's recovered the bodies of six captives from a tunnel under Rafa in southern Gaza Hamas says they were killed in an Israeli strike but Israel says they were found with bullet wounds to the head and other parts of the body one of the Dead captives has been identified as HH Goldberg Poland is an Israeli American his family confirmed the 23-year-old's death in a statement they've been among the most high-profile Israelis lobbying the government to bring home the captives they've addressed last month's Democratic National convention and the United Nations here's what hmer said in a statement the one who kills our people daily is the occupation with American weapons and the bodies of prisoners found in Gaza were only killed by Zionist bombing President Joe Biden must stop supporting this enemy with money and weapons and pressure the occupation to end its aggression immediately I'll just he as hamut has reported from Israel now Al jazer has been banned by Israel's government and Ham's joining his in our studio here in Doha good to have you with us H just talk us through what's been happening with regard to the the discovery of these captives first of all well there have been several protesters that have taken to the streets you're looking at thousands of Israelis that are demonstrating against Netanyahu but let's talk about what Netanyahu said in his statement before we get into the demonstrations he said that Hamas is the one who killed the captives meaning that they're not interested in a deal but if you look at what the Israeli public has been saying it's that Netanyahu himself is not interested neither willing or capable to enter into a deal saying that he is prolonging the war for personal and political gain you have members of the opposition who are calling for change you have also the country's defense minister yoav Galant who has sparred with Netanyahu in highlevel security cabinet meetings saying that perhaps Netanyahu should not have such a stance about the red lines that he has that maybe he should lessen his stance so that there can be a deal that is achieved But ultimately no matter the pressure that is facing Netanyahu he seems to be unfazed and has maintained that military pressure is the only way to bring about the release of those captives and I just want to add that some of the captives whose bodies were discovered were actually supposed to be on the list of captives to be released in the first phase of any sort of deal and according to Israeli Army intelligence they were alive just a couple of days ago so there is huge anger throughout Israeli iety because of this am to stay with me because I want to talk to you about this public response and pressure is growing on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as ham was just saying to agree a ceasefire deal leading to the release of the remaining captives relatives of those held in Gaza have joined other protesters at a rally outside Benjamin netanyahu's office in West Jerusalem they're demanding a deal to free the remaining 97 Israelis believe to be in Gaza around a third of them are presumed dead we are very very sad and very very angry about our government that all they does is care about their position in the government it doesn't care about the hostages and doesn't do anything in order to release them the deal should have been signed long time ago and these people for sure like many others could have been saved uh it's an unimaginable H feelings and they they were so close and some of them were supposed to be out in the first part of the deal H so we are really really heartbroken it's a very sad morning it's supposed to be a happy morning when all the little kids go to school but it turned out to be one of the most devastating days in the last 11 months well a general strike's been called from Monday to protest against the Israeli government opposition leader y laed has called for government shutdowns the strike on Monday is also expected to impact Israel's main airport in Tel let's go back to hamut who's with us in the studio so there seems to be even more pressure now we're seeing trade unions getting involved in this and supporting the call for a ceasefire the call for the captives to be returned how much support is there amongst members of the Israeli public well there is huge support for the labor union and there's huge support for the protest movement so let's talk about this labor strike that is going to take place on Monday starting at around 800 a.m. this labor union the hist is the largest in Israel it is is responsible for most of the Trade Federation and most of the economics so they are incredibly organized and they have the power to really do damage to Israel's economy with this shutdown the greatest and most high-profile of those shutdowns is going to be at Ben Goron airport which is the main hub for travel in Israel so that's going to start at 8:00 a.m. a spokesperson for the union said that a list of all other organizations and businesses will be released later today but you also have is's opposition who was supporting this who was saying that people should be taking to the streets against Israel's government the head of the labor union himself the chief is going to be at these protests and is encouraging people at the the day of the strike to go demonstrate in the streets saying that he's going to join them saying that a deal must supersede everything else the last time we saw a strike like this from the labor union was around a year and a half ago when the country was protesting against judicial reforms and it actually made an impact it did have an impact because it shut down Israel's economy and that sent a message to Israel's government to do things differently with their proposed bills and they're hoping that this time the message that the labor union can send can be to push the government in the direction of a deala thank you very much indeed hamud with us in Doha well Daniel liit is the grandson of retired Israeli journalist Aid liit who was taken captive during the October 7th attack he's joining us live now from Tel Aviv thank you very much indeed for being with us on Al jazer ham was just explained to us the level of pressure that is growing within Israel to find a ceasefire deal find a way of getting the captives home and of course she mentioned that the last time that there was such a significant protest it started to affect the economy and that had a knock on effect with the government is there any confidence that you might have that the degree of protest that you're seeing now might actually finally bring some action from the Netanyahu Coalition so uh first of all uh speaking about what happened yesterday is really devastated it's devastating that uh first of all an American citizen who've been hurt and injured by a Grenade on October 7 H Goldberg and after that somehow succeeded to survive more than 300 days been murdered in captivity and shot together with two other women I think that is a a horrible situation and a war crime and we are going out because we had more than about 12 hostages that died in the last uh months and came back that been alive there and uh for us it's our right and we have to go out to the streets to make the pressure on our government but without the world pressure we will not succeed we H we must have the pressure of the President Biden we must have the pressure of the katari Prime Minister and she Muhammad Alani aisi Kamal abas everyone to make make the pressure of all sides it's not only one side to take a deal and uh we really need that and with our pressure the internal pressure which we are the citizens of Israel and we will do everything to bring back our hostages we need the help from the world to do the same pressure over Hamas because murdering and executing hostages there is nothing that is connected to any um religion any society any culture and it's really against the Quran and betraying it I we should point out of course that hamas's position with regard to these captives is that they were killed as a result of Israeli bombing until the bodies are actually it has been proven that they've been shot we got the IDF final uh resolution about it and those been murdered I don't know why there but that's the situation for me personally I'm very worried because I have a great grandfather there he's my grand father and the great-grandfather of my daughter the only hostage which is a great-grandfather in the world we cannot expect old men in captivity Hamas said things went out of control on October 7th but if things went out of control you have to return those hostages the old men are something so holy for the Quran and for everyone and not bringing them back releasing them unconditionally is it's a scene and I'm so worried about my grandfather is almost a ear there and he's someone who did all his life everything for coexistence and for peace I feel like the peace is held in a in a tunnel in Gaza and it's devastating for me Carmel Gat was as well with me in school and uh I can't imagine that she died she could be here it's such a devastating moment for everyone in the world which uh are talking about Humanity critics of Benjamin Netanyahu and the Coalition of course including members of the US government in the past have said that Benjamin nanyu himself has been one of the stumbling blocks to finding a solution to this this war um is there any indication that you have had given the fact that you've had interaction with us officials as well as Israeli officials that that position that is being held by the Netanyahu Coalition may change as the pressure grows I believe that uh it can change I believe that after what happened yesterday only from the uh suffer we are suffering here so much and we are going out to show it we are not protesting against we are protesting for the release of the hostages to make a deal because finally this deal will bring back our beloved one will end the suffer of the gazin who should go out as well and protest against Hamas because because if Hamas will release all the hostages it will end tomorrow and as well we want to go back to our homes we are displaced as well my mom she's displaced all my community is completely burned all the houses are impossible to live in I'm coming from kibuts n Ro Place who did everything for coexistence and believed in peace and all this place we still have now 29 hostages only from the community of near o from the bibas family the kuna family and to all the families in IR Ro which we just can't continue and we cannot even fight anymore after the horror happened in N Ro I was very lucky that my mom and my daughter left n Ro on Friday October 6th at 700 p.m. but that's not the story of my community it's a community who believed in peace that Hamas ruined on October 7 to ashes Daniel lifes we
