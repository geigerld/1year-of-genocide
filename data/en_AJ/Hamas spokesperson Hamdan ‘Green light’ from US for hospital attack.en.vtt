Israel<00:11:40.000><c> is</c><00:11:40.120><c> doing</c><00:11:40.480><c> in</c><00:11:40.760><c> in</c><00:11:40.959><c> in</c><00:11:41.480><c> Gaza</c><00:11:42.480><c> and</c><00:11:42.839><c> so</c>

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
Israel is doing in in in Gaza and so
 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
Israel is doing in in in Gaza and so
Israelis<00:11:43.760><c> have</c><00:11:43.959><c> been</c><00:11:44.720><c> very</c><00:11:45.079><c> much</c><00:11:45.560><c> building</c><00:11:46.000><c> up</c>

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
Israelis have been very much building up
 

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
Israelis have been very much building up
on<00:11:46.639><c> the</c><00:11:46.839><c> civilians</c><00:11:47.399><c> that</c><00:11:47.519><c> are</c><00:11:47.639><c> now</c><00:11:47.920><c> captive</c><00:11:48.880><c> uh</c>

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the civilians that are now captive uh
 

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.710 align:start position:0%
on the civilians that are now captive uh
in<00:11:49.360><c> Gaza</c><00:11:49.800><c> and</c><00:11:50.000><c> if</c><00:11:50.200><c> Hamas</c><00:11:50.839><c> releases</c><00:11:51.440><c> that</c>

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
in Gaza and if Hamas releases that
 

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.949 align:start position:0%
in Gaza and if Hamas releases that
probably<00:11:52.200><c> that</c><00:11:52.320><c> is</c><00:11:52.480><c> also</c><00:11:53.200><c> going</c><00:11:53.360><c> to</c><00:11:53.600><c> give</c>

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
probably that is also going to give
 

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
probably that is also going to give
another<00:11:54.680><c> momentum</c><00:11:55.680><c> to</c><00:11:56.040><c> to</c><00:11:56.279><c> to</c><00:11:56.480><c> to</c><00:11:56.720><c> to</c><00:11:57.000><c> to</c><00:11:57.279><c> to</c>

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
another momentum to to to to to to to
 

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.949 align:start position:0%
another momentum to to to to to to to
the<00:11:58.240><c> people</c><00:11:58.600><c> who</c><00:11:58.760><c> are</c><00:11:59.040><c> not</c><00:11:59.279><c> protesting</c>

00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
the people who are not protesting
 

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:02.430 align:start position:0%
the people who are not protesting
against<00:12:00.600><c> Israel</c><00:12:01.079><c> so</c><00:12:01.279><c> in</c><00:12:01.480><c> that</c><00:12:01.680><c> sense</c><00:12:02.000><c> probably</c>

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
against Israel so in that sense probably
 

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.389 align:start position:0%
against Israel so in that sense probably
this<00:12:03.040><c> moral</c><00:12:03.519><c> ground</c><00:12:04.320><c> is</c><00:12:04.920><c> shifting</c><00:12:05.720><c> from</c><00:12:06.040><c> one</c>

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
this moral ground is shifting from one
 

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
this moral ground is shifting from one
side<00:12:06.920><c> to</c><00:12:07.440><c> another</c><00:12:08.360><c> and</c><00:12:08.560><c> if</c><00:12:08.760><c> that</c><00:12:09.000><c> happens</c><00:12:09.360><c> so</c>

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
side to another and if that happens so
 

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.069 align:start position:0%
side to another and if that happens so
Hamas<00:12:10.200><c> probably</c><00:12:10.519><c> will</c><00:12:10.839><c> have</c><00:12:11.320><c> the</c><00:12:11.519><c> opportunity</c>

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
Hamas probably will have the opportunity
 

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
Hamas probably will have the opportunity
of<00:12:12.200><c> saying</c><00:12:12.600><c> that</c><00:12:12.880><c> this</c><00:12:13.519><c> is</c><00:12:13.959><c> happening</c><00:12:14.760><c> just</c>

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
of saying that this is happening just
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.150 align:start position:0%

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.030 align:start position:0%

they're not targeting the is Israeli
 

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.110 align:start position:0%
they're not targeting the is Israeli
civilians<00:12:20.639><c> this</c><00:12:20.760><c> is</c><00:12:21.360><c> an</c><00:12:21.519><c> argument</c><00:12:21.959><c> that</c>

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
civilians this is an argument that
 

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.269 align:start position:0%
civilians this is an argument that
Israel<00:12:22.519><c> have</c><00:12:22.680><c> been</c><00:12:23.360><c> has</c><00:12:23.519><c> been</c><00:12:23.920><c> building</c><00:12:24.519><c> up</c><00:12:24.880><c> on</c>

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
Israel have been has been building up on
 

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.910 align:start position:0%
Israel have been has been building up on

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
so in that sense simply just
 

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
so in that sense simply just
militarizing<00:12:27.839><c> the</c><00:12:28.160><c> issue</c><00:12:28.480><c> and</c><00:12:28.639><c> is</c><00:12:29.360><c> losing</c><00:12:29.760><c> the</c>
