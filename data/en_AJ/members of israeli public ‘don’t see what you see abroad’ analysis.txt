[Music] thank you for joining us at 13 GMT and there is mounting International condemnation of Israel following its air strike in central Gaza which killed 18 people including six employees of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unra says it's the highest death toll of its staff in a single incident the eu's foreign policy Chief Joseph Bell condemned Wednesday's attack in Al nerat refugee camp and said in a statement he was outraged by the killing of six unra stafas after Israeli strikes hit for the fifth time a school in nerat Sheltering 12,000 displaced people the disregard of the basic principles of international humanitarian law especially protection of civilians cannot and should not be accepted by the International Community the German foreign Ministry also condemned the deaths of the UN staff saying humanitarian Aid workers must never be victims of rockets the death of six unra staff at a school in nerat is totally unacceptable Rose who's the senior deputy director of unra Affairs in Gaza he is in car Unis and says unra employees are devastated and feel nowhere in Gaza is safe this is one of the most difficult days that that we faced in unra in Gaza during the most difficult conflicts that we've we've ever faced staff in the offices are in Shock that they're grieving they're despairing and the colleagues on the ground who who I've talk to in the shelter providing first line response are just are just devastated yet another attack on a protected un facility the fifth time as he said at the at the start of the the the clip that that that this school itself has been attacked so it it's devastating it's horrific it's all these superlatives and just the scale and the rapidity of the incidents they just too difficult for us to get our heads around sometimes these were local humanitarian workers who were helping their fellow Palestinians today Gaza really is a dangerous place uh to work for for humanitarian workers no one seems to be safe is there a point Sam where where it will be impossible to do your work on the ground I mean we're certainly running out of options the highest number of un workers and humanitarians slain in in any conflict the vast majority of them unra workers we're facing increasing difficulties getting our supplies into Gaza we had a terrible terrible incident at one of the checkpoints uh trying to go north a couple of of of nights ago to to lead on the administration of of the polio campaign so yeah we're running out of options the space in which we're able to operate let's now speak to Alan leel who's the former director General of Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs he was also uh Israeli ambassador to South Africa joining us from Tel Aviv uh Ambassador thank you so much for being with us we hear a global condemnation yet again of Israel how will the Netanyahu government be viewing this does does this International condemnation matter at all to Israel's government and I just heard ER your description of what happened sounds terrible but I must tell you we were not exposed here in Israel to any of it yet H our the coverage here of the war is focusing today on Syria on Lebanon and still on this American Turkish peace activist so maybe it's uh about to come but there is no coverage here so if you ask about the impact internally in Israel or on our government ER we were not exposed to it and uh the only thing I've heard so far is that Netanyahu is not answering the phone calls of the Secretary General of the UN gutes but they didn't explain Beyond it so I guess it was the related to but it's not the first time that we've seen condemnation of Israel um from from the International Community whether from the European Union we've heard from Joseph Burell the UN Secretary General these attacks have happened very often in the past 11 months almost a year now and there's condemnation of Israel denunciation of Israel and none of that seems to resonate with the Israeli government sure this is happening almost daily and obviously there is a an accumulation and it's a burden on Israel's image and on Israel's International standing but if I am trying to penetrate the mind of the Israeli government and as you know I'm not there for a long period of time now I think the Israeli government cares less at this stage about public reaction media reaction and it focuses on governmental reactions and I think only when it comes to a governmental level to a governmental move the Israeli government is seeing is seeing it as damage to our International standing as long as long as it's media I don't think they are very caring about what about Mr ly what about the Israelis Israeli citizens are they not concerned about their country's Global image it's deteriorating image Israel uh being accused of genocide well uh first we don't see what you see abroad much of what you see abroad we don't see here and the Israelis are focusing on their own casualties and we have casualties almost every day now on the damage to the North of Israel to the south of Israel so the agenda here is very different what Israel is know and hear is what's going on in the two International courts in the H what's going on in the UN and if there is a governmental move ER specifically like recognition of Palestine and so on it reaches the news here but I don't think the Israeli public not the experts and not the maybe Ministry officials forign Ministry officials I don't think the Israeli public is worried at this stage about it it's much more worried about the personal security and maybe the damage to the economy make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
