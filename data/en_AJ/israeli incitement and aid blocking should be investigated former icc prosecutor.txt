an image of an Israeli soldier standing over a stripped and wounded Palestinian man in Gaza has emerged on social media this is a screen grab from a video uploaded by the soldier himself it was reportedly recorded in Gaza City the US state department has called the image deeply troubling while the Israeli military says the video is quote contrary to its protocols and values well it's just one of many highly criticized social media posts from Israeli soldiers in who okay so what you've just heard is an Israeli soldier reacting to the demolition of a residential building other videos show Israeli soldiers joking about civilians in Gaza not being involved in the conflict as they walk through the ruins of homes and schools South Africa's case at the international court of justice referenced videos similar to these as evidence of genocidal intent okay let's introduce Lewis Moreno ampo is the former Chief prosecutor at the international criminal court he joins us from pad Del EST in Uruguay a very warm welcome to you thanks for your time so even in Conflict there are clearly Rules of Engagement but we know some of Israel's acts in Gaza amount to quote plausible acts of genocide that's according to the international court of justice as we continue to see image after image of Israeli soldiers apparently abusing their positions in Gaza and indeed the West Bank what does an organization like the international criminal court do with evidence like that well I think the most important court now in the short term to protect the people both protect the family of the hostage and the Gaza people the most important in international court of justice decision as you rightly say the 13 judges say this it's plow possibility is a genocide on goinging and in three weeks Israel how to has to present to the judges how they would change to transform the situation that why it's a very important moment now because there are like par tracks I see the core decision demanding Israel come back to us in three weeks tell what you will do I see us and Qatar working on agreement with Hamas on the ceas fire uh that is in some way moving the same direction of course that will be problematic for Netanyahu because Netanyahu end of the war is his end as a political leader so that why it's a conflict between Israeli hostages isi people the Gaza people and Nan Destiny ju just uh while you're talking we're looking at some of the images that have been uploaded by uh Israeli soldiers some of them appear to be reving in acts of violence in Gaza and the West Bank uh we have heard time and time again said in Israel that the Israeli military is one of the most moral and ethical armies uh in the region what what does what we're seeing now say and do to those claims well in the international court of justice decision one point that even the Israel judge agree is that Israel justice system has to investigate whoever is inciting into violence so I this images should be investigated by Isel itself and including the demonstration to block the the humanarian assistance that would be genocide so I believe the court in Israel can show commitment to the idea of law is a way to harmonize interest no war and they could start these cases investigating people in Israel that is inight into genocide Netanyahu is different the international K Court could and maybe will deal with himself because there is no immunity before the international criminal court so Netanyahu even as a prime minister cannot be investigated in Israel could be investigated by thec the problem is this investigation against will take time and we need to protect the people today that why to protect Israeli who has hostages in Gaza and to protect the Gaza people is really important the next three weeks right how Qatar and US put pressure on the SE fire what n will do and what will happen in three weeks when Israel had to go back to the H to present what they will do right I mean they do nothing sure yeah you you you talked about the the um and enforcement of law in Israel and the law being a unifying force for Israel going forward but we're seeing Israeli demonstrators on the uh Karam Abu salum Crossing many aligned with the Israeli far right blocking aid from entering Gaza contrary to the emergency measures passed by the icj to allow in Aid does that mean these so-called demonstrators are themselves particip participating in crimes against humanity for genocide well that is one of the points that the international court of justice said that the US Judiciary should control inight into violence in Israel or incit to commit genocide and the point I did is even the Barack the judge Israel judge who is sitting in the international court of justice agree on that point so absolutely clear yes Israel Judiciary should investigate this crimes this the statements and investigate initation to commit genocide but my point about the law is not just about inside Israel Israel choose to go to war and that's why IJ could transform the agenda is not is Hamas should be controlled Hamas could not commit commit crimes but could not be a war against civilians in Gaza that is the way we have to that his goal stop War stop terrorism stop killings you the law idea Africa yeah just returning to the sit this situation on that all important border crossing I mean what appears quite clear is that those um who are blocking Aid a group calling themselves or Denine seem to have the implicit or tcid support of some serving cabinet members these are people like itamar benier the national security minister could it be argued this blockade of Aid is State sanctioned yes stopping Aid could be in particular to destroy the civilians is genocide under article 2C with inflicting condition to destroy the community and I believe it's a shame that the person got did that was rejected by Israeli army forces for because extremist Behavior so is the Israel Armed Forces who rejected the current Minister G to be in the in the Army and now this person is leading the security that's why we are talking about Gaza but we should also focus on what V is doing in West Bank yes Mr V could not be a minister in Israel is an extremist right wing saved by the Israel army uh Louis Morano oampo former Chief prosecutor the IC in the he many thanks for joining us and sharing your thoughts thank you
