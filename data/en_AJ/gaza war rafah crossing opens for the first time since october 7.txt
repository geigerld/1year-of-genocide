and after 25 days of Relentless Israeli bombardment the first group of people have been allowed out these are live pictures of the border crossing where people are starting to enter into Egypt Palestinian officials say the number allowed to cross is limited seriously wounded Palestinians and foreign Nationals are the ones who've been authorized to enter Egypt let's speak now to our correspondent inside Gaza safat Al calut he's using an international SIM card and so is able to connect to us because all other Communications in Gaza are down and have been for the last few hours safwat first of all let's talk about Rafa we've got a lot of people there um a few hundred perhaps crowded at the Crossing the gate has opened they now look like they're waiting to be processed before heading into Egypt what information are you able to give us so as we were informed by The Crossing out authorities that Egypt officially announced officially the opening for the first time of R Crossing to allow the evacuation of 81 uh injured Palestinians from the war war injuries who are in critical condition adding to that a list of hundreds of foreigners or Palestinian with the dual citizenship uh but they will received uh information by their embassies through the cross uh to to go through ra so it's not something the random uh that everybody who with for nationality can go now to RAF there is a spe specific plan for the foreigners to leave through the RAF Crossing uh we we had a check a quick check on the on the list of the foreigners that includes Europeans Asians and other nationalities as well but still everybody should go based on orders from his Embassy that coordinate with the Egyptian uh Egyptian ti safwat do you know if anyone who's not been informed is also trying to make their way down to the Raffa Crossing to get out but from the first days of the war hundreds of Palestinians they try to reach Raa Crossing to uh to move outside the Gaza the Gaza Strip since they were under the Israeli fire so but then when they realize that it needs a higher level political level to open it to open the crossing for them they just went back home now there is no way that anyone can cross without special coordination although they carry Palestinian or foreign nationality many many people they are willing to leave and to get this place to and another place some people they don't mind even to move to the siai to at least to find a shelter from the Intensive Israeli fire either airc or alter especially when the situ sitation is getting even worse in terms of Israeli tanks invading the North and Gaza City okay safat alut thanks very much for the moment for joining us there from Gaza let's now go to hanni Mahmud he joins us via satellite link from Khan Yunis also inside the Gaza Strip hannie you are outside one of those hospitals which is going to be releasing a small number of Palestinian seriously injured Palestinians to Egyptian ambulances talk us through what you're hearing about the process well uh so far the the process is uh is is going as as it planned uh with the with an expected delay happening unfortunately uh for uh uh hospitals in Gaza and the northern part of Gaza where they were uh where they were asked to uh uh to send uh seriously wounded Palestinian now there's something that we we should know about this process only uh the reason there is a limited number is because we have lifethreatening situations uh life lifethreatening condition for the for those seriously wounded Palestinian the other thing is uh these are uh the individual who were in the ICU units uh for the past two weeks so the the priority is given to these people the problem now that is going to delay the process is due to lack of of of of a safe corridor from north northern part of Gaza and Gaza City to the southern part uh the ambulance vehicle have not moved yet uh there is a demand for a safe route or a safe passage uh for ambulance vehicle from from Shiva hospital as well as other uh Hospital Hospital in order the Indonesian hospital just to make it through uh to the southern part and then ra High Crossing so we're expecting this delay uh for the coming uh hours but so far we know that the Egyptian ambulance vehicle have arrived to the Egyptian side of the RAF Crossing they are in line and they are waiting for Palestinians ambulance vehicle to reach the gate and then a transfer of winded uh Palestinians will take place to the Egyptian ambulance vehicle uh which will take them to a field Hospital uh in shik City uh to the southern of of rafah city in the Egyptian side and this has been uh it was established I believe in the past two days a field hospital as a as a receiving point and then from there uh those wounded Palestinians will be taken to designated hospitals either in the within the vicinity or or to Cairo uh there is also another update about foreign Nationals and Palestinian with the dual citizenship who are still at the RAF Crossing have been trying for the past two three weeks to get out of Gaza with appeals and calls with the government officials and and their embassies uh but we learned from our source and this has been confirmed uh the entry uh the permission uh for for the wounded uh for Palestinian or seriously wounded and foreign Nationals will happen at the same time simultaneously it's like one package of people leaving Gaza and that said uh there won't be a two process going on and and that's the latest of what we heard and due to disabled communication uh we we're not hearing more about what's going to happen but we're expecting a delay coming from the hospitals in Gaza at shifa hospital and the Indonesian Hospital okay hany uh We've also obviously had a huge bombing uh yesterday in jabalia refugee camp a number of strikes on that camp which was a very densely populated area in the very densely populated strip what is the latest that you're hearing about that and I appreciate that Communications have been cut in Gaza since the early hours of this morning so it's difficult to get updates yes yes well the situations in jabalia refugee camps are very cat catastrophic uh due to the uh mass bombardment of an entire residential block uh at least six building of multiple story building were bombed at the same time we're talking about multiple air strikes happening at one minute or within like very very short short time uh without a warning people were not given a warning to evacuate uh and uh they were not even given the time to run for their life so it happened all all the sudden unpredictable uh bombs fell on people who were in that area we're talking about at least 500 people who we inside those buildings that's the minimum we know it's a very crowded area and and and those buildings came down right at the same time initial reports talk about at least 100 or a little over 100 people were killed right at the spot however we are expecting the number to rise as uh these there are people under the rubbles and with giving the intensity and and the uh of the bombardment uh the entire area H turned into a pile of ruins it would be very difficult to dig in and find uh people under the the rebels that will take days of probably uh and with the lack of equipment and Machinery uh to do this the civil defense Personnel will find it very difficult uh to find to get people from under uh the reubel but we have family member who said they know they have relatives who are still under these rubbles and it will be very difficult in the coming days to see how this will play itself out but it was such a tragic a tragic event okay hany Mahmud thanks very much for bringing us the update there from Khan Unice
