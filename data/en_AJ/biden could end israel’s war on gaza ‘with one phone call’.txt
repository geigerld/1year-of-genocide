well let's bring in Sal Takahashi he's a professor of Human Rights and peace studies at Osaka joken University he's also a former deputy head at the office of the UN High Commissioner for human rights in occupied Palestine he joins us today from Baku Professor these initiatives by Western countries the air drops a new port a maritime Corridor they essentially bypass the bottlenecks and the constraints on the land borders which are happening because Israel says they need to check all of the aid going into the strip these new aid routs though presumably also require approval or cooperation of Israel so is Israel now essentially saying those checks aren't necessary why not then just let the trucks in I mean look this is not predominantly a humanitarian issue uh this is not some kind of you know natural disaster tsunami and or an earthquake or anything like that this is a like you say a man-made disaster it is a genocide the Israelis are inflicting genocide on the Palestinians now if the Americans or the EU uh gave a hoot about Palestinian lives what they should be doing is not pretending like they are Hollywood action heroes and you know airlifting supplies into Berlin what they should be doing is stopping the endless flow of weapons and stopping the political support for isra genocide and they should be you know Biden could halt all of this tomorrow with one phone call and the fact that they are not doing it um the fact that Biden is not doing it really shows me that he must think American voters are really stupid are these new plans then do you think also a tacid acknowledgement of sorts that the US and its allies aside from the arms that you're talking about essentially don't have the influence beyond that to get Israel to live up to basic International legal obligations well the notion that they don't have the influence is is ludicrous I mean without the weapons without the political support all of this would stop tomorrow and if the Americans and the EU really cared about Palestinian lives if they really cared about Palestinian rights and the Palestinian right of self-determination they could take M much more effective steps that would really alleviate the situation tomorrow the fact that they're not doing it shows that they don't really care and all of this is for domestic consumption basically sure let me ask you a little bit about what Logistics might look like on the ground if all of this does go ahead as someone who's worked for the UN these are obviously ways to get Aid into Gaza but how do you then deal with the distrib on the ground once it's inside well look all of these are you know all of these are logistical details that need need to be sorted out but like I like I've said this is not predominantly a humanitarian issue if the Israelis were to allow a proper the proper distribution of humanitarian Aid like the international court of justice ordered them to do then all of this could be sorted out you know with a very in within a very short period of time but the fact that you know we're even talking about this just goes to show that the Israelis have no intention whatsoever of allowing this and they are being aided and embedded in all of this by the Western governments let me ask you about the narrative that this perpetuates here the world food program has had to suspend operations in the north because it can't guarantee security there I know some observers are now using the phrase Collective humiliation so Israel's creating the conditions for the the level of desperation and the lawlessness that comes with that as people try to keep their families alive well yes for sure I mean the look the entire Israeli the entire Israeli occupation of Palestine and I'm including 48 within this uh is based on Collective humiliation a daily humiliation uh which is geared towards uh encouraging and pushing Palestinians out of their homes and out of their lands so yes this is just another extension just another level of humiliation and another level of genocide which is which would what we're witnessing let me ask you one thing about the the US plan that that really struck me the Pentagon saying it could take up to two months to build this temporary Port I mean that surely gives us some insight into how the White House feels that ceasy negotiations are going how long the White House thinks this war and The Siege will last well look yes I mean I my my personal opinion is that probably Biden just sort of announced this initiative without real knowledge of how long it would take but look really it is for domestic consumption like I just said he must really think that the rest of the world and frankly American voters are really stupid to think that you know they would be fooled by this act of uh Hollywood action hero you know airlifting supplies into Berlin this is not what this is about this is a man-made disaster this is a genocide inflicted by the Israelis and the Americans could stop it immediately with one fol Professor you yourself used to work for the UN High Commissioner for human rights given the political context that you've sketched out for us here what role do you now see for the United Nations here well the United Nations has has been has had a very very difficult time in trying to get uh the actors here and in particular Israel to abide by its obligations in inter under international law and unfortunately that remains and we see as we see with the defunding of unra uh many of the western governments are just all too happy to uh you know buy into Israeli narratives about the role that the UN is playing and should be playing so it's a it's a very it's a very difficult situation s Takahashi there professor of Human Rights and peace studies at Osaka juger Queen University thank you for joining us on aler and sharing your thoughts thank you
