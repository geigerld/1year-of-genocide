in a wide- ranging speech to Parliament the Turkish president rashab Ty erdogan called for an immediate ceasefire and proposed an International Conference to reach a lasting peace ham Hamas is not a terrorist organization but a group of liberators and mujahid fighting to protect their land and their citizens well our correspondent rul s who has covered tea extensively for us joins me now in outdoor house Studio rasul are we sensing here a shift in in from erdogan today and and how's that likely to go over with regional leaders I wouldn't consider that as a shift however we definitely can't see that now it's tuning up so he's he's speaking up because officially and legally turkey has never uh recognize Hamas as a terror group despite lots of pressure from the Western countries from Israel to on Turkey to put Hamas on a terrorist but that has never been the case so so this is not a new position that turkey is not recog recognizing Hamas as a as a terror group however the timing is delicate as all the particularly the Western leaders are now equalizing both Hamas and Isis together so a leader of a regional country Regional power coming up and saying that Hamas is not a terror group but a liberator that defending their lands that are occupied by Israel is is is quite times time sensitive and it's quite remarkable in this context so and but previously he will go even further Mur and call Israel as a terror state but now we can see that he's not uttering such words so it means that this is not a Rapture so he's not burning up all the bridges he still wants to keep the good relations with Israel good relations with the west but on the other hand by calling Hamas not the terror group of the liberators is actually indicating a kind of the the the root causes of this crisis he said that there is a context of this so there is an ongoing occupation since decades and what happened on October 7 is is not a a is not the the beginning however is a consequences of the Decades long occupations and the wrongdoings so it's not a rupture however it's quite remarkable that after two weeks of almost silent president ardan is coming up as speaking that much on high willm well speaking of of coming out and and raising voices do you think that there's more Unity emerging now in the region especially as we're seeing this death toll continue to rise I I think so look it's like when we see today uan saying that he's calling for an international mechanism to be established and particularly the the the important uh Regional actors also to be present there not only politically but militarily as well and he says that turkey is ready to contribute to that mechanism or to do whatever is necessary politically and militarily so what I understand from that is is that he's talking about a peacekeeping forces that is not just going to be secured and conducted by by the United Nations but a different mechanism that the regional actors are also involved so on the other hand the Turkish foreign minister has been on a regional tour he was in Iran yesterday and then went to the UAE and today was in Qatar he's trying to also promote a regional front here so Eran is also talking about that so as the western front of the C the world is United behind Israel now they're trying to to to promote a regional position here that they can put a kind kind of counternarrative and also put a pressure particularly on the US and Israel so yes he's talking about an international mechanism that has a deterrence that has the political power and also the military power as well whether that could happen or not it's a different issue however that's quite new well it's clearly a plan in the works at least we hope there's a plan in the works Russell sder there our correspondent who's covered to very extensively thank you for your insights here thank
