to war after day four stay with me uh because we've got some breaking news now Israeli media reports various Israeli media Outlets reporting uh that 13 Israeli captives uh being held by hamus in the Gaza Strip have been released now to the international Committee of the Red Cross if correct uh that signals the beginning of a sequenced process now in which uh as we saw on Friday those captives will be taken by the International Red Cross to a medical facility checked over then flown uh by Israeli military uh aircraft to an air base in the south of Israel and eventually finding their way uh to Al Sheba I believe Hospital in Tel Aviv uh we await confirmation of those reports but it does appear uh that the second phase of uh captive release is on way Maran indicating that a 2hour delay has not necessarily amounted to any major hiccup in the process I bring to you what what I mentioned earlier about Egypt suggesting yesterday that it's hearing positive signals from all sides that they may be willing to continue this process at least for another couple of days the negotiators of course will be wanting to announce that as soon as possible a sense of momentum buying a little bit more time for some of those moves that you were discussing in the International Community to my understanding is that the Karis are now more intensively uh involved in discussions uh that the Egyptians and the Americans and my understanding is that over the weekend President Biden himself is getting uh personally involved in seeing where this thing going through of course the Americans want to know how many more Americans or dual nationality are being released or will be released and and and if not all of them then maybe the four days will be extended to 56 and so on so forth so I think what we're seeing especially also judging from what you just said now the breaking news is that uh the pilots are working the first day the second day probably we seeing the process we seeing an oiled an oil a well oiled machine now starting to move forward and I think a lot of the people including a good segment of the public opinion in Israel as well as in the United States would like to see this extended would' like to see more captives more hostages released would like to see more Palestinian prisoners uh released and clearly uh there is at least on the part of certain Europeans at this point in time the majority of the Arab and the Muslim world and I think much of the world would like to see a ceasefire would like to see the so-called humanitarian policies move to be more of a temporary or a permanent ceasefire I think that's the general direction it's not to the liking of Netanyahu or his General en but I think in as far as the generals are concerned they just want a decision either way right because what they don't want is to be stuck like they are today that is that does not work well for any any military so either they're going to so-called continue with the mission achieve the objectives whatever they are at this point they're becoming more like pipe dream or withdraw we'll come back to you in a moment we're going to go to sarak kyat now in Tel Aviv to give us more uh on that breaking news that we heard Sara are you hearing any more on these reports that 13 Israeli captives have now been handed over to the I icrc yeah Israeli uh media is reporting uh sources but nothing has officially been confirmed what we have seen though is that it's also quoting Egyptian media is saying that they had received a list of 14 names so really we're seeing 13 and 14 again those two numbers are yet uh to be confirmed and until we actually see uh those videos uh which will likely if we go by what happened yesterday Hamas did uh um release a video showing those held captive being released now uh what we know is that they apparently have been now handed over from Hamas uh to uh the Red Cross we've also heard uh reports by uh the media that they are all from one uh area which is uh bayi which is the place uh where uh the attack on October 7 happened one of the places where a lot of those were killed that's where uh that where a lot of these people will be from um and they will be sent to a different hospital again reports to the one from yesterday which was a children's hospital interestingly those uh captives yesterday were all but one from another area another southern uh town uh uh with just close uh to bi so again still developing story uh we have a rally here that's happening where uh many expected to come here thousands in fact uh and there will be performances behind us while there are also big screens that will be following everyone will be following the situation and we're seeing people walking around on their mobile phones just as we saw yesterday as people wait to see those um captives handed over through Rafa Crossing uh via Egypt to uh a specialist Israeli unit that's what uh was said yesterday they are specialized in these kind of situations with medical professional help uh that will check them medically first before they are then crossed over through the border crossing as we saw Yesterday by bus taken to a Israeli military base and then helicoptered to the hospitals we've also been seeing Israeli media reporting that uh the families of those held captive already been informed to make their way to either the one hospital or a number of hospitals but so far we're being told that it's just to One hospital again this is a moving story so that information is trickling through and nothing is yet confirmed and Sarah just to explain to viewers the main picture on our screen uh beside you there is of beun Crossing uh as it appears the Israeli captive release has now taken place it means of course in train that the pal imprisoner release will also take place at that betunia Crossing um in the coming hour or two perhaps based on what happened on Friday night uh immense relief I imagine where you are Sara uh there would have been some concern about the delay um yeah sorry I just want to uh say that we're also hearing again now that they're saying 13 people 13 captives not 14 um so until we officially confirm it but it seems that has changed once again to 13 uh going back to your question um of course emotions here have been very high uh people are saying that uh they now feel a little bit more hopeful um there had also been reports in Israeli uh media earlier saying that there could be a potential they're actually quoting Egyptian sources saying that there could be a potential extension to that ceasefire that uh based on all parties requesting or looking towards that same direction um but then another Israeli uh media Outlet then quoted a senior official without giving names saying uh that that's likely highly unlikely to be declared or decided on at least certainly this early in the uh 4day pause and that would probably be something they would discuss closer to the end of the 4day pause but going back we know that Hamas has said that they would be looking to release more captives there's also reports again just in the last last couple of hours saying that they've managed to locate more of those captives because Hamas has said when the war started on Gaza it seems that the captives were taken to different locations and some of them have been held by Islamic Jihad so now they're saying according to Israeli media it seems that Hamas is saying that they have located more 10 to 20 was the number given um and that they could potentially then uh be able to release more we know Hamas has said that it was willing to release not just women and children but look to release past 4day males they said it would not include any of the Israeli soldiers and we also know on the other side that prime minister Benjamin netan who said one of the war goals is to bring all of them back and that he would potentially consider extending it for every 10 captives they would get an extra day of PA and fighting an extra day of ceasefire so again all speculative it's all up in the air but what I can tell you from this Square that's become known as hostage Square because the families gather here and so do their supporters they've said they will continue to hold the rallies here and certainly thousands are expected to attend uh today where some of those families of those captives will be speaking later on okay Sarah I know we'll be back talking to you as events unfold during the evening thanks for that for the moment s Sarah K
