Now talks are continuing in Cairo aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Gaza the framework proposal would see female sick and elderly captives released in exchange for a six-week truce the US says Israel has more or less agreed to the deal but as those talks continue there's no end to Israel's bombardment on the ground inali Refugee camper searching the rubel Force survivors and bodies after a series of blasts at least eight palestin have been killed more than 30,500 people so far have been killed now Palestinians waiting for food have again come under Israeli fire as those Aid convoys [Applause] arrived several Palestinians have been injured by Israeli forces in the or in the Kuwait roundabout area of Gaza City only a few people were able to get some boxes which included water flour and other items now the trucks left carrying some of those injured by that gun fire Al ja's correspondent is Al was at Kuwait roundabout before Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for Aid we're now in Salah Road near Kuwait roundabout where the humanitarian aid from South Gaza arrived in this area the Israeli forces have committed the so-called flower Massacre and open fire on Palestinian civilians who are trying to get flour from eight trucks at the Noble Sur roundabout in the west of Gaza City today we got some Aid we found water and cans water is fine but we need food for the children and the elderly people the holy month of Ramadan is coming soon and we need flour to bake people they speak about the aid every day they're deceiving us three or four trucks of aid for thousands of people my son told me that he's hungry and he couldn't wait anymore my children get up hungry every morning and I have nothing to offer them this isn't life the citizens hopes are very high that more and more trucks will enter Gaza Strip but still the number of trucks carrying Aid is very limited ja Hy Mahmud our correspondent joins us now on the phone from Rafer let's just begin with the ongoing strikes on convoys of Aid it seems to be relentless hany yes and the fact that right now the situations are very very critical in in northern part of this church given the famine is spreading really quickly across that part of the Gava strip where we have more people particularly children vulnerable group and victims largely been victim of this genocide of War a diet of dehydration and starvation and also there's a great deal of frustration and that is it could buy a statement by the civil defense department in the G STP that stated that the mechanism of Aid delivery as well as the uh the ongoing restriction by the Israeli military on the ground to obstruct Aid delivery to Hungry largely hungry popul in in the northern part of Y is humiliating the it is dangerous we're talking about fourth time now in less than a week a trucks are being targeted either the people are targeted directly or the a truck itself is being targeted directly as what happened in within the past 48 hours and right now Kuwaiti in Gaza that's a very popular site right now because it happens before where people Gather in larger groups waiting for a trucks to get to that to the Gaza and the northern part and so they are able to get some of the food supplies and get back to their their families so far children are dying of dehydration and starvation while their parents are try to get their di Food Supplies and and water and and these are the things that we're talking about things that are basics for human survival right now as the Sal continues to spread but there is a the fact that it's happening for the fourth time as a lot of people Express that it's happening deliberately and there is a a deliberate attack on into this part of the gos and only feeds into as one person described it only Fe into one conclusion which is either people will die of starvation or eventually they will have to to leave Elsewhere for example as expressed multiple times this is what is referred to as a voluntary immigration but the way it's happening it looks more like of a forc expulsion expulsion by starvation or by the intense bombing campaign corner there reports of many people who are injured and arriving to health facilities are largely are prepared to receive this kind of emergencies right now they're all out of service in in the northern part of Gaza City no medical supplies insufficient medical staff so the life isard that people are losing their lives there because they're shock now or being targeted waiting for food is is very high H mm for in Raa thank you
