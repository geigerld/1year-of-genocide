well US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks on Israel's war on Gaza he will be discussing efforts to secure a ceasefire and more Aid deliveries to the strip this is his sixth tour of the region since October he's expected to head to Egypt and Israel next for more talks let's bring in Al jaaz senior political analyst Maran bashara let's start with Lincoln's visit his sixth visit to the region since October does he genuin believe that he can make any difference given what he's achieved so so far which is nothing you know you wonder right one wonders because on the one hand one can see how uh the United States the Biden Administration is kind of playing it both ways trying to have it its cake and eat it too it's both trying to maintain some distance from the Netanyahu government while providing unconditional support to the Israeli government so so you can see that they are sort of playing it both ways and it's important to continue to play The Diplomatic card because that helps deflect from the real tragedy that's unraveling in Gaza so perhaps that is the task the task is not to save the people in Gaza the task is to save the United States from complicity being known as the verdict being that the United States is complicit in genocide in Gaza you said deflect but deflect for who because it's really interesting I get a sense that every time the US tells the Israelis uh off anything the worse the situation gets in Gaza this is the thing right so we have here in the studio and in inside in the room in the office you know a number of um screens if you watch International media especially Western media they're talking about how the Biden Administration is trying to boost Aid to the to the poor Palestinians you then you would watch them you Cameron and BBC saying how wonderful you know the UK role is in trying to establish a two-state solution somewhere down the road while doctors are being killed in Gaza while children are being killed in Gaza so you have these Western officials notably the Americans continue to talk about stuff right diplomacy humanitarian Aid Israel is doing its best it's not doing its best the Israeli government not the Israel government while children are dying while people are dying of starvation while more women more doctors more nurses more teachers more academics continue to die in Gaza so while the Western media is busy talking about diplomatic this and that and this ini initiative and that initiative and this captive that captive we've been busy for five months talking about 100 plus captives uh in the hands of Hamas while every day some hundred people are killed by Israel if not more right so it's definitely helps this kind of diplomatic circus helps the United States and Israel deflect from the real tragedies on the ground even you and I here we are talking about Blink so but we are smart enough I hope everyone else could could be smart enough to always mention underline right emphasize the fact that while these people are trying to waste our time in fact people are dying famine is not something at the brink of happening it is Happ it is it has happened it's a state of famine as Joseph Borel himself the EU foreign policy Chief has underlined just the day before yesterday so in fact the tragedy continues to unravel in plain sight it is on the TV screens but Western diplomats basically on behalf of Israel right continuously try to defend the Israeli repeat the Israeli sound bites on Western TV screen so that the West continues to provide support to Israel while maintaining some kind of a distance from Israel I also wanted to touch on what's going on at alifa hospital so little information coming out from there it is I believe day four of an Israeli raid on the hospital Maran I I wonder if we should remind our audience you know that this is the first hospital that was raided back in October uh why are the Israelis back here again and and and 2014 and 2019 there's a whole memory right so this was started and if you it's good probably to to remind people around the world our viewers around the world about how this was supposed to be uh on top of multi-layer multi level Hamas headquarters right where all the operation the world terror right was really being being uh being designed and engineered from there then that there's nothing absolutely nothing okay so why what's happening today is worse than what happened back then and what happened back then was already tragic awful criminal a war crime and so on so forth because Israel was still working on some assumption that somewhere you know some perhaps convinced of that they could probably find something they didn't find anything five months later they continue to attack and the way they're attacking the doctors and the nurses is a thing I would like to you know for us to stop and and think about I think there's a special place in hell for people who abduct and kill doctors and torture doctors because these people amongst all of us they are the ones who are saving lives to kill people who are saving lives you definitely have a special place in in hell so there's a there's an Israeli government that is deliberately attacking hospitals attacking doctors who are trying to save lives now under what pretense I think they basically run out of pretenses right so now they say anything that's associated or smells like someone is perhaps the relative of someone that worked for Hamas or worked in the health Ministry or anything of that nature which is by every single definition a war crime Israel continues to commit war crimes in daylight right in plain sight on TV screens and what Dr mads told us in his own private conversation with people with doctors in the hospital which is I believe 100% to be trustworthy underlines the fact that Israel can continue to do that because if you are if you were in Israel's position the world continues to talk and does nothing it continues to warn Israel don't do that don't do that and Israel does it and nothing happens then why shouldn't Israel continue to do what it's doing and run run away with it get away with it with total impunity because the world continues to warn and does absolutely nothing it's a total betrayal of human rights of of universal values and of every value of decency that we know of how just a senior political analyst Maran Bashar thank you
