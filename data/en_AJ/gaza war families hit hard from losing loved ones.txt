she might be safe from the bombardment but can't escape the grief and pain that has engulfed Gaza Iman says it's the sense of guilt that is hitting her hardest her father mother brother and a nurse killed on October 9th while at home she last spoke to them at 400 p.m. on that day my father kept on telling me we're old people and why would they hit us the Israelis know we're old so why would they target us I agree now I'm thinking why didn't I stay longer on the phone with them the last words I told my mother were that I have to prepare dinner and I would call her back I wished I'd stayed longer on the call the next morning a man received a much dreaded news the entire neighborhood of elel had been flattened in the blink of an eye the family house went from this to this all those inside buried under the rubble Iman managed to get the pictures of the bodies we won't show them to you because they're absolutely gruesome covered in rubble her mother missing her Limbs and part of her head and then the body of her father was retrieved 3 days later and was starting to decompose it's a fear shared by the workers from Gaza who found themselves stranded in Israel when the war broke out they came to the occupied West bang for their safety this man who doesn't want to be recognized says he hasn't heard from his wife or his four children in four days I can't explain the feeling I don't know anything my wife my children my parents I don't know if they're alive or dead if I were there I could have made them feel safer my children need me I'm their father and I should be protecting them my body might be here but my mind is in Gaza Ramy also doesn't know about his family he was on a medical visit in occupied East Jerusalem and says the Israeli police expelled him to ramala he has been trying to reach his wife for a week without success they don't have a phone anymore I was told they went to seek shelter in a un school but I haven't spoken to them in a week I can't stop thinking about them I feel guilty I am here if the crossing opens I am not going to wait a minute here I don't care about my treatment even if it took 6 months to get a medical permit I just want to see my children Ramy fears they could be among those who were killed as they heeded Israel's evacuation order to go south of this trip or among those who were killed when a un school was hit he simply doesn't know these are just a few stories of war and distress common to so many trying to survive as Gaza crumbles in front of their eyes H ABD Hamed Al jaaz ramalan
