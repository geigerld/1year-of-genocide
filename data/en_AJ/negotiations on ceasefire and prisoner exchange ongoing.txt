we're in a position to bring you some breaking news alaz sources say that there are negotiations going on right now mediated by Qatar on a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal that would be a deal for an exchange of prisoners between Hamas and Israel Ibrahim freat is associate professor of conflict resolution at the Doha Institute it's good to have you with us on set to discuss this if this happens still a big if at this stage negotiations ongoing but if this happens it would obviously be major it will be a huge breakthrough depending however on the terms of the ceasefire um and for how long is it going to be a humanitarian ceasefire is it going to be a temporary ceasefire is it going to be an end of this war so this we don't know yet and we don't have a news any any of that what we know however I'll add I'll add a little something these negotiations can be characterized right now we have to be careful with the words we use based on the sourcing and everything but they they can be described as progressing the negotiations are progressing and they're currently at an advanced stage exactly no matter what the terms are it's still a huge breakthrough because we know that there has been a very strong Israeli rejection to any sort of ceasefire even a humanitarian ceasefire even the International Community the European Union yesterday in the meeting was calling for a humanitarian sees far and they were a bit shy of even saying this so there isn't any serious pressure on Israel from the European Union and we know that the US has said several days now that a ceasefire in their view would benefit Hamas and that's why the US has been against one exactly um but nevertheless Israel the United States also they're so concerned about the issue of the prisoners or the the arrested Israelis with with Hamas um and this is an important factor for for the domestic level in the United States and that's let's keep in mind that Dom in the US and in Israel yes exactly and let's keep in mind that the US the US Administration Biden is approaching a new election uh soon so this is the domestic factor is very crucial um as for the United States so there has been some pressure from the US to on Israel to delay the ground operation in order to release the hostages um on that level but um and we have seen some of that impact actually though we don't know the real reasons why Israel has not been uh conducting the ground operations yet one of the explanations that they're scared of the results of what this will happen and the impact on the again the Israeli domestic level for the Israeli government sorry go ahead yeah but but again uh let's keep in mind that this is an important uh development this is a huge break breakthrough even for a short term term uh but then we need to know if this is going to continue to be a temporary it's not going to benefit Hamas a lot it's going actually to benefit the US and it's going to benefit Israel because this will give Israel a free hand is to conduct more ground operations or for a long time well there are two things right that are being discussed one is the ceasefire one is a potential prisoner exchange now the ceas fire we would have to know and we don't at this stage whether again it's temporary or permanent would it be the first step to Wards ending the bombardment and then some some resolution to this uh conflict that we just don't know that's still a question mark the other uh thing that is being discussed is a potential prisoner exchange again there's a lot of information we don't have but there's a lot of context that's important and that we do have when after Hamas carried out its operation on October 7th there were statements from Hamas saying we have enough captives to free all the Palestinians in uh Israeli jails we know that you know these things have happened before with gilad Shalit he was held captive uh for 5 years and when he was an Israeli soldier gach when he was um released it was he was released in exchange for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners yeah um I think it's in my own analysis it's still early to talk about a prisoners exchange okay because this is going to take a long time there are 6,000 approximately 6,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jail U so Hamas announced many times that the time is not Tri now uh for a prisoners exchange and no prisoners exchange will happen before the end of the Israeli War on Gaza so I think so that's why these two things are linked the EAS fire and the and the talks about the prisoners so I think we are talking probably more likely on some some sort of um an exchange with the civilian hostages with Hamas not the because there are two types of hostages with Hamas civilians and Military so and there is high ranked military Israeli military officials are captives with with Hamas at the moment also so probably at this moment we are talking about ceasefire and along with the U civilians uh hostages with Hamas more than a total prisoners exchange because this is would still be a huge step and Israel has many many many vetos on releasing um you know Palestinian prisoners um you know for for the number of like 10,000 6,000 sorry 6,000 prisoners so um again let's hope that there is going to be a ceasefire it's not going to be temporary and it's going to take some time you know for this that something can be built on such even if it's temporary again I think it's still a great progress because some something can be built on later and also let's keep in mind that the developments in the region are not are not helping the United States so there are some sort of developments uh instability taking place in Syria in in Iraq against American American targets oh you think the wider Regional context is something that might that that might play into these negotiations of course of course this is the major pressure point on the us Administration that the US Administration does not made it so clear from day one does not have time for that us larger agenda is Ukraine Russia China it's not this war and for that reason the US finding itself is being pulled into this they felt compelled they felt compelled um to send two aircraft carriers uh just going to remind our viewers of this information on aljazera that there are negotiations going on right now at an advanced level mediated by T this on a ceasefire in Gaza and a potential exchange deal for prisoners between Hamas and Israel that's what we can report at this hour it is 1321
