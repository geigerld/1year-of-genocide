more than 400 Palestinians have been killed during the 9-day period while the polio vaccination campaign was underway in Gaza this month thousands more have been injured and had to depend for their Care on gaza's Health Care System that's nearly collapsed the Palestinian Health Ministry says it has documented more than 270 attacks on medical facilities across Gaza since the War Began and says Israeli forces have killed at least 885 healthcare workers and injured more than 900 34 out of 30 5 hospitals across the strip have been damaged along with about 131 ambulances we're joining us now to talk about the state of medical facilities in Gaza is Dr Victoria ason she's a surgeon volunteering with the charity group Humanity auxilium uh welcome to Al jazer so as imagine there you're volunteer surgeon in the time that you have been there how would you describe the injuries you and other doctors have had to deal with uh you know we've seen explosive injuries pretty much every day since I started at the beginning of September um in addition to the explosive injuries we've seen a lot of wound care um the problem is that when patients have an explosive injury it's not just a one day treat it and they're better they require often times months of post-operative wound care so there's been a lot of that management as well um we talked at length just before we came to you about the extraordinary pressure that hospitals and indeed hospitals staff under right now what are you seeing and hearing in that regard I mean the the staff in these hospitals are incredible um they've been working non-stop for a year now they're they're frankly exhausted um and they're working with really minimal resources um every day that the conflict goes on there are fewer and fewer disposables and essential medicines um so they're working really with with bare bone supplies right now I understand a lack of fuel remains a big issue also I gather two hospitals at least in Northern Gaza the Kamal adwan hospital and the Indonesian Hospital were facing the risk of closure precisely because they were simply running out of power I mean are there any contingency plans in place to make sure for instance critically in injured patients continue to get health care in those kind of scenarios um I I don't know of any contingency plan specifically in place here I do know that fuel is a big problem at all oxa as well they're been several times in the middle of operations that we've actually had to continue using someone's cell phone flashlight and also this major polio vaccination drive that's been underway in central Gaza Southern Gaza and also in the north how are how much are you aware of the effectiveness of that vaccination Drive given that there were eyewitness accounts of people being targeted on the way to vaccination centers um I know know that there were um there was evidence of people being targeted um while they were trying to obtain vaccines but despite that the vaccine campaign has actually been a huge success um they they matched the numbers that they expected and I think you know the who is really pleased with the outcome of the first campaign um and they're planning a second campaign in October so I think that's kind of a a bright light in all of this uh and of course given that bright light there are still concerns about the spread of disease without sanitation being back to what it was before uh the most recent conflict I mean what hope is there about being able to contain illnesses you know I I think at this point the idea of being able to contain illnesses is kind of a kind of a dream I think we're just trying to make it dayto day um without functional Su uh sewage systems without uh clean water available to displac people there's no way that we're going to be able to contain the outbreak of infectious diseases okay Dr Victoria Aon uh volunteer surgeon uh working with the charity group Humanity auxilium good to speak to you and very best to you and your team there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
