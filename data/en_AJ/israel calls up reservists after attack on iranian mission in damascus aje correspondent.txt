now we're just learning that Israel's Air Force has been put on high alert the country's military is recalling air defense reservists to their bases Israeli media are reporting that this is an anticipation of a possible response from Iran that's after Israel attacked the Iranian Consulate in Damascus Syria on Monday killing senior Iranian military officials Al Hamas salut is in occupied East Jerusalem H what are you learning we're learning that after an assessment with the Israeli Army chief of staff and the defense Ministry the Israeli Army has decided to bolster its air defense array meaning that they're going to be calling up reservists in anticipation for retaliation but where it will be is not yet known all of this comes after the Israeli attack on the Iranian missions in Damascus and remember just last week Israel's defense minister yoab Galant hinting at these Israeli strikes in Damascus though never claiming responsibility saying that Israel is in active pursuit of hisbah any adonan proxies wherever enemies May lie whether that's Beirut anywhere else in Lebanon in Damascus or anywhere else in the world and it also comes after just a few days ago the isra Army Chief of Staff authorizing new plans he says for bolstering these attacks on hisbah targets he says in southern Lebanon so clearly an escalation in the region as the Israelis say they are on maximum alert hamda for for context when's the last time you've seen something like this Israel recalling its reservists I mean how much can we read into this it's certainly an interesting question because the northern front of this war which hasn't really escalated into a fullscale war the Israelis have said they were first on the defensive but now they're turning to an active pursuit of hisbah and any sort of Iranian proxy previously we have heard from the Israeli Army that all of their focus was mainly going to be on defeating Hamas in Gaza so really mobilizing most of their troops to the southern part of the country however they say that there are still around 880,000 people who have been evacuated from towns and settlements in the northern part of Israel and yoav Galant has been saying this for months now that the situation cannot remain as such that there will be some sort of action by the Israelis to try and solve what they're calling a problem on Israel's northern border but now the Israelis are saying that they're going to attack wherever they see fit and they are expecting retaliation for that which is why they are indeed calling up reservist Israeli media reading into this as an escalation in the region sarl all right Hamas alhood thank you very much for that snap reporting there on what we're just learning uh out of Israel that's Hamas Sal hutin occupied East Jerusalem I turn now to Tam kmut who's back in the studio with us assistant professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies what's your read on this um uh so timing again s because the the war on Gaza is entering its last phase when it comes to the severity of the military operations you only have a small Enclave of rafah Israel put most of its reserves from the Gaza Strip you only have a small force in the Gaza Strip they are preparing to engage with RAF somehow I mean once they agree with Americans now Israel is shifting Focus to the north because this I mean this front is still on fire of course it's a measured escalation I mean it has been always a measured escalation since the onset of the 7 of October 11th but now Israel has the appetite to go and test Iran's patients and's Readiness for what's next because they want to end this fraud they want to bring it to an end I mean this this escalation in the north so by attacking the embassy in Iran which is a in own diplomatic terms international relations a vulgar attack I mean this is this is a direct attack against an Iranian soul I mean I mean diplomatic Norms you know yeah first time first time they hit ex the the Iranian Embassy compound because they hit the consulate but it's in the embassy compound in Damascus now Israel is believed to have hit plenty of targets yes uh Iranian Target various Iranian targets uh within Syria they never fully claim responsibility but there's no real doubt them and even within Iran itself but but this time by attacking the embassy directly so they're like Crossing line and they're testing Iran's patients and reaction so they want to see what's Iran's next move on this I I really don't know I mean all the scenarios are open on the table now I mean we are in an Uncharted Territory because the Iranians are really embarrassed and they have been pushed into a very narrow corner now and they have to retaliate how would they do it mostly probably through proxy Powers through hisbah or maybe huis or whomever they support but targeting targeting a Target within Israel itself wouldn't it be more likely that they would Target something outside Israel Israel interests but outside Israel possibly possibly I mean the Iranians of course I mean they will not disclose these plans but but but most logically I mean they already have a front on fire with Lebanon and hisbah is there andah engagement with Israel has been under a very constrained War uh scenarios now they could escalate I mean escalate hit deeper in the Israeli side more rockets inside Israel we never know so this could be in preparation for uh for this for this scenario I mean hasballah hitting deep inside Israel I mean what do you think are the interests of both side Israel on the one on the one hand what are their interests they've been messaging we are ready for War uh on the nor what they call the northern front which is against Hezbollah in Lebanon um they've clearly they've struck Iranian targets across the region so what are Israel's interests what are the interests uh and what's Iran's interests that's a very good question s so let's start with the Iranian or hisbah interest so hisbah involvement in this War uh to support the Palestinian resistance in Gaza Hamas as part of the exis movement or the AIS resistance uh and as long as the war in Gaza continues hisbah will keep fighting Israel from the northern front uh I think Israel now at this stage because it's almost finished with destroying mostly of the enre I mean most of the Gaza Strip with all the huge destruction we have seen and uh so now they have the the ability to shift their military Focus taking resources away from Gaza to the north and reach to a new Arrangements governing pertaining the northern borders I mean let's not forget most of Israeli I mean there are hundreds of thousands of Israelis who are fled South they cannot return to the north this is a huge pressure on netan and he promised to deliver on this and he hasn't delivered so far so there is still an open front in the north what the Israelis want is they want to push hisbah back from the northern borders they want to reach a new political agreement through the UN through the US any involved parties so they create new rules of engagement and and New Management mechanisms for the borders where they want to see hisbah uh stay away from the borders I don't know it's seven or 10 kilos I don't know the particular details of the negotiations and then there will be ceasefire and they want to reach to this impose this this these Arrangements now on on on leanon all right Tom thank you very much it's something we're going to continue to talk about in the coming hours I do want to get to the rest of world new news as well though Tom carut there thank you very much
