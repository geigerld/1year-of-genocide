Carnage in Gaza the journalism Israel is trying to suppress the Palestinian reporters risking everything to get the story out Shadow Banning and AG gating social media companies tying themselves up in knots over content coming out of Gaza and silencing Palestinian voices is nothing new for Israel will take you back 50 years to a his historical case in point hello I'm Richard gizbert and you're at the listening post where we don't cover the news we cover the way the news is covered after 3 weeks of punishing Israeli bombardment of Gaza Palestinians there remain sealed off from the outside world Israel is still refusing to allow International journalists or investigators in ask yourself why the situation has made news outlets and audiences is entirely reliant on local journalists Palestinians in Gaza to find out what is going on reporters there face immense challenges and dangers with fuel and electricity cut off charging phones and equipment and transmitting material gets harder by the day the reports that do make it out provide raw unfiltered views into the Carnage produced by the bombing of the most densely populated place on Earth since hamas's horrific attack on Israel on October 7th Palestinian journalists have been killed at a rate of roughly one per day among the survivors Al jaera arabic's bureau chief in Gaza much of his immediate family was killed in yet another Israeli attack in a one-sided War a military mismatch that has killed more than 7,000 Palestinians at least 3,000 of them children for Arabic speakers watching the news of isra 's assault on Gaza one face has been synonymous with the coverage Al jazer arabic's bureau chief there [Music] we this past Wednesday D was reporting live when he got the call the one every Palestinian in Gaza dreads an Israeli air strike had wiped out his immediate family his wife son daughter and Grandson they had been Sheltering in the nerat refugee camp in central gossa an area Israel had designated as safe for Palestinian journalists it was a crushing reminder as if they needed one that there is no Safe Haven left in Gossip having covered one Massacre after another they have come to fear the possibility the probability that they will find people they know those closest to them buried in the rub it's so scary and so terrifying to be a journalist because you're not just reporting on the suffering of the people you're also reporting the killing of your friends and your family members we are actually seeing journalists performing other duties other than journalism heading to the place that get stried and just people gave me these two babies one of the the most heartbreaking videos is of carrying two children and he's trying to do everything at once he's trying to be the paramedic he's trying to be the human to comfort the children he's also trying to be the journalist to report on the story it's really covering death and destru ruction around the clock now where um the entire territory is being deliberately deprived of food of water of medication of electricity I mean the only thing the Israelis haven't succeeded in cutting off to the Gaza Strip is the oxygen supply so I really couldn't overstate the challenges whether at the personal or the professional or the psychological level Palestinian journalists are providing a raw and ugly view of the Carnage in Gaza and they are finding audiences Motas Aiza reports in both English and Arabic on the day before the October 7th attacks he had 25,000 followers now he's at more than 9 million and I'll will show you the massive destruction that happened to the Zahara City in the middle of the STP more than 14 idental Tower got destroyed by the Israeli air strikes Ali Jad Allah is a photojournalist whose work has appeared in many International media Outlets they and many others are chronicling the destruction the likes of which Gaza has never seen before in 2022 a total of 67 journalists and media workers were killed around the world in Gaza they are being killed at a rate of roughly one per day at least two in less than 3 weeks it is a journalistic killing Feld among the latest to be buried rosi saraj co-founder of a company called I media which works with international news outlets like Al jazer some of the organizations that relied on s's work have paid tribute to him among them Radio France International and Amnesty International which said he was murdered by Israeli bombs my uh boss rushi saraj before he was killed one of the last posts he posted was I'm sorry I'm unable to report much because we don't have electricity or Internet so Israel what they're trying to do is completely cut Gaza off from the whole world if it is a war against Hamas as they claim why are you targeting journalists why are you imposing a media blackout on journalists who are sharing what's happening on the ground RI has always had um a passion for film making and photograph and one of his dreams was to show the world what Gaza is like you know the love stories he didn't want to focus on destruction on you know the loss of life he really wanted to show the world that Gaza is full of hope it's full of life but he was compelled to become a journalist because of the horrible atrocities that Gaza was experiencing year after another you know we're following a variety of accounts um Human Rights Watch to do our reporting obviously we rely on on the ground information so the journalists that are reporting on Gaza are doing incredibly vital work The Limited snapshots we're able to get which are so critical for human rights advocates for governments for historians for so many others to understand in real time what's taking place so the limited accounts the dispatches that we get um out of Gaza are critical in terms of furthering our understanding of what the civilian population is facing there more than 7,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed at least 3,000 of them children the casualty figures are updated daily by the dwindling number of medical professionals and journalists on the ground Israel will not allow International reporters or investigators in which has given its official space to cast doubt on the death T are you saying that they're lying about the numbers are you saying that those numbers are wrong we know we know that they learned about the numbers allegations that were echoed this week by the president of the United States I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using the fact of the matter is that doctors in Gaza have developed an expertise in how to identify and account for the dead a methodology born of necessity when we talk about Gaza Health authorities we're talking about Hamas maligning the work of those on the inside is part of a concerted Israeli effort that continues to dehumanize Palestinians even after they have been bu Human Rights Watch has been working in the occupied Palestine territory for more than three decades we've covered multiple rounds of escalations in the Gaza Strip and when we've done our own independent investigations of individual strikes and verified the number of fatalities they have been generally consistent with the figures of gaza's Ministry of Health with no major deviations the major reason is methodological uh the Gaza Ministry of Health has access to data from hospitals and from mors that isn't available to Simply anybody else I would further note that not only does Human Rights Watch but the UN as well as the US state department in their annual human rights reports all use the figures from gaza's Ministry of Health and and the Gaza Ministry of Health has also published the full list um as of October 26th of those killed their names their ages and other identifying um information Beyond dismissing the death toll in Gaza one key focus of Israeli lead ERS and their PR machine Remains the global media the journalists Israel has locked out it is a strategy that Israel admits to Without Shame if the international media is objective it serves Hamas if it just shows both sides it serves Hamas according to politicians like y lapid this story is All About Hamas and October 7th the brutality of those attacks on Israeli civilians and Leed made his name working in the Israeli media he understands the importance of journalistic access at a time like this in a different world every news report about this war by any foreign news agency would start by emphasizing uh that we are unable uh to enter the Gaza Strip and to report from the scene of the crime because the Israeli military has banned us from entering then any statement issued by the Israeli military would have to be prefaced by saying you know this organization has a proven and demonstrated history of knowingly providing the media with falsehoods and why would that be strange there is no conflict in which the parties don't lie it's called propaganda for a reason the reason that Israel is preventing access is completely obvious they they don't have something to hide they've very much uh to hide which leaves the job of documenting this war in the hands of Gins journalists who are finding ways to make an impact this little boy was pulled out alive his rescuer rushes to his mother but before she can Embrace her boy she passes out in a shock Yousef hamash a pal inian filmmaker who also works with refugees has teamed up with Channel 4 a British broadcaster to produce invaluable reports like this one taking viewers to the humanitarian heart of this story Israeli DRS we call the sounds they make zanana a buzzing bee a constant hum they never leave us we are running out of places to hide it is the kind of firsthand accounting of the impact of Israeli bombs and missiles the Netanyahu government does not want the world to see and there is evidence the Biden Administration also finds such journalism problematic the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is reported to have asked Qatari leaders to quote turn down the volume on alzer's coverage because it is full of anti-israel incitement it is not clear what blinkin was referring to spefic specifically not that has taken any notice of that the day after the Israelis annihilated his family he was back on Al jazer Arabic doing his job come what may social media is another front in this war and content moderation policies at some major platforms have people asking questions Flo Phillips is here with more Richard since the start of this war we've seen accounts being closed down others shadowbanned as well as stringent age restrictions on who can watch certain videos this past Wednesday meta raised eyebrows for closing the account of ion Palestine which has more than six million Instagram followers the account going dark is being seen as a prime example of anti-palestinian censorship but meta insists it disabled the account because of security concerns here at Al jazer our digital team has been monitoring multiple platforms it's seeing a big jump in the number of warnings attached to footage showing bomb Devastation or traumatized gazin Tik Tok has been doing a lot of that and when asked why it cited its standard regulations on gory content however similar content related to Russia's war against Ukraine hasn't had this treatment YouTube has been ated as well ageg gating News videos coming out of Gaza which means users have to sign in and verify their ages before they can watch ageg gating has a purpose shielding young people from unsuitable content but again it appears to be applied selectively we didn't see this with News videos coming out of Ukraine advertisers are playing a role in this too a lot of news content from Gaza has been demonetized ads are removed since corporations don't like selling their products alongside images of war the Israeli government has had no such issues it's pushing its ads online many of which feature images and text they're getting a lot of Play on YouTube sometimes they're even being run before videos aimed at kids that begs the question where's the age gating there thanks Flo to the story of another Palestinian voice now silenced by an Israeli bomb more than 50 years ago rassan canaani was a writer who was best remembered for his books like men in the Sun that narrated the experience of Palestinian dispossession and displacement but canaani was first and foremost a journalist exiled living the life of a refugee in Lebanon Beirut in the 1960s was a magnet for young reporters and revolutionaries migrants and misfits Lebanon was also playing host to the Palestinian leadership in Exile at the time it was in Beirut that canaani produced alhad a groundbreaking Palestinian magazine that has been somewhat Lost In The Mists of time three years ago the listening posts Tarak NAFA traveled to Beirut to tell the story of canaani the piece is just as relevant today as it was when we aired it back then there are some voices rare ones that can take a moment in time and give it meaning voices of clarity that to themselves not easily defined rasan canaani a writer artist journalist playright and Politico was one of those people as surely as the Middle East turmoil keeps away the tourist a video from 1970 a news report captures canaani in the city where he made his name in Beirut a new business has developed Revolution Palestinian Revolution he's interviewed by Richard Carlton for Australia's ABC News the bayout leader of the popular front is gasan kopani he was born in Palestine but fled in 1948 as he puts it from Zionist Terror as the English-speaking spokesman of the popular front for the liberation of Palestine the pfp canaani made good TV but it was by no means an easy interview it does seem that the war the Civil War has been quite fruitless it's not a civil war it's a people defending theirself against a fascist government which you are it's a moment of great confidence of clarity of vision of conviction and the way rasan kafani speaks in that clip shows all of this this energy that was the hope of the Palestinian Revolution or the conflict not a conflict it's a Liberation movement fighting for justice well whatever it might be best called not whatever canani picks up on a very important word which for me resonated the strongest and this is the word whatever this is exactly where the problem start this is a people who is discriminated is fighting for his rights this is a story and this is the narrative that Palestinians unfortunately have not been able to relay to the world the Palestinian narrative as narrated by Palestinians is not something that the world wants to hear why not just talk talk to whom talk to the Israeli leaders that's kind of conversation between the sword and the neck you mean said it in simple and clear language how are we supposed to have dialogue you're coming to slaughter me put aside the sword so we can have a conversation they're better that way than dead though maybe to you but to us it's not to us to liberate our country to have dignity to have respect to have our mere human rights is something as essential as life itself in the Arab imagination canaani is remembered for his storytelling which explored the Palestinian experience statelessness separation and Exile in the west he was the public face of the leftist pflp seen as one of the more radical Palestinian factions canaani was not involved in the armed wing of the pflp or in the planning of high-profile airplane hijackings that the group became synonymous with but he was an advocate of armed struggle and understood its mediatic value if it went quiet he wrote no TV network would willingly give any Palestinian a minute of coverage to express themselves above all though canaani was a journalist an accomplished one Rani was multifaceted multi-talented human being he was very significant in the Kuwaiti and Lebanese press in their Heyday we're talking about the 1950s and 60s keni was a central figure I mean he was associated with the founding of many magazines and newspapers throughout the region beut in the 1960s and' 70s was an extremely vibrant City it was a truly Arab City and the Palestinian Revolution was kind of The Last Hope for people and so that's why Arabs from all over went to um Beirut to be part of that that last front for Revolution and creativity and activity and literature and journalism after the defeat of Arab regimes in the war of 1967 and the disillusionment that came with it Palestinians took matters into their own hands a national struggle for Liberation took form and for kenani it marked a shift in thinking to the Revolutionary politics of the pflp in 1969 he was made editor-in chief of alhed the group's newly formed Weekly Magazine alhed was revolutionary in spirit and substance it combined the pp's political messaging with analysis humor art and calligraphy in a Chronicle of the Palestinian resistance that linked it to anti-colonial struggles in Africa Asia and Latin America he made left-wing media accessible well beyond the narrow confines of the already converted he went after arguments by fellow Arab journalists as much as he went after arguments by Western journalists because article where an unusual combination of satire sharp witticism as well as uh information I mean can you imagine Soviet communist literature using humor and irony at that time there was none of that and Arab Communists were even more d uh more humorless than the Soviet Union so you can imagine when comes with this new form of media it was entirely novel Al had an open door policy that made it a hub of cultural and artistic exchange it was there that kenery and his associates produced some of the most iconic posters of the Palestinian Revolution it was was a progressive Magazine with an Engaged International readership but it was the official party organ some would say the mouthpiece of the pflp kill me mouthpiece I don't like the term mouthpiece it's not true neither was it propaganda we were not spreading propaganda we were trying to get the truth to the people that was the slogan of aled it read the truth is always revolutionary which is what lenon wrote these truths were the refugee camps or the truth of the Palestinian situation alhf was open to accept all kinds of new ideas and for this reason I think the importance of literature and journalism and culture from that era is that it was the founding culture canaani left a distinctive imprint on the Arab cultural and media space there is his pioneering fictional writing and then there is this huge body of journalistic work and when you look at the range of his output you get the sense perhaps that he knew his time was limited that he had a Target on his back on the 8th of July 1972 canaani and his niece were killed in a car bomb outside his home he was 36 it was among the first in a series of Israeli assassinations targeting Palestinian leaders and cultural figures in its hitory of canery lebanon's Daily Star said he was a Commando who never fired a gun whose weapon was a ballpoint pen and his Arena newspaper Pages Israel decided to go after all facets of the Palestinian national movement whether they were writers journalists combatants they made no distinction whatsoever they wanted to extinguish the flame of the Palestinian national movement in all its forms canani has gone through two lives there was the life that he actually lived on this planet and there was a second life that he has been living after his death especially in the last 20 years his iconic image is almost everywhere there's so many Facebook pages dedicated to him Instagram Pages resistance for him was something that was not necessarily just in action the heart of resistance could be in the written word and this voice of Hope and aspiration and Clarity and conviction we don't have anymore and that's why this resonates so strongly with us today rasan canaani a Palestinian journalist who paid for his refusal to be intimidated into Silence with his life over the past three weeks dozens more Palestinian reporters and photographers determined to document what is occurring in Gaza have paid that same price here at the listening post we will continue to tell their stories as well as the larger story in Gaza the one the Israeli authorities have tried to keep the world from hearing and
