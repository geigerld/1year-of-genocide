while the assassinations of key Hamas figures are among the goals of Israel's ground operation Israeli opposition leader y lapid has specified six senior people they are Muhammad Al Di a leader of hamas's military Wing he's been described as Israel's Most Wanted Man many times over the past 30 years there y sinoa the current leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip he spent 22 years in prison in Israel before being released as part of a prisoner Exchange in 2011 isma Haner chairman of hamas's political Bureau Salah Al aruri a deputy chairman of hamas's political Bureau and a founding commander of its military Wing there's Haled Michal a former leader of the organization and Marwan Isa Deputy commander-in-chief of hamas's military Wing Michael Apple takes a look now at what Hamas is and what it stands for the Islamic resistance movement or Hamas was founded in Gaza in early December 19 1987 by Palestinian Imam Sheikh Ahmed Yasin it's an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood an Islamic political group founded in Egypt in the 1920s in the late 1980s Hamas Rose to prominence around the start of the first uising against Israel when demonstrations broke out in jabalia refugee camp it extended its armed struggle to a commitment to ending Israel's occupation of Gaza the West Bank and East Jerusalem Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006 and the following year took control of the Gaza Strip from Fat's Palestinian Authority it seeks to free historic Palestine stretching from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea from Israeli occupation Hamas strongly opposed the mid 1990s Oslo Peace Accords that were negotiated between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel the Accords gave birth to the idea of a two-state solution that was to be implemented over time although hamas's 1988 founding Charter called for Israel's destruction it changed its position in 2017 Hamas launched a new Charter accepting a Palestinian State based on 1967 borders alongside what it calls the Zionist Enterprise in the past it's considered implementing a decades long truce with Israel but never a peace agreement the movement has a military Wing the Kasam brigades as well as a social services division it is this military Wing together with fighters from another faction Palestinian Islamic Jihad that launched the October 7th attack on Israel by land sea and air Mike lappel Al jazer let's speak to ABD Hamed s again he's professor of uh political science Middle East studies at rutkus University joins us here uh so first up Hamas if Israel successfully targets the military wing of Hamas to what extent could they regroup after that do you think I mean it's hard to tell now can they really decapitate all the leadership uh all the military leadership I truly doubt it's not that kind of uh similar to the armies where you have a well defined leadership I mean they are spread out in the whole Gaza Strip they have some of them are outside Gaza and the West Bank some of them are in Janine area some of them even outside Palestine Al together those who coordinate with uh like Hezbollah or with Iran they have some connection so they have this kind of uh leadership that is more of uh spread out is not in one place so they might hurt uh Hamas and in some part in Gaza but they've been expecting that and they've been building their infrastructure for so many years especially after 2014 attacks which lasted for 50 days and they were able to come out of it and rebuild and re and improve their technical uh capabilities and improve their uh connection and finance and all these things so they've been building themselves for the last uh decade knowing that this will happen and it will happen again since they are corner and they have no Escape there is no way out they try to reach out to through the Egyptian to rebuild Gaza and to have some kind of uh peace in fact they change also their political doctr in 2017 here in Qatar MH in uh uh in in May 1st first they issued a new statement departing from the old uh program which calls for the complete liberation of Palestine they they moved a little bit to the center however I mean whatever they say they don't take it seriously on the other side they think it's a a very uh right radical group it that needs to be eliminated right now its Fighters are in in the teeth of this battle with the Israeli Army and of course they have more than 200 captive taken prisoner from October the 7th within Gaza and they're playing a bigger and bigger role and we're getting more news now in fact that the Israeli Army says that a female Soldier uh prisoner has been freed from Gaza we don't know anything more than that what's happened if if it's Israeli forces who freed her or or she's been released um there is further news here but as while we digest that as I say what happens with the captives is instrumental in how everything is going to pan out yeah remember you just asked me a little before and I expected that there will be some movement on the uh captives and that proves it so there is ongoing diplomatic relations diplomatic uh efforts and mediation to release more of uh Israeli captives I think it will continue they want to improve their image and by letting three uh Israeli women speak also they want to say look they are here we keep them safe and they should go back home put more pressure on the prime minister of course I just just one thing that what I it's not entirely clear what's happened here it's saying that that this female Soldier Colonel URI madish was released during a ground operation uh after she was kidnapped by her masseters but I I'm not it's not clear whether or not she was sort of willingly released or she was freed so we need to know that we need to establish that more but nonetheless it's all all part of and as you say this whole issue applying pressure on the Israeli I think so and and it's a public opinion now and the Israelis are very keen to the public opinion especially when they have their children women and have having their children in captivity so they they make a difference and they put some newspaper like support them and there is there is a growing pressure on the prime minister to uh first to Halt the ground uh attack because that might hurt the captives and also to find some common ground with the Palestinians to release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages I suppose it's key for the soldiers going in for the Israeli soldiers going in in this ground Invasion to establish where all these prisoners are being kept and presumably they're dotted around the place but they will have perhaps elicited information from prisoners they've taken captive since The Invasion began to try and figure out where everybody is and to to boost whatever intelligence they have anywh they might get some but I don't think they will get all right because look Gil spent almost seven years in captivity and the Israelis uh launched many campaign to try to locate him and get him out and they failed they they the same thing with hisbah they kept two two bodies in for fact for number of years and they couldn't so they know how to conceive these things and hide and hide their information okay we'll leave it there for the moment more to discuss as night goes on but thanks very much meantime ABD Hamid thank you
