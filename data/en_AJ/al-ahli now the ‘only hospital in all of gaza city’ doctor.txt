for joining us now live live is Dr gasan Abu he's a Plastics and reconstructive surgeon at Al Ali Hospital in Gaza thanks very much for taking the time to speak to us uh if you can first of all tell us the situation there at Al Ali hospital so ever since the collapse of shifa hospital we have become a functioning Hospital in Gaza City uh if you recall this is the hospital that was targeted initially by the Israelis at the beginning of the war and so parts of the hospital were damaged and we uh um when we after the collapse of shifa we turned it uh at least the for court and the grounds of the hospital into a field hospital we now have over 500 wounded there's only three surgeons here and two operating rooms with two anst we've today been joined by an obstetrician who's trying to also provide the only uh obstetric Serv service in Gaza uh um and he's been able to perform some of the cesarian section um and uh but we are short on supplies we've been having to perform excruciatingly painful procedures on wounds of the patients to stop them becoming infected with no analgesia or anesthetic because we have such limited supplies and we're keeping them for the most life-saving surgery most of the Wounded are being bandaged and and just admitted into the for court of the hospital uh um and and those who need life saving surgery go into the operating rooms but we're extremely limited and now we're the only Hospital in the whole of the Gaza City it sounds like an absolutely horrific horrendous situation trying to do operations without anesthesia how as a medical staff do you cope with that it's awful I mean you when you especially do it with with children and and you you feel the the the um the pain that is being inflicted but at the same time these wounds have to be cleaned otherwise these they become septic and they become life-threatening on the patient and so you can wait one day you can wait a couple of days but at the end of the day with the fames you end up having to do these things because you have to just buy time 90% of what I do now is buying time for these patients until something happens some some miracle some breakthrough some ceasefire or humanitarian Corridor or anything to these patients to get the medical help that they need the W says hospitals across Gaza City have closed they've stopped operations because they have run out of fuel what is the fuel situation like at alali hospital so we limit all of the Electric City Supply to the operating rooms to try to preserve our fuel supply um and uh that kind of is keeping us going the minute we stop our operating we switch off the the generator uh there are remnants of uh um solar cells that are that weren't damaged in the initials uh uh missile attack but but we we I mean eventually it'll run out unless something happens I I'm trying to I'm I'm trying to understand what the world is waiting for 7 to 800,000 Palestinians in the northern half of Gaza are without Health Care tens of thousands of wounded are without health care I'm trying to figure out what what at what point does the world believe that it's enough and that it is no longer acceptable in this day and age for this to be done to people and especially as even the bombing continues and new patients uh desperately need help and Care are you seeing a greater influx of people needing your help now that the other hospitals have had to shut down absolutely we've had over 500 patients come in in the last three day M um and so it's just been unrelenting every every half an hour there's a new air rate and then there's a new influx of wounded and how easy or possible not easy how possible is it to evacuate any of your patients it's not possible at all there's I mean we can and machine gun fire going around the hospital all of the time and there are still raids the streets are not safe uh um and and we understand from the ambulance uh uh uh Crews that that deliver the patients that they get fired on regularly we're just looking we were just looking there at some pictures from October when we had the Israeli air strike on the Al Ali hospital that was one of the first times that we saw these medical facilities being targeted by the Israel now of course it is common place with the Israelis saying that hospitals like alifa Al coulds they are hideouts for Hamas that Hamas is operating in and under the hospitals because of tunnels and and that is where their operation commands are coming from is Al Ali Hospital similarly being targeted by Israeli strikes now and by tanks on the ground at the moment we have since the missile attack we've not been targeted but we're really in the middle of a lot of the military activity which kind of isolates us from from our patients but I mean this whole discourse about the hospitals the Israelis now surround have been surrounding shifa hospital for four days and have not come up with it and have actually even changed the whole narrative about the shifa being this great command and Control Center and and nothing has happened I mean this this was just a narrative to to justify the targeting and the systematic destruction of the health system in order to further deepen the humanitarian catastrophe so that the wounded if they survive the first attack die from their wounds and that's what's happening just one more question uh Dr gasan abua the the medical staff working in these hospitals I want to understand how you're managing to cope are you sleeping in the hospitals how much sleep are you getting are you able to get food are you able to get water what is the situation like for you so I we literally sleep in the operating rooms where we work during the day we have one of the operating rooms that we put our mattresses in and we sleep there uh uh food is being brought To Us by the ambulance services um we are uh uh um I mean you keep going because of the number of the sheer number of patients and wounded and the fact that you cannot turn your back on them and and say I've had enough or I cannot cope anymore and that's what keeps you going that just sheer momentum of of of moving forward and just hoping and praying that something will change Dr gasan Abu CA joining us there from Al Ali Hospital in Gaza City thank you very much for taking the time to explain the horrific situation there in the hospitals
