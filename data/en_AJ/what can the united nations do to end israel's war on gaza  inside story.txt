what can the United Nations do to end Israel's war on Gaza the UN Chief has pointed to clear violations of international humanitarian law Israel and its supporters refuse any talk of a ceasefire so does diplomacy stand a chance in Gaza this is inside stor [Music] hello welcome to the program I'm Bernard Smith diplomatic attempts to end Israel's war on Gaza have so far failed calls for a ceasefire an end to Israel's bombardment of Palestinian homes or for Hamas to release all its captives have gone unanswered on Tuesday the UN Security Council held an open debate on the conflict in his address Secretary General Antonio guz noted that the hamus attacks of October the 7th did not occur in a vacuum and should be viewed in light of Decades of occupation his comments prompted a furious reaction from Israel and demands for his resignation ultimately though all permanent members of the UN Security Council need to be on board for a binding resolution to be passed and with such deep divisions what role can the UN play in ending the war plenty to discuss with our guests but first this report from sahill even War has rules those were the words of Antonio guz the United Nations Secretary General he was speaking at a security Council open debate on the Middle East most of the discussions focused on Israel's war on Gaza ceras condemned the attacks Hamas carried out in southern Israel on October the 7th but he said he was deeply concerned about clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation they have seen their land steadily divor by settlements and plagued by violence their economy stiffled their people displaced and their homes demolished night Israel responded by calling for his resignation and its foreign minister Eli Cohen canceled a planned meeting with him the SG is blaming the victim you are blaming Israel this is a pure blood liel this is a pure blood liel and I think that the Secretary General must resign Russia China the United Arab Emirates and others called for an end to the conflict something absent from the US draft resolution the key Point here is the need for a swift ceasefire the fact that it was not included in the council draft was a step in the wrong direction and could be interpreted as Council support for Israel's plan to conduct the ground offensive in Gaza the US says humanitarian pauses are needed to allow Aid into Gaza but for Palestinians that's not enough we are here today to Stop The Killing to stop the massacres being committed against the Palestinian people the ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel the occupying power against the Palestinian civilian population under its illegal occupation Must Be Stopped the international after several sessions the UN Security Council has been unable to pass a resolution on the war and with such deep divisions between members it begs the question how much can the UN really achieve saril for insight story let's bring in our guests in Istanbul is Richard folk a visiting professor at isia University and a former un special rapor for the occupied Palestinian territories in Tel Aviv is rapael Jerusalem a former Israeli intelligence officer and security analyst and in Manila is Chris gunnes a former un relief and works agency spokesperson who is speaking today in an independent capacity a warm welcome to you all and Chris I'll I'll start with you how much influence can the UN have when some of its most influential members are not interested in a ceasefire well the answer sadly is very little and when you look at the Israeli reaction to the very reasonable remarks of the UN Secretary General who simply said that there is a context of this fighting that it didn't happen in a vacuum and when you look at the fact that the Israeli foreign Minister immediately canceled a meeting with him and Israel has now said it will refuse to give visas um to Israeli official to un officials including the highest humanitarian in the UN system you have to wonder when sens is going to Prevail you have a situation where diplomatically for making perfectly reasonable remarks the UN Secretary General finds himself rejected by one side and on the ground unra the United Nations relief and works Agency for which I used to work finds itself completely on its knees um it has 600,000 displaced people in its schools all 13,000 of its staff have been withdrawn to the South and um 35 of its staff have been killed and 40 of its installations have been hit so you know unra is the only other massive service provider apart from the Palestinian Authority the Hamas authorities capable of delivering Aid so in the humanitarian sense and in a diplomatic sense the UN finds itself completely marginalized Richard is would you agree with that is the UN powerless to do anything at the moment in in in relation to Gaza uh yes the UN is shown to be helpless in the face of this situation but when must remember that the UN is also important in uh the symbolism of politics and it has had a dramatic effect on the uh peoples of the world and the outrage that has uh that Israel has encountered throughout the world for undertaking this kind of indiscriminate and massive violence accompanied by uh Draconian uh restrictions on the uh importation of food electricity the fuel and water so it is an outrage that in the digital age confronts people everywhere in real time and the UN plays a role and the Secretary General was acting actually uh in full Accord with his responsibility as the highest administrative official in relation to the UN Charter so the Israeli outrage against him is just one more display of repudiation of international Authority all right I mean let me put that then to to Raphael Raphael Antonio gues says the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people it seems a fairly evenhanded thing to say why has that provoked such Fury a furious response Israel well first of all I am in entire agreement with Mr Utes the Secretary General of the United Nations when he said that the assault of the Hamas on Israel was not in a vacuum and uh it's very very very true uh because the vacuum was filled by the incitement from Iran behind the Hamas there is Iran there are the Russians the Chinese a lot of power uh Qatar is involved Qatar is sometimes involved in a humanitarian way but sometimes it supports the Hamas it's a little ambiguous so right right really no vacuum on the contrary the sea is full of of sharks the sea is full of dangerous animals that are pushing and helping the Hamas with Weaponry with money Etc okay okay but why that Furious response from Israel when Antonio gutterz says he wants a humanitarian you wants a humanitarian ceasefire for the innocent people Palestinians in Gaza why Israel is so angry about that uh no we're angry at the the vacuum story more than at the humanitarian ceasefire because the the VAC story in a way is legitimating and justifying Terror and I sincerely hope and it's already being prepared that Mr gz will appear in court International court and he will be judged and possibly condemn normal normally what he said is a six month suspended sentence jail sentence because he has openly and publicly as a public person all right encouraged and uh terrorism but on the other side the ceasefire the humanitarian part I want to say one thing right away okay we the Israeli people have no hatred and no grudge towards the Palestinian people we want Palestinian children women innocent civilians to be safe and we want them out of the combat zone because combat there will be and it will be a violent combat and we point an accusing finger to The Intern community and especially to Egypt and to most Arabic countries Egypt is closing its borders to Palestinian civilians that could be in refugee camps it has now accepted to do refugee camp in the south of Gaza and I'm still waiting to see from Qatar from Saudi Arabia a plane or a private yacht take onean child out of the combat zone Point second rapael thank you I mean Chris there's not much um I mean is the UN Security Council really going to be the best Forum to eventually get a ceasefire when you know a fairly un fairly typical view from Israel is what you're just hearing there rapael the clear answer is no and that's why it should probably go to the general assembly in a uniting for peace type action which is what happens when the Security Council is hamstrung but if I may just reply to what rapael was saying about the secret General's comments if you read what the secret General has said what he is saying is that the context is a the blockade of Gaza which has gone on since 2007 in its most restrictive form to the occupation of Palestinian land which began in 1967 with its Associated settler violence which has increased with this farite settler Coalition um which is headed by which was headed by Mr netan yahu and thirdly Mr guz is referring to the uh dispossession of the Palestinians in 1948 and the wholesale dismantlement of pal Palestinian society which drove 750,000 refugees from their homes they either fled or they were forced to flee their homes and actually those are the three underlying causes of this conflict which need to be addressed if the Israelis are Israeli civilians are to live free from fear and neurosis and anxiety and if the Palestinians are not to be isolated and blockaded and radicalized and brutalized anymore so let's look at what the Secretary General has said and let's look positively on it as a way of addressing the underlying causes this Hamas violence has a cause and contextualizing it is not to justify it trying to explain it um is in no way any attempt to stand by and defend it so let's not just reject what the highest Diplomat in the world is saying and as Richard would put it um Israel must not just FL was just reject the authority of the world Community let's engage Raphael with some of these ideas because that is the way to Future peace for Israelis and for Palestinians and when I look at what the brave people of Southern Israel are saying those people who've had their children kidnapped they're the ones who are saying I don't want a single life to be lost in the name of my kidnapped or my murdered child they are in the the Forefront of the search for peace and people on Rafael's side of the conflict need to listen to what that constituency is saying they are crying out for peace and those are the people the Israelis who are on the border with Gaza who have lost the most all right Rafael I'll come back to you in a moment but Richard first of all because we're trying to focus on the un's uh role here is the security Council going to be the best Forum to get a ceasefire well I don't think it's a feasible Forum because of the uh geopolitical determination of giving Israel unconditional support by the US France and the UK such a situation paralyzes uh the UN Security Council and the organization was created to give this kind of geopolitical power and it's a sad moment when it is appreciated that the worst of international crimes can unfold while the world is watching and the UN is rendered helpless I think the uniting for peace resolution approach via the general assembly is a desirable one and a necessary one but uh I would expect uh Israel to be as arrogant and defiant as it has been toward other aspects effect of un and international legal Authority Raphael there obviously enormous Fury uh amongst Israelis at what Hamas was able to get away with on October the 7th is some of that furing attempt is some of the anger at the UN and attempt to deflect the frustrations that of what hamus was able to get away with uh first of all there is no fury on part of the Israeli people just sadness we are a people of Peace the fury is the Hamas the killing the cruelty is theas we are people of Peace but we have to defend ourselves and if you think that the International Community is not with us you're mistaken and the United Nations if they want to sue us then they will have to sue president macron was of France was here yesterday he renewed his support and his spot of the coalition similar to the Coalition fighting Isis fighting Das so if we do our job and our job is before any ceas fire is to reach one objective which will reach quickly is an annihilate theas destroy the Kamas forever and free Gaza from the Kamas rule but if you want to tell us off uh because of doing this you're going to have to sue the French the British the Free World the Americans because they're all in it with us now when rapael you've been in Israeli intelligence long enough to know that militarily you are never going to be able to wipe out Hamas I mean what is the endgame in G watch us you know how many times we were told that we can't do it in the six day Wars in anbe and we did it just watch us we have a surprise in store but this is military I just want to continue of two points that you mention one is the legitimacy of the Secretary General of the United Nations which he has lost forever by supporting terrorism but I would also accuse some another un institution uh of complic to be an accomplice of terrorism is unra unra in Gaza is cooperating with the terrorist is not protecting the civilians as it should and he's teaching children children Palestinian children hatred and killing the Jews and sacrificing and shahim and Jihad and brainwashing I accuse the United Nations of being an accomplice to terrorism and I will finish by saying only one thing just one thing and I'm finished I promise uh there you talking about the occupation we have evacuated Gaza years and years ago and that's when theas went into the vacuum the vacuum that you're talking about the has filled it and we are not present militarily or any other way in Gaza for years and years and years and and I finish now we have given a lot a lot thousands and thousands of work permits for gazan workers to come and work in Israel for gazan students to go abroad and we have let merchandise go into Gaza more and more so we have been the only real humanitarian and economic help to Gaza is Israel the first donor to Gaza is Israel all right well Chris I'll have to let you come back and that you've spent long enough in Gaza to explain the role of the UN there I'll let you come back yeah yeah can I just work backwards through some of Raphael's completely mendacious tropes first of all this idea that Israel has left as soon as Israel left it imposed a blockade and the idea that it's been generously allowing guest workers into um Israel to work can I say that one of the untold stories of what's happened in the last couple of weeks is the thousands of pales inian guest workers from Gaza who have been incarcerated and locked up we don't know where they are we don't know what's happened them we have some idea but there's a huge untold story there about thousands of workers who were simply doing a job when the war started and they've just been rounded up and locked up the idea that Raphael was saying that the Secretary General is supporting terrorism honestly Raphael people will listen to that and simply laugh at all your other ideas some of which I think are perfectly reasonable to accuse the secret general of being a criminal and of being someone who supports terrorism that simply won't resonate with anyone it's condemnable that you can make these comments about the world's top Diplomat who's working tily along with his superb staff to bring peace to your part of the world as for your comments on unra as unra spokesman for 15 years I dealt with this lie time and time again we had uh people who would film Hamas schools where indeed there were summer camps and other things which were teaching um extremism to to children we investigated every single one of those and we showed that they were all a pack of Lies simly during the Gaza war in 2014 when militants put rockets in our schools when we found them that the schools had been moth B for the summer when we found these rocket components the first people we told pretty much were the Israelis we had no credit for that instead we were told the narrative went out from M regab at the time and others that other Israeli spokespeople that unra was coll collaborating with terrorists in order to send Rockets into Israel all of these anti-un unra troes about unra supporting terrorism have all been fully investigated and their complete lies and a very last point about international support for Israel if you actually listen to the global South the billions of people in the global South for them this is the last anticolonial struggle the last vestiges of the anti-colonial struggles from the 19th century this is the last struggle against white people throwing Brown people off their land and if you look at what's capable what brings people onto the streets today there are three or four issues there's black Liv matter there's the MEO movement there's Global there's climate change and the Palestinians and Rishi sunak and Biden they better listen because they're all under threat from their electorates and the street the people of on the planet are very much standing with the Palestinians in Palestinians in their anticolonial struggle okay uh Richard we'll just talk quickly about what the UN is trying to do now there be going to be another security council meeting while we're uh while this program is on air they want to the US has called for a pause in the fighting and Russia wants a humanitarian ceasefire help us understand what the difference is and what you would like to see I would like to see a cessation of the violence alog together uh and a humanitarian ceasefire is something that is generally understood as a pra allude to political negotiations and Hamas is elected remember that Hamas Hamas is a political actor that has committed terrorist acts in its attack of October 7th but the idea of eradicating a political actor because it has committed an act of terrorism would apply to many governments incl ining that of Israel and is a very dangerous Doctrine and as it's being implemented in the violence that we've witnessed so far it has uh jeopardize the lives of thousands and thousands of innocent Palestinian people including several thousand Palestinian children it it is a great tragedy and catastrophe about which the UN as an organization cannot do anything effective so long as these Western Powers block it from opposing the continuation of this uh Onslaught on the Palestinian people all right Chris there's going to be an after when Israel decides it's done as much as it can in G a what's it going to need the UN for then frankly everything it's going to need the UN in a humanitarian sense and that really puts unra center stage and that means unra has to be properly funded even before this current crisis on the 7th of October unra was over a hundred million short for its regular programs um and it's since issued a flash appeal for over 100 million so yes it will need the UN but it will need onra the world will need unra but unra needs to be properly funded by the world unra is the other huge service provider um apart from the Hamas authorities um unra has Engineers it has health workers it has teachers it has psychosocial supporters in the community it has a broad range of Social Services that is it offers and those are going to have to be be massively ramped up if there's if we're going to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe which frankly we're in the midst of as I said 600,000 people have taken refuge in un schools schools which are designed for a thousand kids during the day and then to be emptied out at night so there's a massive task for anra in just emptying out its schools um but beyond that there's going to be a huge um rebuilding and rehabilitation program again this is the fifth war that unra in Gaza that unra has lived through so unra has experience in doing this on the Diplomatic front it's really difficult to know what the way forward will be um because you've had Israel arrogantly uh condemning the Secretary General completely unjustifiably but again the UN will come to into its Zone because it's going to be the place where all the parties are able together there is to talk together there is no other Forum so you know if the UN didn't exist something like it would have to be invented if unra didn't exist something like it would have to be invented but we have to get away from this idea of Israel and its American Cher is simply being able to reject the UN that is not going to work in the postwar dispensation okay okay uh um uh Richard turkey's president Reb type erdogan says he's saddened by the un's inability to agree to a resolution regarding Gaza he wants reform of the security Council it's not the first time he's called for that but also Brazil's president Lula D Silva says what's happening now in the UN is exposing the weakness of the UN do you do you see those recognize those calls of a need to reform of how the UN operates I I do but I don't think the political conditions will will allow that reform to take place precisely because these Powers don't want to give up their capacity to paralyze the organization if its uh prescriptions go contrary to their strategic interests and this is a shocking example where uh the leading Democratic constitutional governments of the world are overtly endorsing the most uh heus of crimes that unfold day by day in Gaza and have uh committed the worst crimes that have been uh shown to the world in since World War II it's a shocking moment all right and thanks to all our guests to Richard folk and Chris Gunners and to rapael Jerusalem who joined us earlier and thank you too for watching you can
