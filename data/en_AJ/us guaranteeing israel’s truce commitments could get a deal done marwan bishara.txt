political analyst uh you're joining us from uh Paris uh Marwan it's good to it's good to talk to you on this and um there's a there's a big gray area there are a lot of questions around this we have very little certainty and it kind of feels like we've been here before but there's so much movement around this today it it feels like it could be something there could be real movement well I know you being a journalist and we being a News Network clearly you're are not taking uh general gant's advice about just calming down sitting it uh quietly until we hear exactly what is going to transpire out of Cairo because as a news media we try to get ahead of uh ahead of the current as it were and clearly there are a lot of expectations you know one of the things we've learned uh in a long experience in media and Academia is that when there are leaks one has to look who behind the leak and why they are leaking it so those who are leaking all the optimism are certainly leading uh a sort of a strategy by optimism meaning you continue to push towards that there's good news coming the ceasefire is eminent and then if you are the United States and Israel you would say well Hamas is to be at fault for finally you know breaking it word or or or walking back it's what its promises and so on so forth on the other hand if there is really a serious momentum and that's why different countries are sending their technical teams to Cairo because now it's just a question of details and and getting those out of the way in order to finalize the deal then we could be onto something now how and how did we get there if in fact Netanyahu continues to say that he will be attacking uh RAF come what may Deal or No Deal something that is an an atha to Hamas that will never accept and what is of hamas's basic principled if you will demands that Israel would draw its forces eventually from Gaza or uh that the population of Gaza will be able to go back to its homes or uh that uh there will be some serious reconstruction and so on so forth now briefly I would say the following it seems that the ball has moved from Hamas and Israel to Israel and the United States if the United States has given Hamas guarantees on all of these issues that means the clash of the wills is going to be between Biden and Nan forward because if the Biden Administration gives the Palestinians the Egyptians and the cies guarantees that they do guarantee that Israel will do one 12 three then it's going to be up to Washington to make sure that those guarantees are respected and it seems what if you hear earlier in the newsour from the Hamas spokesperson that this could in fact be enough for Hamas yeah it's interesting because Hamas spoke to alaz I'm looking at the clock about five and a half hours ago now right that's the latest update that we got directly from a Hamas representative and they firmly in that interview put the ball in the US's Court cuz they said we want a US guarantee we want no Israeli Invasion intervention of Rafa and we're obviously not going to take Israel's word for it but we would take the US's word for it that puts the US in in in a in an interesting situation I was going to say a bind I don't know if it's the right word it is a bit of an abide in the sense that we know that Netanyahu has been humiliating the bid Administration like there's no tomorrow every time uh uh the American Administration showers the N governments and rewards the Netanyahu governments for its war crimes for breaking its Promises to the United States for refusing American advice the record shows that moving forward probably nyaho will continue on the same path there's no reason why he he should change going on that path especially that he does have at least theoretically speaking or declaratively speaking Coalition partners that continue to threaten to leave his Parliament his Coalition if in fact he signs on a SE so we have a situation that is fluid you know to say the least but at the same time here we I'll add another dimension to all the forces that are at work we've seen more domestic pressure on the Biden Administration especially from the universities and across the cities in the United States we've also seen more pressure domestically in Israel including by the likes of guns and I and c and so on so forth for the na government to clarify what the heck is its position moving for so you could say there there are some serious pressures now and that the war did in some you know horrible ways uh achieve its objectives in the sense of destroying Gaza and incapacity to destroy Hamas and there is a real American fear and a real American objection to the invasion of Rafa same goes for Egypt and Jordan and Saudi Arabia and others so we are stuck now and hence the only way to move the ball forward is something that I did speak about over the past many weeks and months is that as in every negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis it's the United States that steps in and gives guarantees to both sides to make both sides happy and then it is the United States that is responsible for those promises now we know for example from the oso proc Oslo process that started in 1993 the so-call peace process the United States did give the Palestinian a number of guarantees but those guarantees were not respected by the various Bush and and and other administrations right Clint even Clinton administration the settlements increased Jerusalem was basically you know confiscated and and and recognized by the United States as capital of Israel and so on so forth so now Hamas decides like the PLO to place its confidence its trust in the United States that if the United States gives those guarantees that the United States will fulfill uh its promise you know see now yeah as I list to you Maran I'm I'm reminded of the words of Osama hamdan which I actually understand better listening to you when he spoke to us five uh five hours ago he said look we want guarantees from the US but that's necessary but it's not sufficient we also want to see the details of the deal and he stressed that point several several times and I think you just highlighted why uh Maran bishar aljaz senior political editor thank you so much for joining us make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler here
