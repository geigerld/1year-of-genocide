Riyad mansur palestine's ambassador to the United Nations was quick to welcome the icj's additional provisional measures announced Friday and said they must be implemented we uh expect that resolutions of the icj uh to be implemented without hesitation that's mandatory and Israel is as I said party to the convention and the convention is crystal clear on this issue so Israel has to abide by the decisions and the uh demands from the icj one of the icj provisional measures issued by the world's top court is that Israel allow into Gaza United Nation teams to investigate war crimes on Friday when asked about that a un spokesperson said without a ceasefire that's unlikely there is what the court has decided what the court has called for which we've always uh called for Access for investigatory bodies but obviously unless the um the the facts on the ground change uh it is not likely that anyone will be able to travel there soon you seen the icj decision this morning no I didn't at the UN few ambassadors wanted to comment on the icj decision most saying they needed more time to thoroughly read it but Algeria the only Arab State on the security Council made brief comment while speaking at a meeting on the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers in armed conflict that the icg orders are legally binding and that the occupying Israeli power should abide by the order issued today it appears likely in the coming days Algeria will spearhead the effort on a new draft resolution on Rafa demanding that Israel abide by the icj decisions and that could put the United States Israel's main Ally on another collision course with the rest of the council Gabriel zondo Al jazer at the United Nations in New York make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
