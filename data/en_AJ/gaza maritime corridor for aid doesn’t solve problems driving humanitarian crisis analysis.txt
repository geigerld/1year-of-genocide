Scott Paul is the associate director of peace and security with Oxfam America he's joining us from Washington DC thank you very much for your time Mr Paul um we're hearing that the first shipment of Aid to the USB built floating pier in Gaza has departed from Cyprus just how much of a difference do these ships make compared to what can come through land Crossings thanks for having me on and I appreciate hearing the testimonies of people who are in Gaza now and um what you'll hear uh having heard them is of course every pallet every truckload of Aid matters whether it's Food Water Supplies medicine every little bit matters but there's a separate question as to whether uh a mechanism like this is worth uh what it costs uh and worth the amount of political attention and political support that's necessary to get it off the ground when the alternative is that same political pressure could be put on making sure round routes are open which are more scalable safer um able to transport much much more assistance more directly to people in need U so this Maritime Corridor um if it if it transports Aid then great but it doesn't solve the fundamental problems that are driving this humanitarian crisis and I know that it's your job to advocate for all of those things with the US government what are you telling them especially you know as the humanitarian situation in Gaza are worsens by the day what are you saying to the US government and what do they say in response to you well first and foremost what we're telling the US government is that they need to be putting all of their energy and all of their political Capital behind a ceasefire because there is simply no way to meet the immense and burgeoning needs of Palestinians in Gaza under this level of violence and with this level of humanitarian access as as you mentioned at the top of this program people in the north are either experiencing famine or facing famine in a matter of days um what's needed there isn't just dramatically uh increased amounts of food which which is needed but you need broad medical interventions toal with deal with the kind of severe acute malnutrition we're seeing particularly in children and that just can't happen in a place that's under constant bombardment where people aren't allowed to go and where Health Facilities aren't functioning so our our primary message is uh all Aid rots of course focus on the ground routs less so on this Maritime Corridor um but we need a ceasefire in order to do our jobs and you know given just how much is at stake for the 2.3 million people in Gaza how does the US respond to your concerns well the US government now over uh over the past month month and a half is on record supporting a ceasefire they're not clear that they're supporting a permanent ceasefire immediately and I think that's getting caught up a little bit into the details of negotiations between the government of Israel and Hamas um but the main point of tension there um the place that that the US government hasn't been willing to go until late yesterday uh is to really make sure that all of the US's political and Military Leverage is used to push the parties toward a ceas fire and to push the government of Israel to allow all of the uh all of the assistance that people in Gaza so desperately need to to move in um and and uh I guess and most of all uh just seeing what's unfolding to prevent this major ground operation in Rafa from from unfolding which would be so so damaging not just for the people there uh who are living in fear but for people all across the god strip who depend on Rafa for uh and as an a hub for humanitarian assistance um and so what we're hoping to see now is the US government further lean into that posture and really do everything it can to deescalate the fighting increase access to Aid and push for a ceasefire Scott Paul of Oxfam America thank you very much for your time make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
