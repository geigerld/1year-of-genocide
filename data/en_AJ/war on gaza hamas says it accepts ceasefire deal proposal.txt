couple of weeks and days and there are right now everyone including the children are happy about that step because they believe that Rafa Invasion will bring unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe where a blood bath will be but now they are so optimistic and that was completely no longer was afforded in the past couple of days but now with this announcement the situation on the the ground sounds really uh optimistic about this t as they are waiting to hear the announcement as soon as possible T do you think you're able to speak to anybody around you go ahead take your time and and you can

Palestinians but there are completely everyone is is absolutely happy about this they are they are just right now crazy about this step that been taken as the appreciate so much there is a great sense of Happiness right now among those people I'll try within the coming hours to bring more Palestinians to speak about how they evaluate this step on the ground T the area where you are is uh you've been there for a few weeks now you've been pushed South multiple times since the beginning of this conflict is is one of the last areas where you know so many Palestinians have been displaced too and we're hoping it would be safe but as we've reported countless times hasn't been safe and Rafa continues to be struck right now I see people uh running around the streets and I see more people around you than I've seen in I think weeks what does that tell us well uh generally the the vast majority of gaza's population in Rafa are completely experiencing heavy bombardment from Land and Sea as they have been going through really difficult weeks but this announcement right now for Palestinian is a kind of bringing a a sense of relief and Tranquility among Palestinians that they might witness an end for the fighting they are really believing that this ongoing mounting pressure by the American Administration and by Regional mediators can be fruitful to stop the conflict between Hamas and Israel they are so exhausted they have been completely traumatized in the course of the past couple of months and they were all the time asking about the time for the ceasefire right now as the first time ever they have been hearing an official confirmation from Hamas sites regarding the ceasefire agreement they are absolutely optimistic as they believe that this step will definitely uh reduce the Caps of M and this disagreement between Hamas and and it will help to contribute to increase the possibility for approaching to a ceasefire agreement with in the foreseeable future Tara can I can I ask you how you're feeling right now because you're you're reporter yes and you give us the facts as dispassionately and objectively as you can and you've been doing this for months but you're also a

has accepted a ceasefire [Music] proposal well uh well what we do believe is that we have been completely under intense bombardment and uh we have been going through really difficult times including reporters including the crew on the ground those displaced Palestinians who are completely celebrating including children women elderly and every in the Palestinian community that is an opportunity to get a sense of relief and even mitigation about this and in order to know more about this we're are joined right now by a Palestinian man who will speak about how the situation and how this kind of announcement will really represent and means for Palestinians what do you see and what do you think of this announcement by Hamas with regard to accepting the Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire this is

how do you see this announcement by Hamas regarding their agreement and approval for the ceasefire okay first of all thank you Mr T for having me at this interview I want to say that we feel so happy that finally Hamas has agreed about about the ceasefire but now we are waiting for Israeli agreement and we hope that they will say it it's after 212 days of genocides of displacement of Killing Children women and elderly and even nurses and doctors it's not about genocide it's not about it's about time that we have shown the world we have survived after this war after this war it's not just a war by by Israel on Palestinian it's a war from the world to uh against the Palestinian here in Gaza Gaza is so small but yet we have survived 12 to 200 days uh from uh most advanced technical weapons against us we will not forget and we will not forgive everything we have witnessed in this world will written in the history the Palestinian have survived and we will survive until we get our freedom the world is calling for freedom but we don't find any freedom here and do you want to return back to the house that you were displaced from of course if we travel what's uh what's the benefits of our of our defending and surviving there's no warant if we travel if we lift our lands we have survived to to return we have survived so we can call for all freedoms thank you so much for your uh valuable time and that's how Palestinians here children uh young people elderly are really seeing this announcement being made and the approval being made by the Hamas movement side as everyone is really optimistic about the next steps that might be taken within the coming hours regarding the arrival to a ceasefire to a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel that will help to bring an end for the hardships and all kinds of misery Palestinians have been going through T your your previous guest was making a very very important Point uh at this particular point in time Hamas has accepted uh they say that they've accepted this ceasefire proposal by Qatar and by Egypt we need that now to hear from Israel I mean Israel has signaled and its prime minister has signaled multiple times that they were going to invade Rafa come what may Deal or No Deal so you know we need to know we don't have a full picture of what is actually what we're actually looking at and what really is happening right now until we hear from the Israeli side so I I I just wanted to put that out there for you the people you talk to and also for our viewers you know who will be tuning in trying to understand exactly what's going on I want to ask you uh um this T you have lived through multiple Wars with Israel have you ever seen scenes like the ones you are witnessing now well serial personally I've been experiencing multiple words we are talking about 2009 aggression on the Gaza stet 2012 including 2014 which was really bloody for me and 2021 escalations in 2022 and right now 20 23 which from my own side is considered to be the bloodiest I've lost my house I've lost my entire city that has completely turned into a bile of raol we have been talking about being internally displaced for multiple times from a city to another in order to guarantee the full safety of my on my personal level and also on my family uh uh level we have been talking about that we have been unfolded with different kinds of attacks from Land and Sea as we have been lucky to survive till this very moment as the gaza's STP has been under wide military offensive since October the 7th now uh we personally have been doing our p in order to take all the safety precautions but this war sounds completely different in terms of the unprecedented scale of Destruction being caused on the entire Gaza Strip alongside to the point that the number of death uh TOS across the Gaza Strip is so incredibly High we're talking about more than 34,000 500 Palestinians being killed till now with more than 70,000 Palestinians have been injured and that did not happen in any kind of a previous rounds of escalation and conflict between Hamas and Israel but for the vast majority of Palestinians there are peace Seekers who are looking to live peacefully in tranquil atmosphere as the vast majority of us right now have been exhausted from the deadly consequences of this round of fighting that till now there is no any end in sight for written now with the positive response from Hamas side we have been having more clear picture about the initiative being taken from the Palestinian side but the vast majority of Palestinians are waiting for further confirmation from the Israeli side in order to get to a concrete base of agreement between Hamas and Israel just to bring an end of the hostilities and to make a full sensation of all military acts that bring nothing to the ground but only destruction so T I listened to what you said you said you've been through five Wars with Israel my question was have you ever seen at the at the end of a war and again we I don't know if that's what we're looking at right now but have you ever seen at any point during those Wars or after those Wars or as they ended have you ever seen the scenes like the ones we're witnessing now yes certainly I clearly remember every single time that there was an announcement for the end of the world we've been talking about multiple announcement being made under the same circumstances throughout Regional mediations that are completely has been playing a very contributing role to end an end to bring an end for the fighting we every single time we see similar scenes as what Palestinians right now are doing celebrations chanting for Freedom chanting for beast and that's absolutely bring us back in memory to the days that had witnessed a proper end for the fighting a proper end for the tragic stories and even a tragic moments Palestinians have been going through and that I absolutely believe that it we might witness such similar kinds of moments and announcement within the coming days if Israel was so serious about bringing uh a pce uh bringing a deal to the table and accept the mediators I'm watching the I'm watching people behind you where are they going now they are just uh going to their relatives informing them that Hamas has agreed on the proposal they are trying to uh let's say to spread the news among their members of the community and right now they are chanting saying that it's time of return they are trying to celebrate you don't know that people here have been living in mchf shelters which have been under wide military bombardment the vast majority have lost their family uh relatives their beloved ones their friends their even uh loved close people to their heart spot they despite of that all kinds of loss that they have been going through they are happy again when they firstly hear the announcement by Hamas side regarding the approval it means that those people only what do they think about is an end for the fighting and that's absolutely a part of who they really are a part of their own identity that they are only looking for Peace On The Ground they have been living peacefully sadly the were rupted more attacks on the ground being internally displaced and ending up right now with Rafa which has been designated by the military that it's going to be a safe Zone and now with the first step being taken by the Israeli side to invade RAF people has reached to unpreceded level of dispear and even frustration but now this announcement has really recalled and refueled the spirit of optimism among Palestinians who are really looking forward to hear a proper announcement of the ceasefire within the coming hours all right T thank you so much you've been walking us through the last 20 minutes of reactions these spontaneous manifestations of joy and Elation that we're seeing really across the Gaza strippet scenes we're seeing the people walk behind you you're in Rafa of course uh we saw the scenes at the alaa hospital if yous are watching that big the the the biggest window on your screen we saw the alaa hospital that's in central Gaza in derl Bala uh uh
