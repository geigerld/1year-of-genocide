and right on Q we can go live to the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Rio US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is speaking now threat to humanity and that's climate change and our countries have been leaders on that of course the the rainforest the Amazon is one of the world's greatest natural resources when it comes to actually effectively dealing uh with climate change carbon emissions um president Lula put it this way when he was at the White House with President Biden to take care of the Amazon rainforest today is to take care of the planet Earth and to take care of the planet Earth is to take care of our own Survival I don't think anyone could put it any better so the United States uh is working side by side with Brazil to support its efforts to preserve the rainforest uh to combat deforestation uh we're putting resources into that we're engaged with many other countries around the world to encourage them uh to participate and with usaid and other organizations in the US government we're working in very practical concrete ways to help uh with uh support the management and preservation of the rainforest uh in 2025 Brazil will head up the cop cop 30 in BM this is a very important opportunity to advance progress on the many different ways in which all of us are dealing with climate change and we applaud Brazil's leadership another area where Brazil is leading and the United States has partnered with Brazil is on dealing with the challenge of food insecurity and Global hunger here uh I'm proud of the fact that the United States has invested billions of dollars over the last few years both to deal with emergency situations that we faced the world has faced as a result of climate change covid and conflict including Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2021 the United States has invested 17.5 billion dollars in trying to uh support food security for people around the world um but it's not only the emergency assistance that counts and I discussed this with with President Lula it's the work we are doing doing to invest in productive capacity around the world for countries from Africa to Latin America uh to well beyond uh that is the answer to the uh the challenge of food insecurity we have many initiatives underway that are doing just that um adapting our agricultural systems our food production systems with Brazil we have a partnership um to bring artificial intelligence and other Technologies to improve the soil in countries and one of the things that we found and is at the heart of one of our own major new initiatives vax our vision for adapted uh crops and soil is when you have um resilient and nutritious seeds resilient to climate change and Other Extreme uh weather patterns when you have strong soil anything is possible and this initiative with Brazil is working to do uh just that um and that means that what we then put into the ground on top of the the seeds and soil like fertilizer will be much more effective so we're working to develop crops that use nutrients more more efficiently more effectively lowering costs lowering dependencies and at the same time lowering uh emissions it's joined with climate change so another powerful example of where our two countries are working together in common purpose and then of course President Biden president Lula are joined profoundly by their commment to protecting worker rights to defending and strengthening labor around the world I think both presidents see it the same way uh workers labor at the heart of our successes as countries uh we are both building economies uh from the bottom up and the middle out um here again the partnership for workers rights that the two presidents signed stopping worker exploitation focusing on forced labor on child labor promoting rights around the world here again our countries are joined and we have a joint action plan as well to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination and propon equality Equitable access to education to health care to Justice particularly for people of Africa and and Indigenous origin uh I mention all of this because it was really at the heart of the conversation that I had with President ly yesterday and aspects are also at the heart of the G20 agenda which Brazil is leading and the other main purpose of this visit was to take part in a meeting with the foreign ministers led by foreign minister Vera to prepare the agenda for the leaders when they have the meeting of the uh G20 leadership toward the the end of this year here again Brazil and the United States are working very closely together as partners and it's the United States purpose in this to support and make a success of Brazil's presidency of the G20 um in all the areas of focus that Brazil has set forward uh whether again it comes to uh advancing the rights of workers and laborers whether it comes to dealing with climate change food security uh whether it comes to reforming the institution ions that um shape how countries interact around the world uh we are working hand inand with Brazil on that now the scope the scale of some of these Global challenges is immense and I know that there are times when it feels like those challenges are outpacing our Collective capacity to tackle them but I think what the G20 can demonstrate it's demonstrated in the past and I believe it will demonstrate in the future is that no we actually do have the capacity when we're working together to effectively meet the moment to meet the challenges we're facing to actually address the needs of the people that we represent the United States for its part is working to do that and we had some discussion of these issues in the context of the G20 on Ukraine there is a strong palpable desire among virtually all of the G20 for the Russian aggression to end and for peace to Prevail in a way that upholds the rights of ukrainians to their freedom to their future future to the territorial Integrity of their country and was very clear in the meetings that uh that we had over the last two days the conflict in in Gaza between Israel and Hamas we're focused intensely on trying to get an agreement that results in the release of the remaining hostages and that produces an extended humanitarian ceasefire uh and again those were goals that I think virtually everyone in the G20 shares Haiti an area uh that is close to home and close to the hearts of Americans and Brazilians alike uh we see a situation that continues to deteriorate particularly when it comes to the profound insecurity as a result of uh gangs that um are running rampant not only in PTO prance but increasingly Beyond we see a a state that's on the verge of becoming a failed State and the result is that people are suffering tremendously not only from the violence including sexual violence uh but just from the inability to get the basic necessities of life uh today we had a meeting that involved uh a number of countries all of whom will be contributing to the uh mission to help provide renewed security for Haiti that was endorsed by the United Nations uh last fall and that we're now making uh making real we have a commitment from Kenya to lead this effort uh in support of the Haitian National Police and today we had a as I said a meeting with uh well more than a dozen countries each of whom is contributing or plans to contribute significantly to this Mission with personnel with equipment with training and with Financial Resources uh and I think today we had uh at least uh another $120 million committed uh to that effort uh we're working together to deal with irregular migration a challenge that um countries around the world are facing in this moment this is simply put uh a challenge of historic proportions we see more people on the Move now around the planet not only in our own hemisphere but around the planet more people than ever before since we've been
