away from that report to take you live to pulia in the G7 Summit in southern Italy as you can see Joe Biden US President Vladimir zi president of Ukraine taking the podium there they are poised to sign a deal intended to commit the US to a decade of military support and they are as you can see before they speak signing that agreement as I said A Move That Could pressure According to some rival Donald Trump if he takes the White House the deal wouldn't have the strength of a treaty but we understand would signal a commitment it comes off the back of course of another deal emerging from the G7 meetings an agreement to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan amid its territorial Los losses to Russian forces that money coming from interest on $300 million in seized Russian assets much of it in European Banks let's listen in to the US president speaking first last year at the NATO Summit Lithuania United States brought together every member of the G7 to sign a joint Declaration of support for Ukraine 25 additional countries joined us quickly each agreed to forge the long-term bilateral commitments with Ukraine president zalinsky and I have just now signed that agreement between the United States and Ukraine our goal is to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term a lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in in the future it's going to help ensure Ukraine can do both not by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine but by providing weapons and ammunition expanding intelligence sharing continuing to train Brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States enhancing interoperability between our militaries and line with NATO's standards investing in Ukraine's defense industrial base so in time in time they can supply their own weapons and Munitions working with Ukraine's Partners to build a future force that is strong sustainable and resilient and supporting Ukraine's economic recovery as well as his energy recovery after Russia's repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy grid with massive attacks and the feudal attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people all these lines of efforts and others are laid out in this agreement Additionally the G7 achieved a significant outcome this week on the matter of Russia's frozen assets in Europe and other places outside of outside of Russia back in 2022 two days after Russia's Invasion members of the G7 and the European Union worked together to freeze $280 billion in Russian Central Bank funds outside of Russia I'm very very pleased to share that this week this week the G7 signed a plan to finalize and unlock $50 billion from the proceeds of those frozen assets to put that money to work for Ukraine another reminder to Putin we're not backing down in fact we're standing together against this illegal aggression the agreement that President Linsky and I just signed also lays out our shared vision for a just peace a peace rooted in the UN Charter and the principles of sovereign and territorial Integrity a peace with a broad base of support around the world that holds Russia accountable for the damage that is done in this war we will see this Vision strongly affirmed at the historic peace conference happening in Switzerland this weekend with vice president Harris will represent the United States finally this agreement accelerates Ukraine's integration into the European Atlantic transatlantic communities it includes major commitments from Ukraine to impact excuse me to implement Democratic economic and security reforms in line with the European Union's accession goal and NATO's programs of Reform while we take this step the United States is also intensifying pressure on Russia yesterday the US Treasury Department made clear any Bank anywhere in the world that deals with sanctioned Russian Banks companies or individuals risk being sanctions themselves and we announced roughly 300 new sanctions on individuals and companies that are helping Russia with war up they include key parts of Russia's financial sector I wait till it goes over individual and entities that Supply Russia with item critical to its defense production like microecon like micro elonics machine tools and IND materials we also we also sanction more Russian Future Energy projects that Russia's natural gas oil projects that are under construction and are not yet fully operated Putin is counting on revenues from these projects our sanctions will disrupt those plans Plus at the G7 we discussed our shared concern about countries like China where supplying Russia with materials they need for their War Machine and we agreed to taking Collective action to push back against that activity let me close with this we've taken three major steps at the G7 that collectively show Putin we cannot he cannot wait us out he cannot divide us and we'll be with Ukraine until they Prevail in this war first is the bilateral security agreement just signed second historic agreement to provide $50 billion in value from Russian Sovereign assets to Ukraine and third an agreement to ensure our sanctions efforts disrupt third countries that that are supplying Russia's War efforts that will increase pressure on the Russian economy collectively this is a powerful set of actions and will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine success two and a half years ago Putin Unleashed a brutal war on Ukraine and been a horrifying a deal for the Ukrainian people are so brave and incredible it also been a test for the world would we stand with Ukraine would we stand for sovereignty freedom and against tyranny the United States the G7 and countries around the world world have consistently answered the question by saying yes we will we will say it again Yes again and again and again we're going to stand with Ukraine and thank you and I now yield to my friend from Ukraine president thank you so much Mr President Biden dear president dear journalists dear ukrainians dear Americans and thank you so much thanks Italy and Georgia to for an invitation uh uh dear friends today is a truly historic day and we have signed the strongest agreement between Ukraine and us since our independence and this is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life this is an agreement on coroporation and thus on how our Nations will become stronger this is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace and therefore it benefits everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real real Global threat I thank you very much Mr President for your leadership which is reflected in particular in this agreement and in your years of support for Ukraine I think our teams both teams thanks very much for making sure that the details of the agreement are really good and of course I want to thank every every Ukrainian Soldier all our people whose courage made this level of alliance between Ukraine and the United States possible and I am proud of our people and what Ukraine can do and I'm very grateful to all Americans to everyone in America who strengthens American leadership so under the points of the agreement first the agreement contains a very detailed legally binding part and this means The credibility of America's support for our Ukrainian Independence secondly security commitments from the United States are based among other things on the sustainability of of security and defense support not only for the duration of this war but also also for the period of Peace after the war and we will definitely ensure peace third it clearly states that America supports Ukraine's efforts to win this war fourth the agreement has good provisions on weapons for our defense where specifically on the Patriot systems were specifically on the supply of fighter squadrons to Ukraine that's right plural squadrons including but not limited to f16s we have worked for a long time for these the agreement is also very specific about the supply of the necessary weapons dur and production and strengthening of the defense industries of our countries through our cooperation and this is something that will not only provide security but also new good jobs for ukrainians and Americans the agreement also outlines what is needed in terms of intelligence information the agreement contains key aspects of protecting the lives of our people fifth it is very important that the agreement also addresses the issue of Russia's just responsibility for this war and its attempts to destroy ukrainians America supports both Fair compensation for the damage caused by Russian strikes and working out ways to ensure that Frozen Russian assets are used to protect and rebuild Ukraine the agreement also includes sanctions and Export controls that will make Russia fa the pain for what it is doing again the freedom of peoples and two more things I'm grateful that the philosophy of our security agreement is in fact the philosophy of the alliance and that is why the issue of nat is covered through the text of the agreement it states that America supports Ukraine's future future membership in NATO and recognizes that our security agreement is a bridge to Ukraine's me membership in NATO it is very important for all ukrainians and for all Europeans to know that there will be no security deficit in Europe which tempts the agressor to war and makes the future uncertain now we are clearly defining everything we will cooperate cooperate for the sake of Victory make peace guarantees effective and provide the necessary security for our people and thank you Mr President for your leadership in the g7's decision on 50 billion loan for Ukraine it's vital step forward and providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war Russian IM mobilis assets should be used for defending lives of Ukraine from Russian Terror and for repaying the damage aggressor caus to Ukraine it's fear and absolutely right Mr President thank you your team I would also like to thank the United States Congress for their support both parties both Chambers thank you and thanks to every American Heart that does not betray freedom and supports us Slava Ukraine now what we'll do is we going to take uh two questions from American reporters and two question each from two American reporters and a question each from two Ukrainian suppor reporters the first first person I'm to call on is Colleen long and the Associated Press thank you thanks Mr President um about two weeks ago you changed course to allow Ukraine to fire Us weapons into Russia given the reported successes would you consider further expanding the parameters on us weapons into Russia even despite your concerns about escalation and on the news from home um you're going through something that so many American families go through uh the intersection of addiction in the criminal justice system um but you're not like most families was your son able to get a fair trial do you believe the justice department operated independently of politics um and for president let me answer your question and you ask his question okay with regard to the first question it is clear that the near abroad meaning just across the the line of the the border with Russia and Ukraine that it makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to be able to take out or combat what is coming across that border in terms of long long range weapons longer range weapons into the interior of Russia we have not changed our position on that sort with regard to the question regarding the family I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter he has overcome an addiction he is he's one of the brightest most decent men I know and I am satisfied that I'm not going to do anything I said I said I abide by the jury decision I will do that and I will not pardon him um president zinski uh a number of leaders here in Italy including President Biden are facing upcoming election challenges how will the security agreement signed tonight and the other Promises of support continue if they are not an office and what's your contingency plan if they don't if I can k in Ukrainian language yes thank you so much uh the people of of the Nations first and foremost to the United States to the countries in Europe and other on other continents who have supported us since the very beginning of of the beginning of this absolutely unjust war of Russia against the people of Ukraine that and that is it they they've been killing people that homes and territory all that is very important it is part of but first and foremost we're speaking about people and lives of people you understand and this war was unjust since the very beginning the war of this evil whose name is Putin the war against the people of Ukraine and he has killed so many people to to say that it is not him it there was a military man who did it the last one is just an instrument of his and he's playing this in strument and therefore it is important for us that since the very beginning we were supported by people by Nations because they understood that we share common values we simply want to live and the people understood they imagined what will happen if such evil attacks them and therefore we were supported by people and I thank President Biden and other leaders who since the very beginning of the invasion Putin's Invasion started to support us they based on their values they they were based on the voice of of their people and it is impossible without people and I am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents and it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses first and foremost it seems to me that everything depends on the unity Within this or that state and if the people are with us any leader will be with us in this struggle for Freedom want to call on a Ukrainian reporter yeah yeah yeah was pleasure thanks so much T yes please interv channel for both leaders so today during the G7 meeting the discussion focused on developing Ukraine's air defense system based on the most advanced Western complexes and also on enhacing long range capabilities so my question is can you provide any details on the initiative and about the Readiness of our allies to take part in it thank you I'd be happy to respond to that we have acquired commitment from five countries so far for Patriot batteries and other air defense systems as well as we've let it be known to those countries that are expecting from US Air Defense systems in the future that they're going to have to wait everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met and then we'll make good on the commitments we made to other countries I think President Biden already answered to your question really uh he knows uh and uh all other partners they know that urgently we need seven Pate systems he has to if our cities not all of them it's a Pity but urgently seven and we discuss the possibility of having five of them it's true but the partners work on it it doesn't mean that tomorrow we will have these five systems but we see in the closest Future Good result for Ukraine you'll have some relatively quickly uh American reporter Josh wiro Bloomberg thank you Mr President I have a question for Mr President zalinsky shortly on the announcements but uh if you don't mind I'd like to ask you about your discussions on the situation in Gaza here at the summit you were asked just a short time ago about it after the uh skydiving demonstration can you give us your assessment of hamas's response and do you believe that they are trying to work towards a deal or is this response working against a deal and what is your message to allies including those here at the G7 about what more if anything the US can do to drive towards uh a peace agreement thank you I wish you guys would a little play by the by the rules a little bit I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine you ask me another subject I I'll be happy to answer it in detail later but the bottom line is that we've made an agreement I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed by the UN Security Council by the G7 by the Israelis and the the biggest hangup so far is Hamas refusing to sign on even though they have submitted something similar whether it not it comes to fruition remains to be seen we're going to continue to push I don't have a final answer for you uh and to President Biden's point a question about today's uh uh discussions uh president zilinski the $50 billion today you've had the supplemental of course from the US con Congress recently can you give us an assessment of the situation on the battlefield right now and what has been given now how long will this get you uh in terms of either stopping the Russian advance or making Headway uh on this and how long will it last you if indeed Future Leaders or current leaders are unable to reach consensus on further Aid packages and President Biden I'd welcome your assessment of the situation C ly on the battlefield what difference the supplemental has made as well sir thank you thank you for your question indeed we we were expecting the fundamental package of the support within the Congress of the United States of America and truly it it was a long pause for our Warriors first and foremost but it is important that we grateful that in the very end we have this supplement and this will for sure strengthen our Warriors yes this this has given the opportunity to the enemy with within this PA to try to occupy Hari but that attempt was stopped by our Warriors they were repelled the enemy was repelled and we despite everything disrupted all their plans and it seems to me that that is the most important thing uh what this uh supplement that will arrive gives us it enables us to fully equip the reserves those guys those brigades that are ready so so that they provide for for the opportunity to rotate our units on the battlefield so that they can have some rest so that the brigades can regenerate so that other brigades enter the battlefield instead of them with equipment this is what the supplement gives them so the raise of morale but also the raise of strength of our brigades and it seems to me that this is the most important for how long this will this will be enough look we without package have been holding the lines for eight months and the Russians had no successes and therefore the the question on on for for how long it will be enough no I think the question has to be for how long the unity will last the unity in the United States together with the European leaders how these or those elections will influence this Unity it seems to me that we should look on this exactly this way to preserve Unity to preserve the Integrity of the world Integrity of the democratic world because if Ukraine does not withand the Democracy of many countries will not be able to withstand and I'm sure of that by the way the idea that we had to wait till we pass the legislation overall even held up by a small majority of our Republican colleagues was just terrible and uh there's a lot more money coming Beyond what's already come in the other Tres that are available now that we've passed the legislation so they'll have what they need and get it there as quickly as we possibly can thank you so much Mr President Telegraph buas Telegraph please good evening my name is zavar of telegraph UA thank you for this opportunity I have a long way from GIF and have enough time to prepare such long question uh firstly to Joe Biden Mr President the additional Ukraine supplemental Appropriations act that you signed mandated the submission of strategy War uh for the UK for the war in Ukraine within 45 days after it enactment this deadline passed on June 8th and uh now yet uh the International Community has not seen this strategy has it been developed and if the strategy is classified what step does your Administration plan to take to hust Ukraine victory in the world it's my first question the second will be to the Pres what was the last part of your question uh has it been developed this strategy and uh what steps does your Administration plan to take to Victory Ukraine in the world the steps we're going to take to make sure that has the Ukraine has Victory and that Russia does not Prevail is continued support what we just signed we signed that and significant number of nations have signed it we have convinced the G7 convinced we've got support of the G7 and quite frankly 48 other countries we sat with the prime minister of of Japan South Korea we have 50 Nations who signed up beyond the NATO and the G7 and so we're going to stay as long as it takes with regard to the plan that is a that is a plan and process now we're discussing with our Ukrainian friends exactly what it would be we have a lot of movement toward that we know the outlines of it we have not done the detail of it all but we know what Ukraine is capable of doing when given the material to defend themselves and that's exactly what they're doing now my second question second question is to president Z it will be in Ukraine and recently you have made couple of of sharp statements regarding China and there are Rumors in press regarding the possible supplies of Russia's weapons to China apart from that China is is actively promoting its own peace plan among certain countries what are the motives of Beijing now and would it be possible to change the vision of China regarding our war and which role the US can play in this and the final question is is is is China um a a partner of um of Russia in these uh crimes that it commits that your trip was long uh so the so first of all I had phone conversation with a leader of China by phone he said that he will not sell any weapon to Russia that is the first we'll see with you we'll see but he said to me if he is respectable person he will not because he gave me the word the second our you know that you know very good with details our peace formula it's very open for everybody basing on Charter yes you and and you know that it's it bases on next principles territorial Integrity sovereign nuclear security food security if China has alternative view on it it can prepare alternative peace formula if we share common views on it like with globally with all the world I think so so if they share the same way to piece we will find dialogue by the way China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it so it is in fact helping Russia thank you all so very much appreciate this concludes our press conference thank you everybody [Music] all right it's just past 19 GMT and I'm joined Now by our diplomatic editor who has been watching those scenes in southern Italy as we witnessed President Joe Biden and President Vladimir zalinski sign a landmark deal on us U us Ukraine Security deal James we were watching that press conference there president vmir zalinsky referring to this as one of the most significant deals in Ukrainian history yes he said it was a truly historic day he said it was the most important strongest deal that the US had done with Ukraine since Ukraine's independence of course that was at the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 uh and President Biden making it clear this is part of a package of different measures that the US and the G7 are doing in conjunction with things that are going on with nato in conjunction with things that have been happening in recent weeks and the whole idea is to turn the tide of the war in Ukraine because when G7 leaders met a year ago in hoshima I think they're a lot more hopeful about where things would be now than where they actually are now because Ukraine has not made any of those gains that they are hoping for in fact Ukraine has seemed a little to be on the back foot so let me run through what has been agreed first there's this Security deal bilateral Security deal between the US uh and uh Ukraine which lasts for 10 years so it shows I think an ongoing commitment but the way the US system works uh I think the plan is to make the momentum such that this is Trump proof in case there was a return of President Trump in November but we've just look at something like the Iran nuclear deal in in US foreign policy um things can be overturned by the incoming president and in fact in that case president Trump did exactly that uh we also have what's been agreed by the G7 which is new money for Ukraine for Ukraine's reconstruction this is a $50 billion loan for Ukraine and what they're going to do there is use the Russian assets that were frozen at the beginning of the war 280 um I think billion is what President Biden said we've been saying early in the day um 300 billion but either way they're going to use as collateral for that loan uh the interest that has been earned on that Frozen money and then the last part that President Biden talked about was uh the uh the sanctions uh that have uh been put on Ukraine on Russia and he said that the sanctions are being strengthened but of course you look at the picture in terms of the Russian economy and certainly it's not been devastated the way that the Allies uh the US allies had hoped at the start of this War President zelinsky also talking about new uh Patriot uh and other air defense systems for Ukraine President Biden saying that five countries committed or nearly committed president zinski saying that he needed seven and I think the last important thing on Ukraine um that is is an important change um from both uh the US and its NATO allies is the fact in recent weeks they allowing Ukraine to use uh the weapons they're supplying them with to go into Russian territory to attack Russian uh targets but President Biden was pretty clear on that it was allowed just across the border but not deep into Russia and he said the policy would not change on that but certainly what the um but the the G7 countries and the other NATO allies are hoping is there's going to be some diplomatic momentum now and only now in less than a month we've also got the very big NATO Summit that takes place in Washington DC and James President Biden in his remarks on the sidelines of that uh G7 Summit in Italy made a comment that this is a reminder to President Putin that the US is not backing down was was there any is there any indication um as to how that has been received in Italy in terms of uh from the other G7 leaders yeah we've had comments from the other uh G7 leaders uh Olaf Schultz put out a statement earlier on where he said that President Putin keeps hoping that we're going to give up supporting uh Ukraine we'll stop supporting uh Ukraine uh if he keeps up the pressure he said that the new $50 billion deal the the loan for Ukraine he said uh said that he he's failed uh in in in that uh plan today there was a reporter at that press conference who asked US President Joe Biden about the situation in Gaza this reporter asked whether he sees that Hamas is walking working toward or indeed working against the ceasefire deal can you talk us through how President Biden responded to that question yeah I mean this was very much a Ukraine branded event it was there were signs around the um press conference venue the outdoor venue uh heralding this new Security deal between the US and Ukraine There Were Us Flags there were Ukrainian flags and it was clear that President Biden did not want questions about Gaza on this occasion and he made that clear to the reporter all right that's our diplomatic editor there James Bas oh uh actually we are going to uh give our audience a chance to listen to that sound bite from the US President Joe Biden I believe we have that ready at the moment I wish you guys would a little play by the by the rules a little bit I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine you're asking me another subject I'll be happy to answer it in detail later but the bottom line is that we've made an agree I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed by the UN Security Council by the G7 by the Israelis and the the biggest hangup so far is Hamas refusing to sign on even though they have submitted something similar whether hat out that comes with fruition remains to be seen we're going to continue to push I don't have a final answer for you uh clearly unhappy President Biden having to talk about Gaza but clearly it's also been one of the very big issues here we didn't learn anything new from President Biden worth telling you that diplomats behind the scenes are working on the final wording of the communic the G7 communic while the leaders have their discussions around the table and do their photographs of the press what's known as the family photo where they all stand there uh behind the scenes uh the top diplomats work and finalize the wording of that communic and we think the wording now on Israel Palestine has been basically finalized we hear that they're very concerned about the situation on the Lebanon Northern Israel border of course there are some reports that perhaps Israel when it's finished in Rafa may turn more of its attention to that uh northern border they say they have an unwavering commitment to a two-state solution but I was at the last G7 uh meeting in hoshima a year ago and I have to say there wasn't much mention about um two-state solution at that time and the us at that time was basically going round the Palestinians uh trying to get deals with other Arab countries with Israel uh and they also said and I think this is perhaps the most interesting thing that is likely to be in the final communic they call for Israel to refrain from a full scale offensive in Rafa um that raises some questions for me because if you watch our Channel Al jazer and you watch our reporting from our colleagues in Gaza and you see the really horrendous pictures that have come from Rafa in recent weeks if that's not a fulls scale offensive what is right that's our diplomatic editor there James Bay reporting from Italy James thank you
