the Israeli military says its ground forces are now pushing deeper into Gaza a military spokesman has just given an update on the third night of fighting he says tanks backed by artillery and air strikes have killed dozens of Fighters along northern border areas Hamas is saying that heavy battles are taking place let's go live to Sarah Harret she's joining us from occupied East Jerusalem so tell us s a little bit more about what Israel's military spokesman is saying he's just been speaking in the past half an hour yeah that's right he reconfirmed once again that expansion in Gaza is still underway and that in fact if anything they've added more troops they've added more foot soldiers uh he said that they're ensuring that there's strong backup from the air and sea to protect those foot soldiers especially and the tanks that are going in uh I I would like to to add that yesterday when we saw those massive flashes of light uh in the air on the south it was something that a lot of uh experts and including Israelis and Palestinians had said that they've not seen that kind those kind of tactics before it seems to be quite clear that the Israeli Army is using uh uh new tactics uh new plans on how they will tackle this they know they'll be up against a lot of resistance by Hamas uh Hamas knows that area very well despite the fact that Israel has drones flying over 247 even before this war um but the fact is they know they are up against a a a big fight Israel has been very strong mil militarily from the air of course it receives a lot of aid from the US but this going in as foot soldiers is another thing also to add to that Israelis don't want to lose soldiers they don't want a higher number of casualties especially given that they already had the highest number of casualties in that October 7 attack including soldiers Israeli soldiers that are held captive in Gaza and he did uh uh Danielle hagari the spokesman for the Army did touch on that that they want to minimize the number of deaths we know that one was killed that was confirmed by uh the Israeli Army this morning and there have been injuries from today and yesterday but it's still not clear uh the total number they haven't released those he did also add at the end saying that this is going to be a very slow process and clearly of course there's a lot of damage and destruction if they're going to move in by foot with those tangs on land which is what they're doing already they're going deeper and deeper in certainly from the north um they're going to need to clear all of that to be able to get to those targets they're saying that they are aiming for including those underground tunnels yes those Israeli captives are they'll be foremost in mines won't they as there's growing pressure on the Israeli government secure their release yeah we're seeing a different rhetoric in the kind of uh statements are being made by the Army as well as uh the uh War cabinet including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu what started off in the early days where they were saying that you know we're going to go in unfortunately this is war and we may end up losing some of those uh captives as a result that rhetoric has changed they've been up against it from families that are incredibly angered feeling frustrated emotions are high where they've been demanding answers from their government they want to know what the plan is moving forward and with this ground and sea and air assault they are really hugely concerned that their own members family members relatives uh that are stuck in Gaza could potentially die Hamas has already said 50 those have been killed in those Israeli air strikes and that could continue because it's still not clear to Israel despite it's incredible intelligence that it's known for uh in and what we've seen in the past few years despite all of that it seems that they still don't know uh where those captives are we in the last few days we'd seen uh leaflets that were thrown from the air um to ask Palestinians those that could help them in any way locate them so they're really up against the Israeli military the foreign Ministry says that it's going to be meeting with those uh family members later today to keep them updated and clear C they're trying to reassure uh the public as well that now the captives and getting them out and securing them here uh is incredibly important just one last thing to add to that is that Hamas had said um the day before yesterday that they are willing to immediately release all of those captives civilians and soldiers but only if Israel will agree as well to release all of those Palestinian prisoners now those Palestinian prisoners there are more than six th000 of those in Israeli jails a lot of them are on what they call administrative detention which means that they haven't had trials they've been held for years including miners which does go against international human rights um so a lot of those here if you even throw a stone at a soldier that could land you in jail as a Palestinian as we speak now we're hearing a lot of movement behind us um it's we heard gunshots just a few minutes ago tensions here in occupied East Jerusalem are incredible high as well and I'm not sure if you can hear the sirens perhaps if the cameraman can zoom in you'll see in the distance there um there are Sirens there's a they immediately responded the Israeli uh forces we've we heard a round of several gunshots it's still not clear as to the situation there but there's there's been an a general uh mood here in the occupied territories a somber mood where people are scared scared they're afraid here at Al jazer we spoke to some of those Palestinians that said they were incredibly worried um because of the repercussions because of the tensions because of the situation that's happening in Gaza and on the other side you also have Israelis that are worried um in case that they are made a Target we still don't know what's happening right behind us we did hear those gunshots it's still clearly an unfolding scenario but we may likely start to see more of this happening in the coming days as especially because Palestinians feel that what's happening in Gaza is having an effect the war on Gaza there are many of those that are living here that have relatives there they're really concerned and as many have told us they feel that the International Community has turned their back on them it's been 75 years of occupation and that occupation isn't just militarily it it seeps into everyday life here La okay Sarah many thanks indeed we'll let you go and see if we can get some more information on that situation unfolding there in the occupied East Jerusalem these were shots now that you can see from Gaza and just a moment ago we saw some tanks on the move there in uh Gaza we have been hearing that Israel has expanded its ground operations there you can see the result of some of the air strikes that have been going on for the past 24 days now absolutely devastating entire neighborhoods there in the Gaza Strip there you can see that tank on the move not many pictures coming out of Israel's ground operations in Gaza they're keeping it very much under wrap saying that they of course will not disclose any of their positions but we are hearing more and more uh reports of their operation expanding deeper into the strip especially overnight let's speak to Al's hanni Mahmud he joins us from Kan yunes inside the Gaza Strip that's in the southern parts of G Gaza hary first of all what evidence are you hearing of of Israel expanding its ground operations deeper into the Gaza strep yes well within the past hour or so Israel uh surely began its second phase of the military operation or war on Gaza uh using tanks uh large numbers of tank just moved from uh the southern eastern part of Gaza City area uh making its way and pushing uh their way to uh the western side of Gaza City near uh Nim Junction uh it's a junction that connects the Gaza City and the northern part with the central of Gaza City on the southern part of of of the Gaza Strip uh by doing so uh the Israeli tanks now are are separating uh completely uh Gaza City and the northern part from the southern part of Gaza which will be uh very challenging and very difficult uh for people uh to move particularly those who were asked to evacuate uh at uh at earlier hours of the night and yesterday from from the hospital uh we learned from a source uh that the Israeli ISU a warning that nobody moves from uh Gaza and the from the southern part to Gaza or from Gaza to the southern part at this moment because there is military operations activities uh going on we also learned from our source uh that there are uh tanks also moving uh and from the northern part of Gaza uh making their way pushing uh into uh further uh the the northern part of Gaza City all the way uh to to Gaza City uh what seems to be a a tactic by the Israeli military uh who uh stated a few days ago that a military operation is still uh uh going but they were not sure where uh when it was going to to happen but they mentioned it was going to be a surprise and definitely what's going on now it's a surprise uh uh military uh uh operation ground operation uh happening at at the moment uh communication network still disabled and that's why uh we are unable to get uh most of the updates uh from Gaza and I believe uh Gaza uh residents whoever remained there has been completely cut off from the southern part uh of the Gaza City even uh in terms of phone service or Internet we're not getting a clear picture but eyewitness they still believe that the the the the S the tanks moving uh from Eastern side to the western side of the co G line okay and what are people there feeling about that because they're now being told they can't move out of the Southern areas of Gaza as you just said they can't speak to people in the Northern areas of Gaza are they feeling completely cut off and isolated I I I we I believe this is what is happening now being cut off completely uh from the southern part of Gaza we we we saw lots of worrying relatives here at ner Hospital who who are making uh trying to make phone calls and send text message to family members who remained in Gaza either in a shifa hospital around its vicinity or in different parts of Gaza today but unfortunately without a a response and and that what gives us a sense that uh Gaza City and the northern part has been completely cut off from the rest of the Gaza Strip uh and and it we don't know what is going uh to happen in the next coming hours but there is a a a belief that uh it's going to be in intensified in the coming uh hours as we heard the uh that there is an Israeli declaration uh of a warning of people not to move from uh the central part and the southern part into Gaza now uh what we expect is to a declaration that this area is a military zone in the coming hours uh but we're waiting for the updates of from Gaza City okay all right hany thanks very much well we can speak to safwat akut our correspondent in Gaza he joins us from near Gaza City safwat great to speak to you first of all can you confirm to us these reports that we're hearing that tanks are outside the Gaza City and they're separating it from the southern parts of Gaza when we can we can't confirm that we told them perally but we from where I am I'm like five kilometers away from uh the area that they said the Israeli tanks have been stationing or uh get into uh I can see from where I am now a p of smoke coming up from that area which is called alaka or Nim Junction which was one of one of the expected places by the experts here in Gaza the military experts that in case Israel decided or Israeli tanks decid to get through Gaza this what would be one of the the the point that the tanks will be stationing in in order to divide Gaza uh and the north of the Gaz strip from the rest of the Gaza Strip uh we uh but what we can confirm that the the fighting groups they send a statement and we received a coupy of it that the the severe clashes are taking place now between the fighting groups CES and Islamic Jihad Fighters and the Israeli tanks s into the G the Gaza City so by this statement we can confirm that the there are tanks are who are entering inside Gaza and by the way uh they entered from the eastern part of the Gaza City of the Gaza Strip and according to expect they will go straight and cut the wholeway from east to west and then Dominate and control the two main roads that or the two only roads that link Gaza it's north with the rest of the Gaza Strip which is Salah Road and the coastal road so in case or if the Israelis arrive or reach the coastal line or the coastal Road by this point or by this time they will will completely divide the Gaza the Gaza City and the north of the Gaza Strip with the rest or from the rest of the Gaza Strip so uh still people we are we have been receiving lots of f gold from people who could leave the Gaza City and the North and they are ask if they it's still safe and secure to leave the the North and Gaza City towards the South and to what what ex what uh impact is that actually having or when you talk about dividing up the Gaza Strip people unable to move we're hearing from Hanny that people are unable to even make phone calls to people inside Gaza City that Communications have been cut off there can you confirm that for us as well look from the first day of the war there was a severe lack and severe drop of the the local cellular cellular network and internet but the people here since they got used to these world and these escalations they have created new mechanism and new survival mechanisms many people you can find they put in their pockets like some of the Israeli SIM cards who are very weak in Gaza but it's still working so uh or maybe do some roaming that we did when there were complete cut out a few days ago so there's always a way for the gazans to communicate and to survive since they are living under the sieg for more than 17 years and they have been living living under these difficult circumstances not for the first time or second time so this is this under these circumstances they have town or create a kind of survival mechanism in terms of even of electricity internet uh communication and Telecommunications and other means of course because living under these circumstances by the way you can find every house a battery car battery just to get some charge for your mobile so this mechanism and this means of survival you can find it almost in every neighborhood or in every house okay safat alute thanks very much much for the update we'll keep talking to you uh throughout the coming hours as we hear more about Israel's expanded ground operations into the Gaza Strip
