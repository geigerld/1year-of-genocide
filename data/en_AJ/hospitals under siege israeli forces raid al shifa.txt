well meanwhile there have been a series of new Israeli strikes including in Rafa Khan yunas and on the alala school in the south of Gaza City the strip's largest refugee camp Jalia has also once again been targeted by Israeli air strikes Osama bin Javed has more Allah Allah Allah we're being killed she says Those Who survive don't even have water an overwhelming number of wounded at Gaza now out of service in the hospital being seriously wounded here is a death sentence even the vinegar they use to clean wounds has run out for weeks they've appealed to the world but the only thing incoming is more Israeli bombardment she's 15 and has a severe head injury we were hit by a missile some of my children were killed the survivors are critical communication and details are scaned at gaza's largest alifa hospital after Israeli forces raid on Wednesday in their last appeal Medics said the wounds are getting infected there's little food and water and the Israeli military Siege means no one can go in or out no word on how many babies are still alive since oxygen and electricity are fast running out across Gaza entire neighborhoods are being wiped out more strikes overnight on the densely packed jabalia Camp flattened yet another block the rocket hit the building and killed the people in their sleep this is what Netanyahu does but I'd like to say this to Netanyahu we will not surrender there's no more fuel for rescue teams the roads are destroyed and many Rescuers have also been killed the whole civil defense operations will cease we cannot carry out search and rescue without fuel it will be nothing but a horrifying catastrophe I appeal to the whole world international organizations to put pressure for the delivery of fuel and basic resources those who are lucky enough to reach the southern border with Egypt are stranded as well suffering from severe injuries and burns this child is among thousands who need urgent medical help our home was shelled by Israeli war planes my father mother and all my brothers and sisters were killed even my uncles and cousins were killed in the air strike I am the only one who survived I have been waiting in the ambulance for hours we do not know when the ruer gate will open nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is no place to go where on Earth are the Arab leaders where are the Muslims do any of you accept this to happen to your own child where is the humanity Israeli snipers are targeting young children is this child a militant our blood is not only on the hands of the Israelis but also on those Arab leaders standing and watching in silence a few pieces of stale leftover bread is all that's available at the Indonesian hospital it's already being called one of the world's worst man-made humanitarian [Music] disasters but the sounds coming out of Gaza are very different depending on which side of the bombing posts it on social media as Israel's war on Gaza remains Relentless Usama bin Javid aler well we have correspondence across the region Muhammad Jam jum is in occupied East Jerusalem Forest but first let's speak to yumna Al you're inhan yunes in the southern part of the Gaza Strip we know that those bombardments haven't stopped talk us through what's been targeted most recently well yes Mia as you just mentioned these bombardments haven't uh stopped from uh last night all through the night hours and all through this day the bombardments have been taking place in different areas across the Gaza Strip uh let's start with the Northern parts where homes have been shelled by tanks in the Northern parts of the strip and also the bombardments of the jabalia refugee camp one of the most densely populated areas this camp that has been targeted multiple times before before about eight homes were completely destroyed in the targeting of the jabalia refugee dozens of people were killed and dozens others were injured while dozens have remained under the rubble where civilians have uh suffered to bring them out along with the defense teams that were available other targeting also was a targeting in a Sabra neighborhood in Gaza the city and other targeting uh in going to and another targeting in Gaza also was for alah public school now uh going to the South there was a targeting in ra where seven people were killed another targeting in Al for a residential home where nine people were killed another one a home in a local market in the center of kanun also a number of citizens and dozens others were injured in that targeting and the targeting continue in or across the strip y you're in conun at the moment and we know over the last couple of days lots of leaflets have been dropped in the East asking people to to leave and try to seek known shelters where are people supposed to go and are people actually moving well yes these leaflets have been dropped in the southern part on the Eastern Parts in the southern part they have been dropped on four towns here so we're talking about four major towns in KH units itself and people are expected according to the Israeli Army's orders in these leaflets to move to the Western and Central parts of Kan unit itself which is the southern part now or already the entire southern part I'm talking about kanun and Rapa are completely overpacked over a million and7 700,000 people are in the southern parts now Nastasia without being able to find enough space for the amount of population and the amount of people who have been displaced the people who are still being displaced because of the ongoing bombardments in the south and all these people where are they supposed to go while they're still asked to evacuate from their homes yumna Al there with the latest forest from the ground in conun and the Gaza Strip thank you yumna well let's now get the view from occupied East Jerusalem and speak to Muhammad Jam jum Muhammad we know that supplies have been running low we've just been hearing there from yumna about people being asked to move when there's actually no food no water no fuel but we are now hearing that Israel is I believe allowing more fuel trucks into Gaza what details do we have at this stage that's right Anastasia the details that have emerged over the course of the past hour is that Israel will start allowing two fuel trucks per day into the Gaza Strip from the raah border crossing this was a decision that was made by the war cabinet in Israel this is supposed to be for use by the United Nations and to help maintain maintain and keep the sewage system and the water system working in Gaza now um we're told there are a lot of reports in the media here that this decision was the result of recommendations by the Israeli Army the shin bate which is the internal security and intelligence services and also that the US played a key role that it was it's been reported here that the US was growing increasingly frustrated with Israel about this issue of allowing fuel trucks into the Gaza Strip that apparently the US had made made this request several weeks ago and we're we're not understanding why it hadn't been implemented until now um this is supposed to be around 60,000 lers of fuel per day that will be allowed entry into Gaza uh you compare that to about 7 million liters per week that had been allowed entry before October 7th so the current amount that we're told will start entering into Gaza will be about 6% of that previous amount that was allowed in before October 7th now this not not surprisingly has not gone down well with members of the far right government team here in Israel we're already hearing a lot of criticism from certain far right-wing cabinet members including national security minister itar bin gavier but also Finance Minister bezel smotrich he released a statement just a short while ago in which he said allowing fuel into Gaza is a grave mistake and against the cabinet's decision it reflects weakness it's giving oxygen to the enemy and it allows Sinar to sit in an airconditioned bunker comfortably watch the news and continue to manipulate Israeli society and the families of the hostages and this instead of hitting him and his men and his Partners Hamas heads abroad mercilessly until the last survivors there beg us to accept back our abductees unconditionally it's the only way to destroy Hamas return the abductees and restore security to the citizens of Israel now despite the fact that when this announcement was made there were assurances that none of this fuel would reach Hamas you're starting to see what could could constitute a rebellion by members of the far right-wing government um and it's going to be interesting to see if more ministers and if more members of the cabinet and members of the knesset come out and start criticizing it we know now that there was supposed to be a security cabinet meeting that was going to be happening on Monday evening now that's been moved to tomorrow evening and we believe that is a result of the internal dispute this is something that could politically be a problem for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu we'll get you more details as we have them the hours to come Nastasia we will indeed very interesting Dynamics Muhammad Jam there with the latest for us from occupied East Jerusalem thank you m
