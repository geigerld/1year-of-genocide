the Israeli Army says it has killed the commander of hamas's military wing it says Muhammad da was killed in an attack on a building in Kan yunas Southern Gaza three weeks ago Hamas is yet to confirm the reports all right let's get you more on these breaking developments nor joins us now from rala in the occupied West Bank uh nor tell us about the significance of the timing of this announcement by Israeli authorities it's very significant Leila because we have to kind of take a step back and see what has been happening over the past 2 24 hours Israel striking in the heart of Beirut the heart of tahan uh there were strikes also or explosions reported in Syria in Iraq and now the confirmation that the top military commander in hamas's military Wing has been assassinated in kanun so uh Israel really trying to to recover its deterrence which is a a deeply ingrained uh uh perspective in the security establishment in Israel that Israel must always uh maintain the ability to strike in the heart uh of where its adversaries are to be able to reach whoever it wants whenever it wants and right now what uh with this confirmation if Hamas corroborates it what we have is Israel eliminating the top of the Hamas um uh political Wing the top of the Hamas military wing and a lot of the senior commanders of the uh Hamas military wings so the circle closing and Netanyahu trying to recover His Image as a leader of Israel that can protect it so a lot going on really uh and we'll have to see how Hamas reacts and if it confirms that big hit right um now okay nor day I'm told we're going to have to leave it there thank you so very much for for now and um like to take you now to to Hy Mahmud who is standing by uh honey um have you heard of the news has it been confirmed where you are well it hasn't been confirmed yet by Hamas or the military Wing whether uh the commander of the military uh wing of Hamas has been eliminated as the Israeli military uh confirm in their statement but here on the ground we haven't heard any official statement in fact since the attack took place and that was the Israeli narrative and it kept pushing uh for that kind of narrative up till this moment we don't have any confirmation or any comments from any of the uh political uh level in Hamas or any of the military uh level or any kind of statements not even online on website uh statement but this is the kind of of things that we have heard in the past a statement after a statement by the Israeli military confirming their own actions that are hardly to verify uh on the ground just one example to point out how difficult is to verify any of these statements on the ground Israeli military at some point issued a statement talking about the elimination of some 800 uh militants as they described them here across the Gaza Strip but without giving any solid evidence of who were these militants they were targeted where they were coming from what they were names and there were multiple times the pictures of supposedly targeted uh uh targets that they were eliminated by the isra military and a few hours later or two days later discovered that many of them have already been dead years ago or some of them are actually out of the Gaza Strip or uh the majority of them are just civilians who have no connections whatsoever with any of the Israeli claims it's hard to uh to pin uh point exactly what happened the images and the videos released by the Israeli military they're showing the following it's an aerial an aerial footage of a drone of the the one ton bomb that is a the uh the bunker Buster bomb that fell on al- maasi and caused this huge explosion uh at the right in the middle of a side of a tent camp H but so far what we know that the the the T killed it close to 85 people majority of them that displac Palestinians from across the Gaza Strip that's what's available on the ground other than this it's hard to verify hard to verify H Mahmud thank you so very much for your reporting greatly appreciate it all right and here with me on the set is AD Abdul gafar director of the foreign policy and security program at the midle East Council on global uh Affairs so good to have you back with us um so if this is confirmed that Muhammad Dave reportedly killed in an attack uh on a building in Kan Yunis about three weeks ago what could that potentially mean for the trajectory of this war well we have to look at this within the context of domestic Israeli politics prime minister nanaho remains very unpopular and some recent opinion polls show that 70% of Israelis uh want him out these most recent uh assassinations uh of Hamas political wing and Hamas military Wing puts him in better standing uh domestically to pursue a ceasefire in addition to that the keset now is on summer uh recess so his Coalition is safe for the next few months so I think he would be making the calculation that now he can potentially go towards the ceasefire highlighting Israel is coming at it from a position of strength it's quite remarkable in terms of I mean just a quick succession of all these developments it's it's notable that is indeed notable so that might be what Netanyahu is a angling for to move towards the the ceasefire from position of strength but the wild card here is the Iranian response to the assassination of uh the hisbah commander and the assassination of Hana on Iranian soil will Iran retaliate forcefully to expand this uh conflict or not that is the key question now that we have that we'll know in the next couple of 48 hours next 48 hours now um if if this is confirmed um it would mean or would it mean that Israel has achieved the objectives that it had set out at the beginning of its campaign in Gaza uh that is uh correct of course the full eradication of Hamas is is not really possible because ultimately Hamas is an ideology but uh by eliminating the top leaders uh and also uh some of the rank and file commanders again Netanyahu can go to his public and sell this as a huge win and then go down the road of the negotiated ceasefire but in the same time as we discussed earlier there remains multiple sticking points on this ceasefire deal when it happens we still do not know who's going to look after the security situation and day after in the long term we don't know who's going to be in charge of the governance of Gaza we don't know if Israel will return the Philadelphia Corridor to Egypt and finally we don't know when the refugees will be allowed to return to Northern Gaza so all of these smaller details need to be negotiated before an actual SE fire Happ all right now what does this all mean for Hamas though I mean is it is it seriously weakened now Hamas is the definitely uh weaken with the assassination of its leader but as I mentioned to you Hamas is is more of an ideology uh that will likely live on if the conditions of occupation uh still exist but of course it is very weakened but in the same time they're not just dealing with Hamas they're also dealing with its backers such as Iran all right so uh abdah gafar thank you so very much I greatly appreciate you weighing in on this breaking
