hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a question what's behind the US pressure for Israel to change its scorched Earth strategy in Gaza let's get to the bottom line in the Middle East the Biden ministration is exactly at the point where it never wanted to be literally one week before the Hamas attack of October 7th US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan was saying in quote the middle east region is quieter today than it has been in two decades unquote now it's round-the-clock crisis meetings and one top Us official after the other making trips to the region after months of rejecting a full ceasefire Now American officials and some Hardline European allies like the UK and Germany are hinting that they're not okay with the brutality of Israel's war Israel's strategy has been to punish the civilian population of the Gaza Strip with maximum damage killing and maming tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians and turning Gaza into a place where no one can live so what's behind the slight change in tune among Western powers and what if anything will change in this war today we're talking with Ian Bremer president and founder of the Eurasia group a firm that studies geopolitical risk Ian thank you so much for joining us look I I want our audience to know that one of the uh reasons you're famous in the world is for seeing crises coming around the corner assessing and looking at geopolitical risk that is out there but I want to read to you a statement made on the 29th of September by Jake Sullivan uh the president's National Security adviser he said the middle east region is quieter today than it has been in two decades now challenges remain Iran's nuclear weapons program the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians but the amount of time that I have to spend on crisis and conflict in the Middle East today compared to any of my predecessors going back to 9/11 is significantly reduced so I want to ask you Ian this was a week before October 7th and the Hamas attacks what didn't Jake Sullivan see coming that you did see coming well I mean first of all let's let's recognize that many of the things that Jake was talking about a week before October 7th um are still in place uh the Abraham Accords which helped facilitate Israel normalizing relations with countries around the region um and putting them in the best geopolitical position that they had been since independence of Israel um still very much in place secondly a breakthrough that was facilitated by the Americans a breakthrough facilitated by the Chinese between Iran and Saudi Arabia that nobody thought possible that's still very much in place in fact it was after the October 7th terrorist attacks that Muhammad bin Salman and Iranian president RI spoke on the phone for the first time and then RI traveled to the Saudi Kingdom to meet with MBS and with many other Gulf leaders so I mean the the backdrop of the big powers in the Middle East being able to engage with each other and not be in a state of war that was true before October 7th that's true after October 7th but of course the piece of Jake's quote that really reads most problematically is I haven't had to spend any time on this compared to anything else and since October 7th he's been spending most of his time on it and in fact he's been on shuttle diplomacy back and forth to the region just as the Secretary of Defense just as the Secretary of State even President Biden so what went wrong and what went wrong is that everyone the Israelis um and the gulf allies and the Europeans and absolutely Americans for years basically came to the conclusion of well we don't we can't resolve Israel Palestine so we'll just stuff it in a box and perhaps we'll even literally stuff the Palestinians in a box um and we'll we'll make peace with the rest of the region and we'll just get on keep on keeping on and and what we saw on October 7th is that that doesn't work for the Palestinians and they can make you pay for it um that's that's basically the the singular piece um that that Jake is missing is is Israel going to be safer is it going to be able to take out Hamas is there stability down the road for Israel after what we've seen unfold well there's two reasons why they're not safer uh one is that you can take out Hamas leadership and tunnels and command and control and Fighters but you will not uh as a consequence take out the ideas the ideology that led to Hamas in fact you'll strengthen it the Americans learned this over decades with the failed war on terror you can take out Bin Laden and all of his henchmen but you can't take out uh the extremism and you see the Taliban running Afghanistan yet again in Afghanistan today if you ask Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank how they feel about Hamas there is far more support for that group after October 7th and after two months of Israeli uh War than there was before October 7 so that's one way that they're not safer the second way they're not safer is they're losing International support the Americans are more isolated in supporting Israel and opposing a ceasefire in the war today than the Russians were when they invaded Ukraine a couple of years ago and you see that with the United Nations security Council resolution and the general assembly votes that have taken place that's an astonishing thing to say and in the United States Biden is under a lot of pressure because a lot of his supporters and especially young people are increasingly sympathetic with the Palestinian cause not with Israel and indeed in recent polls astonishing to me a majority of Young Americans Generation Z Americans say that the attacks on October 7th the terrorist attacks were actually Justified so those are the two ways that Israel is not safer but Steve I want to be very clear you have a lot of people that are saying Israel is facing an existential threat and that's not true either Israel is in the strongest military position of any country in the region a significant nuclear force enormously well-trained and technologically advanced military border and surveillance capabilities far more capacity to outgun and through Iron Dome to defend against missile attack in Israel than anybody else in the region and it is true U that October 7th showed the weaknesses of those defenses especially if a government took its Eye Off the Ball as nyaho did but I've had so many lectures about how Israel is the best place to invest longterm in the Middle East for Pension funds and institutional investors and then the next hour those same leaders saying Israel faces an existential threat both of those things cannot simultaneously be true the former is and still is and the latter is politically expedient and we need to recognize that well let me play you a clip along those lines from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin who had something to say about this crisis let's listen it would compound this tragedy if all that was waiting for the Israeli people and your Palestinian Neighbors at the end of this awful war was more insecurity Fury and despair and those are very sobering words from the United States Secretary of Defense about the neighborhood you just talked about risk you're one of the greatest risk calculators I know is Israel robbing itself in this moment of that triaa you know gold star rating of you know a relatively low-risk investment for the rest of the World by not taking an off-ramp uh to some of what we've seen how is Israel playing with its future here again you know kind of less than you'd think Steve again because no one's going to take away the military support that the US is providing Noah's going to take away the technological capabilities that Israel has I mean you know the people that are fighting against Israel uh in the Palestinians in Hamas are fighting from a position of desperation the Israelis are defending from a position of strength and they're also occupying from a position of strength so no I don't buy the idea that Israel is suddenly going to be existentially vulnerable to its enemies not least because leaders in Saudi Arabia and the UAE quietly are are perfectly happy to see Hamas be destroyed they can't say it publicly Hamas is a problem for them the Arab street is a problem for them and Saudi Arabia would love to be in a position where they could once again normalize relations with Israel as they were just about to do before October 7th just need it to be more than window dressing for the Palestinians given what's happened for the last couple months so no I don't buy that but I Do by the fact um that Israel is more isolated today um and is losing some of its international support that has been hardfought over many decades and look I'm sympathetic to the fact that Israelis feel like they cannot live next to a territory that is run by a government that does not recognize their right to exist I I I accept that I accept that it cannot be sustainable for the Israeli government to live next to a Hamas Le Gaza but that is very different than saying that they must destroy every member of Hamas that's ever picked up a rifle that they must destroy every individual who has described loyalty or FIY to that organization I don't think it is accomplishable I think that the civilian C have already been far too high as a consequence of their efforts to do that and I think they will lose more than they gain from their own population and more broadly do you think there's a way after this conflict subsides and it will subside it will end at a mo at some moment where the Palestinian Authority or the PLO or some other entity that the United States helps engineer in place will be able to come in and govern Gaza come in and govern the West Bank and move us forward or do you think that's a pipe dream well I mean the the idea of governing Gaza when it's rubble and and and more than 50% of the population without homes you can't govern that you have to uh rebuild that before you can govern it uh you have to construct it there has to be a state there there's no State there right now there's human Carnage so uh we we're we're many many months probably years away from when you would be able to talk about governing two and a half million people on the ground in Gaza but it will need to happen and it will need to happen with a plan for a sustainable future for the Palestinians Israel has a right to defend itself under every circumstance so do the Palestinians the Israelis have a capacity to defend themselves as of right now the Palestinians do not to do that you need to have a govern that doesn't want to destroy Israel and that also is capable of governing its people without corruption without stealing all of the aid that's coming into them that is not Hamas historically that has not been the Palestinian Authority they haven't done a very good job but there's nobody else now the Americans are saying they want the Palestinian Authority to provide some Security even if not governance right um the Israelis under nanyu are saying no way no how I don't believe that nanyu is going to be there for much longer than another few months so it's clear that you're not going to have that kind of a solution with him in charge but nobody thinks he should be running Israel not least the Israeli citizens once he's gone yeah I I think that's part of a solution I think Egypt can be part of a solution as well with a lot of money uh provided by the Gulf States um but this I think the United Nations can be part of that solution but but Steve we are very very far from that conversation you know one of the things I've been wondering is are we seeing an escalation without noticing it um you've recently written about the hooes um drones that were short down 14 drones that were shot down successful ballistic missile attacks from the hotties on shipping uh in the Red Sea and coming out of the Suz canal and it is affecting the decision on how some Commerce is traveling is there an iran-backed escalation right now that we're not witnessing is this the hooes basically taking independent action and do you worry about that is that something as I have to tell you in Washington there's not been a lot of reaction to this but when you look at the detail of what the hotties have been able to do it's pretty significant in my book what do you think well you you asked me if there's Iran backed uh escalation I think the answer is yes you did not ask me if there was Iran orchestrated escalation the answer to that would be no and there there's a very big gap between those two things even if they are leading to the same outcome now for the first six weeks of this war the attacks we saw from the houthis as well as from uh Shia militias uh in Iraq and Syria also backed by Iran were considered by the Americans privately to be nuisance attacks they weren't meant to kill soldiers they weren't meant to really you know sort of lead to any escalation uh they were just kind of showing that these actors were there their power powerful they could cause problems in the future you know you need to pay attention to them and the American response was very restrained targeted one attack a week also meant to not really kill anybody and certainly not get the Iranians directly involved since then we have now seen since the ceasefire the the humanitarian pause when the hostages were being exchanged and now the attacks on Gaza have begun again in Earnest we have now seen a significant escalation from the houthis in particular who are um attacking ships with the intention of destroying them and sustained attacks on American warships in the Red Sea that has led some companies to stop shipping through that area and instead a much longer much more expensive route around South Africa um and it's also led to more significant American responses though focused so far on economic sanctions against some of those S as opposed to military escalation the Americans don't want the Iranians to get directly involved in this war what we've seen from the Iranians so far is they're willing to keep the houthis on a pretty Long Leash but that's very different from you know wanting um to uh to have this become a regional configration so I'm like you Steve I'm more worried today about that trajectory than I was three weeks ago but I still think it is less likely than more likely that we are you know on the Tipping Point of a regional uh War now you're seeing more and more direct calls by the administration for a change of game plan by the Israelis in Gaza and I'm just wondering and I asked this recently of uh Egypt's foreign minister S shukri I said is there a line that will trigger some different action from Egypt in the neighborhood and he said probably not which means I'm wondering at what point we stop watching the horror of what's unfolding in in in Palestine and people begin putting consequences into their words now privately the Israelis had told the Americans um that they had learned lessons and that mistakes were made in the first weeks of the bombing campaign in the north of Gaza and that that was going to lead to restraint and a lot fewer civilian casualties well the Biden Administration doesn't by that at least from what they've seen so far and Biden doesn't like or trust nanyu now um the the Americans it's not surprising Israel is the top Ally of uh the United States in the region and they experien the worst casualties the worst attacks on the Jews that anyone had seen since the Holocaust so it's not a surprise that the American response is we're going to CR any criticism we have we're going to make to you privately we're not going to air Dirty Laundry against our friends uh publicly that also meant vetos at the security Council and carrying a lot of water for the Israelis in multilateral diplomacy with the Gulf States and with the Europeans and others all of that has happened but I want to bring you back Steve to 2015 when the same nanahu was in power in Israel and the Obama Administration with Biden were pushing for an Iran nuclear deal the jcpoa and nanyu who the top Ally of the United States in the Middle East did not not quietly tell Biden here's what I really think you should do and here's how we should work this and I want to give you some advice no he flew to Washington he gave a public speech to uh the house and the Senate bipartisan doing everything he could to sabotage to torpedo the Iranian nuclear deal gave interviews to American newspapers same thing now that is not the way you behave if you're the top Ally of the United states in the region especially when you're in a position of supplicant it's not as if there's a power balance between Israel and the United States and and I think that Biden has had an entirely too soft gloves approach with Nan yahu I mean Biden is Israel's biggest friend strongest friend most committed friend for decades and decades and he has been sitting there publicly watching nyaho destroy aspects of that position and that relationship in an election year in the United United States do you think that there is an opportunity there still down the road that the United States is hoping the Saudis maybe other abrahamic courts members are going to be the Rebuilders of Gaza the stakeholders in Gaza or do you think they're going to stay on the sidelines like they've largely been doing uh I I think the Saudis want to play more of a leadership role and I think they're they have a much better relationship with the us right now in in some ways paradoxically given the Chinese engagement how much more energy they're buying as well um given what's happened uh between Israel and and Hamas still um the the Saudis are very interested in a nuclear energy deal civilian nuclear energy deal with the Americans that would also bring inspectors onto the ground um into Saudi Arabia with a fuel full fuel cycle uh and that the Americans would provide them with major non-nato uh Ally status and ramp up uh the level of and Technology of the weapon systems they're providing the Saudis I think think that that deal is absolutely still doable the question is is uh Saudi normalization of relations with Israel a part of that deal right now it can't be with this Israeli government it can't be and with window dressing for the Palestinians which would have been acceptable before the war but that can't be you need to have something much more substantive for the Palestinians and the Saudis need to be part of it needs to be a lot more money and a lot more security and stability on the ground than that deal that was Inked in Bahrain that was a sop for the Palestinians that allowed for the Abraham Accords in the first place under the Trump Administration let me ask you um real quickly about David Cameron um now foreign minister of the UK and analina barcock of uh Germany Germany's foreign minister are both pushing hard for a resumption of the deal making around hostages and a lot of us have been looking at the hostage politics in Israel and whether is any Dimension there but more and more international calls to get back into that kind of deal making uh with Qatar at the table uh the Israelis Hamas Etc where do you think that might go the French the Germans uh and the UK are now calling for a sustainable ceasefire uh between uh Israel and Hamas not an immediate ceasefire but a sustainable ceasefire that is a different position from where the Americans are it's very different from where the war went on Russia Ukraine where the US was so aligned with all of NATO here the US is largely by itself and the Allies are taking a position that's more akin to what you see in the global South frankly um they are also calling for the immediate release of all hostages everyone is saying that um but you've gotten you've already released the hostages that were easy to release and were easy to negotiate for when you're talking about men of fighting age it's a lot harder and then Hamas is going to drive a much tougher deal also with Hamas getting blown up to a much greater degree um you know they they increasingly see that the Israelis War cabin is willing to go after them individually well there's not as much reason for them to negotiate it's kind of like the position that y fian had when he finally decided to march on Moscow it's not like that was a winning strategy but he was kind of out of options right so I mean if you're Hamas right now you're willingness to negotiate short of things that the nanahu government are completely unwilling to provide you really really limited so you can call for this all you want and there have been you know General Assembly resolutions that have demanded overwhelming majorities demanding a ceasefire but also the release of all hostages well Israel's said no to one side but Hamas has said very clear no to the other well we always get a straight Scoop from Ian Bremer Ian Bremer president and founder of the political risk consultancy the Eurasia group really thank you so much for joining us today good see you steeve so what's the bottom line from America's perspective Israel's future in security have sort of been dealt with as a sacred issue that couldn't be disussed with the same kind of give and take that say the security of Europe is discussed that's one of the reasons why a state of Palestine or Justice for Palestinians has been a third rail Topic in America for decades but that may just be changing the US defense secretary is warning out loud that Israel may suffer strategic defeat and young people in America are dismiss made by what they're seeing and they're promising to withhold support from President Joe Biden this crisis is changing and affecting American politics that doesn't mean the equation of us support for Israel's structural indifference to Palestine changes tomorrow but it does mean the equation is no longer cost- free it means more Americans are paying attention and the past belief that palestine's future could be shoved out of view and under the rug is just no longer viable maybe just maybe a different world is shaping up and that's the bottom [Music] line
