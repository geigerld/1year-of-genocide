Doug Banda is the senior fellow senior fellow at the K Institute and former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan he joins us from Washington DC a very warm welcome to Al jazer I could start by asking you what purpose you think uh this joint public appearance of the heads of these two secretive organizations serves right now I think part of this is to put gentle pressure on Israel both the United States and United Kingdom have been very strong supporters of Israel uh provided arms backed them you know diplomatically and what this tells me is both of them are pushing hard if they're working together you know trying to get an agreement between Israel and Hamas and there's General recognition that Netanyahu has you know been a barrier to getting that agreement so they've um both talked at length about the need to support the UN Charter and Global norms and international standards of law particularly when it comes to Russia and China but there doesn't seem to be any mention of Israel and breaches of international law when it comes to the war in Gaza what does that say to you well what that tells me is that in both countries Israel is a domestic political issue I can state that categorically in the United States uh the Republican party uh never likes to criticize Israel the Democratic party has some divisions but President Biden has declared he's the most Pro Israel president ever you know so what that does is makes politicians in the United States reluctant to criticize Israel even when it appears to be guilty of the same breaches of international law as other countries uh Doug stay with us because I I want to open up the uh conversation uh a little bit more because both spy Chiefs also discussed Russia's invasion of Ukraine a war that's been going on for two and a half years and a joint opinion piece they said staying the cour forces more vital than ever Putin will not succeed in extinguishing Ukraine's sovereignty and Independence Russia's actions are a flagrant breach of the UN Charter in global Norms as I mentioned on Ukraine's surpris incursion in KK they said it was a typically audacious and a bold move by the ukrainians to try and change the game and I think they have changed the narrative and really brought the war home to Russia Doug back to you uh I mean how might Russia and China do you think calibrate its response to what we've heard from the UK and US spy Chief I mean Putin's often cast by Western intelligence agencies as the Eternal Bond villain that the world needs saving from is there a degree of double standards here well of course quite honestly you Saudi Arabia has killed more yemenis than uh you know Russia has killed ukrainians the United States invasion of Iraq was a flagrant violation of international law you know so there's an element of do what we say not as we do you know that what we see Russia having done was a blatant aggression it was wrong and he deserved to be criticized and deserved to have a world reaction but you would wish that the countries doing the criticizing would also live by the same standards and unfortunately both the United States and United Kingdom have some problems in that regard what do you mean by problems in that regard help us understand well first for example you know the invasion of Iraq it was you know conducted heavily by the United States and backed by the United Kingdom the Blair government and that was clearly a violation of international law the justifications were basically you know you can argue whether they were lies or misjudgments but they were wrong hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians ended up dying and you look at the treatment of Israel you know a willingness not to talk about you know what Israel has done in a country like Saudi Arabia both the US and United Kingdom love to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and they don't worry about how those weapons have been used and an awful lot of yemeni civilians innocent people have died over the last decade you know with Saudi Arabia and the amadis involved been really interesting talking to you Doug Doug band senior fellow at the Kato Institute and former Reagan many thanks make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
