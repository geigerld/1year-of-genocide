a week after students at Columbia University in New York first began their camp in support of Palestine the protests against Israel's war and Gaza have spread to college campuses across the United States the White House says President Joe Biden supports free speech and non-discrimination at universities but there were scuffles at the University of Texas as police and state troopers Tred to disperse the crowds hundreds of students have been arrested in the US since Friday we have correspondents covering the protest from coast to coast John henin is standing by for us at Columbia University in New York but first let's go to Rob Reynolds who joins us from the University of Southern California so uh Rob what's the latest you can tell us from there well Carrie everything is uh pretty calm and peaceful right now there are uh speakers uh making speeches and leading uh chants uh of for a group of perhaps a thousand students it's a little difficult to tell exactly how many I think the crowd has ebbed and flowed over the course of the last several hours uh the students here are demanding several things including uh that that stand in solidarity with Palestinians uh and demanding freedom for Palestine an end to the occupation an end to genoci side in Gaza and Israel's war on Gaza and they're also more close to home calling for their University USC which is an elite institution uh people pay a lot of money to send their children here or or or students pay money themselves uh either way as the case may be it's a very prestigious University and the students want it to cut all ties with Israel and to remove board members MERS uh on the uh governing board of the uh college or the university who are uh involved in the defense industry in the United States that supplies uh Israel with weapons and so forth they want to cut off any study abroad with uh Israeli colleges or universities uh and they want in other words a complete clean break between USC and any Israeli entity now it's all been very peaceful as as I said uh during my time here observing this crowd there have been no uh uh confrontations or shouting matches between individual students or anything of that nature but earlier uh when students were trying to set up uh tents in order to have a sort of camping protest 24-hour uh there were uh some scuffles I guess you would called them as campus police who are armed with uh weapons uh with firearms and clubs and wearing helmets did intervene they tore down the tents um at least one student was uh detained I'm told by protest organizers uh but then released and a couple of people were roughed up uh but there were no serious injuries uh but uh that has there this is a situation which has been mirrored as you mentioned Carrie around the country from coast to coast where there have been other uh in institions and colleges and universities where arrests have been made and this has all led to a profound debate over the right of freedom of speech on campus uh on universities which are dedicated to the goal of uh fostering free inquiry of uh of fostering a a culture of um of Discovery and learning and self-expression and now those same institutions are caught in a Crossroads where there are uh uh instances where they crack down on that very freedom of speech and so that is creating uh a great deal of concern among the students and among a number of the professors here at USC and elsewhere Karen okay Rob thanks very much needed for that let's uh go live now to John henin who's at Columbia University in New York John can you give us a sense of what it's been like there with these protests Well Carrie Columbia has a long Legacy of protests from the Vietnam War to today but there's a lull at the center of this particular storm it may be the epicenter but look around uh you've got students now putting on an extra layer after a warm day grows a little chillier today was a busy one here the speaker of the US House of Representatives Mike Johnson came here and he spoke to Jewish students and condemned these protests the ones here and across the country well the students held a little news conference of their own the protesters and they made some demands they said they're protesting the war in Gaza but they're also protesting their University they want to know they want the school to disclose where it's investing its money they want it to divest of all Israeli Investments and they want amnesty for all of the students that are out here and all of the other protesters and that presumably includes the more than 100 who were arrested here last week since then the university has given them a new deadline of midnight local time on Thursday as talks continue between the student protesters and the university and as this Wildfire of protest spreads across the country but you can see how peaceful this is right now and one reason the University president might be looking for a way out of this conundrum is that back in 196 another Columbia University president called in police they violently cleared out student protesters and that was the end of that President's stormy tenure John henin thank you well staying with this now Jeremy Siri is a professor of Global Leadership history and public policy at the University of Texas he joins us from Austin Texas welcome to the program we understand that you witnessed firsthand the student protest can you tell us what actually happened sure so I was coming out of the class I had just taught and it is uh the history Department uh on campus and I saw a large group of students not not a very large group but about 200 students who had assembled on a grass lawn uh behind my building uh it's what we call the South mall and it doesn't block any buildings it's visible to many people but it's an area that students often sit on to study and things of that sort and these students were shouting free Palestine uh that's all they had maybe one or two signs they were saying nothing anti-semitic they were saying nothing that was threatening and as they were standing and shouting I witnessed the police uh the state police the campus police the city police uh an army of police almost the size of the student group uh collecting themselves many were carrying uh guns many were carrying rifles and then within a few minutes uh this group of police stormed into the student crack Crow and started arresting students these students were shouting free Palestine they were not threatening anyone they were peaceful they were loud uh but they were peaceful and they were not anti-semitic either and the police just started attacking them and that led to more shouting more students then arrived when they saw this and the situation became more violent but it became more violent because the police had attacked the students not the other way around so what are University authorities making king of all this then where is this actually heading well I believe that University presidents including my own at the University of Texas are afraid they are afraid that they are going to be criticized and condemned by politicians by the governor of Texas by members of Congress they're they're afraid they're going to be condemned for allowing anti-Semitism and I'm against anti-Semitism too I'm Jewish myself I think anti-Semitism is horrible and there has been too much of it but this the presidents are overreacting and what they're doing is they're creating an environment in which no one is allowed to say anything that sounds critical in any way of Israel or any other topic and they're making it impossible for students to express themselves I want students to express strong opinions I want them to argue I don't want them to say anything that's offensive to another group and I don't want them to use violence but we're a university we should be encouraging Free Speech presidents of universities now are afraid of free speech and they're suppressing free speech and that is terrible we should not allow that to happen given what you say then could this eventually lead to some kind of policy change when it comes to how institutions react to protests like this well I hope it will lead to some sou searching I believed we had a policy until today at the University of Texas and a policy I think most major universities had which is that peaceful protests were encouraged uh that is actually what we should be about for some reason we have abandoned that policy I would like to see us have a discussion about returning to that policy and setting clear guidelines uh for that policy I do fear there are some people who want to limit free speech and limit protests at universities what is ironic is these are the same people who a few years ago were saying we didn't have enough Free Speech the same conservatives who said that we were doing too much woke diversity training are now the same people who don't want real discussion of other issues uh and that's very dangerous the lifeblood of intellectual work is debate and discussion and from what you've witnessed then firsthand how strong is the resolve of students well the irony is that this kind of behavior by the police only increases the resolve of students I cannot tell you how many students more than 15 to 20 that I spoke with who I saw at this event some of whom are students I know uh were students who were apathetic or may have even been favorable to the Israeli side in the argument and they see the police acting this way and it leads them to become more radical uh and this is the story of the 1960s in our society we're replaying that when the police attack students in this way it makes other students sympathize with those who are attacked not the attackers Professor Jeremy Siri thank you very much indeed for your time thank you for covering this story make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
