KH say is a Palestinian political analyst who learned of his father jerice se's death earlier today his father was among others Sheltering at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza and he joins us live now from Washington DC uh first of all um our our deepest sympathies to you and your family uh over the death of your father and uh we thank you for uh talking to us at this difficult time can you um tell us first of all about the circumstances of what happened here and how you how you learned of your father's death yeah thanks H for having me and thanks for adding this context today in the morning I just received a call from my cousin who's in ramala telling me have you talked to your parents today and me saying no but I think they're okay because I heard yesterday that the snipers that were around the church that shot down two of the women uh at the church who were killed and others who were wounded are no longer there and I felt that it's more safe and then she said I hate to break it down to you but your father passed away your father wasn't able to be transported to a hospital when his health has deterred and us your father died it was uh very hard to hear that but even more hard that I wasn't for hours uh able to even know what happened to my father due to the lack of connection with Gaza and the cell phone services and I had to really waitting hours just to know if my father was buried or not how did he die and the circumstances of surrounding his death so from what you're saying there there was an opportunity for your father to get treatment for his injuries but because of the the insecurity there he he never got that chance yeah for sure for the last two days the Israeli Army has completely besieged the church haunted down two women who were killed on the spot and and one did another seven people who tried to um uh uh hold or carry these two woms from within the comound of the church as Pope Francis himself also referred to the incident so there was an opportunity to not only save my father who his health has been deterred in the last two days that yet they find no hospitals or ambulances but also there are seven people who are wounded in the church since 3 days and they're still bleeding without any medical um uh care and we are afraid at least that one of these people at the church as I heard today from the priest that they will she will pass away as well uh and while this is something that has uh affected you personally I know because we we we introduced you as a as a political analyst and and and and someone who studies Palestinian politics how how should we view this in the context of the the The Wider conflict it seems that there is very uh uh intentional um uh Israeli uh policy of uh making sure the Palestinians don't get the things they need whether it's food or medical attention or even access to hospitals uh the way we understand it and the way we look at it is that there is an an an Israeli attention and policy to push the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip they want to ethnically cleans the Gaza Strip they want to reoccupy Gaza fully and the more they make the humanitarian catastrophe worst in Gaza the more it is likely that people would leave from from gaza's strip so now giving that Egypt has closed the border and giving that Egypt did not allow Palestinians to leave from Gaza I think that the Israelis are sort of um still confused on what what's the next step but yet they they never change these policies there's no other explanation for why there is not even one functioning Hospital in the north of Gaza except that there is an attempt to ethnically cleanse or there is a potential even genocidal intentions there so there is no another way as far as I'm concerned analytically beside that the Israelis don't want to see Palestinians continue to continue living in G can I ask you KH um when was the last time you you spoke to uh your father and um how did he how how did he feel about what was happening there yeah the truth is I couldn't speak to him for the last few weeks because of the lack of self Services uh the uh painful part is uh my communication with my family since they moved to the church after the bombing of our house toward the very beginning of the war has been through just the word of mouth of hearing from other people and all what I was waiting for every day is someone to tell me I talk to someone at the church your family is alive literally that's the only thing I'm waiting for every day but how does my father feel about the situation knowing my father having spent um uh time with him and talking to him about it he's a very peaceful person he's not a person of War he does not believe in war he always told me and taught me that you should be like Christ you should forgive others you should forgive even your enemy and even love your enemy you should uh seek peace and I knowing my father who would be against this war he would be even against the Hamas a horrific attack in October 7th and he would be someone that sympathizes with civilians both Israelis and Palestinians thinking and saying all the time that everyone is created in the image of God well father sounds like a wonderful man and um we appreciate you talking to us about him and uh our uh our deepest sympathies to you and thank you so much for talking to us thank you h
