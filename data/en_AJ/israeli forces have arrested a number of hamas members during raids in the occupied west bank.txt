in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces are increasing the number of raids arresting dozens of Palestinians around 400 Palestinians have been detained and at least 55 killed there since last Saturday let's go to Imran Khan who's in rala in the occupied West Bank Imran this was already the deadliest year in a long time for Palestinians but 55 killed 55 Palestinians killed since Saturday that's a very sharp escalation tell us about the latest raids well the r the latest raids took place uh in the last 24 hours 66 people have been arrested today they've been arrested by the Israeli military remember that the occupied West Bank comes under Israeli military rule not Israeli civilian Rule and only in the Palestinian areas as the Palestinian Authority RIT actually make any uh have any effect so these people have now been taken into Israeli military uh detention 470 since Saturday since October 7th uh when hamas's military operation began this is a worrying number uh for the Palestinians now sirel it was only a few days ago that here in Manara Square in the center of rala that Hamas actually called a public rally they were allowed to do that by the Palestinian Authority there were senior leaders of Hamas leading the prayers um uh for the victims in Gaza uh they were doing this publicly and now uh the Israelis are going in and arresting um members of Hamas now that's only adding to the sense of nervousness here in the occupied West Bank remember s the occupied West Bank is still uh under blockade is blockaded uh from the Candia checkpoint from other checkpoints that actually lead into uh occupied East Jerusalem into Jerusalem generally but you can't move around within the occupied West Bank and so people are simply staying at home they're watching the tele ision and they're just incredibly nervous and they keep telling us look if that's happening in Gaza we're worried that we might be next Imran you're also getting new information on the humanitarian situation in Gaza what can you share with us well I can tell you the Musa baruti a very senior Palestinian figure the head of the Palestinian national initiative gave a press conference today he gave some very Stark numbers about uh what was going on within the Gaza Strip and he also talked about uh it infolding into a humanitarian crisis it's worth taking a listen to him what we see in Gaza is unlawful killing of innocent civilians slaughtering children 800 Palestinian children have already been slaughtered by Israeli air strikes what we see is acts of collective punishment and bombardment up till now the Israeli Army and air strikes have conducted 57 massacres and I mean by a massacre the elimination of whole families completely and killing them totally we already received report that 47 families and I mean by families grandfather grandmother brothers sisters children they 47 families have already been erased from the Civil record it's very Stark numbers there St seral that he was talking about but what's perhaps slightly more interesting for the International Community is that press conference was actually held in English and that's something you're going to start seeing a lot more of the Palestinians have realized that they need to get their side of the story out to the International Community and they need to do that in Lang in languages other than Arabic they're not playing uh to their own domestic audience anymore it's important they say to get those messages out in as many languages as possible and this has been echoed in uh by Palestinian demonstrators as well at the German Embassy uh there was a demonstration yesterday we speaking to people there and they were saying we simply need to start telling the world our story our plight why this happened this didn't happen in a volume in a vacuum rather and it happened because of 75 years worth of occupation so expect to see more things like that in English as they try and get the message out Imran Khan reporting from romala in the occupied West Bank thank you very much ever Imran
