W Rani is non-resident fellow at the center for conflict in humanitarian studies and he's also co-editor of jelia it's an online publication covering the Middle East who's joining us live now from Montreal thank you very much indeed uh for being with us Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing this as a tragic accident uh saying it a grave mistake took place is this an appropriate response do you think no of course not and I would point out that in contrast to previous such attack where Israel either celebrates them or doesn't even bother giving uh an excuse for its actions now it is also claimed that it is launching an independent investigation so quite clearly uh what's called The Diplomatic tsunami um recent the recent ruling by the international court of justice the ICC applications for arrest warrants and so on are gradually beginning to have an effect that this same time when we look at the broader International situation what we've learned is that US President Joe Biden's red line is actually a river of Palestinian blood and that senior us officials are quite happy um to swim in it as far as the Europeans are concerned we've seen quite extensive condemnation of this attack and denunciation of this attack but 8 months into this brutal genocidal campaign I I think simply making statements becomes entirely meaningless when this is not paired with concrete actions to bring such acts which are taking place on an almost daily basis to a definitive end with the increase in uh diplomatic pressure with the pressure coming from the the recent rulings from the international court of justice plus of course from the domestic pressure that the prime minister is facing as well do you think that all we're going to see is just a change in his language is it going to have any impact at all on the way that Israel is carrying out its military operation in Gaza at this rate absolutely not and I think one objective of this attack was to demonstrate that the US actually does not have a red line and bear in mind um according to the available reports Israel used exactly those bombs the 2,000 PB bombs in its attack on T suan um yesterday these are the same bombs that Biden had claimed he was suspending the delivery of to Israel so this is basically a message you know essentially raising a middle finger to the ICC to the icj to the International Community and making the claim you know Washington has our back we really don't care about anything else in terms of the the the linguistic um gymnastics that we've seen over the last several months with regard but particularly in the last couple of months with with regard to the operations that are going on in Rafa do you think that we are going to can see a continuation of the avoidance of uh words like a major operation a large scale operation that that may well be what we're seeing on the ground but what but the the frames of reference if you like are going to be much milder I I think so um we've seen the constant shifting of the goalposts now it also make another point at various stages we have seen senior us officials President Biden Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and others make statements that appear to be critical of Israel or laying down boundaries um regarding what Israel can and cannot do I don't think we should look at those in terms of reflecting any change in US policy what they actually are are um attempts to respond to Growing domestic public opposition to Growing Global criticism of the US's unconditional support of Israel and in a sense to divert um to change the subject to give the appearance that something is changing in Washington but in effect nothing happens and these statements are intended purely for public uh consumption to mask the continuation of the precisely same policies with respect to Israel's genocidal Onslaught in the Gaza Strip there are a cautious talks going on with regard to the possibility of moving towards another set of potential ceasefire negotiations do you think given the pressures that you've been uh discussing um there might be some pressure on Israel to move forward to try to find some sort of um way of finding some sort of Common Ground uh with Hamas with the negotiators albe it that they might not want to make that public well I would first look at what happens in the United Nations security Council this week um the algerians are apparently preparing to submit another draft resolution calling for a ceasefire if as widely expected the us either manages to water it down to the point of making it meaningless or if it fails to do that and once again casts its veto that would be a very clear message to Israel uh to Netanyahu that they can continue um and that these ceasefire discussions are really no more than a fig leaf for Israel's ability to cons to continue with its campaign in the Gaza Strip so um we have to look I think not only at the negotiations themselves but at the broader context in which they're being conducted M Rabani we appreciate you being with us and Al so thank you very much indeed for your time thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get
