taking you live to T Aviv to listen to the press conference uh between uh Lloyd Austin and yav Galant they have been meeting today while Lloyd Austin has been in Tel Aviv let's listen in Secretary Austin the United States and Israel have never been more determined and align in our share values our share interest and our share goals my friend General atin you have shown the people of Israel and the entire world what is what it means to be a leader and a partner there is no greater projection of our intimate ties than sitting together with General Brown and general Levy discussing the most sensitive issues on the agenda in full transparency and Trust thank you secretary for your deep commitment to Israel's security we stand here 72 days into a war that we didn't want on October 7th Hamas conduct a brutal attack they murdered raped and kidnapped children women soldiers Holocaust survivors on October 7th we fought back and immediately set the goals of this war the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages home with no exception our common enemies around the world are watching and they know that Israel Victory is the victory of the Free World led by the United States of America in in our in our war against Hamas the Hamas terrorist organization is a war not it's not a war against the people of Gaza we are fighting a brutal enemy that Hinds behind civilians billions of dollars have been invested in Gaza money that should have gone to civilian infrastructure and instead was used to build a network of tunnel hundreds of kilometers long equipped by military facilities today IDF troops are operating in Hamas hotspots across Gaza in Northern Gaza our troops have eliminate thousands of terrorists destroyed military infrastructure and this this man most of the battalions operating in the area in South Gaza in Junes we are perise and focus on eliminate Hamas leadership and Military infrastructure detecting and engaging Hamas leadership and the chain of command span over the phases of this war and will continue until we fully achieve our goals secretary Austin we both know the the complexities of War we both fought brutal terrorist organization we know that it takes time unlike our enemies we are defending our values and we operate according to international law the IDF is operating to minimize the harm to civilian popul population we are also working with International Partners to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian Aid yet anytime we discuss humanitarian issues we must remember the 129 hostages will held in Gaza this is the most humanitarian issue on October fa a day after Hamas attack kisala open fire unprovoked the threats of rockets missiles and drones is unacceptable over 80 80,000 citizens have been in displaced living as refugees in their own country we are determined to create a new reality restoring Security in the area based on new UN resolution 1701 pushing backis balah we will bring back the residents of the north to their homes on the border after full Security will be restored we prefer to do so via understanding ensuring that the Border region is clear of terrorist and does not allow direct threats of our citizens if such a process will not be implemented diplomatically we will not hesitate to act today we also discuss the growing Global threat posed by the htis terrorist organization their action threaten International Freedom of navigation and their Reckless Behavior fire ing ballistic missiles cruise missiles and drones against Israel can drag the region into war the state of Israel values us leadership and we will support International efforts at the same time we maintain the right to take all the actions necessary to defend our sovereignity and our citizens Hamas kisala and the htis are funded supported and trained by one source of evil Iran and unfortunately this is only their secondary effort Iran's major effort is acquiring military nuclear capabilities and this continue even now we are aware of the actions and we will we are ready to defend ourself we must take a stand the world is watching us now this include our enemies Hamas hisis balah and Iran the image they see today is powerful as we stand here united we are resilient and determined and we will win on every front thank you on once again Mr secretary thank you for coming and thank you for your support and your friendship thank you very much well good afternoon everybody you have we've been talking almost daily by phone so it's good to see you once again in person and it's good to be back in Israel even in these difficult days especially in these difficult days this is my fourth visit to Israel as Secretary of Defense and my second time since October 7th and I know that Israel has been profoundly changed from where you were on October 6th so I'm here with a clear message America's support for Israel security is unshakable and Israel is not alone at a time of morning a real friend shows up and I know how terrible these days have been for the Israeli people and I know that October 7th touched everyone in the small democracy so let me again extend my deepest condolences to minister GTI Eisen Cott who has been sitting shivba for his 25 year-old son and mourning his nephew after they both fell in Gaza on October 7th amas committed one of the worst atrocities in the history of modern terrorism as President Biden said it was an act of sheer evil innocent young people at a concert were massacred parents were shot in front of their children women were sexually assaulted Toddlers and Holocaust Survivors were taken hostage and for Hamas that was just the beginning Hamas has clearly and loudly spelled out its vision of the future and it is to repeat October 7th over and over and over again no country should tolerate such a danger and Israel has every right to defend itself against a fanatical terrorist group whose stated purpose is to murder Jews and eradicate the Jewish State Hamas is still holding hostages including American citizens Hamas embeds itself and hides itself behind innocent Palestinian civilians Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people and Hamas is determined to Doom both Israelis and Palestinians to an unending cycle of suffering and strife so make no mistake Hamas should never again be able to project Terror from Gaza into the sovereign state of Israel and we will continue to work together for a safer more secure future for Israel and a brighter future for the Palestinians the United States will keep keep pushing relentlessly for the safe return of hostages in Gaza and we will continue to help Israel in its efforts to bring them all home thanks to the personal leadership of President Biden we helped to broke a deal that got out more than a 100 hostages but this remains a top priority for the United States from President Biden on down and we will continue to do everything that we can to bring home every man every woman and every child seized by Hamas now the United States has been clear and consistent since Hamas started this war on October 7th democracies are stronger and more secure when we uphold the law of war and I've as I've said protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral duty and a strategic imperative so we will continue to stand up for Israel's Bedrock right to defend itself and we will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian Aid into Gaza that's important as Israel fights to dismantle the Hamas ter terrorist infrastructure in Gaza and it will also be crucial for our work with our allies and partners after the fighting stops now we're working to ensure that this conflict does not escalate Beyond Gaza but as we are driving to stabilize the region Iran is Raising tensions by continuing to support terrorist groups and militias attacks by these Iranian proxies threaten the Region's citizens and risk a broader conf conflict of course the United States does not seek war and we urgently call on Iran to take steps to deescalate now in my meetings today I also discussed the need to take urgent action to stabilize the West Bank attacks by extremist settlers against the Palestinians in the West Bank must stop and those committing the violence must be held accountable now we know that the past 72 days have been some of the most painful days in Israel's history but it would compound this tragedy if all that was waiting for the Israeli people and your Palestinian Neighbors at the end of this awful war was more insecurity Fury and despair as I've said Israelis and Palestinians have both paid to Bitter a price to just go back to October 6th so I discussed Pathways today toward a future for Gaza after Hamas based upon the clear principles laid down last month by my friend secretary blinkin Israelis and Palestinians both deserve a horizon of hope so the United States continues to believe as we have under administrations of both parties that it is in the interest of both Israelis and Palestinians to move forward toward two states living side by side in Mutual Security now we know how hard that is especially after October 7th but ongoing instability and insecurity only play into the hands of Hamas so we must think together about what lies Beyond this terrible season of Terror and War and as we do the United States will remain deeply committed to the security and self-defense of the state of Israel as John F Kennedy said in 1960 America's friendship with Israel is a national commitment that was true then and it's even truer now the United States will remain Israel's closest friend in the world as I've said repeatedly our support for Israel's security remains unshakable and it always will thank you very much and we'll be happy to take your questions um all right we'll start now with klyn betel um thank you secretary Austin welcome to Israel um it's not a secret that there is a gap between Israel and the US so have you set any sort of either time table or deadline to the current phase of Israel ground war in Gaza and have you heard any firm assessment from the IDF where the current phase stand and if I may with regard to the north um Israel says and and Minister Gallant has just repeated that it will attack Lebanon if there won't be an acceptable solution that will include theala withdrawal North to the Lan River Jake salivan was here last week and he was quite confident that such a solution can be achieved uh what is the US the US position if Israel attack and will you order the US Army to strike and even destroy hisis Bala and Iranian Target if required and uh Minister Gallant um it took the IDF 70 days to reach the tunnel that was uh revealed yesterday how long do you think it take to totally dismantle the threat of the tunnel in will R will rule Gaza and will the IDF be in Gaza throughout the entire next year thank you very much which one of those 12 questions do you want me to ask I have more regarding the timeline this is Israel's operation and I'm not here to dictate timelines or terms our support uh to Israel's right to defend itself is Ironclad as you've heard me say a number of times and that's not going to change it's critical as I said earlier that H Hamas not be able to threaten Israel from Gaza or even threaten Gaza anymore you know that's an interest that we all share it's a common interest with all of us and so today we had great discussions about the status of the campaign about goals and objectives and about um how to reduce uh harm to civilians uh in the battle space uh and to and the need to ensure uh a sustained flow of humanitarian assistance uh into Gaza you know we can offer some insight based upon our own experience in fighting terrorist groups and certainly uh that enabled us to have great uh great discussions and we also have some great thoughts about um how to transition from high-intensity operations to a lower intensity and more surgical operations so we had uh great discussions on all of those uh those issues on Lebanon uh we've been clear that uh we don't want to see this conflict widen into a a uh larger war or a regional war and uh and we call upon uh Hezbollah uh to make sure that uh they don't do things that would provoke a wider conflict yes as to the first uh first question let me be more precise it took us 70 days before we exposed this tunnel to the public it was discovered longer period before that after a month or so but we had a lot of uh uh a lot of operations to be done inside inside the tunnel before we expose it h the war will take time and uh I can assure only one issue that uh eventually we will reach our gos uh first of all to destroy Hamas second to rescue the hostages both of them are very important equally uh this is a war of uh National determination and National resilience and uh we will prevail because we are fighting for the right values and uh for our survival in this region as to the second question uh we understand how important is the uh cooperation uh the international uh support to establish something something different in Gaza this is the reason we conduct this uh this uh uh uh talks today together with secretary Austin and general b and Mr safield and others regarding the issues that we have to uh to conduct in in Gaza ER we know that Hamas will not control Gaza we know that we will have have the freedom to eliminate any kind of threat in the future and there will be no serious military threats against Israel from Gaza second Israel will not control Gaza in in any civilian way we will conduct any any needed operation and Military effort in order to secure our future and we are building the routes for uh non-hostile Partners in in the other side thank you Tera cop if we can also please stick to one question each please thank you thank you Minister glant back to Lebanon um are you currently planning for a ground operation in the north to as you said fully secure that area from Hezbollah secretary Austin if that ground operation is launched just to um repeat my colleague's question what role would US forces have in uh such a case and then is it too dangerous right now Minister Gant to open a second front in the north when you have troops committed in the south in Gaza and my final one for secretary Austin um another commercial vessel today was attacked in the Red Sea and US warships continue to intercept ballistic missiles and drones that are fired from houthi controlled Yemen why hasn't the US struck back or conducted a Counter Strike like it has against similar Iranian backed militants in Iraq and Syria uh I uh I would like to reiterate what I said I said that diplomacy is the preferred way we uh we are not looking for Wars but we have 70,000 Israeli refugees andala is shooting us every day since October 88 a day after Hamas launch the war against Israel therefore in one hand we are patient and uh we are looking for a diplomacy solution that will uh make sure that his balah is not threaten Israeli uh civilians on the Northern Communities Direct ly on the other hand we are preparing ourself to any any situation that is needed and uh if something like that happened uh we will know what to do and we will prevail we we are not looking for anything similar to that and we hope that balah will understand it it's time to stop uh thanks s uh regarding the who boties um these attacks are Reckless dangerous and they violate international law and so we're taking action to uh build an International Coalition to address this threat and I would remind you that this is not just a US issue uh this is this is an international problem and it deserves an international uh response uh and that's why uh I'm convening a meeting tomorrow uh ministerial meeting with fellow ministers in the region and Beyond uh to uh to address this threat uh we're uh uh that'll be a virtual meeting and I look forward to that discussion and more important I look forward to uh working together uh with uh uh members of that uh of that uh group uh to address the threat in a meaningful way in the future and we'll have more details on this soon but uh we're going to make sure that we're doing everything that we can to uh ensure uh freedom of navigation uh in the area uh the straight is uh Straits are pretty pretty important as we know as you know a large amount of Commerce flows through their International Commerce flows through their on a daily basis thanks y Bob y Bob from the Jerusalem Post good to see you again uh Mr secretary there's been a lot of discussion about getting Israel's intent to reduce civilian casualties to match up with the results General Petraeus famously said that sometimes the US needs to take hits on Force protection to win over hearts and Minds legitimacy you're probably familiar that just recently about 10 Israeli soldiers died in one Ambush and a lot of people in Israel were saying if the Israeli Defense Forces had just bombed the area they wouldn't have died is is this the kind of thing you know War doesn't have Perfect Solutions that sometimes the United States may think that Israel may need to take more hits to force protection instead of being as aggressive with um its Air Force and artillery um Minister Gant good to see you um the United States in its most respectful way possible is trying to push Israel on certain timelines on certain things about uh the day after um is it maybe time that that uh yourself and the government need to tell Israel that even though we've had tremendous successes in the field we may not actually control all of Gaza at the end of January we may not get all of the hostages back at the end of January some of these things may continue in the 3 to nine months afterwards the what they call schav gimo the third stage so for the first part of the question in terms of um the nature of the strikes uh and and the amount of collateral damage I think uh let me Begin by saying the protection of our troops is important to all of us uh Minister Gant me all of us uh and uh and that is foremost um but what we see happening is a combination of two things the first thing is the complexity of of this battle space three-dimensional battle space uh very closed uh closed spaces uh dense population of people uh and uh and so that's that makes it very very difficult uh to uh to conduct any uh operation above and beyond that we see that um Hamas routinely uh uses civilians as as shields uh beyond that they Place their headquarters and and their logistical sites uh near uh protected sites hospitals mths churches uh you name it and so that adds to the to the complexity and as you as you youve heard Jake Sullivan say it's a it provides an additional burden for uh for the uh the forces that are Prosecuting this fight uh it requires a very professional force and that Force has to learn each uh each step of the way and we've seen that and and Minister Gant and I had a great conversation today about some of the things that they've learned and some of the techniques that they're that they're uh you know changing and as as they uh conduct operations in the South so all of us learn and and uh and again they were a very professional Force going into this but this is a an incredible uh complex battle space and taking lessons learned from the north they've they've applied some of those lessons in the South and uh and again uh I'm sure that that'll continue to happen well first of all the discussions are uh are transparent and Frank and uh on the personal level I have a lot to learn from General Austin so I'm learning also and he always give me good advises therefore we share everything and uh we consult uh second uh on the on the on the battlefield we have a uh a very meaningful uh uh and successful uh achievement uh we uh we detect thousands of terrorists including cluding senior commanders but not the leadership the eliminate Hamas leadership is an ongoing goal that will be achieved hopefully soon but it will be achieved it's part of the goals of the war and uh we will continue to operate in different levels of intensity according to the situation the in the region and uh I I can tell you that uh uh uh soon we will be able to to distinguish between different areas in in Gaza in every area uh where we achieve our mission we will be able to uh transition gradually uh to the next phase and start working uh on bringing back local population that means that it can be achieved maybe sooner in the north rather than in the South so we are dealing with all the different components and we will decide in the next in the next future early Future No I'm I'm I'm not I'm not defining any any any region and uh this is an ongoing discussion but I give you an idea about what we are discussing in the Israeli military establishment and together with the Americans mosa Gaines thank you mosha gains with the NBC News uh Minister Gant what are the benchmarks for moving to the next phase of this war does that mean that you have to take out top Hamas leadership to be able to move on and what specifically is keeping Israel from moving to more precise and targeted operations against Hamas and then secretary Austin based on your experience in Iraq and what you discussed today what metrics should Israel be using to know that it's the right time to transition from major combat operations and what are the risk particularly to civilian protection and lastly would you say that Israel is on track for a strategic victory in Gaza uh you want me to go first always okay well Mo I will uh I I'll let uh Minister Gant speak to uh the elements of their campaign um and how they're going to conduct operation but I would tell you that you know we all know that any military operation any large scale military operation uh will have uh phases to its campaign and as you go from one phase to the next uh you know your your stance shifts a little bit your activity uh uh shifts a little bit because you're you you begin to focus on on different things and what those things are they'll be defined by by uh by the Israelis um but as you transition from one phase to another it doesn't mean that um that I mean that doesn't signal an end to the operation uh it it it sometimes means that you're being more more precise you're being or more F more focused on a specific Target set you're doing different things during that campaign uh for example on on in in one phase you may have a higher intensity fighting uh both air and ground in another phase uh you may shift a little bit and then and then uh provide more humanitarian assistance that while still focused on a discret set of targets again I'm not saying that that's what uh that's what they would be looking at going forward I will let the Israelis Define their uh their their campaign and the phases of the campaign for themselves but but in any operation like this any any campaign uh there will be phases and and the most difficult part uh is as you as you shift from one phase to the next making sure that uh that you have everything accounted for and you get it right so that's that's uh that's that requires detailed planning and very thoughtful planning and Sir over to you thank you uh the goals are the goals for the war that mean means that by the end of the war as long as it takes we need to make sure that we have our hostages back that we eliminate the Hamas abilities and that include destroying Hamas military capability and its ability to govern in in Gaza and it have certain parameters including the amount of Battalion uh battalions that we we need to dismantle and the the chain of command and and the Supreme military leadership and so for and so on the phases are the technique ER which is part of the plan that we have to to deploy in the in the area in order to achieve our goals and uh as secretary Austin said this is only the the way that we shape our plan in order to achieve the goals and uh as it happened in the battlefield the circumstan are changing you change your efforts and you do something different in a different phase and the intensity in the first phase is is given but in in other phases we will concentrate on certain issue for for instance the the engaging and and detecting the the Supreme leadership of Hamas and others so all and all H there is no uh there is not no ER uh clock that is running and uh we have to uh to obey a certain day but we need to get to different performances on the ground before we move to the to the next phase and I believe that we will find a proper time to do so and the most important issue as I mentioned in the beginning we will we will prevail we will dismantle Hamas otherwise we will not be able to exist and live in the way we want to live in this region because there is a price to deterr and they need to know that if they kill or kidnap 1500 people including kids and women this is the end of Hamas thank you very much everyone okay so you were just listening to a press conference being held in Tel Aviv that is the uh us defense secretary Austin standing alongside the Israeli defense minister yav Galant they were both addressing the media uh in Tel Aviv um here's some of what the Secretary of Defense the US Secretary of Defense had to say uh he did say that we will not impose conditions or Tim taes related to the Israeli War on Gaza on the issue of the uh threat that's coming from the Red Sea according to them it's a threat the US defense secretary said that we are building a coalition to address uh that threats from the Red Sea and uh one more issue that was raised in that press conference is uh hasbalah in Lebanon the US defense secretary as well as the Israeli defense minister saying that they uh call on hasbalah not to provoke a wider conflict so those were some of the uh sort of overarching messages that came out of that press conference let's bring in Bernard Smith he's joining us now uh from Tel Aviv so Bernard let's just first start with uh the military campaign Israel's war on Gaza what was said in ation to that and and um you know the US defense secretary as well as the defense minister was saying that they will transition into a a next phase what is that and what more did they say well there's obviously been a lot of talk before this that there is uh American eagerness us eagerness to see Israel transition to a less intense phase of the war to because of the high very very high number of Civilian casual uales that is uh that Israel's uh war is exacting and there's a lot of pressure uh on Israel from the US and from outside to reduce the number of CI civilian casualties so Lloyd Austin began his press conference uh really by saying by being of course fully backing Israel by being heavily critical of Hamas calling it one of the worst atrocities of modern terrorism what Hamas did on October the 7th but then he went on to say that democracies are stronger when we uph hold the laws of war and he said we will continue to ensure protection of civilians so there was there was no offer of a a deadline but um there was no suggestion of a time scale of when Israel should start uh reducing or changing its focus but there were indications that Israel is looking in that direction and even Galant himself said that we will continue to operate at different levels of intensity so the first hint there that things may change but no indication of any timeline presumably because the Israelis and the Americans don't want to give any timeline away to their enemy but clear emphasis that the US supports Israel in this battle and uh Bernard there were also some messages to uh the houthis in Yemen as well asbah in Lebanon and in fact let me add on to that apologies Bernard but Iran as well yeah yeah well there there is a risk there's a US fear of this conflict uh spreading wider in the region because of the iran-backed Armed groups uh not just in leban Lebanon but in Syria and in Yemen as well and on Lebanon he was asked if uh galand was asked if Israel is planning to invade uh Southern Le Lebanon to push Hezbollah back he said there is no plan to do that but we have 70,000 internal refugees he's referring to the Israelis displaced from their homes along uh the northern border along the border with Lebanon and he wants them to be able to go home so he says we're waiting for a diplomatic solution but they can't wait a long time and on the houes on uh the houthi attacks on shipping going through the Red Sea and heading up the seiz canal the US has said as we've hinted before there is exploring an option for a regional and international force a maritime protection Force in the Red Sea that will offer protection to shipping so it can because a lot of big shipping companies are diverting their ships down around the Africa Around the Horn of Africa it costs a lot of money uh and it delays shipping a lot there is reluctance that it's going to be a challenge to get the Gulf States and Egypt and Jordan to back this but the Americans want them to back it but you have already the Emirates emiratis and the Saudis uh looking to secure peace deals with the with the houthis in in Yemen so it's going to be challenging for them but the US wants their backing all right thank you Berard Smith for that update from Tel Aviv
