well let's now bring you up to date with what's happening on the ground in Gaza where the UN says some 600,000 displaced Palestinians are now Sheltering in un facilities as bodies continue to be pulled out from under the rubble hospitals in Gaza are nearing total collapse nearly half of the strip's 35 hospitals have now shut down Assad beg has more on the situation in [Music] Gaza throughout the night hospitals in Gaza receive steady flow of victims of Israeli air strikes afraid and in shock these children were at home one minute and being pulled from the rubber the next we were having dinner we had just put food on the table my sister was laughing I was talking to her suddenly a missile fell I thought it hit another house I put my hands over my head and started to say my last prayers I kept praying the Palestinian help Ministry says nearly half of gaza's 35 hospitals have been forced to close their doors those still operating are overstretched running out of Basics like bandages painkillers and disinfectant and perhaps more worrying fuel for generators people crowd outside believing this is the safest place to be for many Palestinians life now is about survival this family has split up so they're not all together in case of an Israeli air strike some families in Gaza have been completely wiped out if we die then at least some of us will be alive we put bracelets on to Mark each other just in case something happens I've seen bodies ripped apart you can't tell the victims apart if something happens and they are in pieces this way I will recognize them from these bracelets I will collect their body parts the young hair have to also face up to the possibility of being killed all my siblings are wearing these bracelets now we're separated half of us are in hunis and half in Gaza City this way we will all know each other if we're killed then my mother will be able to identify our bodies or if my mother and siblings get killed we will recognize theirs this is a daily reality for Palestinian families trapped in Gaza surrounded by death and the fear of not being able to recognize your loved ones if they are killed Assad bag Al jazer well let's bring in our correspondent Han buba who's on the ground there for us in kanun honey as we've been saying many hospitals have been on the verge of running out of fuel many have do we know how long the remaining hospitals can actually continue yes well there are more hospitals joining uh an a group of hospitals that are out of service uh for the past few hours and we know the crisis of fuel has made that process uh more quick and in the coming hours we're going to see more hospitals joining in uh the only uh uh remaining hospital as of now those who have a a a a store they have a reservation of a fuel just a little bit to keep them running uh till the end of the day uh at any moment uh more hospital will announce uh becoming out of service due to the lack of of fuel as well as a lack of medical supplies which put the life of many casual and patients at Jeopardy and as because it's uncertain of if if a fuel is going to be allowed into Gaza or not honey we know that the bombardment has been truly unrelenting tell us about what you've been seeing there over the last few hours and and what you've been hearing too from the doctors at the hospital yes well just speaking with doctors in the past few hours the situations are grave and they are only becoming worse as the the as we further into this war there are more casualties on the floor of the hospitals operations room are filled and and just to put you in a context uh we are joined with Dr Muhammad kandil who's the director of the emergency department at ner hospital just to tell us more about the situations in the hospital and how long Naser Hospital could survive the lack of of a f can you tell us more about the situations in ner Hospital in this this difficult time yeah for the last two weeks we are calling the human Community the international Health Organization are we are going to collapse actually to be honest literally the collapse has happened we have part of the uh Hospitals now without electricity we have the icus without electri without water now the health system is now almost most off the hospital corridors are fully backed with s with Wounded patient the hospital lecture hall are fully backed with the wounded patient uh the backyard of the hospital also fully backed with the wounded patient we putting patient everywhere we are buying bed from everywhere but still we are uh fully backed and we cannot compensate much more patient the uh Medical Supply most of it are off nothing came from outside nothing came I'm confirmed that nothing came from outside no medical AIDS and no Medical Teams and we still we still sending a call for a human for a Humanity but no Dr Muhammad we we understand that the hospital is overwhelmed uh with casualties and and and patience uh but can you tell us how are you managing with this large number of casualties particularly in in operation rooms and with the with the lack of of essential material what are what are your emergency plan in these difficult situations yeah I think the words cannot describe how bad are the situations so I'll give you some shots for example in in the last night we received 300 wounded patient we received 150 killed in the last night we did a cerian section for two women severely wounded in the emergency department uh we are managing the situation with something unusual with something extraordinary our medical our guidelines are not usual not regular in the routine day it's like a not allowed it's banned to use such policy but we are using policy because which is a strict I'll give you another shot young woman came with her with severe injury in her tumy and her intestin were outside so she were alive she were telling us what's her name and what we did for her only we give her some peaceful wordss we ask her to just relax and she's going to die she she was knowing that she's going to die within minutes and she did that's this is some shots of our situation my colleagues most of them received bad news about their families now the head of ICU department one of the ICU department he received the news about her his her his daughter sorry and entire of her family they were bombard and they are now still under the stone the Dr Muhammad with the extreme shortage of the fuel and and knowing there's so many hospitals are have have been shut down and and they don't have services to offer how long can ner Hospital survive with just limited amount of fuel available to run the power generator to be honest we we are not talking about regular Medical Services now you know the bti the people with heart attack the people with stroke the people with bad sepsis and their body are sending them home we said no no beds from the emergency they simply facing death we are not standing the health system now is not standing is not working if you see the hospital is open the door is open but what you can do for any patients with no medical supply with no ventilator with electricity which lagging on and off with no water and most important part of the hospital which is ICU so only the hospital door are opened and only some refugees coming in but the health system is collapsed already we cannot say we have a still we cannot work we don't have we cannot we cannot say that we can serve more patient this is all logic so literally the health system is shut off we don't have enough to offer to our patient either the wounded one or the regular medical patients thank you Dr Muhammad for joining us so this is these are the situations in the hospitals very dire very difficult doctors are making very difficult decision to decide whether whether to to save who to save and who to let go and with patience uh the the Hospital cannot receive more more patient into the hospital H AB there on the ground for us with that report from Kan yunes in the Gaza Strip thank you hany well let's bring in maub wary he's a professor of contempary Middle Eastern politics here at Kata University he joins me now in our Doha Studio Maj we know there's diplomacy going on but what does that actually mean for all the people that the families that we've been hearing about the people whose loved ones are on ventilated that are about to be turned off the diplomacy we are seeing in in the last few days needs to be more effective and decisive and talks directly about one major thing it's a Seas fire any diplomacy does not talk about this does not consider the following facts more than 6,000 people were killed half of them children and women more than 1,00 units people they live in being destroyed more than 44 hospital and Health Center has been demolished and more than um uh uh um um casualties every day on on people who are working in Health Service and civil service so with all of this on the table any debate any diplomacy does not talk about immediate ceasefire putting a pressure on Israel putting a pressure on Washington putting a pressure on the EU and United Kingdom that the people of the Palestinians does equal exactly the the the life of the Israelis if they want to have some credibility some respect some dignity they have to to call to immediate seiz fire opening the humanitarian corridors immediately allow the fuel to go in otherwise they don't have the right to ask about why people hate them the hatred is there there they can stop it now well we know that the UN has for instance been calling very loudly for fuel to be included in these Aid deliveries as I was discussing with Russell earlier though it does sound like there's the framework of some kind of of agreement being well a negotiated settlement and an idea floating around that that's being hashed out particularly by Regional leaders are you optimistic about that at all I think at the end of the day Regional leaders they are working in the context of international order I mean they they have a connection with with different players including the United States there are some limitation I think the focus now on um some uh arrangements to allow fuel fuel to go in uh but of course there is a lot of rejections and and from from the Israelis and I think it's the time where the United Nation uh which uh Gish did upset Israelis last night a lot is the time to put pressure on Israelis and ask them that you know getting the fuel in is actually allowing people sa to saving thousand of of of people's life I think it's also the time to remind the International Community that if they if they keep talking about you know all of these casualties all of this killing without having immediate action they will be blamed at the minute of not doing enough to stop this and also keep an and open for opportunity for people in Gaza to have the minimum of Life at least saving some other thousand of their lives and we're watching that death toll continue to rise in the meantime unfortunately M was wary they're a professor of contemporary Middle Eastern politics at catar University thank you for joining me here on
