Al jazu senior political analyst Maran Bashar is joining us now in the studio one of the fundamental elements of the case that the Israeli uh representatives were putting forward this morning was the degree to which that Israel was apparently supplying humanitarian Aid into Gaza one of them described it as a flood yes um you know it's uh in in in a kind of a theater of the Absurd this would be very funny I mean it's actually comical but then it's tragic um if I had a chance to capture that moment and frame it I would put it in my office for eternity this is what media is is made for in order to capture those moments expose them for what they are the lies of power right and that's why power needs to be questioned all the time you had these two kind of you know uh Grim characters appearing in the international quarter Justice making a defenseless defense uh indefensible uh of Israel and making such claims that everybody in the world knows to be false everybody in the world why do I say everybody in the world because even Israel's allies think it's false otherwise why would the Americans build a floating Port of the Gaza cost if Israel is flooding uh Gaza with Aid why would the um the wife of former Senator McCain a Republican senator a great friend of Israel she is a great friend of Israel but she's now the director or the head of the world uh food program why would she talk about famine in Gaza right why would the Europeans talk about famine in Gaza I'm talking about Israel's friends in Europe Germany France and so on so forth so so basically everyone knows we just heard from the UN in your own report earlier that Israel is closing in on on on Gaza Israel is is blocking aid from reaching Gaza the Americans have pleaded with the netan government to allow Aid to Gaza so despite all the testimony despite all the images despite all the reporting all the facts all the UN documents and still you would have an Israeli bureaucrat right come out and say we are flooding Gaza and it's worth mentioning that when she came to the end of her her presentation there was a woman in the gallery who shouted out liar at which point the feed uh was cut so even in the the icj itself there were members of the public who were not being convinced by what was being said but these things are very often fairly dry fairly uh as you say bureaucratic in their approach we've seen a different approach from Israel at the United Nation ations talk to us through what you see is the different different ways that Israel is representing itself in the um International court of justice compared to the United Nations so this is the thing right I mean if I could uh use any kind of analogy or metaphor it would be that was the circus right at the United Nations with the Israeli Ambassador doing his acrobatics rude obnoxious HPA like acrobatics and at the icj it was more of the theater of the Absurd just lie after lie after lie after lie just you know series of lies that easily debunked easily contradicted easily argued against and so on not convincing it is interesting though that the Israeli Ambassador at the United Nations is cocky the Israeli delegation the icj is koi cocki versus koi why why are they koi here and cocky there I think because the icj matters not because the icj is going to liberate Palestine or in the war in Gaza or uh force a ceasefire on Israel because you can do whatever you might do at the United Nations and basically the end of the day there's America and it can block any action at the icj it's about the moral and the legal standing and if the icj does take the position that there needs to be provisional steps against Israel that Israel is plausibly again carrying genocide Israel cannot withstand that but the same quickly that's why the SEC is also important because once you start calling those generals and at any criminals this is will not go away M Bashar thank you very much indeed make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
