well Kenneth Roth is a visiting professor at Princeton University he's also the former Executive Director of Human Rights Watch he joins us live now from New York welcome to Al jazer what do you make of the Israeli Army's conduct in the occupied West Bank in light of this current operation well clearly this is the largest military operation that we've seen in the West Bank in years I think the big issue really um as your correspondent just mentioned is you know what are the legal standards that are governing it um the ordinarily with Israel's endless occupation the standards should be those that apply to law enforcement to the police on the street and that means you know as the correspondent just said you cannot use lethal Force except as a last resort to meet an imminent lethal threat ordinarily you have to try to detain people now it looks like that's not what Israel is doing it is bombing away and indeed the Israeli foreign minister Israel Catz said this is is a war now in war you can just shoot the other side's combatants no need to try to capture them nothing about Last Resort so if Israel is now escalating its standards for the use of lethal Force to war standards that is a very grave development for the people of the West Bank now even in that case it still has a duty to do all take all feasible precautions to spare civilians the harm of armed conflict but it can just shoot to kill people whom it deems milit now that would be you know a big big step and I think the Secretary General and the UN are right to be pushing back on that because we've seen what that can mean for Gaza the last thing we need is for that to be replicated in the West Bank you mentioned Gaza there I me to what extent have the horrors of Gaza uh allowed Israel's operations in the occupied West Bank to happen almost under the radar as it were well I mean the world is horrified by what's happening in Gaza and you know rightful our our attention has been focused there but you know we shouldn't neglect the fact that you know quite apart from these kinds of raids by the Israeli military itself Israeli settlers have been routinely attacking Palestinian civilians at minimum doing it with the Israeli Security Forces just kind of closing their eyes to it often actively assisted by Israeli Security Forces so you know there has been a um really you know a degree of Violence by Israelis and Israeli forces that we just haven't seen in recent history and and it seems now to be getting worse what about the timing then of this particular operation in the occupied West Bank why now you know I mean it's so hard to put one's mind inside of netanyahu's you know clearly he is uninterested in peace in Gaza he keeps you know Finding ways to obstruct the ceasefire negotiations but you know one particularly worrying thing you know when we talk about you know possible parallels between Gaza and the West Bank in Gaza as we know the devastation caused by the Israeli military has forcibly displaced some 90% of the population and the two far-right Ministers of netanyahu's government smot Ridge and Ben Giver have talken openly about you know their interest in in just you know expelling 2 million Palestinians just removing them from the demographic balance sheet and pushing them into egpt now Egypt doesn't want that they've resisted but suddenly the Israeli foreign minister started talking about the need to displace people in the West Bank as well and I think we really have to nip that sentiment in the bud because the last thing we want is this kind of massive displacement taking place in the West Bank too and you know frankly the dream of the far-right ministers in netanyahu's government is to you know solve the problem of the West Bank solve the problem of the apartheid regime that Israel is maintaining there by just getting rid of the Palestinians now that would be you know a massive war crime but you know this is what you know certain members of the Netanyahu government whose votes in the knesset Netanyahu needs to stay in power this is what they talk about so you know again this is an urgent reason to nip this in the bud and not to let this continue down the path that we've seen in Gaza given what you said then how much pressure is Benjamin Netanyahu under at the moment especially domestically well you know domestically he seems to be able to get away with whatever he does so you know apart from the families of the hostages who are really upset with him for basically sacrificing the hostages to his end of this war in Gaza he doesn't seem to be under a lot of domestic pressure the big source of pressure that could make a difference is Joe Biden but Joe Biden you know says the right thing periodically he you know did stop delivery of the massive 2,000 pound bombs that were devastating Palestinian neighborhoods in Gaza but other than that it's a complete green light for ongoing arm sales ongoing supply of military aid and so you know Biden says the right thing but completely undermines it with what he does Kenneth Roth we very much appreciate your insights thank you thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel
