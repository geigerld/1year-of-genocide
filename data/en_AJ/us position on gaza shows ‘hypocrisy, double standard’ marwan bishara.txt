of course we've been uh saying for a number of months now that we are skeptical uh because there is no intention real intention on the part of Israel or the United States to push for a real ceasefire but over the past several weeks uh the United States rather the Biden Administration has began to change its Stone and its stance on the question of the ceasefire even abstaining uh at the United Nations security Council in favor of one and clearly there is a push on the part of the Biden Administration for something to materialize this is new what's also new is that the Israeli military is taking a bit of a nuanced position of late since the offensive against Rafa has not exactly been working that they also uh would like to see a ceasefire the only obstacle today to AAS fire is Netanyahu and his government everyone else including the kataris in the Egyptians and as I said the Americans but even the Iranians and all the Arab world and today we heard from hb's Chief Hassan nah saying that certainly his organization wants a ceasefire in Gaza so again everyone wants a ceasefire but not na government
