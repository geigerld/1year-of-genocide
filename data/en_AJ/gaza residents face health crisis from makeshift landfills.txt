we are here at the AL magazi camp in central Gaza this area has been transformed to a landfill you can see smoke columns billowing all over the place as a result of the citizens burning trash to keep it from piling up further we have dozens of tons of trash that are being burned here which is causing a significant Health crisis in the surrounding areas we are talking about health issues illnesses and inss that are spreading as a result of this scene that you can see here recently municipality Crews dumped soil on the trash in order to make room for additional quantities of waste bigest there are no landfills for the waste that is being generated by displaced people we will now talk to the head of Al magazi municipality Mr Muhammed mosle since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip garbage has been diverted from the licensed landfill managed by the Gaza municipality to this dump that you can see behind me the Alm magazi municipality and the United Nations relief and works agency started diverting all waste from the camp to this area because it is somewhat far from the population and located in the westernmost corner of the region it is also a large area and the municipality is dumping approximately 25 tons of waste here every day occupation forces prevented all our vehicles and all vehicles operated by municipalities in the central Gaza Strip from reaching the main landfill in order to dump all this waste unfortunately the presence of this garbage here constitutes an ecological disaster and causes very harmful effects to human health and the environment what is interesting is that you told me earlier that the area here was uninhabited however we can dozens of homes that are uninhabited by citizens as well as tents used by displaced people landfills should be located in the eastern part of Gaza in larger areas that are located farther away from the population so even if a fire breaks out in the landfill the smoke would not affect anybody however like I said accessing those other landfills requires coordination and occupation forces are not allowing municipality vehicles to access the those areas Mr Abu anas you are a resident of the area how are you living with this Health crisis this is my house there as you can see it sits across from the landfill we have been suffering from this dump since the beginning of the war all the waste that's coming from the magazi camp is dumped here it's a health Calamity there are mosquitoes there's insects there's flies and I'm talking about huge numbers that we simply cannot put up with there are displace people living in my house and in the surrounding homes as well we cannot sleep be it during the day or during the night and our suffering is massive there are lots of mosquitoes and they are very annoying not just to me but everybody here is annoyed by the mosquitoes mosquitoes are the worst and at night it is unbelievable the situation is dire we have a real Health Calamity on our hands make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
