let's speak now to Danny Danon who's a senior member of the knesset sits on Israel's Foreign Affairs and defense committee joins us live now from Tel Aviv Mr danam welcome to Al jazer so 48 hours in 600 Israeli dead 300 Palestinians dead it's just a terrible waste of life on all sides isn't it you cannot say all side basically we are still counting the casualties of the vicious barbaric attack which was provoked H we don't know the number there of the number of Israelis who were kidnapped into Gaza we have seen the footage of of kids when I'm talking about two years old kids who were dragged by Hamas militants into Gaza elderly that are sick are now in captivity so once we will know the numbers we will start to think about the next stage and the next stage will be retaliation against Hamas it will be painful but we are determined to protect ourselves and to make sure that it will not happen again we'll come to further Israeli action in just a second when you say unprovoked is it time now to consider as a matter of urgency the cause and effect here that people living under 56 years of military occupation of 15 years of blockade in Gaza of Israeli settler violence every day this is going to happen sooner or later so let's talk about let's talk about the facts we left Gaza 18 years ago completely you cannot find even one Jewish community in Gaza today you don't have a single Jewish Home in Gaza and look what happened Hamas took over expelled the Palestinian Authority and the people of Gaza under the occupation of Hamas so when you speak about they live under they completely trapped inside The Enclave why you don't blame the Egyptians so why why you don't blame the Egyptians you have a border in in Rafa with Egypt they can bring from Egypt whatever they want they can live toward Egypt why you comeing blame Israel I I think you shouldn't look for logic when you deal with Hamas it's exactly like Isis alqaeda when you deal with radical Muslim militants don't look for reasoning for excuses for Logics they will always come against us when you talk of further action from Israel what form do you think that is going to take are we talking a ground incursion well I think the government will have to declare the exact purpose of of the operation my opinion that the goal should be to eradicate Hamas completely we will do a big favor for the people of Gaza who live under the occupation of Hamas the billions of dollar that many Arab countries and European countries contribute to Gaza will not go to digging tunnels will go for infrastructure for Education look what happened in the last few years they took all the money and they build the military capability to attack Israel exactly like they did yesterday you must be concerned that despite all the security there is around Gaza all the surveillance that takes place to uh the intelligence that goes on that killing and death at this scale Could Happen absolutely you know we marked the 50th anniversary of the Yum kipur War when we were CAU by surprise and unfortunately it happened again you know the Hamas used another another Jewish holiday to attack us but we in the past prove that we know to to stand up to get together and to get the strength to come together and to fight and that exactly what's happening today the people of Israel left all the discussions we had and the argument we put it aside and today we are United standing together willing to fight evil willing to to fight Hamas and we will defeat evil but how how about the failure of intelligence that allowed this to happen well you know I I we have to look into that and do the inquiry but but one of the problem was that we we allowed many protest and riots to get very close to the fence and Hamas took advantage of that to put explosives next to the fence to to dig tunnels to the fence I think in the fure future we will have to take into consideration that no one should get even closer to the fans all right we'll leave it there Danny Don on thanks very much indeed for your time thank you let's bring in our senior political analyst Mar bishar joins us now from Paris and Marin dare say that you were listening into to that this is the thing isn't it I mean this has been going on for so long and it's reached this scale and it surely is time now to look at the cause and effect absolutely and you know you and I were speaking earlier and one of the biggest problem for us in the media especially uh visual like television and so on is that we are too constrained by the present and we're looking at images and we will understand them right this moment and probably most of us on in television our memory you know dates back 24 hours okay maybe 48 Hours the problem for uh something like this is that there's a 100 years and more of History uh for this conflict now we don't have to summarize 100 years of of history but certainly we need to uh signal that uh that there is uh you know a root cause for the issue and unlike what the uh former Ambassador says uh it is totally logical uh for the occupied to resist his occupier and and I kind of jued down if you allow me Nick just couple of quick points and this is not you know to argue with the Ambassador behind his back as it were but just to make generally speaking some points clear because we've he we've heard the Sound by again and again as you said and as he answered unprovoked you know Israel has been an occupying power as we said again and again for more than five decades and it and it does every day in the occupied territories what Hamas did in the southern part of Israel but not necessarily on the same scale meaning Israeli soldiers Israeli armed settlers roam Palestinian towns and Villages and refugee camps and terrorize the heck out of the pal Ians and that happens every day every year every decade for the past so many decades so it is provoked the second thing is when he said we withdrew from Gaza they did not withdrew they withdrew the settlers from Gaza but they redeployed outside Gaza and they've been besieging Gaza ever since again back to the logic he says there is no logic but Israel withdrew its uh settlers from Gaza and redeployed its soldiers out of Gaza only under the threat of force by Hamas Israel would not have left Gaza if it wasn't for the logic of force by Hamas to basically kick them out and they succeeded in doing that at least partially so there is logic to Palestinian resistance and then there is the issue of we left Gaza so why are the gazans resisting imagine if Israel would be occupied and they would be left only part of it and they say okay you now we can leave the other to be occupied gazin are Palestinians most of them are refugees from his Palestine if you redeploy AR Gaza doesn't mean it's okay for you to occupy Jerusalem to occupy the West Bank and so on so forth so it's not okay to occupy the rest of the Palestine if you only redeployed AR of Gaza so yet another point and he says once again we're going to eradicate Hamas Israelis have said that forever if for every time I heard that I'd have a dollar I would probably be a millionaire by now the last four Wars the Israelis promised that they're going to eradicate Hamas for the past five decades they have promised that they're going to eradicate Hamas four Wars later Hamas is only getting stronger and stronger and stronger compare this war with the 2008 War there's no comparison Hamas is far more sophisticated far more deadly and clearly far more terrorizing of Israel than ever before and just one last Point quickly just to say that Hamas did not exist before the Israeli occupation Hamas while it is Palestinian it is the product it is the baby born of the Israeli occupation Hamas is the product of the occupation it only existed as of 1987 20 years after the occupation has deepened in Palestinian society that Hamas came to existence so Hamas is a product of the occupation if the occupation ends I'm not sure what the Palestinians would produce probably more liberals there so you say as we discussed and I discussed with with Danny D on that Palestinians have been provoked there's no question they have been perhaps they've been forced into this you can argue H but the scale of death and the seemingly indiscriminate way it was carried out that was not a good tactic was it well but certainly it is tactic because look uh this is not a a conventional war between two armies or between two states this is asymmetrical war and allow me just a few seconds to explain that to our viewers around the world asymmetrical Warfare means that the two sides have totally different standards of how they measure their successes and failures and totally different values of what does it mean to struggle the cliche goes Israelis defend their civilians Palestinian Fighters hide behind their souvenir which is not true but kind of the image gives that impression but it's the population in Gaza that protects its Palestinians and now that the Israelis bombard Gaza Hamas is going to get more popular not less popular so while they think they're going to eradicate Hamas in fact Hamas will become stronger but the Netanyahu government is becoming weaker after the attack by Gaza so this is an asymmetrical Warfare with totally different means and tools and values and means this not the same thing so we cannot be judging them according to Interstate International standards we judge them according to asymmetrical standards because they are very different one is resisting occupation does not have Air Force does not have missiles does not have an army and certainly does not have nuclear power so their way of resisting is completely different and I argue that they yes they use Terror they're not terrorist organizations but like all Guerilla movements around the world for the past two three centuries gorilla movements and different Liberation movements use Terror Hamas uses Terror Hamas terrorized the pal the Israeli population the sou paza they should own up to it because it is an asymmetrical conflict within an asymmetrical all right that's our senior political analyst m b thanks my
