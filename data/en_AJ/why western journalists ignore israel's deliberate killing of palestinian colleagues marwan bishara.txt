let's bring in Maran bashara Al jaer senior political analyst he joins me now from London Maran as we were just hearing there from Honda these journalists aren't just covering the story they're living the story Yes actually I've uh in one of those times when I was watching U I remember him uh reporting about children's starvation and how children were telling him that um that they were uh starving that there was no food and so on so forth and how he felt compelled himself not to be not to eat it's that much the the living conditions on Gaza that basically end up um eating up our journalists and other journalists in Gaza because they are part and parcel of the fabric of the society they're not parachuted there they know exactly uh the type of society they live in a ref a society of refugees a concentration camp of sort they grow up there and they go to the available schools and University like is they study as he did journalism and of course his fellow uh Road uh uh traveler as it were in the camp Romy again a cameraman you know through their lenses and through their eyes we've been able to see the tragedy unfold the starvation the children and we've seen the reporting from the hospital and we've seen them arrested as they reported from Alani hospital and end up being tortured and uh now they're assassinated though so it's tragic in every possible way but again it's just as tragic as what is happening to each and every one of their family member of their co- Palestinian brothers and sisters living in Gaza or dying in Gaza Maran we've been hearing a lot about Israel's patterns here of targeting journalists and and not just journalists but as we were saying earlier to healthcare workers Aid workers but specifically when we look at at the attacks on the Press clearly Israel has been trying to strategically change a narrative has that been successful well clearly it has not been successful uh the message is getting out and Palestinians not just journalists by the way but Palestinians themselves with their little uh cell phones are able to tell their stories and a lot of these stories are reaching out through various forums and that's why you know Israel its friends wants to close down the likes of Tik Tok and other whereby the message is getting out to people but certainly the likes of jazer is really able to have a wider audience reaching living rooms everywhere and yes laptops and so on so forth so in the end of the day the message has got out uh but but I think the logic of the of this pattern of killing is not just um logical there's something sadistic about what Israel is do right I mean there's a lot of good explanations political explanation for example why they killed hania right or why they continue they don't want a ceasefire they want a regional War there's a fanatic fascist government that is bent on violence and they live off violence and and they gain popularity and legitimacy within their own ranks through violence but this sort of a targeting of journalists is not helping and that's why I wonder for example why Israeli journalists are not talking about that and let me be very clear here I am against the killing the targeting the harming of any journalist anywhere Israeli journalist American journalist Arab journalist whoever they are but when you are a witness to more than 160 journalists are getting killed few kilometers from you in Israel why aren't the Israeli journalists speaking out because at least in terms of Journalism even if you do support your government shouldn't you be talking in in in in un uh filtered terms about the killing of journalists shouldn't Israeli journalists American journalist British journalist be talking just like other journalists now are increasingly talking about the horrific crimes that are being carried out in G if the international court of justice took the case of Israel's genocide if the international criminal court are pursuing Israeli leaders or the persecutor for war crimes why aren't journalists talking about what is happening to their fell journalists and here I'm talking about Israeli journalists American journalists and others they need to speak out far more than they have because it's their governments that's either carrying those crimes or aiding and abetting the car con I just heard today secretary blink said we have no part in this meaning in the assassination I'm sure they have no part in the killing of our fell journalist but they have every part to play in this by arming financing and shielding Israel the United States is responsible for the killing of journalist in Gaza because it is the one that's arming financing and shielding Israel or rather this fanatic government as it carries its crimes in Gaza Maan if indeed word is getting out because of of the Brave reporting we've seen from the ground in Gaza you mentioned earlier that there has been a shift in public opinion around this do you think that we could see any kind of tangible political consequence to to the reporting that we've seen you know there will be eventually the question is will it be too late because people are dying every day in Gaza people are starving every day in Gaza and and the rest of it right I don't want to repeat every tragedy that is happening to every Palestinian family today in Gaza and the West Bank and elsewhere so it it's it's just that it has to happen sooner rather than later and we really cannot wait until every other person organizes and they have been organized we've seen the mass demonstrations in most western cities and throughout the world we've seen Young Generation over campuses and universities so we've seen public opinion Rises to the occasion the problem is a good number of influential governments are not and why when you look at some of the faces or some of the Declarations you think they're stupid but I have news for you blinkin Biden sunak and today's St and and the rest of them they're not stupid they're very smart in fact but they're C they're cynical they're cynical because they're allowing this to happen under the pretext of whatever they have always emphasizing that they are concerned concerned concerned we are tired of hearing the word concerned as our fellow journalists as our colleague are killed by the Israeli military machine concerned is no longer good enough they are smart they know what's going on they're cynical they need to stop being cynical because the Strategic calculus is not working out the political calculus is not working out a ceasefire has to happen and it's not just seizing the fire the Israel has to seize the crimes it has to seize the genocide it has to seize the starvation it has to seize the killing of journalists M bashara the aler
