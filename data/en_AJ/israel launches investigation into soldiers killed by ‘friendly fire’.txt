in Gaza where fierce battle is underway in the north of the strip the Israeli military says five of its soldiers have been killed and seven injured in Friendly Fire incidents in jabalia but Hamas has released this video saying 12 Israeli soldiers have died in January Israel declared it had dismantled Hamas battalions in jabalia we'll have Israeli reaction very shortly Muhammad Jam Jun is standing by in a man in Jordan but first let's cross over T Abu aom who's in De abala in central Gaza so as the sun rises uh Tark uh the overnight death toll Rises and the focus continues to be now up in the north of the Gaza Strip yeah that's right so hell the Israeli military is completely focusing now in two main areas across this trp jabalia in the north and draa and the far more south South City in this trp now in the north jabalia is considered to be from the Israeli perspective one of the strongest stronghold of Hamas movement where they are trying to chase all the Palestinian armed groups there in order to militarily dismantle the fabric within that area but battles have been described to be completely violent and aggressive specifically that the Israeli military has announced the death of five Israeli soldiers while seven others being injured and those who have been injured have been transferred to Israeli hospitals to receive Medical treatment but the nature of the fighting there sounds critically hard and difficulty due to the narrow streets of the camp and the unprecedented scale of Destruction being caused by the Israeli ongoing intense military bombardment of the camp there were 100,000 Palestinians according to the United Nations have fled from the camp to the western side of Gaza City where emergency workers today managed to evacuate and to recover 30 Palestinian bodies were found killed in Israeli at attacks on the main Central neighborhoods of Gaza Strip including aabra a zun and a sahaba neighborhoods in the central areas of Gaza City of there so help T resum there for us with that update thanks very much TK he's there in De Al Bala Let's cross over to Aman in Jordan where Muhammad Jam junor is standing by for us hi Muhammad uh deaths of those Israeli soldiers up in the north do affect the public perception of what's going on really in Gaza and it causes evergo arguments it seems within the Israeli government too that's right Z let me first just mention what little we've heard thus far from the Israeli government regarding this particular incident which is being called a friendly fire incident in which five Israeli soldiers uh were killed as a result there was a statement from the Israeli Army that says from the initial investigation it appears that the tank fighters from this paratrooper company identified a gun barrel coming out of one of the windows in a building and directed each other to shoot at that building we expect we'll be getting more about that particular in inent in the hours to come now why is this something that is uh being focused on so much in Israel right now it's because there is mounting worry being expressed by not just military leaders in Israel but also by the public in poll after poll questioning as to if the Israeli military campaign in Gaza is being conducted correctly one of the reasons these questions are being asked is because the public is seeing that Israeli military battalions are going back into parts of AA like in the north for example where they had previously fought Hamas Fighters where they had issued statements in which they said that the area had been cleared of Hamas Fighters so this is really showcasing to the Israeli public that the the military campaign in Gaza is not going nearly as well as they had said it would um this is happening at a time when we're seeing more and more military leaders that are questioning publicly um what exactly is going to be going on in Gaza after the war is finished uh also you have milit AR leaders that have been quoted unnamed military leaders but military leaders nonetheless throughout the Israeli media landscape the last several days in which they are saying that there needs to be a plan put in place for how Gaza is going to be governed they are also saying that the Israeli uh government needs to be adhering to the advice of the Americans they are concerned about the fact that the Americans have said that they are not going to be shipping more weapons potentially if the ra Invasion continues to go ahead they are worried about what this means for the war in Gaza as well as potential other conflicts on other fronts clearly the military concerned the public concerned even though in poll after poll the majority of the Israeli public continues to say that they back the war effort they are increasingly questioning as to how that war effort is being conducted and one of the things that's making them question this is the fact that they are seeing more and more soldiers killed and they are seeing more and more military units go back into areas they had previously said they had cleared of Hamas Fighters so Hill M Jam Jun therefore is in man in neighboring Jordan thank you and we're just
