I mean, we are entering [music] famine. We are reaching a point where people are starting to gather together in order to eat. The children of Palestine have tasted it, and I see that the war has remained. I mean, if one of the children of the world lives, he will feel that this day has passed his life. all from here, Dad, about us, Netanyahu, when he calms down. Of course, Basir Hussein was raised.  I feel that there will no longer be a place for us because it is Rafah, but what remains is ours. Rafah. Of course, your life before the war was very nice. I used to go to school, my friends and I would go to the sea. Since I was young, I did not love and I loved to do anything. [Music] Something, I walk, my son, I walk, I hold my pants and I walk in them. These are my pants, which remained in the 56 camp. They called me Newton. Gaza, take a bag, give it. Oh, you liked it. I mean, we didn't work well. I invented a wire lock, and the last invention, I mean, was this [music] fan.  The fan with the wind energy, with a speed that is comfortable, it is damaged, it is damaged, it generates energy for us, so the energy that is generated passes through the wires and descends into the tent, lighting up [music] The tent entertains us in the first place in many things in the heat, and we have known many types of airplanes and weights in war. The safe corridors we have known in war. Hayman Al-Hah It means that you are running into a decomposing corpse while you are displaced, as if you are escaping from a ghost city. It is definitely a very scary feeling that it might happen to us like what happened in this jet. It means, for example, that I am sleeping, so I cover my face out of fear, and it means that I am intoxicated and did not hear.  The sound of the bomber sleeping, good night, in fear that at any moment, this force could fall in the tent, burning the whole tent. While we are sleeping, at night, it means you get tired, it means with fear, I mean, whoever sees it, he will die slowly. Go, let's play rat. Imagine. Let's go.  We get up and what did your sister see? We tell each other what her dreams are about eating, and I imagine that the bed net is picking up on her name. The smell of Ramadan. A long time ago had a smell about her. It is expensive. It is cod. More than the days of the past. More than the last Ramadan. I saw how we were last Ramadan. I cook it with meat. Everyone who claims what is paid.  In it, as much as we used to pay for Ramadan, be silent like our sweet kitchen, our sweet refrigerator, and a long table of 12 chairs, our memories that are in it, oh how sweet they are, how sweet they are, goodness and blessings are the oven we have, oh God, this, oh lost one, is an oven O listener, the Israeli army has raised the level of readiness for operations.  The wilderness in Rafah and the camps in the middle of the Gaza Strip. Help me. Come on, take the small ihram. I go back on my bed, on my bed, on my bed. I sleep in them, not in the tent like this. Two days ago, at night, at night at night, we woke up to this bombing and we found fire and shrapnel and things. This is nothing, nothing is anything.  By God, there is nothing wrong with you went to a doctor and he told me that you are infected with hepatitis because of the junk food that you are eating. I was hoping that before I got sick, he would fulfill my dream and that he would complete the Al-Nadhi project and the whole camp that I live in.  And I will continue to attend until the illness in me ends, and I will return until I complete my project. My brain is cramped. A lot of course. I lost things in the war. My house, which all my memories are in, was destroyed. This is the war that is happening in the metaphorical sense, and that no one means to take into account the children of Gaza. Of course, we ourselves are living.  Freely like the bugs of the children of the world
