political analyst mwan Bish uh Madan I think you know we're hearing very much an Israeli perspective of not just someone whose relative is being held in in in Gaza but also you know very much the Israeli perspective of of this War I want to know if you think that the Israeli government is in any way prioritizing the captives well uh just to be clear uh it's a terrible thing it's a terrible thing that an 84 yearold is held captive in Gaza just as we feel for the families who lost who lost countless children and mothers and sisters 20,000 plus children in Gaza we also feel the for the old people and for the young people who are held captives there's absolutely no doubt about that one cannot prioritize human suffering and I feel for Daniel just like I feel for ad or Muhammad in Gaza but there is a political issue involved here one has to be very clear about the humanitarian but also one has to be very clear about the political in today's newspaper editorial today the paper a mainstream paper accused Benny Gans who was supposed to be the moderate in the war cabinet of lying to the Israeli people when he says that we are attacking Rafa to save the captives M accused him of lying because he is lying Netanyahu is lying Eisen Cott is lying they are lying when they say we do not accept the captive uh prisoners deal in order to serve the captives and you're saying that because I think it's only something like three Israeli captives how the number of Israeli captives that have been uh rescued in Israeli operations compared to the number that were released through a ceasefire agreement it pales in comparison it's insignificant isn't it absolutely absolutely no and it's it's actually much worse than that of course one of them was not held with Hamas the first one and they killed a two of them holding White flags and so on so forth so no I mean this doesn't even compare Israel's policy towards its own captives has been criminal but it was clear from day one Netanyahu and his work and they said we number one is defeating Hamas number two is the captives and they are have gone along that way for the past seven months and in the process they've killed countless Palestinians so once again while we identify with the suffering of any Israeli we have to bear in mind that more than 100,000 casualties have already paid the price with the total Destruction of Gaza Gaza today is not H hostage by Hamas Gaza today is held hostage by Israel because Hamas accepted the deal that was provided to it by the United States Yeah by Bill Burns the director of the CIA and let me say something which I which I find quite uh disturbing uh and I think something needs to be looked at and I haven't seen many much on it Bill Burns is a 40-year-old Diplomat who worked for both Democratic and Republican administrations I've just finished his book back Channel he's a very very seasoned Diplomat that knows very well the Arab world I think when he reached that deal he reached the final deal that basically should have been accepted by Israel after it was accepted by Hamas because he did not offer something from the top of his mind the fact that we are now going back again to the cycle of diplomacy as if nothing happened two days ago it tells me that there's a problem in Washington not just in t Aviv yeah that's exactly what I was going to ask you what game is Netanyahu playing by saying that the deal that Hamas agreed to is not one that Israel agreed to when it was put to Hamas by Qatar and Egypt and the US which surely wouldn't put a deal to Hamas that the you know that Israel wouldn't agree to Netanyahu is known in international circles and Israeli circles as the ultimate liar he a pathological liar and he does not want a ceasefire he wants a total war in Gaza on Gaza on Palestine and he wants a total occupation of of Gaza that's what he wants but that's not my problem I we've known that for the past seven months I am talking about something different here I am saying that's expected for metano what is not expected is why is Bill Burns being stabbed in the back by his own Administration that's what I'm talking about why didn't blinkin support Bill Burns the past 48 Hours when Bill Burns came back with a deal that should have been accepted because Bill Burns accepted it face value as this is the deal yeah this was the American deal as I said he is far more uh experienced than blinkin the Secretary of State he's far more seasoned Diplomat he knows the region and he knows Israelis and Palestinians All Too Well when he reached that deal it was on the basis that the Egyptians the Israelis the kataris and Hamas are on board now the fact that then this was rejected with some hyper hyperbolic Language by Netanyahu without him being supported by his own Administration yeah so the question a problem yeah so the question then isn't why did Netanyahu do that it's why isn't the US Administration supporting their head of intelligence absolutely and here there's a good number of um I don't know educated guests my my first educated guest and that's why today the state department once again post not once again it postponed a deadline to answer the simple question is Israel violating American law and international humanitarian law everyone in the world knows Israel is violating International but anyway apparently it's a very complicated report that they said the be that as it may blinkin has gone out of his way for the past seven months to justify Israel's war crimes and to defend Israel no matter what the case is and he has the president's ear now the president is already a self- declared Zionist but the president has his presidency at stake at this point in time as Senator Sanders said this is his Vietnam he will be like Johnson a one-time president if he continues on the same path secret uh director Burns brought them a deal that is excellent for everyone and could wind down the war and bring the the H hostages the captives back and release prisoners and end the unfolding genocide in Gaza Israel rejected it and the United States did not stand behind its director of intelligence of the C of CIA which is I think problematic even in terms of not just what happened the past 3 days but also what's going to happen in the next two 3 days and 3 weeks cuz every if every time Burns William Burns is going to reach a deal that's going to be torpedoed by the Israelis and the Biden Administration is not going to stand for it then what are we doing in in Cairo and Doha and T Aviv yeah what are we doing I'm I'm told we'll run out of time for this one sure but stop giving me answers that beg more questions for now that is our senior political analyst Maran Bashar make
