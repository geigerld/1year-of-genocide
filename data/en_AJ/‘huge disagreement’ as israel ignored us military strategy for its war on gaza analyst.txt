hamas's military Wing has aired a video of what it says is the killing of three Israeli soldiers operating in Gaza on Wednesday the video showed a group of soldiers being targeted by snipers several times the attack took place north of bate hanon the Israeli Army didn't confirm the attack since October 7th Israeli military's confirmed the killing of 614 soldiers in Gaza after more than 7 months of War Israel has still not achieved it stated goal of eliminating Hamas this month saw Fierce fighting in jabalia in Northern Gaza after the Israeli Army went back to areas where it had said Hamas had regrouped the US based newsite Politico reports that only 30 to 35% of Hamas Fighters were part of the group before October 7th have been killed and about 65% of its tunnels are still intact this according to American intelligence it also reported concerns from us officials that herass has been able to recruit thousands of Fighters during the war and the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has criticized Israel for failing to prevent Hamas from taking back areas it once controlled let's get more in this now with William Lawrence a professor of international relations the American University joins us now from Washington what can you tell us about the conversation or perhaps even the concern there in Washington about Israel's military strategy in Gaza well right from the beginning there hasn't been much agreement between the US and uh and Israel you may remember that it sent in its Commander from the mul operation seeing mosul maybe as the most similar recent military operation by the US in which the US managed not to kill a lot of Iraqi civilians and Purge Isis from um uh from Iraq and or at least this urban areas of Iraq and most of Iraq and Israelis basically didn't take that um that strategy to heart um and while they do have mechanisms to avoid killing civilians didn't Implement their own policies either and uh and ended up killing you know at least 16,000 civilians by their own admission and probably many more uh and so um there's a huge disagreement between the US and Israel on strategy now the us as you probably know is withholding heavy bombs withholding intelligence not supporting the Rafa operation other way because the us both on the intelligence side and on the military strategy side doesn't agree with Israel's approach uh to defeating Hamas even though the US agrees uh to some degree in the idea of Hamas no longer governing Gaza uh it really believes the strategy is all wrong but it's not really prepared to follow that up with solid action despite what you say about the concern there in Washington it's very difficult to believe that there is an absolute wholehearted support for Israel when they have supplied Israel billions of dollars worth of weapons and funding and after the deaths of over 35,000 people in Gaza including 15,000 kids and 880,000 injured um if I could just make one point there the UN has revised down its uh its estimate of how many children were killed to around 8,000 still a lot of children yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's horrible uh and 8,000 more than it should have been uh but but back to the um the strategy at hand the US uh has given more or less a card blanch to Israel does continue armed shipments to Israel of of the lighter weapons the tank weapons uh etc etc and so from a Palestinian perspective it's absolutely clear that the US is doing next to nothing to save them from the onslaught of the Israeli forces um but from an American perspective we have the worst relationship with Israel we've had in my lifetime uh and the amount of disagreement uh between the US and Israel strategy Grows by the day uh to the point that the US is building a $230 million Pier off the coast just to get around Israel's refusal to feed the Palestinians uh and and all these other things the US is trying to do kind of to have its cake and eat it too in an in that make I mean as an American you know a professor of of course you've studied these issues for a very long time but I mean you the America sacrificing its own political um security Regional interest for the sake of Israel has it sort of reached a threshold that you you wouldn't have predicted I would say since 2008 the US policy began to change on Palestine and it will finish changing within the next 10 years or so maybe more maybe less but my whole life the US has given carp lunch support to Israel most of the time no matter how bad things got and now we have about 25% of Americans half the Democratic party that are disgusted with what the US is doing and that over time is going to change the US policy but for me you know back in the day in the 80s a lot of us the old guard of pro Palestinian Americans we were alone you know there were very few of us probably 1% of the population then it was 5% now we're at about 25% of Americans who are disgusted with this policy towards uh Palestine which defies international law defies US foreign policy um uh better objectives and ruins our relationships with the world and with the region for the reasons you said uh but it's a long slow slog to get where we are now and it's going to take more of a slog to finish getting there it something that did change with the Biden Administration is they started to to say things like a Palestinian life is equal to an Israeli life something they' never said before and they're actually increasing humanitarian assistance and stopping arms which never happened before uh but it hasn't gotten to the point where the US has the courage or The Willpower to say to Israel stop fighting the war this way not only does it make everybody less safe Palestinians uh and the whole region but it makes you less safe as Israelis because you're creating another generation of res ful Palestinians who are going to want to exact revenge on you all right thank you very much uh Professor William Lawrence for joining us there from
