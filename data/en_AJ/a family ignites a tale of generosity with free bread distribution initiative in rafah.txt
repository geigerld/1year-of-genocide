my name is rafid Hussein Al a resident of Rafa I live near the area where displaced people from Gaza are taking Refuge they don't have cooking gas no water they have nothing they live in tents I welcomed them into her home and I have built them a mud oven I provide them with portable water there is no other place where we can bake oven wood is expensive and not always available but we come to the house of Al Aja and we bake at the house we don't have any utensils Allah bless them they gave us what we need they gave us water as well we bake our bread there and I personally cook there I hope this anguish is removed and this war comes to an end so we can return to our homes and I hope we can invite everyone who stood by our side and supported us I have been displaced from Gaza to Rafa we have tents at montaza and we bake bread at our neighbors Al arja family of course it's been difficult it took a while until we found flour to bake the situation is tragic and unlike what one would imagine thanks to God we found these people who welcomed us into their home not just us but also all others this oven can be used for free by all the people in this neighborhood the AL are well known for their kindness and we have been fortunate to come across them make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al
