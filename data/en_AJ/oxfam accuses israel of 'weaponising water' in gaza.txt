where once they played and dreamed children now carry water in any container they can find when they can find it I carry a heavy load and I'm not used to carrying heavy things I'm 11 years old I'm too little I walk a long distance from the tents to get water I do several trips back and forth and I get drenched as I walk in the sun clean water is a precious resource in Gaza but water stations like this one have run dry some are Switched Off for days or weeks at a time so there is never enough water to go around and that means children have to walk longer distances to find a top that's working my name is Huda we have been displaced to De Al Bala we are having difficulties with water sometimes we find it sometimes we don't no one helps me carry the bucket to the tent fetching water exhausts me we queue in the Sun and my head starts a tanker brings clean drinking water here once a day it's nowhere near enough though some people get water most do not all we have are these children and they're shouldering the responsibility they have to fetch water and do the laundry and wash after that they go to the Sea which is up to 5 km by foot just to get a little water I swear the other day we had to walk to fetch sea water to drink International charity oxfarm says Israel has been systematically weaponizing water against Palestinians in Gaza showing disregard for human life and international law the results of that weaponization are clear everywhere you look Altin make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al zero
