well Adnan Abu hasna is a spokesperson for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees or H joins us now live from Rafa good to have you with us so today like many other days we're hearing more reports of residential buildings being hit a refugee camp in jabalia being hit again what sort of Carnage is this creating from what you can tell from I assume you still have operations on the ground there yes I believe that destroying you know jabalia cam again and again you know would result in more frustration more anger more Panic you know actually as you as we see in your report that people they don't know where to go actually everything had been uh destroyed you know yes we have uh some colleagues still you know uh providing services in health clinic and in the shelters uh there we have nearly I'm talking about across the G stri we have nearly 1.2 million internally displaced persons in our shelters across the GM some of them are in jabalia area and in Gaza City I can tell you that the humanitarian situation now it's not a catastrophe you are talking about humanitarian tsunami actually these areas people lack of everything lack of food drinkable water even hospitals you know they're partially working now now they don't have the capacity to receive to receive fatalities or injured people across the northern part of dri Adan I'm wondering because I know usually Anda has channels of communication for Israel has Andra requested that Israeli forces cease bombing civilian areas refug refug camps and what kind of response do you get you know we are sending to all parties of the conflict you know or the location the exact location of the GBS and of our shelters our his clinics and to the Israeli side you know so no one can tell us after that that we don't know that you have uh you know tens of thousands people Sheltering and these schools all the time we are sending the the exact location to the Israeli Israeli Army actually we don't have we don't receive responses and despite that there have been reports of un schools having been hit in places like jabali refugee camp right yes of course and alur school as example had been ha I believe twice or three three times you know all the time but in all over G across the STP we have 85 you know installations including shelter that had been had 30 of them had been hit directly and resulted in the killing of 218 people and injured nearly 900 people from our staff as unra as un staff nearly 130 staff had been killed since the start of this escalation has onra ever experienced something like this at now never ever we never experience you know something like that even the UN itself you know nothing happened like that in the history that the 130 stuff the UN had been killed in 50 days it never happened you know I personally I am with unra you know and I survived three Wars before that I what it's horrible it's something un beli the the amount of Destruction you know people that had been killed and and injured I'm looking that some figures of uh that's coming from Ukraine about how many people that had been you know killed I mean civilians last August they are talking about 9,000 people 9,000 civilians that had been killed and 16,000 that had been injured now we are talking in Gaza about 60,000 people that had been killed or injured or missed actually no one can rescue them they are under the rub you are talking about 3% of Gaza population that had been killed and injured if you have a country of 50 million people you will talk about 1.5 million people that had been you know killed and it's unbelievable what's going on we know during the humanitarian ceasefire or pause that happened Aid was being delivered is Aid still being delivered today and if so are you able to distribute it at a time when it's becoming more and more desperate because people are being pushed into smaller and smaller areas in the South and everything is becoming there's a shortage of everything we're hearing from toilets to drinking water yes there is a like you know a glimpse of hope during the humanitarian pause that we succeeded you know to send you know food medic and fuel to the northern part of Gaz St but unfortunately after it ended you know we went again to square number one you know where huge Shilling and distruction and many people had been injured you know nearly seven you know 700 people had been killed since the the end of the humanitarian post now they are pushing you know people not only to the South pushing people to the south of the South so we have now we expected that we will have in Rafa here more than 1 million people you know in the coming days actually now we have tens of thousand families in the streets they are erecting you know random things you know pieces of nylon and and wood it's raining now and we will see the disaster after so if I understand you correctly you're unable no Aid is coming in at this point is that what you're saying as these people sleep under nylon in the rain part yeah no to the northern part and Gaza City are not sending anymore because the Israelis they are cutting off all the roots but you know it is coming through RAF crossing point we are talking about a average of 50 trucks it's about 5% only of the needed trucks or the needed Aid that we used to get through Shalom but why because you know ra pring point is is not f up for you know commercial like commercial CR it's for bit strains only so the capacity of Rafa pressing point will never meet the needs of Gaza population now we are getting 5 50 trucks 60 truck 70 trucks and they want us to to distribute it to more than two million people I believe we will continue like that that humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip will for very all right thank you so much Adan Abu there
