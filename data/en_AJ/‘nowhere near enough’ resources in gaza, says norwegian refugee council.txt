We Begin this newsour in Gaza where pressure is mounting on both Israel and Egypt to reopen The crucial Raa border crossing while talks are expected in Cairo between Egypt the US and Israel hundreds of a trucks are stuck in Egypt and for weeks now Food Supplies have been rotting in the sun after Israel took control of the crossing last month and with Aid unable to reach Gaza the humanitarian situation is worsening for thousands of able Palestinians control over border crossings especially Rafa has been a sticking point in ceasefire talks Muhammad Val begins our coverage the raah border crossing is gaza's only point of access by land that doesn't pass through Israel for the Palestinians it's a vital economic and humanitarian Lifeline but it's also a symbol of freedom and sovereignty Israel has controlled it directly or indirectly since 1967 if when it announced its forces were leaving Gaza in 2005 the movement of goods and people through the crossing remained subject to Israeli approval under international law controlling the borders of a territory is considered an occupation and Palestinians argue that the occupation is the reason they're in conflict with Israel earlier last month the Israeli Army took direct military control of the Raa Crossing Israel says it was a necessary part of its prep preperations for a fullscale invasion of the city of Rafa in a final bid to defeat Hamas and other resistance groups the move further complicated efforts to bring desperately needed humanitarian Aid into Gaza and allow people requiring emergency medical care to be evacuated outside the besieged strip wfp is calling for all border crossings and Crossing points within Gaza to be open um as the Israeli incursion in Rafa continues to have a devastating impact on civilians and our own humanitarian operations our friends at the world food program warned that there is little the agency can currently do in Rafa with stocks very low and Mobility severely restricted the UN the US and Egypt have been pushing for the immediate reopening of the Rafa Karam Abu Salam Crossings the latter at the Southeastern tip of the Gaza Strip is mainly used by trucks carrying humanitarian Aid it's fully under Israeli control a key focus of current ceasefire talks is deciding the future status of the Rah Crossing Egypt insists Palestinians should control it Israel's adamant Hamas and other resistance groups should never be allowed to be in charge claiming they could use it to smuggle in weapons while efforts to start ceasefire talks continue Palestinians say the restoration of life in Gaza will be impossible without the Israeli blockade being lifted Muhammad Val Al jazer and T abazo joins us now live from in central Gaza T what impact has the closing of the crossing had on Palestinians in the South well Lea the ongoing closure of Crossing Borders as especially the vital the Rafa Crossing has prevented the humanitarian Aid flow into the Gaza Strip including food water uh medical supplies alongside with f f it means that famine is eminent and it this is a clear result of the Israeli military operation in Rafa we need to remember clearly that citizens are suffering from severe levels of malnutrition alongside with food insecurity and that is absolutely contradictory to the international humanitarian law which stipulates that any occupying power is responsible for securing Food Supplies and even securing the needs of the uh the occupied Nation as well as the Israeli ongoing uh control of these borders have also brought negative impact on the ability of onor and humanitarian organizations to keep operating on the ground specifically that they prevented any kind of Aid to get into this strip and then recently established floating dock did not sufficiently and effectively worked within the past uh period specifically that a very limited numbers of humanitarian at TRS had entered the Gaza Strip and that that are completely loaded with food supplies that can't match the ence's needs of gaza's population in light of this ongoing control uh the of this ongoing control the medical sector and the Gaza Strip is absolutely grappling and on the verge of complete collapse due to the ongoing revention of basic supplies entry to the Gaza Strip and this is a systematic military campaign that aims to completely impose medical humanitarian and Military Siege on more than 1.2 uh 1.5 million Palestinians across this trip and of of course people further up north are also in dire need of humanitarian Aid what conditions are Palestinians facing well generally uh population and people families in the north of the strip have endured much since October the 7th pre time of uh uh the conflict pre October the 7th there was there was no any kind of famine across this trip but with the initial uh months of the Israeli War on the Gaza STP the Israeli War happinet has prevented any kind of essential food water and even if fuel supplies entry to the Gaza Strip and that gradually had completely deteriorated the humanitarian situation as families there are trapped under the Israeli fire they have been internally displaced multiple times and now ending up living in evacuation centers that was already raided and invaded by the Israeli Army in Western areas of Gaza Strip they are as we have been talking to locals there they have been confirming that they are struggling to get food as the dition of food stocks started to uh take place in the north of this strip alongside that they are also grumling with finding pure sources of water due to the destruction of water wells in Northern Gaza so people there are in a big cage it means that they they they are unable to get the basic supplies and at the same time if they are not killed by the Israeli fire they might die due to the uh ongoing malnutrition that they are suffering from and dehydration as well Lea s Yen has leukemia and needs urgent treatment appro but Israel's war and blade on Gaza is a stopping that his mother can only watch as her son's condition worsens my son s was a normal boy he was a very good student he fell sick two months ago I took him to the hospital and they diagnosed him with leukemia he can't walk and started using a wheelchair two weeks ago he is in constant pain we give him a dose of morphine to relieve his pain and to let him sleep he now lives on painkillers Yin is also suffering from malnutrition at Al AA Hospital in Dar balah he's not alone there are malnourished children everywhere here and doctors say they can't cope there is no food no healthy food no proper uh health services in all Gaza Strip this leads to more complicated cases the UN says children are starving as Israel continues to block the entry of a humanitarian Aid into Gaza according to the UN more than 20 children have died of malnutrition in the north alone and 31% are acutely malnourished as a result of Israel's war and restrictions that completely contradict International low gazans again are on the brink of famine as malnutrition among Palestinians continue to spread so fast due to the lack of all kind of basic humanitarian and medical supplies where disease and even malnutrition are a deadly compination T abaz Al jaaz darl balah Palestine Ahmed bam is the Norwegian Refugee council's Middle East spokesperson and he joins us now from Aman Jordan uh sir can you give us a sense of just how much Aid is getting into Gaza right now very little very little indeed a few hundred trucks only have made it since since a months if I speak on behalf of the Norwegian Refugee Council we haven't had any supplies make it through any of the crossings for the past month now and we're only you know uh relying on our ever depleting resources on the ground uh it's it's nowhere near enough we have had big promises that have also you know uh Promises of of more Aid Promises of safety for for our uh age workers which my team in Gaza describe as a big fallacy uh and of course the closure of the nine uh uh possible potential Crossings is is a catastrophe as you have heard from your reporters and of course as we he we hear on a daily basis from our teams that uh you know children are sleeping on the Sands because there's no tents left they are drinking uh you know unsafe water all day long and they are eating very very very little now um facts on the ground are dire as you've just outlined and as we have been reporting should the ra border crossing open do conditions in Gaza even allow for the safe distribution of Aid and for for the safety of Aid workers uh the short answer is no and I'm going to illustrate it in a in a few examples of what a delivery looks like on the ground I mean Israel obviously takes forever to inspect trucks it takes forever to let trucks in but even when the trucks are in we don't have fuel to go and bring these trucks into into Gaza if we had the fuel we don't have the cash because of the liquidity shortage on the ground to pay for these trucks and let's say we have paid we have found the cash it's not safe to take these trucks from point A by The Crossing to point B where our houses where houses are so it's it's it's an obstacle course as my colleagues describe it on the ground it's not just one factor it's not a straightforward process anymore you are working under the bombs under the Rockets you know in dangerous very dangerous roads you are basically as an aid worker just like the rest of the population putting your life uh on the line here and people have been putting their lives on the line to go find some bread or some water so the short answer is no big promises should stop and we should see concrete action concrete action means Israel pulling out of of these civilian areas in Rafa letting Aid trucks in opening all Gates possible to to let uh you know these trucks in and of course uh very important to allow uh a workers to work in the safest environment possible but if there is no Rack or change in in Israel's uh policy what would that mean um for for Aid trucks and for for Aid flow it means it means yeah you know we are working in atrocious circumstances it's not possible I can't see how you know we have to make these Journeys back and forth 18 miles I think it is from the Rafa Crossing to to to kanun or to masasi where AID you know Aid operations are are focused and concentrated right now um pressure has to come from Israel's allies and and from these talks and and other talks behind closed doors I mean rhetoric empty rhetoric really doesn't doesn't work anymore we need action and that action should come from from these big allies of Israel who have been you know trying you know we we've heard you know all good rhetoric but very very little action whether that is on on a route or whether that is on our on the safety of our teams I think Time for Action is is now and that could only work if Israel stops attacking Raa had let these populations back to where to where they have been receiving aid you know these these months Ahad a Middle East spokesperson at the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you sir for your time make sure to
