well al bar and Al magazi refugee camps also came under attack in central Gaza the three camps are all crowded with forcibly displaced Palestinians including many of the more than a million who fled the southern city of Rafa where Israel started its ground offensive there last month okay uh let's speak to TK abosom he joins us now from outside alaxa Hospital in Deer albala so another night another attack on a refugee camp tck this time in nerat can you tell us what happened yeah exactly what we do know is that the Israeli uh fighter jets have targeted a un run school which is a completely an evacuation Center hundreds of Palestinian families have been seeking refuge in that place and the vast majority of families who have been uh living in that area had been multiply displaced from many areas across the trip ending up in that corner that was targeted without any prior warning at least 32 Palestinians have been reported killed while another residential building was targeted in the same refugee camp were at least six others are being killed with dozens of injuries that arrived to Al AA hospital to work we are right now uh the situation in fact as we just arrived at the hospital earlier today was absolutely devast ating we saw how the funerals were propelled in order to be later uh buried by the their families and at the same time those families have been speaking to Al jazer saying that they are completely shocked by the attack that was carried out without any kind of pre warning as they have been trying to guarantee their own safety by uh trying to take un schools as basic shelters for them but they say that there is no any place safe as the bombardment continues uh hitting and bounding civilian houses civil infrastructure alongside with you run shelter centers which gives a clear indication that Israel is upscaling the military acts on the ground as within the past couple of hours also we could clearly hear the sound of the artillery bombardment in the Eastern areas of Dar bah and alage refugee camp while the Israeli Army saying that now they are carrying out a very limited Military incursion in the Eastern areas of ALB and dar bah as well yeah as you say t there really is nowhere safe uh because the Israeli strikes have continued all over the strip in other areas and parts of the strip what else can you tell us about that yes um in fact the military campaign is still ongoing in the North in the center and even in the southern part of Gaza now starting from the north of the strip where the Israel artillery units have been bounding as they T neighborhood causing a number of casualties that were transferred to Al Arab hospital to get medical treatment there but at the same time now the military is targeting also multiple areas in the center of this strip including Dar balah where the Israeli helicopters have opened the fire against Palestinians on Salah Road where one Palestinian has been killed with two others being wounded and they have been fro to Al AA hospital to get medical treatment and in the far south of Gaza including kanun City the Israeli forces have destroyed a residential building in Al Manara neighborhood in kanun while the military operation is still ongoing in Rafa where they have been demolishing complete residential neighborhood one after the other as close contact fighting between Hamas and Israeli soldiers continues as well on the ground there where the military now are station inside Western areas of Rafa which is so adjacent and close to Al maasi and they are trying also to take full military control over the Rafa District after they managed to control Philadelphia corridor as they as they are saying that they are trying to dismantle Hamas remaining battalions but the level of Destruction is unprecedented in RAF where no one is trying to uh trying even to remain in Rafa after receiving warnings by the Israeli military and now the entire Gaza population are left stranded in the Palestinian Street in almasi area and even here in darel Bahan in central areas that were also targeted within the past couple of weeks which is a complete reflection and indication that Palestinians have lost safety okay thank you for that t abom there for us outside the alaxa hospital in Dara Balor make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from alaz
