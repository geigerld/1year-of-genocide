okay Anthony blinkin is speaking now at Cairo Airport let's listen in we came here with four key objectives to make clear that the United States stands with Israel to prevent the conflict from spreading to other places to work on securing the release of hostages including American citizens and to address the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza um we started as you know in in Israel and it was important to make it very clear that the United States has Israel's back we will stand with it today tomorrow and every day and we're doing that in word and also In Deed I spent time with prime minister Netanyahu to go through the needs that Israel may have to um make sure it can effectively defend itself uh and you've already seen a lot of that assistance moving forward and that's a conversation that'll continue um Israel has the the right indeed it has the obligation to defend itself against these attacks from Hamas and to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again as I said in Tel Aviv as President Biden has said the way that Israel does this matters uh needs to do it in a way that affirms uh the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians um after we uh left Israel we've gone now to I think I've lost track but to six countries in the region Jordan uh Bahrain cter the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia now here in Egypt and the purpose of um seeing all of our partners was first and foremost to listen to them to hear how they're seeing this crisis and to look at what we can do together uh to deal with many any of the concerns that it's raised what I've heard from virtually every partner was a determination a shared view it looks like we have lost the feed to Anthony blinkin there who was speaking uh before departing Cairo where he has been on a whirlwind diplomacy tour right around uh the region we're going to go now to Petty Khan who joins us live from Washington DC Petty we heard Anthony blinkin reiterate once again as we have over the last few days uh the United States uh priorities here trying to prevent the conflict from spreading the hostage release and the humanitarian crisis was there anything else that stood out for you in uh in what we heard from uh the US Secretary of State there I think what stands out for me is in all of the conversations he's had with his counterparts in the region is they are putting and you just heard heard from the Egyptian president they are putting the focus on the fact of what's happening in Gaza now the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin he is talking about the attacks on Israel and again they're very careful with their language but it's also very deliberate when they said again we expect Israel to follow the rules of law Israel is not following the rules of law especially with that blockade now I know we're hearing reports that some water may be turned on but we've just heard again carefully worded from the National Security adviser Jake Sullivan saying that they expect that they that they expect that Water Shelter food for Gaza should be respected by Israel and others so I think what's notable is he's getting pushed back I think when he's going to this region and you just heard from the Egyptian president saying what this is not it's not equal what happened to Israel this is now Collective punishment and again so this the secret this the sly language if you will of they have to respect the rule of law is they're not respecting the rule of law they have not changed any of that language since uh they just first started using it some days ago so the question is are they going to start saying more than they should respect the rule of law but they aren't that's what I'll be looking for yeah we also heard blink in the Israel has the right to defend itself but the way it does matters they have to take every possible precaution uh to try and protect civilians is that new in this that uh is really outlining that civilians have to come first here well they've been saying that at the same time they keep and the president reiterated this uh just last night saying that Hamas is using civilians as a human shield uh so the they basically saying look they're trying to protect civilians they told them to move to the south then and if they're if they do it hit civilians in the north it's likely the US would come out and say well maybe they couldn't leave uh but again it's what the United Nations is saying is it's it's impossible to move a million people in such a short a period of time and especially when it comes to moving people in the hospitals uh that you know are running out of electricity so they're trying to walk a very fine line of showing unwavering support for Israel but also trying to appease Partners in the region because truly for them the biggest concern and it is actually one shared by the American public is that this could lead to a wider War there was one poll 8 in 10 fear that this is going to lead to a wider conflict okay thank you so much for that petty that's Petty khin for us in Washington dcat bagat is a professor of National Security Affairs at the National Defense University he joins us from Washington DC for more on this issue thank you very much for joining us on elera sir we heard uh and we have heard over the last few days all about uh the United States and their priorities but what are Egypt's concerns or priorities here as everybody knows Egypt is major regional power and uh this instability this war in Gaza is against uh the interest of everybody including Egypt Egypt is very concerned about all uh about stability in the Middle East and also on National level Egypt is very interested and concerned about uh about 2 million Palestinians where they will go uh Egypt is not an option for a very long time Egypt Jordan all Arab countries have insisted that the Palestinians maintain their national identity Egypt does not accept the Palestinians to move there Jordan does not accept the Palestinians to move there it is in the best interest of Arab countries of the Palestinians for the Palestinians to stay there what is the fear if the Palestinians if two million Palestinians were to move to to Jordan and into Egypt uh this is uh will will end Palestinian uh uh dream the Palestinian demand for two State solution the Palestinians belong to Palestine to the West Bank to Gaza and they demand their uh nation state their uh independent state and if they move to Jordan and Egypt this will be over okay just stay with us so we're going to go back to Anthony blinkin who is speaking on the T in Cairo that has countries in the region normalizing their relations integrating working together uh in common purpose and uh upholding and bringing forth the uh the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people that's One Vision it's very clear there's another Vision that Hamas has demonstrated in the most horrific way and that's a vision of death of destruction of nihilism of terrorism that's a vision that does nothing to advance aspirations for for Palestinians that does nothing to help uh create better futures for people in the region and does everything to bring total darkness to everyone that it that that it's able to uh to affect so I think the the two the the paths are clear the Visions are clear and I have no doubt what path people the overwhelming majority of people in the region will choose and will prefer if given the opportunity so our responsibility all of us who believe in that first path and that's everyone I talk to our responsibility is to make it real uh to bring it to life to make it a clear affirmative choice and that's what we're determined to do we have to get through this crisis first uh and we're we're working to do that uh but we also have to get back in a very clear practical way to that Vision to making it real if we do that everyone in this region will be in a much better place and so will the rest of the world well that he was US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin uh speaking there at Cairo Airport we're going to bring back in our guest Gad bakad is who is a professor of National Security Affairs at the National Defense University thank you for staying with us uh I want to ask about blinken's tour of the Arab region we've seen him uh go to about half a dozen countries over the last four or five days he is due to head back to Israel on Monday though what message do you think he's going to be taking back from all the Arab leaders that he has met I I believe the main message which everybody agrees on that there is no military solution what happened was not surprise and uh if we do not agree on political solution meaning uh agreement which both the Palestinians Israelis and AR countries will accept uh this conflict will come again it will not stop there and this why the in the short term we have to stop escalation in the long term there is no military solution all parties have to agree on political solution political solution means state for Palestinians in peace with the state of Israel we heard earlier today when blinkin met uh Egyptian president Cece Cece warned that this could spread wider than just Israel and Gaza I mean how worried is Cairo about this expanding further Beyond just Gaza there is great concern there are military clashes between hasbalah and Israel Israel bombed different sites in Syria Iran announced that it will uh take action if Israel does not stop bombing Gaza so there is great concern that the war will not stop in Gaza and will spend will include the entire Middle East yeah and Beyond Iran earlier today warned that no one can guaranteed control of the situation if Israel invades Gaza do you see that as a threat from Iran uh I believe Wars take life on their own when the Iran Iraq war started nobody ever thought it will take eight years so uh it is this is the lesson when United States invaded Afghanistan we never thought we will be there for more than 20 years so it is very important to understand that it is very hard to predict the course of any War okay thank you so much for joining us uh and for your inside on all of this that is godat bagat uh for us thank you so much
