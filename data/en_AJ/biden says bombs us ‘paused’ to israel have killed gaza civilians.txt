uh so John first up just tell us more about what the president said children and their the president told an American Network civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs in other ways in which they go after population centers he said I made it clear that if they go into Rafa they haven't gone into Rafa yet if they go into Rafa I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafa to deal with the cities that deal with that problem in other words the president is saying he doesn't want to have any part in supplying the weapons that go into Rafa and he's urged Israel he's urged Benjamin Netanyahu not to go into Rafa the Israeli Army is going in any way it appears and the US president appears to be finally drawing a line at some point now he's under a lot of pressure if you look around me you can see why across the us there have been these protests and even Democrats especially Democrats have been pressuring the the president to draw the line somewhere and to pressure Israel into a ceasefire and this seems to be his first direct act the first time President Biden has actually pushed back and said no so John tell us more about what's happening behind you there Biden's due to speak shortly of course we've had protest going on no sure thing uh President Biden is uh at a fundraiser it's very near me if the camera were to turn just to the right that hotel is where the uh the fundraiser is being held that's the Palmer hotel and it is Rush Hour in Chicago and as you can see traffic on State Street a famous street here in town is stomped dead while these protesters stop movement of traffic I can tell you having tried to get here from another part of town that they've been very successful so what they're doing here is making a point while President Biden is literally within hearing distance of them and they're insisting that what he's done is not enough that it is a first step what they want is an actual ceasefire this goes beyond those protests we've seen at universities across the US this is an instance of people in the city the public non students and students as well getting together and as you can see police have uh surrounded them in order to stop traffic but they're not making arrests they're allowing them to continue this protest and it looks like it may go on for some time here John thanks for that John we'll be back with you uh as that event unfolds thanks very much indeed John hend there in Chicago make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from aler
