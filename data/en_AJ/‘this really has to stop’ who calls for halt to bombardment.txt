arak yashari is a spokesperson at the World Health Organization joins us now from Geneva good to have you with us first of all let's start with these latest strikes two strikes within 24 hours on a refugee camp How concerned are you about what this is doing to the health conditions that civilians are facing well it's truly horrible what uh what two million people in Gaza is going through right now Relentless bombardment and as we have just heard hospitals are lacking medical supplies medicines they're lacking fuel to operate uh and many of hospitals have to either completely shut down or to stop certain Services because they're either damaged uh during bombardment or they don't have a fuel to operate so what we need is a uh unhindered and safe access to bring Medical Supply two thir of Health Centers have already shut down one thir of hospitals is is not functioning anymore others are running low on fuel and medicines we are not only talking about injured people who need immediate trauma care we speak about 50,000 pregnant women 9,000 uh cancer patients 1,000 people uh getting dialysis treatment uh hundreds of thousands of people with chronic diseases all the people rely on a health system and this system right now is under huge stress and and and will stop providing Services if there is no solution to assist health workers Ina if I could jump out jump in that that we've seen some of the hospitals which do remain functioning in Gaza like a shifer and the Indonesian hospital announc that the countdown has begun before they'll have to shut down their operations because of a lack of fuel do you have any reason to believe that fuel will be coming in soon to Gaza well what we can do as a humanitarian is really try to stress that this is a moment of life and that for thousands of patients and people in Gaza unless hospitals continue working it is indeed question of of time when each hospital will have to they already started to gradually shut services and we heard about a Turkish hospital that is shutting services and that's the only uh hospital for cancer patients and cancer cancer patients are already very fragile and if they don't get uh the treatment they need it is really a that sentence for them so we really appeal to everyone who have the possibility to make the decision to to have access safe access for medical supplies but also for fuel uh to Gaza what we have brought so far is nowhere enough uh for for what is actually right needed right now toic we did see a limited number of some wounded Palestinians and some foreign Nationals and dual Nationals leave Gaza today is it your understanding that this is the beginning of a process that there will be further movement of of people in the coming days well indeed it is a it is a a good uh think that some patients manag to get to Egypt we have been working with the Egyptian Ministry of Health in preparing them for uh for receiving triing and and uh uh providing Medical Care to uh to those who uh who are coming today out of uh out of out of Gaza we had a team in a hospital making sure that ambulances have all life support equipment that doctors and paramedics are being trained in resusitation and basic basic health services for those with a with a severe trauma injuries but this is again we are talking just about handful of of patients the the needs in Gaza are huge there are thousands of injured people in in Gaza right now they cannot all be evacuated and some of them cannot leave the hospitals even those in alifa hospital in the north they cannot be evacuated we need to help hospitals to do their job inside Gaza I I'm curious T have you put that to the Israeli authorities and if so what response does the World Health Organization get well there is a in the UN system uh there is a mechanism to to to try to ensure that because it's not only about who it is about other un agencies as well so so so there are discussions on how to get things in and not only just AC cross the crossing uh point in Rafa but within Gaza we need those supplies to be safely distributed how can we get our things in a safe way to hospitals in a Nor today so we need those those guarantees uh and not only for medical supplies it goes for for other things it goes for for for for food uh for uh uh for fuel for clean water so this has to be decided on on a political level we as who we are really ready we have our uh Medical Teams ready to go in we have our staff inside Gaza who who are doing their best uh while at the same time risking their lives uh to to provide support to to their colleagues in the Ministry of Health and and workers in a hospitals but we need we really there has to be some sort of political level but if you really push the argument what we need is a end of hostilities because even if we bring supplies in as long as there is a such a Relentless bombardment of gas there will be necessarily more casualties there will be more dead people there will be more injuries so this really has to stop all right thank you very much t
