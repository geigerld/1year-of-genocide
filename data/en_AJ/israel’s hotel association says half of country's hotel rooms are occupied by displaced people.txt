as a trucks have made it through to displaced people in Gaza many of them are saying they need the Israeli bombing to stop we don't want Aid we want to return to our homes enough with the killing of our children and slaughtering us we can't sleep neither during day nor at night because of the shelling and the misery we are living in enough we do not have patience anymore we are drained we don't feel human anymore I left home without taking anything except this shirt and pants I have on the aid they brought for us is nothing but a small amount of what is needed and in southern Israel preparations are now being made for evacuations to IAT alzer's Theresa Bo is there for us Teresa what sort of scale are we talking about here well I'm here in aad this is right next to the Red Sea this is a tourist destination that's now been overwhelmed with thousands and thousands of people being evacuated to this place because it's safer from the rockets that are coming from Gaza you can see that several of the shops around here are open now there's some music playing but still people are coming to this part of the country mostly evacuated from the southern part of Israel's surrounding areas from the Gaza Strip but also from northern uh Israel where people are fleeing the latest fighting between Hezbollah and the Israeli military the government has evacuated around 200,000 people all around the country but not everything is going as planned with hurts lots of reports for example that some of the evacuations were halted in kimona that's in Northern Israel because there were not enough hotel rooms people were brought here and they're staying in many of the hotels that you can see right behind me around 60,000 people were brought here the mayor of uh this city is saying that they do not have any more rooms that they need assistance from the federal government uh they're also saying that if people continue to arrive here it's going to the city is going to collapse uh they also we've been hearing reports that there could be a tent city not far away from where I am right now for 60,000 people it would have a medical facilities it would also uh have a school for example if the situation continues to escalate uh Teresa you talk about potential escalation I know tensions have already been running High what's the mood like on the ground there now well there's lots of Enon on the ground not specifically here because it's considered to be a safe area but people are still afraid they're still angry they're still in shock about what happened we've been talking to many of them and many support a ground Invasion with Gaza they want the Israeli government to be done with Hamas with the Islamic Jihad among others but at the same time earlier today we were in some centers where they're Distributing clothes to those who had to flee they had left everything behind and they're living here right now and also there's a sense sentiment that some people do want peace they're saying that it's time for something different to happen in Israel I think that what's extremely interesting that is happening here is that the Israeli government is trying to keep the morale High uh they're trying to tell people that they're going to win this war that this situation is going to be over soon but when you talk to people on the ground nobody knows exactly whether that will happen they feel afraid they feel threatened and many are saying and many have told us actually that they blame president Benjamin Teresa Bo there on the ground for us with the latest from ISAT thank you Teresa
