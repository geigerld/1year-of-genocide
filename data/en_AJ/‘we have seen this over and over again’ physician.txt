okay we'll now speak to Dr Tanya Hassan who's a pediatric intensive care physician she was last working in Gaza in March and is joining us from am man thanks very much for your time with us on Al jazer so we've just seen an attack on a field Hospital in central Gaza with many children among the dead now the doctors nurses all the medical staff will be having to make some tough decisions as to who to try to save with the lack of space and lack of supplies how difficult are those decisions to make and what are your colleagues on the ground at AA telling you about the situation yeah I think uh they're they're extremely overwhelmed so I've been getting brief messages saying they're trying to get things under control but struggling uh they said they received uh upward of 40 uh Martyrs so people who've been killed and over 120 injured mostly women and children they described Terri burn terrible Burns uh that uh were so severe that they were actually scary to look at horrifying Birds covering up to 100% of the body surface area these patients will not survive they will gasp some of them will survive for hours maybe a day if it's uh significantly less than 100% but they wouldn't survive in any setting the problem when you have a mass casualty of this scale is you can't even provide compassionate end of life care to relief uh the suffering they said that they've been trying to take hold of the situation but despite this being now several hours ago that they cannot um they said said that reports they're getting from the casualties that are coming in is that this was a a triple strike operation where uh the same uh vicinity of the medical point the the field medical point the clinic where a lot of the cases that would otherwise be cared for at ala are being cared for in in this Clinic because ala is above capacity and so they described there being over a thousand people in the vicinity of that uh clinic and school including patients and their caregivers and that it was hit three times and we've seen this over and over again where um places where civilians are highly concentrated are uh struck by Israeli forces the rescue workers go into to um to rescue any survivors and then the same location is hit uh recurrently after that taking not only the the few survivors of the initial uh strike but also anyone who attempts to rescue them um and so they received uh a number of uh casualties over 100 injuries a number that any healthare system would not be able to cope with in terms of managing a mass casualty one of my colleagues it's his day off today uh they're working very hard they've been working non-stop for now over uh close to nine months and these uh these Physicians generally will work for 24 hours and then have have a 24 hour period off and this was his time off and he was called back in because the situation was so out of control so he he just left me a voice message describing the horrifying injuries that they were seeing he said it's uh terrible uh and completely out of control control can you talk more about the pardon me but can you just talk uh perhaps a little bit more about the types of injuries that your colleagues are telling you that they're seeing I think it depends on on on the hospital so we have colleagues at noset hospital we have colleagues at ala today they're seeing air strike type injuries so what I heard was horrifying um amputations one of the nurses who's in the Red Zone which is the ICU uh was messaging me uh about 30 minutes ago and I asked her what type of injury she's saying she was seeing and she she said three things she said brain matter out amputation so brain matter out is when the brain matter is actually visible because the the head has been blown open uh uh amputations and severe burns my colleague who's at anlet hospital where you're you're having more troops on the ground Israeli troops on the ground said uh in the last 24 hours they've received uh multiple women with gunshot wounds to the thighs and legs um and so a lot of gunshot wounds a lot of uh tank shelling uh and injuries that are related to to troops being on the ground so it really depends but uh and losted Hospital seems to be reporting more sniper attacks shootings executions of that type and um but Anda reporting more aerial bombardment that said both institutions are reporting you know majority women children elderly these are I I did see a report saying that several steps were taken to reduce the possibility of Civilian casualties and that's just not the reflection on the ground I'm sorry this is clearly a concentration of civilians that has been not intentionally targeted once but three times in a row with with an overwhelming majority of uh women and children casualties one woman and this is a report I got about 20 minutes ago from a colleague of mine who's with me and Aman right now she's part of an an NGO that's current a medical NGO that's currently in Gaza and she shared the story with me of one woman whose husband was killed at the beginning of the war the woman was pregnant at the time after 13 years of trying to conceive eventually conceiving with invitro fertilization with IVF her husband was killed at the beginning of the war she delivered her baby in her tent and today she was killed the baby was removed from the rubble alive and is now orphaned uh having lost both his parents in two separate air strikes actually I don't know the the gender of the child but both the baby's parents in two separate air strike incidents I mean I just I just want to add one thing because I'm finding this extremely frustrating coming on over and over and over again as a humanitarian asked to offer a humanitarian perspective and a humanitarian solution to what is very clearly on the ground genocide and you can save a life we can spend hours resuscitating the people impossibly trying to keep these people alive the majority of them will die under the current circumstances and with the types of injuries that my colleagues are reporting and the area of the emergency department the most critical area that said we can spend hours trying to resuscitate them but if they survive and they have to go back and live in a quote unquote humanitarian Zone that is clearly a valid Target because as a civilian you are a valid Target to Israel in fact you're clearly targeted Drass that's that's what I wanted to ask you about in fact let me just uh jump in there for just a moment because look we see hospitals which are supposed to be protected under intern law being repeatedly targeted by Israel I mean how do you make sense of the fact that there are these repeated violations of international law yet no accountability the the reality is I'm a physician I'm supposed to make sense of the injury and I'm supposed to treat it and I have spent my entire Adult Career and life investing in my skill set so that I will be very good at keeping people people alive I'm not an international humanitarian lawyer I'm not an expert in human rights or Warfare I can tell you that the realities on the ground that we are witnessing as people who are supposed to keep people alive is every single means of uh livelihood of keeping people alive from uh water to food to shelter safety uh healthc care resuscitate resuscitative capacity Rescue Services ambulances uh Waste Management systems are targets of the Israeli strategy now you can conclude what you would like the icj seems to conclude its plausible genocide the ICC has put out arrest warrants everybody's making conclusions that are based on International humanitarian law for me on the ground as a physician who was there and who is now talking to my colleagues who are there I can tell you that this looks like a strategy to to to to to eliminate a population I don't know what else you could conclude logically but I'm not an expert that can conclude anything legally and the legal experts have also spoken okay we'll have to leave it there thank you so much Dr Tanya Hassan for speaking make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
