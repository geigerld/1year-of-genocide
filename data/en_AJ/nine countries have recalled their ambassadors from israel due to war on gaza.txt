now since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza nine countries have withdrawn their ambassadors or severed ties now they call for an immediate ceasefire and for humanitarian Aid to enter the strip unhindered NATO member turkey is amongst those that's pulled its Ambassador out so did Israel's neor Jordan and it said that Israel is committing war crimes the latest to join the list are Chad and South Africa Bolivia was the first two SE ties entirely with Israel saying its decision was a condemnation of the aggressive and dis proportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip Alan Fischer has more from occupied East Jerusalem thank you Benjamin Netanyahu has spent many days recently meeting world leaders the latest the Bulgarian president but with more countries rethinking diplomatic links with Israel the Prime Minister decided to act he summoned foreign ambassadors to a meeting in tviv and claimed Israel was fighting for their future too we will win and we believe that all civilized Powers should back Us in this effort because this battle is your battle and our Victory is your Victory several countries have withdrawn their ambassadors over the growing Carnage in Gaza Bolivia has severed all diplomatic ties many have criticized the human cost of war the growing number of Civilian deaths the pictures of dead children in the wreckage the latest country to recall its Ambassador South Africa we believe the nature uh of response by Israel has become uh one of collective punishment which Falls fully outside of the practice of international humanitarian and international human rights law Ireland's prime minister has also said he has no regrets at describing Israel's response to the Hamas attack as something more approaching Revenge bringing together the community of ambassadors shows that Israel is worried it's losing international support about the way it's Prosecuting the war in Gaza but the Diplomatic Tipping Point may come if one of its traditional allies decided to call for a ceasefire or even an end to the war Alan Fischer Al jazer in occupied East Jerusalem let's bring you those latest pictures coming out of Gaza and explain what they are a military sourcerers has confirmed they're described as illumination rounds fired from Israeli artillery their flares that are attached to a parish shoot that float down like a sort of mini Sun giving uh the military the opportunity to operate in uh daylight so to speak when they run out of uh fire they the military fire more into the air um the Israeli military according to this particular Source don't have as many night vision goggles or night vision capability as uh other Armed Forces like the US for example they do have some smaller specialized units that do have these night vision goggles but C certainly what you're seeing uh are not Munitions as such but they're called illumination rounds that light up the sky and allow the Israelis to Target the locations that they have been doing certainly for the past three hours across the Gaza Strip let's bring in Mar Bashar aljazera senior political analyst he's been monitoring events with me can we just begin with uh Ry manzur at the UN he wasn't party to this closed door meeting that's been held by the security Council a meeting called by the United Arab Emirates and China over the ceasefire but it is the word ceasefire that is Paramount right now and Ry manzur made that very clear yes um and and that's also clear from uh what he explained in terms of the general assembly's overwhelming resolution in favor of a humanitarian truce which now considering the humanitarian uh disaster that is called Gaza I think the the need for a humanitarian ceasefire is uh is Paramount but once again you know as he said there is an actual elephant in the room and clearly the Biden Administration has uh rejected once and again uh the idea of a ceasefire because it's trying to Shield Israel diplomatically as Israel carries its crimes in in in Gaza there's this idea in the Biden Administration that Israel uh needs to get Justice and needs to finish as it were Hamas in Gaza and for both the United States and Israel unlike the rest of the International Community uh the ends justify all means the end meaning finishing of Hamas justify the devastation of Gaza and that's not acceptable to the rest of the International Community and this might be the overall message that's been given you might say by by the top uh be it the president or or the the Prime Minister but what we do have is secretary blinken and the CIA Chief in the region talking to various capitals and various leaders of respective Middle East countries that have influence or certainly have an opinion secretary blinken has certainly experienced firsthand how angry the Middle East is right now is this message going to reverberate when he goes back to Washington you would you would hope so right but uh to me the Administration has to has proven to be uh sort of blindly following in Israel's footsteps you would think as a as a world form of superpower it would be sensitive to its credibility reputation and interests around the world especially in the Middle East and you would think that it will have a certain calculus different from that of Israel so instead of blindly copying Israel and coupling its mindset to that of Israel that it would take a bit of a distance figure out what is needed in the Middle East and in Gaza today and act a bit more responsibly because the United States has been acting even less responsibly than Israel the last month see if you look at it soel and I think our viewers around the world have probably noticed that American diplomacy and Israeli War have been two sides of the same coin and that's problematic in the sense that America has used its gun Bo diplomacy gun boo diplomacy something like borrowed from the 18th century uh like like the British Empire they dispatched aircraft carriers and uh and and nuclear submarines to the east Mediterranean in order to flick their muscles Shield Israel and basically uh pressure different countries in in the Middle East to support Israel in its war crimes as you said as you well stated the Arab capitals are are in no mood to be complicit in Israel's war crimes against fellow Arabs even the most moderate the most pro-american uh like Egypt and and Jordan have rejected the notion of Israel self-defense by carrying war crimes in Gaza and hence you would think something got to give and we're already a month into this uh this evil war against the Palestinians and the United States needs to start taking some steps to distance itself from the war crimes and start acting more responsibly like a grownup you talk about responsibility and we talk about anger in the Middle East but we have to also focus on Egypt because they have a very delicate position but also a very important position and a responsible one as well we're talking about the Rafa border the only communication and transport link there is really for Palestinians and gazans to get in or out uh if their name is on a list the Rafa border is not open all the time and there are restrictions There Are Rules there are laws and there are agreements that hinder Egypt even wanting to open that door and allowing everybody out but it's not going to happen but you would think that in these exceptional circumstances of an utter genocide taking place in plain sight that you would take exceptional measures I mean these exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures and these are not that exceptional in the sense that Egypt has a very special relationship with the Gaza Strip it in fact administered it for for 20 years gaza's only way out to the world is through Egypt you know probably I don't know how many exactly but a good a good portion of the people in Gaza have studied in Egypt all these doctors that we see and nurses and teachers a lot of them actually have studied in Egypt a lot of them have actually gone to Egypt and went back so so there is there is a real uh uh genetic if you will National interest and relationship between Egypt and Gaza uh uh uh Egypt owes us to be more responsible owes the people in Gaza to be more responsible owes the International Community to be a more responsible Middle East players because it's always been that way meaning Egypt is like a sort of a nation state that's always acted soberly in the Middle East it doesn't act out of a you know emotion or or rash it actually considers things and a month into the genocide into the war crimes into the suffering into the killing of of thousands of Palestinians you would want Egypt to step in and say look I had enough of this Bloody War I am not necessarily able to stop it but I'm certainly going to try to help people eat and get medicine and get shelter and that's a humanitarian uh uh mission to do now finally and probably this is the most important since we are talking not in humanitarian uh NOS we're talking about a state and and and an interstate system it would be very helpful for Egypt to play an important role moving forward after this war ends if it acts responsibly today and acts in a way that is humanely reasonable towards the people in Gaza only by acting responsibly not with indifference but with difference towards the people of Gaza will it be able to play a an important Ro after us because I think the Egyptian presidency is looking to the time when the dust settles so it can go back again and play an important role in East Mediterranean politics but it won't be able to do that if it lets down the people of Gaza today we shall see what does happen certainly uh over the next few weeks the Bashar thank you
