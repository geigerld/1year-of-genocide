Gaza soldiers stormed the Kamal adwan Hospital well these pictures are from last week but this is the courtyard where Israeli forces rounded up Palestinian boys and men including health workers also in the nor a medical worker was shot and injured other doctors have been subjected to humiliating treatment by soldiers at Israeli checkpoint well here's an account of what happened to one red crescent worker traveling between northern and southern Gaza he informed us that he was harassed beaten threatened and even stripped of his uniform blindfolded hands tied behind his back and and and and treated in a degrading and a imitating uh Manner and and once released he had to walk towards the South with his hands still tight and and with out with a t-shirt only and and no shoes and there he was he could make a call a un School in B hanoon has been destroyed while Israeli soldiers cheered hundreds of displaced families were Sheltering there and now have nowhere to go and in southern Gaza at least 20 Palestinians were killed in a dawn attack on several homes in Rafa Israeli military is pressing on with its offensive and its bombing of Civilian areas let's go to T Abu aom in Rafa in southern Gaza now TK tell us what more you know about the situation with hospitals across Gaza now yes uh the situation for hospitals across the territory is really critical as only a according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health only 11 hospitals partially functioning right now uh after the attacks that had been conducted and carried out against the majority of hospitals across the territory similarly to the situation that happened to a shifat hospital which had been stormed and uh ruined by the Israeli soldiers now uh in the north of the Gaza Strip we have Al Al kamalan hospital and ala Hospital which have been also under intense buming since the early beginning of this fighting and during last couple of hours the Israeli forces are deployed on the vicinities of those hospitals and in particular in kamalan hospitals where they are preventing any patients or anyone from the residents who are taking shelter inside to leave as they have deploy their forces and snipers uh they are adopting a clear principles of arresting any Palestinians who is over uh 15 years old and uh they are taking them to undisclosed location for investigation by the Israeli off officers now the situation there is critical and there is no any kind of Medical Aid had been delivered to the uh north of Gaza hospitals where uh doctors and medical workers are tirelessly and peely walking and functioning in order to keep providing treatment especially with the increasing numbers of the Israeli strikes on jabalia and mlaha town in the north of Gaza and T turning to schools now a un run school has been destroyed by Israeli forces yes I personally uh know this is school because it's my my hometown in the north of Gaza in B hanon uh town in the Eastern areas which is uh close to the uh to the areas of confrontations between Palestinian Fighters and the Israeli occupation forces now this school is a United Nation run school which is which was in the early days of the confrontations was a shelter for the majority of Bon residents in order to be protected from the Israeli puming now with the start of the ground invasion they have uh they have evacuated from this is school Under intense Israeli bombing now the Israeli forces had completely destroyed uh this uh run School uh the United Nation run school with explosive devices uh uh which uh clearly will impact after the period of War on the process of of Education simply because this school was the main Central School in the Eastern areas that uh that that gives education for thousands of Palestinian students in banon town and T we've been hearing a lot of activity behind you there what's been happening where you are in Rafa yes uh in Rafa during the last uh hour the Israeli forces had intensified the air strikes where they have uh destroyed a residential building uh belong to a Brash family where a number of Palestinians have been killed and others have been injured we saw the uh the scene of young girl which was completely uh covered with smoke with black smoke over her face a number of dead bodies that had turned up to Al kaiti Hospital uh just before a couple of uh minutes and the uh when we start to ask about the uh the place they told us that the situation there is really catastrophic as the ambulances kept for more than 10 minutes of evacuating victims from under the in order to be uh delivered and transported to Al hospital to receive a treatment uh ra this area in the south is supposed to be safe according to the uh classification of the areas by the Israeli forces where they have ordered people to flee to to it in order to be away from the battle zones now it had been repeatedly attacked by the occupation forces which gives a clear sense of mistrust among Palestinians that there is no any safe areas across Gaza D Abu AUM in Rafa Forest there thanks very much indeed
