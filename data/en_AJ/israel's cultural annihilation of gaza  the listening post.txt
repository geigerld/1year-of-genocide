[Music] to understand the scale of Destruction in Gaza today one needs to understand the nature of the war Israel has launched against Palestinians we're not talking about conventional Warfare this is a war of annihilation that targets the foundations of society we've seen universities bombed libraries museums Israel is trying to prevent Palestinians from reclaiming and reestablishing life in Gaza as they knew it my name is Jihad Abu Salim I'm from the city of darl balah located in the middle of the Gaza Strip it's where I grew up and spent most of my life Gaza City was the only Palestinian coastal city that was not conquered by Zionist militias in 1948 and that gave Gaza uh huge significance and placed it as the Beating Heart of preserving Palestinian nationalism and furthering the Palestinian cause for Liberation and by destroying universities museums libraries and archives Israel seeks to make our memory whether it's Collective institutional inaccessible it's an assault on continuity they want to force people out of Gaza but also they want to make sure that if people return to Gaza they find nothing and dwell for eternity in this limbo of nothingness in this gaza's old city with its masks like or a church like the Church of St poriferous testifies to Palestines complex and multifaceted history alar mosque is the second oldest mque in Palestine after AA MK and from the footage that we've seen it seems that the mosque was deliberately targeted because there are photos that show surrounding buildings standing intact while the mosque has been bombed to smithin so Israel is trying to impose a rupture between the present and the past and of course the future and destroying an iconic structure like musk is just part of that effort the goal of targeting uh gaza's archives is to make it impossible for people to rebuild and reclaim what has been lost we did not only lose historical documents but also land Deeds land registration infrastructure plans and schemes now we hear all these reports of people going back to their neighborhoods and being unable to recognize where the street that they lived on was located where their homes were and they think that by destroying institutions or uh archives or looting museums they can destroy Gaza as a place and therefore prevent people from returning there or reestablishing their lives Gaza and its District have suffered a lot in terms of the targeting and destruction of historic and Heritage s after 1967 after Gaza became under Israeli occupation Israeli defense minister MOS Dean built an entire Infamous career in addition to being a war criminal of looting artifacts from different parts of Gaza and Palestine and storing them in his own home but also in the 1970s and 80s Israeli forces alongside Israeli archaeologists looted a 4,500 year old Canaanite Cemetery located in derl balah my hometown and they took anything they could carry to the Israel national museum and today I go on the internet and I see artifacts that were stolen and looted from this site being sold around the world and that makes you wonder if Israel's practices today are a new phenomenon or just a continuation of a long-standing pattern of uh destruction and looting of Palestinian history and culture in this war alone Palestinians in Gaza have lost towering figures in in in their society who shaped and defined the cultural and scholarly life uh in Gaza and if there is one individual that captures the essence of this city and what it stands for it's if the Lions do not have their own historians the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunters will always glorify the occupier was was killed while he was Sheltering with his sister and her children before he was killed he received a phone call from an Israeli officer warning him that uh they're after him he was killed his sister was killed the children were killed and his brother was also killed I'm an academic I probably the toughest thing I have at at home is an expo Mar but if the Israelis invade if they par at us charge at US Open Door too to Massacre us I'm going to use that marker throw it at the Israeli soldiers even if that is the last thing that I would be able to do he was an important professor and and a writer and a poet whose impact transcended his personal work to shaping and molding of a generation of English-speaking Palestinians in Gaza who mastered the art of telling their stories but we we've also lost a large number of cultural and literary figures and of course many academics this is an assault on the people who create meaning in society and who create the language that helps people understand and and reflect on their reality Israel knew what it has been doing and continues to do by attacking and going after our cultural and literary and intellectual figures but tat like Gaza is an idea and ideas don't die buddies can perish cities can be destroyed but the ideas that they stand for the principles and the values these are things that uh do not just vanish Into Thin Air they continue to exist and to inspire people for many years to come thanks for watching now hit that like button and leave us a
