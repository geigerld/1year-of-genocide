the UN Security Council is expected to vote in the coming hours on a resolution calling for the suspension of hostilities in Gaza the vote has already been delayed twice this week as diplomats have been negotiating with the United States on the wording of the resolution earlier this month Washington vetoed a resolution calling for a ceasefire the latest draft calls on the parties of the conflict in Gaza to comply with their obligations under international law regarding the protection of civilians it also calls for Urgent and extended humanit Aran pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full Rapid Safe and unhindered humanitarian access additionally it calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages let bringing our correspondent Gabriel elizando he's joining us live from the UN headquarters in New York so many delays Gabe what's been the hold up and what are we expecting tonight well the holdup has quite frankly been the United States that's very clear because the United States uh is uh clearly not satisfied with the original draft uh that came out on Friday there was circulated on Friday that called uh for a suspension I'm sorry called for a cessation of hostilities so they asked for that wording to be changed it was changed to suspension of hostilities a less permanent uh uh term there uh and it's been the United States that we think has been continuing to ask for changes and modifications uh behind the scenes in closed doors but at some point uh the other members of the security Council primarily the United Arab Emirates which is drafted and essentially sponsoring this resolution has to either agree to continue delays or not and so we are believe now that uh there will be a vote uh within the next hour or two in the security Council and uh at that point we will see what happens uh on this now this first draft came out last Friday so this has been now we're on day five almost uh almost into day six if you will on this draft being reviewed by the United States and other other Security Council Members this is a hugely important uh Security Council resolution uh it has wide support by Security Council Members it will pass that is very clear the only thing that would prevent it from passing is if the United States chooses to veto it and we are being told between two sources diplomatic sources uh been speaking to Al jazer have said that they are hearing that the US has not taken off the table the option to veto we have not heard from the United States we'll wait until that vote happens but uh clearly there has been a lot of last minute negotiations but according to two diplomatic sources that told Al jazer that they are hearing that the United States has not taken off the table the option for a potential VTO Gabe thank you very much for that that is Gabriel alzando live at the UN headquarters in New York for now
