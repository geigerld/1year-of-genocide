to a line that's dropping Hamas saying it intends to suspend negotiations unless food is brought into Northern Gaza well let's bring in osam hamdan he's senior spokesperson of Hamas joins us on the phone line from Beirut can you confirm that is Hamas now decided it will withdraw from talks unless food Aid is brought into Northern Gaza well I don't know what do you mean by The Source because uh in a few hours ago there was a statement by Mr Han the head of Hamas movement when he expressed clearly uh the positive position from Hamas towards the negotiations and our willing to achieve an enagement to uh to to to have a ceasefire a complete ceasefire and to introduce a full support for our Palestinian people that was the statement by Mr Han so I don't know what is the meaning of some sources from Hamas are saying that so from your understanding uh Hamas is still uh in the talks are talks ongoing right now uh according directly to what SM have said we have reacted in a very positive and resp responsible way with the brothers mediators the C and the Egyptians in order to stop the Israeli attack against the Palestinians and to leave to lift The Siege on Gazza and to talk about the the the Brisas exchange that was the statement from brother is H and he said also we will do our best in order to stop the Bloodshed and the uh ethnic cleansing against the Palestinian which is coming going on in Gaza that was the statement of brother so according to that we have a clear position from Hamas and I think this is the position which is still now from hamas's perspective what has to happen in order for there to be uh an end to this war and a permanent ceas five deal what do you want in other words well yeah yeah what exactly this is the good question what we what we exactly want it's clear that we want uh a clear ceas fire a complete fire that includes stopping the Israeli attacks and against Gaza and a complete withdrawal from Gazza strip second we we we want a reconstruction of Gazza as an international responsibility the thir to send to open the doors for bringing up all the needed AIDS uh for the Palestinians and also we want to talk about the exchange of the prisoners but it's not the main issue as the Israelis are seeking to do uh it's clear that the Palestinians are suffering from uh the Israeli attack they are suffering from Hunger we are talking about real hunger situation in northern part of GZA and we insist that this is must to be ended so this is our position and this is what we are seeking to have according to those negotiations which we are dealing in a positive way with it and in your understanding what is the point of disagreement what is holding up an agreement the main point of disagreement is Netanyahu and his games he's still playing games he's trying not to have any arrangements or agreements that is clear not because he is not accepting Hamas position but also he wants to uh uh not he didn't accept even barish paper which was agreed on by even the Israelis themselves their response to this suggestion was negative did you receive ium did you receive a counter proposal from the Israelis after Hamas submitted as we understand from media reports Hamas submitted a proposal did you receive a counter proposal unfortunately there was no counter proposal they have comments on Paris B and it wasn't a counter proposal it it shows clearly that they they are not dealing in a positive way with Paris paper which they have agreed on any initially uh and we have we have warned everyone that Netanyahu is still playing the game to gain more time while he is killing more Palestinians without any concern about the future of the host the the the world prison in GDA without having any even attention to what may happen while he's bombing GZA knowing that some of those War prisoners were killed by the Israeli bombardment let me ask you this question what we've heard from at least from statements by the US officials who have been talking about more of a pause rather than an end to the war is that something that Hamas would be willing to consider a deal in which there is a temporary pause to fighting and a release or exchange of prisoners and captives what this this this uh this position of the United States it shows that they are still covering the position of the Israelis they have welcomed through the Diplomatic channels they have welcomed our paper and then they start talking about abos it means that they are still supporting nyaho uh ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians and they are Partners in that if they did not do their best to make it end so Americans about the bu it's a partnership it's a partnership with this with the Israelis all right thank you very much hamand let's go back to
