the war on Gaza comes on the 106th anniversary of the balfor Declaration which changed the lives of Palestinians forever so what was that declaration well for centuries the Ottoman Empire controlled Palestine until it was conquered in 1917 by advancing British troops during the first World War the British foreign secretary Arthur balfor wrote a letter to a prominent member of the British Jewish Community saying his government was in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people well at that time only 8% of palestine's population was Jewish the letter also said nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine but after the war ended in 1918 the newly created League of Nations mandated Palestine to British control with the language of the Bal for declaration written in 1948 after the second world war British occupiers left Palestine the newly formed United Nations declared the creation of the state of Israel more than 700,000 Palestinians lost their land well Vincent fi is a former British Consul General in Jerusalem he's also a trustee for the Bal for project charity which says its mission is to address the UK's responsibility for peace and Security in Israel and pal joins me live from London good to have you with us so do you agree with those who say that it was the ball declaration that laid the foundation for conflict in the region I believe that on this 106th um anniversary of the Bala declaration that declaration is still alive because its impact is still with us and it has led to conflict the document that you read out uh the very short promise to the Zionist leader in the UK um says two things it says a Homeland for the Jewish people but without prejudice to the civil and religious rights of non-jewish people which were the majority as you've said um Britain's role in that time was I would say a policy of Deceit um the Bal for project charity that you mentioned that I'm the trustee of uh has a website with information objective information about the British role we focus on Britain the website is bpo.org and one of my fellow trustees has written a book which I commend to your viewers called a policy of Deceit because Britain promised the same land to the Sharif of Mecca before promising it to uh the leader of the Zionist movement in the UK and and then during the Mandate period the the only consistent thing that Britain did was effectively to prevent Palestine becoming an independent state for as long as there was an Arab Palestinian majority there in that's led to conflict and it gives Britain a responsibility today to take a lead as a government as a people to try to ensure equality between Israelis and Palestinians with Mutual Security the idea that unilateral security can be imposed by one people on another through the occupation is wrong and it's being proved to be wrong tragically as we speak just want to pick up on something you said there the the only effective thing Britain did in that period was preventing an independent state of Palestine to emerge for as long as there was still a Palestinian Arab majority there there effectively what does that mean denying Palestinians of having a chance at State Hood themselves this was in Imperial times sadly and the Imperial Legacy is still with us the method used by Britain in that mandate period um was essentially to flip and flop between um Sympathy for the Jewish uh migrants immigrants particularly at the time of the Holocaust and frankly a lack of Sympathy for the national aspirations of the Palestinian Arab people and the outcome was a mess Britain left a mess behind and I feel no pride in that but turning to now I think Britain has a responsib ability a duty as a state as a government to do several things to recognize the state of Palestine which it has failed to do uh Britain recognized Israel as a state in 1950 long ago that recognition stands and will not go away but the idea of recognizing the state of Palestine as more than 140 other states in the UN have done is important it's important symbolically it's more than important symbolically it's important legally because it means that the international criminal court and the international court of justice can rule on the legality of the occupation uh 56 years on from 1967 and can investigate alleged war crimes in Gaza and in Israel both past and present all right given that everything you've just described there in the process ultimately this was a European colonial power promising to give land to a movement which was primarily comprised and led by European non-natives to the land of Palestine was this not setting the stage for a colonial project I called it Imperial uh the the British uh themselves ourselves did not colonize Palestine uh under our time more and more Jewish migrants some driven to Israel by the horrors of the Holocaust came and as I said we flipped and flopped at one stage uh Britain prevented uh Jewish migrants from Landing uh after World War II um in order to try to keep some sort of uh imperfect balance between the uh the Jewish population and the Palestinian in it over to what was primarily a non-native movement that led did it not to a policy of colonizing I think that what we should look at if I may say is look at now what should the British government be doing now it should be urging its Israeli uh Ally to allow fuel medicine clean water food into Gaza it should be urging Israel to end Collective punishment of the 2.3 million Palestinian people it should be urging Hamas through intermediaries like katar and Egypt to release the more than 240 hostages unconditionally we're all living under the same God the lives of Palestinians and Israelis are of equal value that needs to be emphasized it needs to be said by Israel's partners and it needs to be said loudly and I would like that to be said by Tony blinken when he gets to uh Israel and the region uh tomorrow uh may I also just add one of the point which was mentioned in your earlier uh reporting quite rightly the risk to Palestinians in the West Bank of displacement is very high more than 2,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the beginning of this year by settler violence and the silence or even support of the Israeli Army so what can we do about that in our terms in the UK uh we can write to our MPS we can try to exercise our Democratic rights to protest but also to propose an outcome after this tragic war ends and that outcome has to be Mutual Security it has to be recognition of the State of Palestine by Britain and by Partners in the Commonwealth and in the rest of Europe and it has to mean that we end up in a situation where this tragedy can never be repeated that means Mutual Security but it also means parity of esteem parity of esteem from the West for Palestinians and Israelis and we don't have that today all right thanks so much we'll leave it there thank you
