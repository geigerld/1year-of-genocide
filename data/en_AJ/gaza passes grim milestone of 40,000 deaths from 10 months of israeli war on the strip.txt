hello and welcome to the program more than 40,000 Palestinian men women and children have been killed in almost 11 months of Israel's Relentless war on Gaza making it one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history that Grim Milestone comes on the same day new efforts have started here in Doha to broker a ceasefire but with Israel's genocide in Gaza continuing the number killed is set to keep Rising z b begins our coverage tens of thousands of lives violently taken tens of thousands of voices forever silenced for the dead the suffering is over for the living the agony of survival 40,000 men women children and babies 40,000 Sons daughters mothers fathers 40,000 people often left in pieces for friends and family to mourn sometimes buried by strangers because whole families have been wiped out attack helicopters and air strikes drones tanks and artillery pounding one of the most densely populated civilian areas in the world 40,000 victims of the kind of indiscriminate bombing that might seem unimaginable in the 21st century victims whom Israel's government has coldly characterized as 40,000 human shields for me 40,000 people is tens of thousands of parents whose lives will never be the same because they've lost their children it's thousands and thousands of children who have forever lost their parents and it's ongoing and I think that's what people struggle to understand that all those people who have not been killed all those people who are trying to get through without a parent in the trauma having lost a child are currently living in tents still going through bombardment the impact of bombs and bullets is often immediate but many die after being crushed under collapsed buildings or from preventable infections disease and starvation because Israel is blocking medical supplies and food from entering Gaza it can mean a slower death seemingly more cruel if this happened in any European country there would have been a reaction condemnation and a stronger response we are at a stage where a person in Gaza has no value they just the number can you imagine what 40,000 means it is a catastrophic number that the world cannot imagine despite this the world sees is aware hears and watches us every day every minute but remains silent and we are powerless we are exhausted we have no energy left enough even if this is revenge against Palestinians they have taken enough Revenge enough intervention is needed what is happening proves that the world is complicit with Israel and the entire world is intent on the destruction of the Palestinian people even if the war ended today past conflicts show indirect long-term effects continue for years and it is a near certainty that the death toll in Gaza will continue to rise in a letter published in the medical journal the Lancet experts predict the final count will not be measured in the tens of thousands but in the hundreds of thousands and while massacres can be measured the scale of death put into numbers the level of suffering and Trauma now and going forward is incalculable Zan basravi Al jazer make sure to subscribe to our channel to get latest news from Al jazer
