Israeli tanks have targeted starving civilians seeking food killing at least nine Palestinians in Gaza the attack took place at the Q roundabout in the center of the strip the Israeli military has repeatedly targeted the location in recent weeks last month Israeli forces killed more than 115 civilians near the same area hany Mahmud joins us now on the phone from Rafa in southern Gaza hany this uh area q roundabout it's it's a place where people trying to get Aid seem to be repeatedly targeted by Israeli forces what's the situation there yes good morning glory and that's why people have been calling this area as a desert trap but despite the dangers involving in that the Kuwaiti roundabout on Salah wood hunger and and starvation and inforce the dehydration and starvation just doesn't stop people from get getting together waiting for it as they are largely hungry in addition to the fact that they've been displaced and and traumatized for the most part since the beginning of this genocidal War nine people have been killed so far and in fact the initial number was seven and two just died in the shifa hospital as there is no medical proper medical intervention whatsoever the other 20 plus injuries inside a shipa hospital are likely to lose their life right now because their injuries are very severe and the hospital doesn't have the capacity to intervene and provide life saving elements right now or a treatment because it has been non-operational since it was stormed and largely damaged by the Israeli military with in the past three months this has unfortunately becoming the new normal for Aid SE Seekers and hungry Palestinians stranded in the northern part in Gaza City we've seen this happening almost in on daily basis right now people get together wait for food supplies and and other survivals and they're being attacked by the Israeli military and as of this month today is the second day of the month of Ramadan and that doesn't seem to stop the Israeli military from committing these atrocities at all in addition to the attacks on the on Aid Seekers we see an intense bombing campaign and and heavy artillery Shilling across G distrib from the northern part of the trip including Gaza City and its Western neighborhoods to the central area the refugee camps to hanun mainly the eastern part of the city of hanun where from Raa City here we could hear clearly the sound of explosion of the systematic control demolition of residential homes uh to the point a lot of of the civil defense crew parameters describe the eastern part of hanun as an largely empty clear land now there are no signs of Life of any or infrastructure or public facilities at of early hours of this ra City came under at least two air strikes along with the constant ongoing artillery Shing of the eastern part of the city but no injuries reported at two residential homes that were targeted in Raa city were uh empty and uh but the fact that it that the explosion happened and the attacks happened just forced a people within the vicinity of the area into further more displacement just aggravating their already miserable living conditions okay hany Mahmud bring us the latest on the situation across Gaza Gaza there from Rafa in the South thanks very much hany
