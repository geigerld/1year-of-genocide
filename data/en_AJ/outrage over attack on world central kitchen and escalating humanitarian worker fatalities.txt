well Harden Lang is vice president for programs and policy at refugees International he joins us live from Washington DC Harden good to have you with us so uh there's been widespread condemnation around the world against Israel uh for killing these Sade workers from the world's Central Kitchen what's your response Harden to the attack it seemed intentional despite Israel saying it wasn't the strike on world Central Kitchen is as unacceptable as it is tragic you know the death of 7 a workers under any circumstances um would be you know unacceptable and not permitted under an international humanitarian law that they'd be targeted in this fashion this situation is particularly inrees not only for the nature and scope of the incident in question but as the UN Secretary General earlier said because it comes at such like a bookend or a milestone in such a tempo of operations of seeing 196 almost 200 humanitarian Aid workers killed in the last six months I I've been doing this work for a number of decades and I don't think I've ever seen this pace of death amongst humanitarian Aid workers in any conflict yeah and that's so now I was going to say Harden that's an interesting point you make because what is clear following this attack is just how dangerous Gaza is for Aid workers let's remember as you were saying there it's not just International Aid workers who died yesterday more than 200 workers mostly from the UN have been killed in Gaza since October the 7th indeed and many of them are Palestinian and they are they deserve the exact same sort of protections uh and and condemnation under international law as their International counterparts um the thing that also really stands out about this is the fact that world Central Kitchen had been uh coordinating so closely with the Israeli military and Israeli Defense Forces in its operations in north and Central Gaza um and this is a time when very few organizations are actually providing humanitarian relief or Aid or food Aid in the North in the midst of a famine I think it's really important to emphasize this point because you know a number of folks number of uh reports talk about famine being imminent in Gaza like the data actually suggests pretty strongly that famine is underway in core Pockets especially in the north and this is what the maritime option was developed um to respond to with the B of the pier and the humanitarian Aid coming through off that Pier to World Central by World Central Kitchen and so in the midst of a famine this is going to have a huge chilling effect as we're already seeing on operations that cannot be considered this point I mean right now what we need more than anything else is a massive scaling of humanitarian operations across a number of sectors across the entirety of Gaza and this is going to set us back significantly Harden um world Central Kitchen and other groups have now paused their operations in Gaza because of this attack talk us through briefly uh the challenges facing Aid groups in getting food into Gaza uh with all 2.3 million people there now facing either starvation or acute food shortages right there are a series of challenges that are in that that a groups are facing the first and some of the largest challenges are actually getting the food Aid into or any Aid into Gaza itself so for example we have huge backlogs of trucks in Egypt and Jordan and elsewhere trying to make their way into um Gaza to deliver all forms of humanitarian assistance and a series of different restrictions which are being put on them largely by the Israeli authorities are keeping those trucks from actually Crossing in once you're inside it's a question of distribution and there there are a series of different challenges one The Limited number of infrastructure trucks and other sort of vehicles to move things around that are there and are operational two there is some concern over the like increasing like dynamics of the security environment in terms of um sort of popular discontent the breakdown of Law and Order robberies Etc but the real challenge that we're hearing from every Aid worker on the ground now is it's more strikes by Israel the military uh pace of military activity and the targeting of Aid workers is the number one thing that's preventing people from moving around so you have a whole challenges of getting in and you can see actually growing frustration with the inability get trucks in or leading the United States and others to support this Maritime option and then dropping aid from the air both of which are massively inefficient all right Harden Lang we have to leave it there thank you very much indeed for your time and your analysis Harden thank you thank you now the Palestinian Authority has relaunched its bid for full membership of the United Nations it wants the security Council to vote this month on its application which was first filed back in 2011 at the moment the Palestinians are considered a non-member Observer state by by the UN full membership can only be approved by the security Council in the past the US has said it would veto any such measure members of the United Nations security Council are calling for deescalation and accountability following that Israeli air strike on the Iranian Consulate in Syria Monday strike in Damascus killed two senior commanders of the Islamic revolutionary guard along with 12 other people Iran's been calling for both Israel and the US to be held accountable for the attack Russia requested the emergency meeting of the security Council and describe the nature of the strikes as Reckless this is not the first attack carried out by Israel in a densely populated area of the capital Damascus which has generated high risks of mass casualties among civilians since the beginning of the escalation of the Palestinian Israeli confrontation on October 7th the number of Civilian attacks on Syrian civilian infrastructure and Syria's neighbors has multiplied as the White House has stated the United States had no involvement in the reported strike yesterday in Syria neither did we know about it ahead of time we have communicated this directly to Iran we cannot confirm any information about this event as We Gather details one thing is clear Iran and its proxy and partner groups need to avoid escalating tensions in the region the choice is Stark either uphold the principle of the UN Charter and and on international law or risk plunging into chaos and insecurity on the regional spillover it's now crystal clear that Israel ongoing destabilized and irresponsible actions and atrocities against the nations in our region are a real threat to Regional and International Peace and security well Iran has warned it will retaliate for the air strike on its Consul building in Damascus Iran supreme leader Ayatollah aliam says Israel will be punished and that it'll be made to regret its actions president ibraim RI condemn the attack as a clear violation of international regulations which will not go unanswered Gabriel Alando has more on that security council meeting at the UN there was a lot to unpack there but I think there are some main themes that we saw woven through if you will and that's pretty much accountability a lot of people wanted accountability uh for Israel for this attack and I think it was because so many diplomats that work in this building really raised their eyebrows if you will because of this attack because it was against a diplomatic facility and there are a whole host of international conventions including the UN Charter itself that speak about how it's supposed to protect uh diplomatic facility so it's was a gross violation of of these International conventions if you will and and I think that's why so many uh speakers uh uh Nations that were on the the security Council spoke out against this and you also heard definitely a call for deescalation uh really worries that countries could use their proxies uh in retaliation and there was calls to really restrain uh in any sort of retaliation on that front but clearly uh it was Russia that echoed uh the view I think of a lot of council members saying that it was Israel being being the aggressor and they are the ones that are responsible for any retaliatory action
