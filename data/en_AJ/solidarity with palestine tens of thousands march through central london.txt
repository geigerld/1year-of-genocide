thousands of demonstrators in London have marched in support of Palestinians is the latest in a series of protests in European cities in recent days a counter demonstration was called because of was canceled rather because of security concerns but a smaller event by a group that supports Israel's actions did go ahead in central London Harry foret was at the march with this update so this latest March Now setting off along whiteall its destination hide Park as always concerns about the latest phases of the war in Gs of the potential for a fulls scale assault on Rafa this is as well the first March since the discovery of that mass grave at Al NASA hospital and the first since the dramatic scenes we've seen at campuses in the United States we spoke to some students here a short while ago we are so proud of it to be honest this builds um more strength among students and I think it's it's getting huge it's getting a spread um in the whole states and around the world and it's making everything more important and it's so so important now the campaign against anti-Semitism was also scheduled to be holding a March or what it called a walk together event at the same time it pulled that off it said for fear of hostile actors and the safety of Jews at the same time I put those points to the head of the Palestine solidarity campaign Ben Jamal this tactic of conflating anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the state of Israel is a very very familiar one uh and is used globally by Israel to silence palan voices and those uh who are advocating for Palestinian rights another counter-protest by a pro-israel group did take place though a group calling itself enough is enough stationed in a static demonstration alongside the pro Palestinian March route uh police concentrated at that area and kept both protesting groups apart from each other the prop Palestinian group then ending up here in Hyde Park for their rally they say that this the 13th such National protest in London is the latest but certainly not the last they intend to continue with this action in support of Gaza and against the war Harry foret Al jazer London make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
