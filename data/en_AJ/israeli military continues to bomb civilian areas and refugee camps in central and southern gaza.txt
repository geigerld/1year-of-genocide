all right let's clear what that was that was obviously not a mother grieving her son that was hind reporting to us from alghazi refugee camp but we can go now to Southern Gaza Let's cross over to T abum he's there for us so let's talk a little bit about these strikes around hospitals like EML where are they leaving the ability of medical facilities yes uh bloody attacks on kanun did not stop during this day where the latest had claimed the lives of around 30 Palestinians who have been taking shelter in one of the residential houses that is so close to alal hospital uh belong to the Palestinian red Christians inside Gaza now uh these people have been living peacefully as the Israeli forces were expanding the military operations in the city of hunis destroying residential buildings uh over the civilian head where also a number of residents have been injured being transported to receive treatment into anaser hospital now the situation there is very catastrophic as our civilians are trying to flee more after receiving different evacuation orders from the Israeli military to head more to the south in Rafa to for their own uh safety but we need to remember earlier thatas has been designated as a safe zone now the military attacks had reached this area with more uh severity where residents are facing dramatic UND conditions um those people are completely trapped there have a kind of partial access to get to the South but the fact there that the fighting and the heavy bombardment continue where the Israeli forces are trying to eliminate the military infrastructure as they as they claim for the Palestinian Fighters and to take full control over this largest uh one of the largest city inside Gaza andic as more and more people head towards Raa take us through just how stressed that area has become coming yes haam of course we we saw today horrific scenes as our colleague H was reporting that people hundreds of them were evacuating to uh to the South to find a place that they might Fe they might feel or get a sense of safety there away from the Israeli bombing now those people had been going through very difficult days as the Israeli bombardment started in a very intense rate during the last couple of days and we have been reporting that this kind of Shilling and unprecedented attacks is just only an introductory to the military ground inclusion to this area and this is practically what is happening right now where the military are starting their mil limited ground inclusion to ALB and Alat refugee camp throughout different areas in these uh two areas these two regions now those people are fleeing to the South but the fact in on the south is really also uh chaotic as people and and more people are getting to this area making very densely populated as people are taking shelter in MA Shi makeshift tent that are set up in public places after the hospitals schools uh United Nation run shelters have become uh very uh overwhelmed and working beyond the cap its capacity and those people are want only to survive along with their children and their families away from the Israeli bombing but the question which is triggering more growing concerns among Palestine what if the military operation extended to Rafa every single house had at least dos of evacuees which means that more difficult scenarios might face Palestinians within the coming days if there's going to be much more expansion of the military operations all right thanks so much there
