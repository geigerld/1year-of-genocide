let's get more on this with Maran Bashar Al jazer senior political analyst he joins us from London thank you for your time today Maran so Biden's comments come to Jesus remark it appears to indicate Biden's frustration with Israel but what is slightly more confusing is given the enormous leverage the US has over Israel why the Israelis don't seem to be listening unless the US are not actually using that leverage well yes absolutely I mean this whole thing has becoming so comical if it wasn't all so tragic in Gaza but definitely the relationship between Biden and Netanyahu is so absurd the fact that the American president that just committed more than4 billion dollar to Israel in addition to some $40 billion in Aid to a country that is you know rather doing well in German but it's kind of squeezed now there is at least so much economic and financial leverage that Washington can use against Israel or with Israel but it's not using and then there's the arms America has basically opened its storage uh for ammunition to give to Israel 83% of the bombs of the ammunition used against the people in Gaza to commit that gen side in Gaza are American bombs and ammunitions at least according to one American Congress woman so there's so much leverage it is so easy for the American president if he is really serious about dictating to Netanyahu what he must do at least on the humanitarian front I have absolutely no doubt that he can do that without the song and dance without the theatrics that that he's involved in without all the politics and the and the public relations Washington can and should must use its leverage in order for Israel to allow more humanitarian Aid into Gaza and to stop the war well linking to this whole Aid situation we now have the US uh talking about these attempts to get Aid to Gaza via some sort of Maritime route it it's is talking about building a port which could take two months to build many Aid groups have criticized this as not being genuine what's your take on it well there is a consensus that it's not genuine and despite that there are some Hamas spokesperson who are welcoming it you know Hamas being pragmatic about the fact if anyone wants to help you know let it be through sea fine let it be through the sea but if the Americans are really serious they can use the same leverage in order to erect a port in order to establish a port by putting that same leverage on the Egyptian government and the Israeli government to allow Aid in from Egypt and from Israel into Gaza it's it's not rocket science there are hundreds of uh lores already on the borders all full of whatever is needed in Gaza but they just not allowed in so really it makes the question why go through 350 km in the sea line from Cyprus when you can just open the borders and allow the trucks in and why continue to undermine Ona even to wage a war on hona by Israel supported by the United States when horaa is indispensable to get that Aid distributed to the people in Gaza because you see one thing is to get the aid to the port or to the Border another thing is to get it distributed throughout Gaza to to the people who need it most and for that we need honor and hence honor must now be honored supported financed and totally protected by the likes of the United States instead of being sanctioned and undermined by Washington and a okay Maran Bashar good to get your thoughts Al jazer senior political analyst
