well in an exclusive interview with Al jazer US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin discussed the war in Gaza and the prospects of a ceasefire deal aler Jalal Chada sat down with him for a one-on-one Hamas submitted a response uh to uh the proposal seeking some um amendments how do you assess the um um the response so far just to step back for one second uh 12 days ago um president Biden laid out this proposal and in that time almost the entire world came out in support of it uh including the United Nations security Council but also the Arab League virtually every country in this region and well beyond um Israel accepted the proposal Palestinian Authority uh accepted the proposal uh Hamas was the one answer we were waiting for and the answer that we got last night uh that was submitted to um cutter was submitted to Egypt uh and to us as the mediators in this process unfortunately was not the yes that everyone else had provided uh it was um looking for more changes to the uh to the agreement including uh changes on items that Hamas had previously accepted so the hard reality is um we could have a ceasefire we could have maybe had a ceasefire 12 days ago uh but we don't in this moment because Hamas has not said yes we have I think some changes that Hamas is looking for that are workable that we can uh try to uh uh close the gap on there are others that are not workable so we have to see in the days ahead uh whether we can actually close the gaps I think that um uh the gaps are are bridgeable but just because they are doesn't mean they will be ultimately Hamas has to decide everyone else has decided Hamas is not what does not workable for you and for the Israel well I can't get into the details you understand that given the sensitivity of the negotiations um we're not going to talk about the the details but what I can say is this the um proposal that President Biden laid out 12 days ago was virtually identical to one that Hamas had accepted uh and put forward itself on May the 6th so there's no reason why uh this uh agreement should not be reached the only reason would be Hamas continuing to try to change the terms but here's what's the reality the reality is as this negotiation is going on during the 12 days that it took Hamas to respond the world wasn't standing still Gaza wasn't standing still people were suffering every single day uh Palestinian children women and men suffering every single day so from my perspective from our perspective it's time to stop all of this haggling and back and forth and start a ceasefire Hamas said the priority is to stop the war um what information did you receive from um prime minister benam Netanyahu during your meeting with him a few days ago in Israel um uh concerning the the permanent ceasefire in Gaza so what I can tell you from my conversations with the Prime Minister Netanyahu was a reaffirmation of Israel's acceptance of The Proposal that's on the table and what does that proposal have in it it it says first of all that there'll be an immediate ceasefire immediate and in that during that immediate ceasefire um Israel will pull its forces back from populated areas in Gaza will surge more humanitarian assistance into uh Gaza um Palestinians living in Gaza will be able to return to their neighborhoods their homes if their homes are still intact anywhere uh in Gaza and during that initial Phase 6 weeks both both parties Israel and Hamas commit to negotiate toward a permanent ceasefire with the understanding that uh the initial ceasefire will continue as long as those negotiations are going on and this is backed by the United States it's backed by cter it's backed by Egypt this is the quickest most effective path to a durable ceasefire and that means an end of the an end of the war it also opens up so many other possibilities for where we want to go um to try to get a truly durable piece for everyone in the region and one place that we believe it's important to go is the realization of Palestinian State how how do you plan to address the situation now what are the next steps so I've met over the last uh two days with qari and Egyptian counterparts we've been uh intensely engaged with uh with all of our colleagues who've been working as mediators on this agreement uh we have to continue to analyze the document and then see if um over the coming days we can find a way to bridge the gaps that have emerged because Hamas wouldn't say yes what are the assurance that your Administration can offer to both parties to um in order to uh proceed and finalizing the agreement well I think the the the assurances first of all are that the the three countries that have been mediating this the United States qar and Egypt stand fully behind it and will stand behind it and we'll we'll make sure that both parties to the agreement make good on the commit ments that are in the agreement second I think there's a there's another Assurance here which is the power of the fact that virtually the entire world stands behind this agreement it's pretty rare these days to get the United Nations security Council to speak with an almost unanimous voice 14 votes in favor not a single vote against and the Russians abstaining that I think speaks volumes to the fact that people all around the world want to see this war come to an end they want to see the suffering come to an end they want the hostages returned all of that is in the proposal that's on the table uh meanwhile uh Israel operation to rescue for hostages in in nsat uh resulted in the death of more than 270 civilians three hostages one of them uh American uh obviously um um um according to what uh the military spokesman of Kasam said do you think that uh military operations will release and secure the hostages in Gaza first it's it is horrible that innocent children women and men lost their lives in the intense uh Crossfire the battle that took place when Israel was in the process of trying to rescue its its hostages uh just as it's horrific that so many lives are being lost so many lives are being ruined every single day in Gaza as a result of a war that Hamas started on October 7th um look there shouldn't have been any hostages to begin with once the hostages were taken Hamas could have released the every single day since they took them they didn't Israel has a right to try to uh rescue its its people um I wish that innocence had not been lost in the in the process but again the quickest way to resolve this entirely the fastest way to resolve it entirely so that the war comes to an end all the hostages come home and we build a durable peace is through this agreement through this proposal was Washington involved prior to or during this Israeli operation to uh rescue for hostages inera I I can't speak to any uh any details but of course we've um tried to help uh the Israelis locate hostages if we had any information of course we provide that we want to see them come home I think the most effective way to bring everyone home is through an agreement that not only brings them home but gets an immediate cease fire and leads to a permanent one efforts are being made from your uh from your side to reopen RAF uh Crossing uh have any agreements been made with Israel to reopen to manage the crossing to prevent a severe famine uh in Gaza especially in the north we're working on that every single day we uh we want to see Rafa reopened uh just as we want to make sure not only that more humanitarian assistance is getting uh to Gaza but that once it's in Gaza it's getting effectively distributed to people who desperately need it we were at a conference yesterday in Jordan that brought the entire region and actually many countries from around the world together to do more for the Palestinians who are desperately in need uh the United States pledged another $400 million uh we are by far the single largest country contributor uh to Palestinians any country on Earth uh and we've now since the start of uh of the war in Gaza contributed uh nearly $700 million uh and uh $2.2 billion during the course of this Administration uh but it's imperative that not only are the resources there but that there are ways to get it into Gaza and once it's in Gaza move it around to people who need it we've had progress in in recent weeks in in the north where the israeli's open Crossings and more is getting in there's a route from Jordan uh that goes directly so that trucks can move from Jordan through Israel to The Crossings um many goods are coming in through ashod Port but just as that was happening the situation reversed in the South with the closure of as a result of the operations around Raa so yes we want to get that open as quickly as possible uh I can tell you we're working really around the clock with the Egyptians with the Israelis to find a way to get an agreement to reopen it Mr blinkin after visiting Israel lately where you met with uh Minister uh guns yeah uh how do you assess the current uh internal situation in Israel uh following the resignation of Gant and Eisen from the Civil War look it's really not uh for me to comment on uh Israeli politics these are decisions for the for the Israelis to make these are decisions for the individuals to make about their participation or not in the government decisions for the Israeli people to make about uh about their government um Minister Gans is someone I have great respect for we've worked uh closely together and so and he leads uh a major party so of course he's someone I'm going to talk to just as I'll see people in the in the government uh the opposition leader y Leed it's important for us to be talking to everyone so that we have the clearest possible reflection of what people's views are throughout Israel and across Israeli Society your your Administration bluntly rejected any occupation of Gaza after War that's right um how do you envision the future in Gaza who's going to be in charge uh uh on what you call it the next day so this is this is critical because um in order for this this for to end uh we also have to be be ready for that and ready for what comes next for what happens on the day after how do we uh look at governance uh how do we look at security how do we look at the Reconstruction which is going to be a massive undertaking over these last four or five months I've been Consulting intensely with Partners in the um in the Arab world uh with the Palestinian Authority including just over the last two days precisely on these questions the day the day after plans and without going into any details now uh we're we're at a point and I mentioned this earlier today where we are going to be be putting forward ideas concrete ideas for what we believe should happen how we uh help organize things so that uh there can be a day after that actually uh deals with all the challenges that Gaza will face that Palestinians will face even once once the conflict ends uh last question uh Mr blinkin about to the West Bank um settlers violence increases in West Bank especially after October the 7th how do you assess the the situation there we've been deeply concerned about this and as you as you know um we uh have taken steps to um sanction uh extremist uh settlers who've engaged in acts of violence or intimidation um and will as necessary to continue to do that but we have real concerns about about that uh and beyond that I think life in the uh the West Bank already challenging and difficult has gotten even more difficult as people are not able to go to go to jobs uh that they've had as movement is um is more restricted uh and uh as we see pressure being exerted from uh the uh extremist settlers so this is something that not only is a deep concern to us but it's also something we we've taken action on um beyond all of that look we are working every day to bring this war to an end to bring the suffering of people to an end to bring the hostages home to put us to put everyone on the path to a more durable peace more durable security and a big part of that is getting this agreement I think that's the most critical step but there's something else that's so critical in this moment and it's so hard what I've seen over these last eight months and of course it predates the eight months but it's been intensified is something I've talked about before um but it's this poison of dehumanization the inability of all sides to see the humanity in the other and when that happens when Hearts Harden um it becomes very very hard uh to do the good things and it becomes very easy to justify the bad things so one of the things that we have to do we have to find a way to do is to remember the humanity in in each other because that's what it's all about when I see children little boys little girls lose their parents in Gaza and are on their own um that hits me as hard as uh a little boy or little girl who lost his or her parents on October 7th there's no hierarchy of suffering it's all about real human beings and that's the thing we have to have in our minds every single day as we work to bring this to an end but not only bring it to an end get to a to a better place um a place where Israelis and Palestinians can actually live side by side in peace and security I am convinced I'm convinced that that's not only possible it's absolutely necessary U but the first step the first step is getting the ceasefire getting this uh war in Gaza to end and building from there make sure to subscribe to our channel to
