Israeli forces have launched a new offensive on the jabalia refugee camp in Northern Gaza residential areas and shelters for displaced families have been reportedly uh targeted and several people have been killed Israel is stepping up attacks in the southern areas of Gaza the Army has ordered tens of thousands of Palestinians to leave Eastern Rafa the UN says around 150,000 people have already fled the area to discuss this I'm joined by Diana buhu Palestinian lawyer and former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation organization it's great to have you in the studio for once thank you for your time today thank um as a lawyer is it legal to displace civilians again and again and again and I could add 10 Again absolutely not unless the displacement is done in a way that is legal meaning that they were providing shelter they're providing um adequate medical care they're providing water they're providing electricity what Israel's been doing is just dropping leaflets on Palestinians they've been yesterday they dropped leaflets in the North telling people to flee to the South and then the South they're telling people to flee to the north so you have this situation in which they haven't provided even the basic necessities of life and so this this can hardly be called uh legal this is entirely illegal well I ask you this because you know I think our viewers will be familiar with the idea that there have been many breaches of international law yes committed by the Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip for months now um and we understand you can't indiscriminately bomb civilians we've discussed this on air many times um there are places that should be protected hospitals schools Etc the the threshold to attack those places legally is very high but something we've perhaps discussed a little less which is extremely relevant today is you also can't just displace hundreds of thousands of people that's right and in their displacement of them they haven't been providing the basic necessities of life you know it's it's important to keep in mind that not every person is able-bodied not every person has the ability to be fleeing you're talking about people who have been injured traumatized and Israel has done absolutely nothing to make sure that there is a place for them to go not just that the other thing that they've done is when they tell people to flee they they've actually been shown that they're bombing those areas that they've told people to flee to so there is no safe space in Gaza and I think we do a huge disservice if we somehow think that there is no place in Gaza safe at the moment staying with the in the legal world for a second longer um we know there's a case against Israel at the international court of justice the icj has already said there's plausibly genocide going on here in the Gaza the strip now South Africa which had brought the case initially is asking for additional uh emergency measures to be imposed by the court basically they're asking the court to tell Israel to stop this do you even want it feels like all of this is happening in a parallel world because it has zero impact on the ground do you even watch these legal developments anymore I do I do watch these legal developments because although they may seem like they aren't worth anything these legal developments are going to lead into long lasting legal developments for example if it's through these courts that we can then be pushing for arms embargos to be uh against Israel it's through these courts that we can be pushing for sanctions and it's through these courts that we should be pushing for boycotts and for divestment the legal aspects alone we know that the us is going to do everything to try to stop those legal Maneuvers but the US doesn't control the world and there are other countries that do believe in a rule of law and the system of law and it's that system that we have to be pushing forward not this idea that might is right okay so you are watching this closely but more for the long-term consequences then so let's talk shortterm what do you think is Israel's endgame here Israel's made it clear what its endgame is genocide and ethnic cleansing and the fact that well they obviously wouldn't put it that way they've put the genocide part very clearly they've made enough statements of of genocidal intent and the ethnic cleansing within the first week uh on this very program they indicated that they wanted to see Palestinians going into the Sinai they indicated they want to see a smaller Gaza Strip fewer in numbers as well that equals ethnic cleansing but as you know they've changed the the reason I I interjected is because now Israel has changed its public messaging they are saying at every press conference that they have they're saying we are trying to you know limit casualties to civilians limit damage to civilian infrastructure etc etc and yet they still continue to bomb schools they still continue to bomb hospitals 30 of 36 hospitals have been bombed there the the line that they say in the to the public is very different than what we see on the ground and what we see on the ground is genocide okay so back to the back to the end game what does Israel want to achieve because there's still a million civilians left in Rafa city correct and that's exactly what they're trying to get at is they want to make life so miserable that Palestinians end up eventually leaving whether it's right now or in the future you mean out of the strip or out of the strip entirely in its entirety this is what they want to to see and theyve they've made it they've made their desires very very clear we even talking about people who are now saying they're going to rebuild the settlements in the Gaza Strip so all of it is clear in terms of what it is that they want the question is whether or not we're believing them and the International Community continues not to believe Israel even though Israel's made its its intentions very clear and followed those intentions with actions militarily this does not seem to be going well for Israel I'm no military expert but they back fighting Fierce fighting we told in jabalia in the northern part of the Gaza Strip which they said that they cleared months ago and clearly Hamas has a pretty um pretty impressive I mean remarkable ability to just come back where they were supposed to have been defeated and even more than that it's been made clear to the Israeli public that there will no there will not be any Israelis released unless there is a ceasefire and this is why you're now seeing that there are demands for a ceasefire does that mean that they don't want to pulverize Gaza the answer is no the vast majority of Israelis do believe in continuing to pound uh Gaza but uh militarily as you as you said already this is not going in their favor now since you mentioned the ceasefire do you think that this that the the the expanding ground offensive in Rafa along with the fighting in jabalia could also be used by Israel as a bargaining chip this is what they've been doing so they've been doing a few things one is they've been uh taking in and arresting many more Palestinians mostly abducting them to be quite honest because they're held without charge without trial they've been going and trying to take more land in the Gaza Strip and the third thing is increasing the military offensive in the attacks particularly in places like the South and in the center as well all right Tibu Palestinian lawyer uh former legal adviser to the PLO
