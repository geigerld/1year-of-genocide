H mm joins us now from deal in central Gaza so let's just begin with what's been happening in the past few hours and the strikes across the Gaza Strip yes well Israeli air attacks continue to strike across the central area and the southern part of the strip and overnight attacks we're seeing more residential buildings being targeted and destroyed and at the fact the matter the tragedy of this happening right now is people are not giving warning whatsoever they are being targeted inside their homes and if just if they're lucky enough they would be uh paying attention or realizing that they're going to be attack and leave the area but for the most part people are caught in the line of fire and caught under these unpredictable falling bombs in different parts of the Gaza Strip in eastern khun more residential homes being targeted and this is not the first time the entire city of khun was pretty much obliterated by the Israeli military uh for the past 4 months when the Israeli military uh invaded the whole city including the destruction of its public facilities and residential buildings and evacuation centers those are managed and operated by the United Nations for Palestinian refugees honorable but reports of multiple injuries were transferred to Naser Hospital the uh uh the aftermath of these attacks is the pressure that is put on Naser Hospital hital that is already not operating very well in theat area that's the central part of G more buildings are being targeted and destroyed reported here to Ala Hospital a mother with her two children there also another attack where a father and two of his children were also killed in overnight attacks meanwhile the paramedics and the civil defense crew members were able to remove eight bodies from the different different locations in ra City those were all transferred uh to Naser Hospital given that the entire Raa City doesn't have any operational health facility whatsoever uh meanwhile the Israeli military in Gaza it pulled out uh from major parts of the western of Western Gaza City that's including a subra neighborhood the headquarters of uh of United Nations as well as the College University complex to the western part of City leaving a trail of Devastation and and destructions also many of the bodies are still in the streets paramedics and civil defense crew so far collected large number but there's still many in areas that they are unable to get to given that the uh the Skies of Gaza are clouded with Sky Predators surveillance drones and attack drones Hy thanks very much for the update Hy mm for deal
