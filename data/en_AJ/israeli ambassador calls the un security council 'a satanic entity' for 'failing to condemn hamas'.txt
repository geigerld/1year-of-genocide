we interrupt that report to bring you a live broadcast from the United Nations Riyad mansur the Palestinian representative to the United Nations is currently briefing the security Council let's listen two days ago and acted accordingly it would have saved hundreds of lives maybe for some saving hundreds of Palestinian lives is not such an important objective to pursue but are you sure that Palestinian lives are the only ones you would be saving if you act we told this councils months ago act to save lives all lives you did not hear us then don't make the same mistake now Mr President people are being killed as we speak a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportion is unfolding in Gaza live on TV screens and we heard what Mr Griffith said a political disaster is underway and yet the security Council of the United Nations is unable to say the only thing that truly matters stop the Bloodshed I repeat stop the Bloodshed for those who think they can avert a humanitarian catastrophe and a regional spell over while Israel continu continues bombing and killing Palestinians think again the region is united in telling you it is not possible listen to them the only way to prevent both is to stop this criminal aggression against our people Mr President there is no speech no legal conation no political cover that can clear Israel of its responsibility for the Palestinian civilians it is killing for 75 years now Israel has explained brazenly Justified how it had to dispossess us how it had to occupy our land how it had to kill our people all in full impunity killing more Palestinians will never never make Israel more secure 75 years of experience should have been proof enough for those who want to learn there is no logic in this world no moral in this world and no law in this world that can justify the killing of a people innocent children women and men as a pretext to make another secure another one secure the whole world is watching they're watching us the events of the last 10 days May shape the next 10 years in our region and Beyond what happens next is decisive if anyone thinks this is a situation under control for which you can plan and Implement they are making false and irresponsible assumptions this is the kind of War where you know how it starts and have no clue How It Ends until now it can be stopped and it should be stopped immediately any further delay is a r risk no one should take the council should have met today to heed the call of the Secretary General of religious leaders around the world including the pope of the Arab states of the Muslim countries of of the global south of the overwhelming number of states around the world of billions of people including the millions who marched in your streets stop the Bloodshed stop it now stop the Bloodshed stop it now listen to them but it has not heeded these calls it has not upheld international law unequivocally equally and respons responsibly and in the next few hours more Palestinians will be killed tensions in the region will rise to new dangerous levels anger and resentment will explode each one of us will be asked what we did when all of this was happening all will be asked what they did to prevent what will happen next the council's failure to shoulder its responsibilities after 10 days of Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people and after the killing of hundreds of people gathered in a hospital to find shelter and Care will Mark public opinions in our region and the world for a very long time and affect belief in the protections of the law for all people as well as their perceptions and reactions this was not a moment to Foster more Despair and more impunity this was not a moment to make the same mistakes that got us there here in the first place finally Israel does not deny that it killed entire families infants children their parents uncles and aunts and cousins their grandparents with sometimes up to 45 members of the same family being slaughtered it has done so repeatedly through the years and is doing it again this time in the Gaza Strip it has now killed 3,500 Palestinians almost all civilians including more than 1,000 children it admitted it was was killing all of them but urged it could not do otherwise their deaths were not its fault even though it killed them but the hospital Massacre had such an impact on global public opinion that it had to change tactics and change its original story into a new one so Israel will deny responsibility for the massacre in the Baptist hospital alahi just as it made every effort to deny its responsibility in the killing of Shireen abak and and Mahmud Muhammad dur and in the many massacres it had perpetrated over the decades despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary it will blame the Palestinians for their own death and as it has always done and it will attempt to PR to present evidence to that effect to this Council remember the last time somebody presented evidence in this chamber to justify War do you remember that somebody came with technological uh uh devices and pictures and what have you to convince you of evidence remember the last time somebody presented evidence in this chamber to justify War I am sure the council the media and the world will not be fooled by such theater again these are serious times they require serious and responsible leadership one this Council has failed to provide some members here are losing an opportunity to change our region for the better whatever their calculations they are wrong may they change course before it is too late reality on the ground will overtake any plans you may have shaping it or enduring it is a decision that needs to be made now thank you Mr President I thank the permanent Observer of the Observer state of Palestine for his statement I now give the floor to the representative of [Music] Israel thank you Mr President distinguished council members what is going on going on on here I'm truly shocked I'm horrified I truly don't understand what is going on on here the most barbaric and widescale terror attack in decades bigger than 911 was perpetrated 11 days ago and it seems like this Council has already forgotten the pictures and footage from the October 7th pogram are seared into my brain in every israeli's brain forever but it seems that I must remind some of you of what happened thousands of barbaric Hamas Nazis invaded Israel and brutally murdered 1,400 innocent Israelis as they slept celebrated hugged their families in fear and cried for Mercy some were raped other beheaded and some were burned alive while bound and gagged many were children and hundreds were young people at a music festival there were many paramedics talking about Medical Teams there were many par paramedics who were murdered on their way to treat the wounded mothers who watched as their babies were slaughtered and elderly Holocaust Survivors who endured the Nazis only to be executed in their own living room this was planned and carried out deliberately deliberately by the terrorists that rule Gaza today as we speak not by accident not by mistake but deliberately 200 Innocents were violently taken hostage many of which are Nationals of your own countries I read hamas's Charter aloud to you just two days ago hamas's word were not empty threats hamas's Charter is their action plan their goal is the annihilation of Israel and if Hamas has the opportunity to commit these atrocities again they will and you know it although there are some here that choose not to designate Hamas as a terror Organization for political reasons it still doesn't change the facts Hamas deliberately deliberately targets civilians and massacres children when given the chance this makes Hamas a terror Organization no different than Isis they do not believe in dialogue they don't want a dialogue not in political solutions they only believe in Exterminating Jews and annihilating the Jewish State and nothing can change their genocidal ideology they don't even recognize the existence of international law to all those who are talking about two-state solution and international law there is only one solution solution to curing a Cancer and it is the evisceration of every cancerous cell just as was done with Isis and Al-Qaeda complete obliteration this is the only way to ensure such atrocities will never be repeated nevertheless look at what is going on here 11 days after Isis like Hamas terrorists attempted to carry out another Jewish genocide this Council is not even focused on their heinous crimes up until today you have not even done the most basic thing you have not condemned as a councel hamas's brutal terror attack it is really unfathomable you cannot unite even on that basic thing you are not focused on what needs to be done to free Gaza from Kamas and ensure that the oppression of the Gaz people by their T by their tyrants ends instead the council is fixated only on humanitarian corridors and Aid these are important and Noble causes but they are certainly not a solution to prevent hamas's NE next atrocious Massacre how is it possible that you are only dealing with resolutions like the one that was voted upon today it's tragic to say but this council is playing the exact role that Hamas was written for it in their script of death and Terror and I will explain Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza 18 years ago Hamas was then elected elected by the people of Gaza I hear a lot that they do not represent them elected and after murdering the Palestinian Authority officials by throwing them off rooftops Hamas proceeded to convert every inch of the Gaza strep to a war machine where was the council then where was the council when Hamas exploited the billions of dollars in international Aid to embed Terror infrastructure within and Below densely populated residential areas where were you where was the UN the UN knew all of this but it remained silent Kamas then spent the following seven contins terrorizing Israel by firing tens of thousands of rockets indiscriminately at Israeli towns and cities while hiding behind their own civilians where has the council been as we speak right now Sirens are wailing millions in Israel are running to find shelters Hamas does this so that once Israel strikes back back they can parade the bodies of the civilians in Gaza that they hid behind their strategy is to exploit their civilian casualties as propaganda to Leverage The International Community to tie Israel's hands their goal is to increase civilian casualties in Gaza this is part of their script they know that they cannot beat Israel on the battlefield of course they know it so they want to terrorize our citizens deliberately only citizens and then weaponize the UN to prevent Israel from obliterating them so they can rebuild rearm and continue terrorizing Israelis they have a lot of patience while working towards annihilating Israel a lot of patience this is hamas's script this is their playbook and shockingly even after the recent Slaughter it's still working for them do you not understand that just by holding this session with its focus the council is showing Hamas that they can fool everyone again and again and again I reiterate so far this Council has not even condemned Hamas for the atrocity it perpetrated let alone held Hamas fully responsible for the situation in Gaza but here we are discussing humanitarian corridors does nobody else see how ludicrous this is calling for calm restraint and ceasefires is like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound such steps will not eradicate the cancer that is Hamas humanitarian corridors will not prevent the next atrocity the only thing that will is the utter obliteration of this satanic entity what are you doing to prevent this evil perhaps if for once for once the council condemned Hamas the people of Gaza would begin to comprehend the absolute destruction their leaders have brought upon them perhaps they would stand up to these barbaric Savages yet every time the International Community pressures Israel and attempts to tie our hands it only serves to embolden these genocidal terrorists increases their popularity and ensure that this evil lives to see another day distinguished council members perhaps the most fundamental part of this issue is that some have still not internalized what Kamas truly is this emergency session and the resolution voted upon were triggered we all know it by the propaganda of savage jihadists let that sink in claim names made by baby killing terrorists were accepted here and repeated today by the way at face value without a second thought and this is what triggered this session every piece of information that comes out of Gaza cannot be trusted Hamas runs Gaza Hamas runs all gazan institutions so whatever comes out of the strip is not the truth it is what Hamas wants you to hear sadly transparency and the truth are not Central values for genocidal terrorists in August 20122 Sarah masroof the former head of office for Ocha in Gaza tweeted a condemnation of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad for their in indiscriminate rocket fire at Israeli civilians August 2022 you can check almost immediately miss muscroft the head of Ocha was removed from her post and deleted her tweet this made Israel very upset obviously so I asked her boss I hope he's still with us under Secretary General Griffith why the UN would remove an official from their post for condemning acts of Terror that deserve un condemnation do you know what he told me he said that Miss muscroft was transferred because according to un information and assessment there was danger to her life danger to her life if a un official received death threats for telling the truth about the terrorists try to imagine how any gzen feels about telling the truth not only are official gazan sources absolutely unreliable as they are terrorists they would also be immediately murdered if they say something that Kamas doesn't like so distinguished council member I have to ask you a question what does this say about whoever decid decides to believe the claims of a terror organization without any factchecking the Ali hospital was hit by and only by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket what happened yesterday including the tragic the tragic loss of life of civilians was the sole fault of Hamas Israel has lots of footage and even audio recording from Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists to prove this Beyond a fraction of a doubt nevertheless the Secretary General and numerous un officials immediately accepted the claims of baby killing terrorists what a disgrace and today some of you repeated these lies how can the Secretary General forget that he has the obligation to verify the fact before issuing a condemnation I guess it's easy when it comes to Israel mere months ago the Secretary General himself signed off on a report detailing how the misfired Rockets of Gaz and terorists terrorists G killed and maimed gazen dozens of gazen children and medical personnel we demand an apology an apology the UN and some of on this Council rush to adopt the lies of Isis likee terrorists and refus to accept the hard evidence of a law-abiding democracy you should apologize apologize for never convening the council when M Rockets are fired deliberately deliberately at Israeli Hospital hospitals barai Hospital in Ashkelon was directed was directly hit by a Hamas Rockets just last week where was the council apologize for years of putting your heads in the ground while Hamas ceaselessly build up its War Machine in Gaza distinguished council members stop following Kamas script stop playing by hamas's rules the time has come for this Council to hold Hamas fully and solely accountable for the war crimes committed this Council should be purely focused on condemning the Hamas terrorists supporting Israel's right to defend itself and demanding from Hamas to immediately and unconditionally return our hostages Israel's Rescue Mission can end very quickly if Kamas terrorists turns themselves in and release all of the hostages but this Rescue Mission will not end until Israel ures ensures that Kamas atrocities can never be repeated again and there is no way to ensure this this other than the obliteration of hamas's capabilities thank you Mr President I thank the representative of Israel for their statement before giving the floor to the next uh speaker I would like to uh say the following to ensure that all speakers enjoy the same sizable audience I strongly recommend that statements do not exceed five minutes if possible I now give the floor to the Jordan presid I make this statement on behalf of the Arab group against the backdrop of the tragic events in Gaza H where we La the fair voice of the International Community and any active and effective International action to protect the Palestinian people in Gaza the Arab group condemned in the strongest words the the heinous Massacre by the IDF the criminal idfm yesterday against the innocent civilians who were receiving care in AI Baptist Hospital inas the Arab group holds Israel the occupying power the sole responsibility for this heinous War crime that we cannot remain silent about it we call on the security Council to take immediate action for immediate ceasefire and the Israeli aggression on Gaza we call to ensure that humanitarian and Medical Aid enters this trip and provide the protection to medical staff and relief staff and medical education and un facilities and we also call for preventing the forceable displacement of the people of Gaza Mr President the heinous crimes of the occupation are contravening with rules of international law in particular Geneva fourth convention in relation to the protection of civilians during armed conflicts that's in addition to the provisions of the UN Charter and international legitimacy we recall your the security Council resolution 2286 that provides that those working in the medical field and health care should not be targeted and it condemns all attacks against the medical staff and calls for providing the adequate protection Mr President the Arab group calls for holding Israel accountable Israel the occupying power for the massacres and crimes it continues to commit against the defenseless Palestinian people the targeting by Israel of the Baptist a hospital is not coming out of vacuum as we mentioned before the pronouncements from the Israeli offics was clear it indicated that Israel will not protect it will not respect the humanitarian and moral values which sees that hospitals should be evicted that triggered the response from the wh and different un entities they confirmed that the forced eviction and targeting of medical facilities and staff are severe violations to International material law in relation to what was said by Martin Griffith a short while ago a warning has been issued by Israeli authorities to 20 Medical institutions including the Baptist Hospital that is shortly before the attack on the hospital in this connection we stress that the heinous crimes against the people of Gaza are crimes against the humanity of all of us condemned this attack is a humanitarian call Purely humanitarian call that makes it incumbent upon us to unify to put an end to this war and to provide the necessary International protection to the Palestinian people immediately the Arab group warns that this war against the innocent civilians has entered a serious phase that will take the region to a disaster the International Community and the security Council should assume its responsibility in maintaining International Peace and security by putting an end to the blood shed and the killing of children women and elderly we stress that we will be The Advocates Advocate Defenders of the rights of Palestinians and their Just Cause And we stress that the reason behind the conflict is this occupation if we want peace and security the Palestinian cause should be resolved with the establishment of the independent Palestinian State along the borders of June 1967 with its Jerusalem as its capital and according to International resolutions and the arabes initiatives in conclusion we express our heartfelt condolences to the families of the murders and we call God to have mercy on them and to Grant recovery to those who are wounded and injured thank you Mr Jordan for their statement and I now call give the floor to the Egypt thank you president I should like to congratulate you upon assuming the presidency of the security Council I'd like to thank Martin I'd like to thank toland thank you for your briefings furthermore thank you the UAE and the Russian Federation which asked for this emergency session of the council to be convened in light of the Israeli bombing of the Baptist hospital alak hospital in the Gaza Strip This was part and parcel of an attempt to uproot the Palestinian people forcing it to leave its territory this crime committed on the 17th of October is a new chapter in a long series of violations which did not begin on the 8th of October they began much earlier than that they began when the occupation began this requires the International Community to put an end to its current policy and begin to hold to account uh an illegal political session everyone who commissioned participated called for and ordered these crimes the crimes committed yesterday included the events underway in Palestine call on us to shoulder our responsibility and we're all well aware that are friends Brazil will be able to shoulder its responsibility and uh fulfill these duties as part of their presidential duties and this is necessary because what's going on it poses an imaginable risks to the region and to International Peace and security these risks cannot be rolled out therefore we against and took action to avoid these risks on numerous occasions the occupation cannot go on these crimes cannot be overlooked inal measures taken specifically the broadening and extending of the illegitimate illegal settlements the crimes being committed the desecration of holy sight it's the political deadlock owing to Israel's edance the condescending fashion with which Israel treats law all of this is fuel to the fire we must ensure that no one uses what we've just said is as a pretext they shouldn't recycle narratives accusing us of terrorism we'd like to therefore reiterate speaking before you speaking before this August assembly speaking before the world a categorical rejection and direct condemnation of all acts which involve taking of Civilian hostages this is a position which we expressed we did this clearly and all Arab states have in fact expressed their position very clearly at the ministerial meeting of the Council of the leag of States earlier this year Mr President we condemned civilians being targeted we've condemned this and we also have condemned the double standards we've seen we condemn civilians being targeted our brothers in occupied Palestine being targeted we'd like to reiterate our condemnation and staer rejection of all crimes being committed by Israel against the Palestinian people the latest such crime is uh the targeting of Al Baptist hospital yesterday we'd like to reaffirm our rejection of Israel's attempts to evade responsibility and attempts taken by certain International parties to cover for Israel by providing false false excuses and this is what resulted in the impossible situation we have on our hands in Palestinian territory in the Gaza Strip we see civilians being bombarded in their homes in hospitals because of the ongoing refusal of refusal to adopt initiatives get towards uh ensuring calm and political initiatives as well unless the International Community shoulders its share of responsibility in full unless this August Council shoulders its full share of responsibility this explosive situation we won't have Clear Vision of the procedure that's required and we do have a Clear Vision we need an immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and we are surprised this is the ordinary procedure which applies in all armed conflicts nevertheless we don't see the same level of commitment gear towards achieving this in Gaza despite the risk of the conflict spilling over there are some states which have not done their atmost to achieve a ceasefire but we must say that they are they will not SP these risks this might fuel the Flames of conflict second we need to guarantee the protection of civilians we need to furnish humanitarian assistance to civilians we were equally taken back to see that this principle which is one of the most fundamental principles of humanity the fact that we're debating this principle the fact that it is controversial when the protection of civilians in armed conflict is one of the pillars of international law it is in fact one of the pillars of humanity we must therefore immediately CE targeting medical institutions which is something that's been condemned by various un Security Council resolutions such as resolution 2286 which condemns all violence and acts committed against hospitals and other medical facilities we also need to immediately with withdraw abolish the evacuation order that's what Israel calls it this is one of the most abominable abominable instances of fored to transfer our populations in the modern area this is acious justification which Israel claims to be a means of protecting civilians third we must put an end to hate speech to justification of crimes committed against the Palestinian people to their demonization animals this is a term that was used by an official of a country which claims to be Democratic this description these words were not commented on by other states which continuously talk about the principles of humanity this kind of speech poisons our minds and fuels conflict fourth we need to do our utmost deploy all efforts to free detainees hostages and ensure they're treated in keeping with international law and the principle of humanity Mr chairman Egypt ever since uh the the latest conflict began has been working as part of its historic role to help the Palestinian people and restore peace we're working with this vision in mind we want to establish a ceasefire by taking measures to uphold and guarantee humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip and to mobilize sufficient uh Aid Egypt also called for the convening of an emergency humanitarian Summit in KIRO on the 21st of October with the participation of all International part and Regional parties affected by the crisis under these very pressing circumstances given the risk of escalation in order to overcome this crisis and somehow pave the way for a lasting comprehensive and fair solution We Stand convinced that simply managing the crisis containing circumscribing the aspirations of the Palestinian people is an approach which uh should be consigned to history Mr President Egypt Egypt people people all over the world have their eyes on you the eyes of the world are on you on the security Council so that the security Council shoulders its responsibility put us an end to this war which was waged by Israel against Palestinian territories and against and innocent unarmed people and all the people want is to enjoy its fundamental rights to freedom and to live in dignity in an independent state like all other peoples of the world thank you Mr President well you've been listening there to an emergency session of the UN Security Council on the Israel Gaza War we just heard there from Jordan and Egypt calling for an immediate ceasefire protection for civilians a halt to Israeli aggression in Gaza and Urgent access for humanitarian Aid Egypt also rejecting Israel's claims about the Alat Hospital blast while the Israeli ambassador to the UN gillad erdan has criticized the security Council saying it's fixated on humanitarian corridors and aid but says while they're important there and I quote here not a solution to prevent hamas's next atrocious Massacre he's reiterated that that blast at the Ally Hospital which killed nearly 500 people was the result of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket he says that Israel has the evidence to prove it the Palestinian representative to the UN Riad Manor called repeatedly for the council to stop the Bloodshed he said says the events of the last 10 days will shape the next 10 years he says this war can be stopped now but that it requires strong sensible leadership let's speak to our correspondent Kristen salumi she's been following the discussion for us at un headquarters in New York Christen we saw the US veto a resolution in the security Council today and now divisions are clearly being laid bare yeah we had two things happening in the security Council today one uh resolution was put forward calling for humanitarian pauses that was vetoed by the United States and now what we've been seeing play out is an emergency meeting that was called by Russia and the United Arab Emirates uh on the situation in Gaza in response to the bombing of the alahi uh Hospital there uh and in that briefing we got updates from the un's Middle East coordinator and the humanitarian Chief Martin Griffith about the situation in Gaza and they both say that um a humanitarian ceasefire is needed the Secretary General himself has now said it as well a humanitarian ceasefire is needed to get Aid into innocent civilians in Gaza um given that the situation gets more and more dire and Tor venison the Middle East coordinator warn that the conflict has the danger of expanding Beyond Israel Palestine now into the broader region uh of the of the Middle East uh because tensions are so awful over the situation there um but many of the countries have also been talking about the security council's failure to act in light of what's been happening and many see it as uh a slight on the security Council a discrediting of the security Council given that it's primary responsibility is maintenance of peace and security the fact that the council could not come together in one way or another on this issue and make some sort of statement uh many have decried going forward Kristen salumi there with the latest for us from the United Nations thank you Kristen let's now bring in Maran bashara he's alaz senior political analyst he joins us from London Maran no surprises from the rhetoric we've been hearing today but I've been curious what do you make of the competing claims that we keep hearing around the alaki blast well of course you know I'm no um expert let's say on that but from the various allegations I've seen especially from the way the Israelis have uh you know kept advancing argument and retracting those arguments and uh I'm just hearing now the Israeli Ambassador Eran saying we have the proof I'm reminded by how Israel Advanced the proof from 2022 about what happened in uh on October uh 2023 and then they had to take it back and they've been actually various Israelis officials and non-officials they've been walking back a lot of their allegations they seem to be a bit confused on how to um you know justify or defend themselves and accuse islami of having you know been the reason uh for the for the suffering at the hospital and clearly from some of the media as well including some of the they call them sister channels there's been a lot of skepticism about the fact that uh one of those sort of stray Rockets from Hamas wouldn't do the damage that we've seen at the hospital usually these Rockets you know could do I don't know a dent in a building or something or or hit a car but the damage in the hospital and the way the damage and I don't want to repeat the details from our correspondents at the scene that they have seen only limbs they couldn't even see you know whole bodies that is not something that's uh caused by a stray rocket that's more of something that's uh you know the the result of serious bombing Israel time M it's clearly raised tensions at the security Council we just heard Kristen there talking about how it's being criticized for for its failure to act we've seen now two resolutions two draft resolutions one from Russia one from Brazil both of them have failed what's the next step now for the security Council well you know the security Council hasn't been very effective since the polarization on the international scene right and I think clearly the Russians and Americans are not exactly going to agree on the same thing they they kept you know they keep scoring points they don't want to make any real point about anything uh you know that counts especially like in this case they keep scoring points against each other and clearly the Americans are not even in the mood to hear anything of a compromise like the one presented by the Brazilians uh under the pretext that there was no uh you know clause about Israel's right to defend itself I just and I need to you know just take a point with that once again I I don't think anyone's questioning Israel's right to defense its people the question is you know could could it continue with 55 years of occupation and and defend that could it use continue with a system of arid and and and defend that could it do 17 years of Siege and defend that I think the question of you know self-defense has really mutated into self deceit where the Israelis you know are quite delusional about what they can and cannot do and I think that was reflective a bit what we've heard from the Israeli Ambassador this verbal diarrhea I mean I don't know you know it's like anger hit the fan and he just shot right left and center the satanic entity I think did he just call the security Council satanic entity I think he did and did he just refer to uh the Hamas fight as Hamas Nazis I mean seriously uh it's just this this this this this sort of language this sort of rhetoric and you know certainly you know they said truth is the first victim of War but clearly language is also a victim of war the Israeli Ambassador feels that he his country should not be held accountable it shouldn't be questioned there should be no resolutions passed there should be no discussion at an international Forum because Israel is above all others and it has rights above all other rights and its people are of a greater God apparently than the Palestinians who are of a Lesser God or something like that I mean the idea that the Israeli Ambassador just so upset after the death uh of of thousands or the casualties and the 10s of thousands that his country shouldn't be held accountable that it shouldn't be even questioned at a forum like the UN Security Council and last but not least if I may quickly I think it was interesting to hear from the Arab ambassadors AB khik of Egypt and of course the Jordanian Ambassador the way now they frame the way they frame their argument is very clear for a change Israel is responsible for the bombing in Gaza and it's responsible for the deaths at the hospital and Ali in Gaza Maran bashara the alaz senior political analyst reflecting on what we've been hearing from that emergency session of the UN Security Council thank you very much for sharing your thoughts Maran
