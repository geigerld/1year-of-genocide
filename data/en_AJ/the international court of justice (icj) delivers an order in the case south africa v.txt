2024 in the case concerning application of the convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip South Africa versus Israel for reasons made known to me judges Abraham Shue and iwasawa who duly participated in the debation and the final vote are not in a position to take their seat on the bench today judge ad hok Barak who also duly participated and the deliberations and the final vote is unable to join us today for family reasons I recall that on December 29 2023 South Africa filed in the registry of the Court an application instituting proceedings against Israel concerning alleged violations in the Gaza Strip of obligations under the convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide to which I shall refer as the genocide convention the application of South Africa contained a request for the indication of provisional measures after hearing thearters the court indicated certain provisional measures by an order issued on January 26 2024 by a letter dated February 12th 2024 South Africa referring to I quote the developing circumstan in Rafa end of quote called upon the court urgently to exercise its power under article 75 paragraph 1 of the rules of Court the registar informed the parties of cour decision in respon to that communication by letter on 16 February 2024 on March 6th 2024 South Africa requested the court I quote to indicate further provisional measures and or to modify its provisional measures indicated on January 26 24 by an order of March 28th 2024 the court reaffirmed the provisional measures indicated in order of January 26 2024 and indicated certain additional Pro provisional measures on May 10 2024 South Africa submitted to the court what it described as an urgent request for the modification and indication of provisional measures pursuant to article 41 of the statute and articles 75 and 76 of the rules of court in accordance with usual practice I shall not read the introduction paragraphs of the althor which set out the procedural history of the case I shall also omit or summarize some other paragraphs I shall therefore Begin by reading the order at paragraph 20 the court Begins by noting that in its View South Africa's present request is a request for the mod modification of the order of March 28 2024 for this reason the court must determine whether the conditions set forth in article 76 paragraph 1 of the rules of Court have been fulfilled that paragraph reads as follow I quote at the request of a party or prop otu the court May at any time before the final judgment in the case revoke or modify any decision concerning provisional measures if in its opinion some change in the situation justifies such such revocation or modification end of Court the court must first ascertain whether taking into account the information that the parties have provided with respect to the current situation there is reason to conclude that the situation that warranted the decision set out in its order of March 2 8 2024 has changed since that time that time if the court find that there was a change in the situation since the delivery of its earlier order it will then have to consider whether such a change justifies a modification of its earlier decision concerning provisional measures any such modification would be appropriate only if the general conditions leted down in article 41 of the statute of the Court were also met in this instance the court thus Begins by determining whether there has been a change in the situation that warranted the decision set out in its order of March 28 2024 the court recalls that its order of 2024 it noted that the military operation conducted by Israel following the attack of October 7 2023 had resulted in I quote a large number of deaths and injuries as well as the massive destruction of homes the forceable displacement of the vast majority of the population and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure end of quote in its decision communicate to the parties by letters of 16 February 2024 the court noted quoting the United Nations Secretary General that the developments in the Gaza Strip and Rafa in particular I quote would exponentially increase what was already a humanitarian nightmare with Untold Regional consequences end of quote the court further recalls that in its order of March 28 2024 it observed with regret that the catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had deteriorated further since January 2024 especially in view of the prolonged and widespread deprivation of food and other basic necessities to where the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had been subjected in the present order the court notes that the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip which as stated in its order of 2024 was a serious risk of deteriorating has deteriorated and has done so even further since the court adopted its 2024 in this regard the court observes that the concern that it expressed in its decision communicate with the departs on February 16 2024 with respect to the developments in Rafa have materialized and that the humanitarian situation is now to be characterized as disastrous after weeks of intensification of military bombardments of Rafa were more than million Palestinians had fled as a result of Israeli evacuation orders covering more than 34s of gaza's entire territory on May 6 2024 nearly 100,000 Palestinians were ordered by Israel to evacuate the Eastern portion of Rafa and relocate to Al maasi and kanun areas ahead of a planned military offensive the military ground offensive in Rafa which Israel started on May 7 2024 is still ongoing and has led to new evacuation orders as a result according to United Nations reports nearly 800,000 people have been displaced from Rafa as at May 18 2024 the court considered that the aforementioned developments which are exceptionally grave in particular the military offensive in Rafa and resulting repeated large scale displacement of already extremely vulnerable Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip constitute a change in the situation within the meaning of article 76 of the rules of court the court is also of the view that provisional measures indicated in its 2024 as well as those reaffirmed therein do not fully address the consequences arising from the change in the situation previously explained thus justifying the modification of these measures however in order to modify its measures the court must still satisfy itself that the general conditions let down in article 41 of the statute of the Court are met in the current circum situation the court next turns to the conditions for the indication of measures it records that in its orders of January 26 2024 and March 28th 2024 it concluded that Prima fashi it had jurisdiction pursuant to article 9 of the genocide convention to entertain the case the court sees no reason to revisit that conclusion for the purposes of deciding on the present request in the order of January 26 2024 the court also found that at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa under the jasad convention and for which it was seeking protection were plausible namely the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts mentioned in article 3 and the right of South Africa to seek Israel's compliance with the latter's obligation under the convention the court saw no reason to revisit this conclusion in its order of March 28 2024 the court likewise sees no reason to do so for the purposes of deciding on the present request it further considers that by their very nature at least some of the provisional measures sought pursuant to the present re Quest are aimed at preserving the rights claimed by the applicant that the court has found to be plausible the court must next consider whether the current situation entails a risk of irreparable prejudice to the plausible rights claimed by South Africa and whether there is urgency the court recalls in this regard that it has previously included that in view of the fundamental values so to be protected by the genocide convention the plausible rights in question in these proceedings are of such a nature that prejudices to them is capable of causing irreparable harm the court recalls that on May 7 2024 Israel began a military offensive in Rafa following weeks of intensified bombardment and that as a result approximately 800,000 Palestinians were displaced from Rafa as at May 18 2024 the court notes that senior United Nations officials have consistently underscored the immense risks associated with the military offensive in Rafa for for instance on May 3 2024 the spokesperson of the office for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs warned that an assault on rafah would put I quote hundreds of thousands of people at imminent risk of death end of quot and would severely impact the humanitarian operation in entire Gaza Strip which is run primarily out of Rafa on May 6 2024 the United Nations children fund indicated that about half of the approximately 1.2 million Palestinians Sheltering in Rafa were children and warned that military operations therein would result in I quote the few remaining basic services and infrastructure they need to survive being totally destroyed end of quote the United Nations sources indicate that the aforementioned risks have started to materialize and will intensify even further if the operation continues for instance on May 8th 2024 the director general of the World Health Organization stated the alar hospital one of the last remaining medical facilities in the Rafa governor was no longer functional due to the ongoing hostilities in its vicinity on May 17 2024 the world food program warned that it had been able to access its warehous in Rafa for over it hadn't been able to access its warh houses in Rafa for over a week and observed that I quote the incursion into Rafa is a significant set back to recent mod modest progress on access and of quot on the basis of information before it the court is not convinced that the evacuation efforts and related measures that Israel affirms to have undertaken to enhance the security of civilians in the gasa strip and in particular those recently displaced from the governor are sufficient to alleviate the immense risk to which the Palestinian population is exposed as a result of the military offensive in Rafa the court observed for instance that according to a statement by the commissioner General of the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East Mr Philip lazarini on May 18 2024 I quote the areas that peoples are fleeing to now do not have Safe Water Supplies or sanitation facilities al- maasi as one example is a Sandy 14 Square kilm agricultur land where people are left out in the open with little to no buildings or roads it lacks the minimal conditions to provide emergency humanitarian assistance in a safe and dignified manner end of Court the court observed that Israel has not provided sufficient information concerning the safety of the population during the evacuation process or the availability in al- maasi area of the necessary amount of Water Sanitation food medicine and shelter for the 800,000 Palestinians that have evacuated thus far consequently the court is of view that Israel has not sufficiently addressed and dispelled the concerns raised by its military offensive in Rafa in light of the consideration set out in the preceding sections of the order and taking account of the orders of January 26 2024 and March 28 2024 the court finds that the current situation arising from Israel's military offensive in Rafa entails a further risk of irreparable prejudice to the and that there is urgency in the sense that there exists a real and imminent risk that such Prejudice will be caused before the Court gives its final decision the court concludes on the basis of the aforementioned considerations that the circumstances of the case required to modify its decision set out in its order of March 28 2024 the court recalls that in accordance with article 75 paragraph 2 of its rules when a request for the indication of provision measures has been made it has the power under its statute to indicate measures that are not in whole or in part other than those requested in the present case having considered the terms of the provisional measures requested by South Africa and the circumstances of the case the court found that the measures to be indicated need not be identical to those requested the court consider that in Conformity with obligations under the genocide convention is Israel must immediately hold its military offens and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part the court recalls that it that in its order of January 26 2024 it ordered Israel inter area to I quote take effective measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence related to allegations of Acts within the scope of Article 2 and article 3 of the genocide convention end of quote in the present circumstances the court is also of the view that in order to preserve evidence related to allegations of Acts falling within the scope of Article 2 and article three of the genocide convention Israel must take effective measures to ensure the unimpeded access to the Gaza Strip of any Commission of inquiry fact finding Mission or other investigative body mandated by competent organs of the United Nations to investigate allegations of genocide the court also considers that the catastrophic situation in Gaza confirmed the need for the immediate and effective implementation of the measures indicated in its orders 2024 which are applicable throughout the Gaza Strip including in Rafa in these circumstances the court finds it necessary to reaffirm the measures indicated in those orders in so doing the Court wishes to emphasize that the measure indicated in paragraph 512a of its order of March 28 2024 requiring I quote the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance and of course necess states that the respondent maintain open land Crossing points and in particular the Rafa Crossing in view of the specific provisional measures it has decided to indicate the court considered that Israel must submit a report to the court on all measures taken to give effect to this order within one month from the date of this order the report so provided will then be communicated to South Africa which shall be given the opportunity to submit to the court its commands thereon the court recalls that its orders on provisional measures under article 41 of the statute have binding effect and thus create International legal obligations for any party to whom the provisional measures are addressed the court underlined that the present order is without prejudice to any findings concerning the respondent's compliance with the orders of January 26 2024 and March 28 2024 in its orders of January 26 2024 and March 28th 2024 the court expressed its grave concern over the fate of the hostages abducted during the attacks in Israel on October 7 2023 and hence since then by Hamas and other armed group and called for their immediate and unconditional release the court finds it deeply troubling that many of these hostages remain in captivity and reiterate its SC for their immediate and unconditional release I shall Now read out the operative part of the order for these reasons the court by 13 vots to two reaffirms the provisional measures indicated in its orders of 26th January 2024 and March 28th 2024 which should be
