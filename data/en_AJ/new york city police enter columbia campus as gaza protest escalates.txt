[Music] hello I'm Elizabeth panum in Doha with the top stories on Al jaaz and we begin with some breaking news out of New York where police have entered Colombia University and begun to arrest students occupying a historic Hall after they barricaded themselves inside earlier the university said it's begun suspending students refusing to meet a deadline to abandon their encampment let's bring in our correspondent to a is live for us outside Columbia University in New York and today said there was an expectation earlier that police would come to Colombia what's happening there now well I'm right in front of Columbia University right in front of Hamilton Hall there's dozens and dozens of police officers that have come here to remove the students that are currently inside Hamilton Hall let's not forget what happened here on Monday evening a group of students that inside Columbia University occupied Hamilton Hall they renamed it as hindra who's a six-year-old girl who was killed in Gaza they're there right now if you can see where I am you can see the police they came in with a truck now there's a stair they have broken a window they're going inside the building probably to detain the students that are inside this building there's been lots of tension in the last hour we've been seeing police coming from different sides of the are right now there's dozens of students who are also here they've been protesting all day they've been coming here to support their other students who are inside of Colombia University the those inside Columbia University they've been saying all day that they are under siege because since very early in the morning this university has been completely isolated uh students inside have been asking for food and water among other things and the students that are side have been bringing it in but as you can see right now the police officers are moving into the building one by one it's not clear yet how they're going to carry out this operation but we have already seen at least seven or eight students that were outside and close to the gate inside Columbia University being detained and it's very very likely that something like this will happen again Columbia University has been threatening the students that are inside for with expulsion that's the we saying if they did not leave the building on Monday evening there was already a deadline that those that remain inside in the encampment in this sitting that is happening inside in the middle of the campus they had given these students until 2: p.m. local time on Monday for them to leave and if not they were going to face suspension so now they're not only facing suspension expulsion but also arrest because of the police officers that were seeing rout outside where I am right now yeah incredibly tense scenes there at Columbia University as as you say TOA we can see those police officers moving in forcing themselves in through the window of Hamilton Hall Tesa do we have an idea of the number of students who are inside that Hall it's not clear how many have remained in inside we do know we asked that to one of the students earlier today and they were not sure because what happened is that on Monday there were hundreds of students inside but those who remained in in in inside columia Columbia University many of them left and went to their homes or to their dorms outside of the main campus we're let me so it's not clear yet how many are inside but there are many others who are outside showing their support for the University students you can see them right here where we are right now they're saying shame on Colombia University let's not forget what many of the students have been demanding they have been demanding Financial transparency they want Colombia University to stop using the money the students pay every year for them to be able to study here from being invested in companies that they say are profiting from those War they're also demanding an amnesty for many of the students and faculty members let's not forget about them many of the faculty inside of Columbia University have been supporting and protecting the students so they want an amnesty uh from uh Colombia University authorities that they won't be disciplined as being uh risking expulsion or suspension uh among other things so we as the Press we not allowed to move from where we are we're right behind a fence we've been uh everyone that is crossing this fence has being threatened with arrest if you're on the streets and that's why we are remaining here but uh you you can see that there's hundreds of police officers not only where I am but completely surrounding this campus a campus that is between Broadway Avenue in uh New York City and Amsterdam Avenue and you can see right on the window of what is known as Hamilton Hall that the students have REM renamed as hint Hall that continue to go inside this building probably to remove the students by force and uh TOA as you are speaking there we we have seen live pictures of police taking away a few people now we don't know if these people have been taken from inside Hamilton Hall of they are indeed part of that group that's inside the hall uh but certainly police are once again taking protesters away and you know when we were speaking a couple of hours ago todaya we were talking about how it's not just students who are protesting at Colombia there has been a March through New York City a group of protesters who have been visiting different University campuses in New York and came to Colombia to show their support uh for the protesters there especially those who've barricaded themselves inside the hall well certainly we're we've been here all day and were a dozens of protesters peacefully demonstrating outside of Columbia University on the gate that you can see right in front of me they've been here all day showing their support for the students that remain inside and while they were protesting there not even on the streets but right cloo very very close to the gate another demonstration passed in front of us and they were going to other campuses in New York City uh apparently they went to City College and they tried to carry out a protest there they were not allowed to do that and let's not forget that earlier today we heard a press conference from the New York City Police Department where they were already warning students and warning the students parents for example to try to force their children from where they are right now because they were facing arrest the other thing that they were saying is that the protest inside the campus had been infiltrated by outside wrers not just by students and they said that this is something that increases the danger or that increased the danger of this ongoing situation here we cannot confirm that when you talk to students they say that they are the only ones carrying out the actions to shed light on what is happening in Gaza they want to shed light to the killing that is happening in Gaza they want to shed light to the displacement that is light on the hunger that is happening in Gaza so certainly as I said before there's been protests on the streets across uh New York City there's been other campuses where there are other protests on going for example downtown downtown of Manhattan uh New York University there's another group of students protesting there another went to a a college that about 2 kilomet from where we are but the pro biggest protest happen here mostly because this is the place that their biggest encampment has been going on where on April 17th and 18th over a 100 students were detained and taken from this University that was severely critic uh criticized of the actions taken by the president of Columbia University and because of calling law enforcement but certainly it's not clear how this operation is going on but certainly there's dozens and dozens of police officers right now there's other dozens of students who remain here and there's lots of tension where we are right now yeah today's an end since April 17th since those arrests at Colombia University I believe that something like at least 900 students have been arrested at universities around the United States Colombia is one if not the first US University which saw protests against Israel's war on Gaza and it really has inspired demonstrations around the country at universities around the country hasn't it certainly this is the University that in way inspired a movement throughout the country there's a long tradition in the United States from carrying out what they call Civil Disobedience protest Colombia University has been and back in the 1960s students did exactly the same thing that happened here on Monday evening they took over Hamilton Hall to protest the Vietnam War they were also arrested and that's what many believe that is going to happen tonight as the police is moving in into the building but what is happening here in Colombia is what inspired what is happening all around the country we've seen protest in California in Texas and so in many many other places across the country and the students here say that even though if they are arrested or if the people inside are arrested they will continue with this movement as I said before they want to make sure that the their voices are heard but at the same time they're saying that they're not the story that the story is in Gaza right now the story is with the Palestinian people in Gaza but also in the West Bank they have been demanding an end to occupation they have been demanding an end to genocide so certainly uh as people here are saying they will remain here it's not clear yet how long they'll be allowed to remain here we've already seen at least seven or eight students that have been detained they were not inside the building they were just peaceful protesters on the streets outside of the gates they were taken the by the police just a few minutes ago yeah Teresa we saw the pictures
