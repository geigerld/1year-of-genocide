Tommy just joining us on Alia we have we have been listening there to Island's leaders the Prime Minister the foreign minister as well uh announcing today that Ireland will recognize formerly recognize a Palestinian State on uh May the 28 uh we heard from the Irish Prime Minister first uh Simon Harris who said Peace is possible Justice is achievable and recognition of both a Palestinian State and an Israeli state is Cornerstone to which peace can be built uh Simon uh Harris uh announcing again that Ireland will recognize a Palestinian State just as Norway has done in the last hour and Spain is expected also to do or is doing now as uh or they have they have in fact the prime minister is speaking right now in Parliament in Madrid Spain also announcing that it will recognize a Palestinian State uh from the Irish we we heard the Prime Minister say that from Ireland's own history it knows what it means to aspire to statehood and having full rights Ireland he said uh believed in the fundamental rights of Palestinian people and this was also a way for Ireland to show its unequivocal support to the two-state solution well the reaction from Israel to these three countries Spain Ireland and Norway announcing that they will recognize uh Palestine well the reaction from Israel has been Swift and and very angry uh the foreign minister of Israel uh uh cat saying that uh in his words the Irish and Norwegian Folly does not deter us and we are determined to achieve our goals he says Israel will not remain silent in the face of those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security there will be serious consequences for the decision of Ireland and Norway uh the Israeli foreign minister has said and Israel has already announced that it's withdrawing its ambassadors from Norway and Ireland let's bring in Mustafa bargoti once again who's the Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative joining us from romala in the occupied West Bank Mustafa you were able to hear I believe what uh the Irish leaders had to say about their decision to to recognize uh Palestine today what what is your reaction to what you heard and also your reaction to the angry response from Israel well thank you first of all I think I would be speaking on behalf of all Palestinian people in uh welcoming this wonderful act by Ireland and Norway and I'm sure the Spanish step will follow very soon they have in fact Spain has now also recognized Palestine excellent so three countries hopefully Malta and Slovenia will follow so we are talking here about a true powerful political and symbolic significant step uh that means a lot in the direction of achieving freedom justice and just peace as was said uh but it is a very important step in determining uh the right of the Palestinian people our people for self-determination and also it is a blow up it blows away a lot of the de facto effects that Israel has created through settlement building on the ground uh confirming that Palestine today is a state under occupation and so any effect any efforts of the occupying power to change facts of the ground is meaningless and will not have an impact in the long run right but also this is this is a blow a second one to Netanyahu and his extreme government and to the fascist in his Government after they were indicted by Natan and Galant were indicted by the international criminal court H it means that the act of fascism and the the the extremism in the isi government has no future and the Israeli reaction of the of of refusing these recognitions and claiming that it affects isra security is of course something that will not convince anybody I think this is a historical moment and the big change Mr baruti let me ask you this I mean you say it's a historic moment a hugely symbolic moment but what does it change practically on the ground it uh it will it the main change is of course it could be perceived as symbolic but it's more than symbolic because uh in fact what we have seen since 1967 is Israel's effort to change the status of the West band Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem to make it Israeli they Annex East Jerusalem they are in the process of annexing the West Bank they reoccupied now Gaza as well as all of the West Bank so their goal is to Annex the occupied territories and make it part of Israel and consistently ethnically cleanse Palestinians from this land this plan is failing and the fact that now we are a state under occupation means that whatever Israel did or does now in the occupied territories will have no legal value and eventually will have to be reversed we we heard that is very important yeah we we heard the three countries say that this move they hope that this move will complement efforts towards the two-state solution uh and a secure lasting peace between Israel and Palestine but we talk about they talk about a two-state solution is that still something feasible today when you look at the reality on the ground I mean what impact is this move going to have on this peace process and and this two-state solution that we keep hearing about well look now the number of states that recognize Palestine is probably larger than the number of countries that recognize Israel that's very meaningful but on the other hand of course this will not become a reality unless Israel withdraws and takes away all its settlements from the occupied territories unless Israel itself accepts the right of the Palestinian people to to be free from occupation but the value of what's happening is that the rights of the Palestinian people cannot be cannot vanish and whatever Israel does it will not go away and of course the only two solutions that are possible are either two- State solution with where Israel would accept an independent Sovereign Palestinian state or one Democratic state with equal rights for everybody the problem is that this Israeli government and not only the government but also the Israeli opposition this establishment once a third solution which is ethnic cleansing of Palestinians which is exactly what they are doing now in Gaza and what they try to do in the West Bank there is no future for such a plan this is a I said it's a historical moment from the perspective of telling Israel that all these uh fascist and extreme plans have no future and they have to accept the Palestinian people as equal people but do you think this is likely to have a positive impact on the peace process uh sorry on what can the peace process do you think it will have a positive impact on it h here you have two factors that have to be uh changed the Israeli position of course which is very uh extreme and the American position which is covering up Israeli without a change from the side of the United States we will not see a peace process but we will see the continuation of the Palestinian struggle which is even more Justified now with all these recognitions I think it's now 12 countries of the European union members that have already recognized Palestine this means that the struggle of the Palestinian people for their freedom for their for justice and for self-determination is even more Justified than it was until that moment happens when the United States and Israel change and they will not change without our struggle on the ground thank you Mr baruti for speaking to us
