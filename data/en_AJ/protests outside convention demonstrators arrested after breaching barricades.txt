outside Chicago's United Center protesters for an array of causes gathered to demonstrate against the Democrats the first protests of the day led to the first breach of a security barrier as protesters tore down a fence between them and the convention that led to the first arrests and that led to a police Crackdown that cleared a nearby park oh the occupation on Sunday and Monday thousands marched against poverty for LGBT rights and against Israel's war on Gaza including this teacher a lot of the students uh don't have housing or don't have adequate food at home don't have adequate healthare and yet the government findes billions and billions of dollars to spend on massacring children in Palestine so you know there's something wrong with that and we we need to fight against it among the protesters was presidential candidate Stein of the green party this is a gathering of working people homeless people the Poor People's Army who marched here from Milwaukee uh to bring you know the real issues of poverty and homelessness and lack of Health Care and student debt and medical debt and all that that we don't hear a word about actually from you know from the uh Harris Trump uh you know uh campaigns thousands of Chicago Police controlled the the streets with bikes with riot gear and what appeared to be a measure of restraint as when a supervisor off camera told officers not to arrest this man no hey Andre Andre no this is a standoff between protesters and police that officer is holding a sign telling them they are being ordered to disperse these protesters are not doing that and there are plenty of police to reinforce that order we're taking did that Mo back me the tension eased when protesters agreed to remove a tent encampment for some it was a teaching moment we're mobilizing human beings are mobilizing over around a cause that is so uh sounds so so basic right like to protect human rights and and so this has been a Great Awakening for a lot of my you know the people that are here and my children to see it firsthand uh you can't you can't teach us in the books so that's why we're here time and time again police avoided repeating the bloody crackdowns of the 1968 convention here mindful of the city's reputation but knowing there are many more protests to come John hendin Al jazer Chicago make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
