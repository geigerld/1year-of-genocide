Germany has been accused of aiding and abetting genocide in Gaza in a case before the United Nations Top Court it was brought by Nicaragua and calls for emergency measures to stop Germany from selling weapons to Israel it also wants Berlin to restore funding to the un's agency for Palestinian refugees unra Nicaragua's lawyer heard harsh words for the Dual role Germany's playing in what the icj's already ruled to be a plausible case of genocide it is indeed a pathetic excuse to the P Palestinian children women and men in Gaza to provide humanitarian Aid including through air drops on the one hand and to furnish the weapons and military equipment that are used to kill and enate them and to kill also humanitarian Aid workers as most recently evidenced by the missile itch against vehicles and workers of world Central Kitchen on the other hand let's hear more now from Steph Fass and she is in the hag with more it must have been an uncomfortable two hours here for Germany at the world's highest court in the heag Nicaragua had some harsh words for Germany saying it is facilitating genocide in Gaza it's an interesting and unprecedented case because the two countries here at the court Nicaragua and Germany are not directly involved in the atrocities that are happening in Gaza but uh n AGA argues that Germany as a signatory to the genocide convention has the obligation to do everything it can to prevent genocide let alone not facilitate it uh Germany is the second largest supplier of weapons to Israel after the United States and in 2023 uh its supplies have uh grown tenfold compared to the year before and many of these weapons have still been exported after October 7 uh anti-tank weapons ammunition uh drones uh all used according to Nicaragua or at least a lot of it in Gaza against the civilian population there so this is an unprecedented case Nicaragua said that Germany has be held accountable and ordered the court to uh tell uh Germany immediately to stop supplying these weapons and the arguments uh Germany has used as for example that its commitment unconditionally to Israel comes from basically connecting its own existence to the existence of Israel is misleading because this applies to the Jewish uh population Jewish people but not to Israel and it also says that the business uh has gone really up uh armed sales the armed manufacturers are making lots more money so it's not just business as usual uh Germany supplying weapons but the business even has gone better so we will hear on Tuesday from Germany it has the chance to defend itself and then in a few weeks we will hear if the court will have provisional measures against Germany step fast in Al jazer de lawyer and Diplomat Tanya Von gishan is representing Germany before the international court of justice she says the government is upholding international law Germany rejects the allegations made by Nicaragua to gay Germany does not and never did violate the genocide convention nor International humanitarian law neither directly nor indirectly on the contrary Germany's committed to the uphold of international law and this is what we work for internationally we will tomorrow present our position in detail to this court so much I can already tell you today Nicaragua's presentation was grossly biased and we will be telling you tomorrow how we fully live up to our responsib AB ilities let's go to Dominic kanaine who is lifeless in Berlin Germany clearly saying it's being misrepresented by Nicaragua in court today is that the general feeling inside Germany the thing to to remember when considering the situation in the ha and the way that the German government is playing it is that that's what we were just hearing there they haven't changed that view going back some considerable time now remember the situation here they say that what they are doing is entirely consistent with their commitment to the existence of the state of Israel there is a polarization in society between those who endorse that view who believe that Israel has a right to exist and the policy of the government and other governments going back through time Visa Israel is entirely appropriate but then you have those on the other side who don't accept the point of view of the government and who say that the way that they are refused the right to demonstrate their disagreement with it is not consistent with human rights which explains why we see the sorts of cases being brought against Germany which have been starting to gather some momentum in recent months okay thank you for that Dominic Kane there for us in Berlin let's discuss this further with Maran bashara Maran house significant is this case by Nicaragua at the icj could it potentially uh set a legal precedent uh to deter countries from supporting military operations involving serious International crimes well of course I'm no legal scholar I mean need to underline that but certainly it's certainly an interesting precedence that a southern nation is putting another Nation on the stand at the icj that's kind of a bit of a first in the context of genocide I think the most paradoxical part of it is the fact that Germany uh is being or being put on the stand 80 years after it committed the horrific genocide against the Jews and others in Europe and this time it's actually complicit with the so-called Jewish State uh that is apparently plausibly carrying genocide in Gaza according to the icj um now what is troubling in all of that is the fact that Germans continue you know to play innocent and naive about that's something that's unfolded in front of our eyes for the past six months Joseph Bell the EU foreign policy Chief says Israel weaponized hunger that's a war crime so the EU Chief says of foreign policy Israel is carrying a war crime it's weaponizing hunger famine is not something that is coming fam is a State of Affair in Gaza today the American president Germany's Patron in the west says that Israel bombs Gaza indiscriminately that's a war crime every Joe Dick and Harry and Sarah know that Israel has used disproportionate weapon force in Gaza that 2,000 lb bombs on residential buildings and Germany is still saying oh no what war crimes oh no you know we're not complicit you are selling arms you are financially politically diplomatically supporting the country that is carrying all these war crimes in Gaza against your very commitment to the genoside convention so there it's not about Nicaragua per se it's about everything we've been reporting the facts of the matter the past six months also paradoxical in the same context is that Germany continues to support Israel unconditionally despite all of that the the the the the killing the death and injury of tens of thousands of Palestinians including some 20,000 children and women in Gaza killed by Israeli weapons and yet some six members of Honor was 13,000 staff are accused accused of joining on in the on the October 7 and until today froze its assistant to a UN agency in in Gaza so it's quite disturbing for Germany to play innocent when in fact it's its arms to the pit are really sunk in gaza's Blood and talking of arms Maran do you feel that there is this growing momentum now uh of stopping Western governments providing weapons to Israel now well certainly uh what we've seen in the UK for example you know the big protest movements on the in front of the trade office and now a number of functionaries within the trade office saying we cannot continue licensing weapons sales to Israel the protest movement in Europe certainly in the United States a whole bunch of Democrats including the former uh uh Congress uh uh speaker Nancy Pelosi saying we need to stop the weapons to in Israel that continue to deny food and medicine to the people continues to use bomb against the people in Gaza so I think certainly there's a momentum towards uh uh towards punishing Israel or towards uh cutting or freezing military and other aids to Israel because I think everyone is coming to the understanding speaking of Germany but also of the UK and the United States Israel closest Ally that one thing to support Israel and to continue to say you know we need to support Israel another thing is to support the Netanyahu government which Biden has explicitly said this is basically a very extreme government that needs to change because it is a government of fascists and Fanatics to confuse that with Israel in general right by the UK the Germany and the United States is not only foolish it's it's also shortsighted and in the context of Gaza it's not only sadistic it's also aimless because why at this point in time 6 months into genocide do they continue to support Israel with weapons always good to speak to you uh Al jazer senior political analyst Marwan Bashar there for us
