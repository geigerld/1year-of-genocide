us defense secretary Lloyd Austin has told Israel's defense minister the safety of civilians in Rafa is a top priority UAV Galan traveled to the Pentagon for the in-person meeting on Tuesday Israel says it's planning a ground offensive in the Southernmost city of the Gaza Strip where 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have been forced to seek shelter that's despite concerns from the US and the International Community ptical Hayne reports from the Pentagon pretty strong language from the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the beginning of the meeting now we know the Israeli defense minister yev Gant has come here with a long list of weapons that he says Israel needs to get from the United States including really advanced fighter jets this is seen as the most crit critical key piece of Leverage that the US has if you want to try and force Israel to change course so what happened well we were able to speak to a senior defense official on a background call and reporters repeatedly pressed were the weapons granted are they on their way and he would only say that the US strong believes Israel has a right to defend itself and to defeat Hamas that Israel says and the US believes they are following International laws of war and any announcements would come in the future but again it was fairly tough language at the beginning of the meeting let's listen to that protecting Palestinian civilians from harm is both a moral necessity and a strategic imperative in Gaza today the number of Civilian casualties is far too high and the amount of humanitarian a Aid is far too low Gaza is suffering a humanitarian catastrophe and the situation is getting even worse the safety of the 1.5 million Palestinian civilians in Rafa is also a top priority for the United States the senior defense official said he believes more Aid is getting into Gaza although he said it's still not nearly enough and when it comes to Rafa we we're able to press and say what does the US want to see happen he said basically the US wants to see uh 1.5 million Palestinians there being able to move safely to somewhere else as long as Israel can provide for their basic needs uh and then start the assault on Rafa the problem is this vice president kamla Harris she just said in an interview that she's looked at the maps there's literally nowhere for these 1.5 million people to go so obviously still a big debate behind the scenes but the pentagon's choosing not to let it go public Patty Cain Al Zer at the Pentagon
