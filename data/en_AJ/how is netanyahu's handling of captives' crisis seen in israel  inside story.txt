relatives of Israeli captives held by Hamas have reacted with Fury at a meeting with the Prime Minister about the Relentless bombing of Gaza where their loved ones are trapped some are demanding Benjamin Netanyahu Ste down what do people in Israel think this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm NE Barker as Israel relentlessly bombs Gaza as well as 2.3 million Palestinians Israelis held captive by Hamas are trapped in the strip the war is a catastrophe for Palestinians with tens of thousands injured or killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes in Israel there's a tragedy of a different kind the plight of the captives dominates the political and news agenda with major rallies calling for their release some have been freed in return for Palestinian prisoners but 138 remain trapped in Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says bringing them home safely is a priority but he says so while his military bombs Gaza without Mercy Sympathy for the captives is huge in Israel and indeed elsewhere in a few moments we'll be discussing their plight and the political dangers it presents for Netanyahu and his far-right government these came into sharp focus at a meeting he held with relative and his War cabinet increasing anxiety among some about the fate of their loved ones fter Monahan reports angry relatives of Israelis taken captive by Hamas had demanded a face Toof face with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu you show me but the closed door meeting with the war cabinet didn't have the outcome they'd hoped for Reports say some relatives called for Netanyahu to resign because Israel is bombing Gaza while their loved ones are being held there we have to do and he has to do everything to bring them back immediately everything the week-long ceasefire with Hamas in late November saw dozens of captives released Israel says around 130 are still being held in Gaza but Hamas says it won't free anymore until Israeli forces stop bombing Palestinians and the Gaza Strip it also wants all Palestinians released from Israeli jails a price some relatives believe is worth paying the simple answer is I would like them to give all the Palestinian prisoners back to Gaza or wherever they should be the Israeli government says one of its objectives in the war is to bring back the captives alive but that would almost certainly require further agreements with Hamas which Netanyahu has pledged to eliminate I say to our friends in the world who are pressing for a quick end to the war the only way to end the war and end it quickly is to use overwhelming Force against Hamas overwhelming force and destroy it Hamas says several captives have been killed in Israeli air strikes across Gaza we hold Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu fully responsible for the lives of Israeli hostages opinion polls have shown significant support among the Israeli public for the war but a recent survey suggests more than half of respondents were in favor of extending the ceasefire with Hamas to enable the release of more captives so unless there's another breakthrough the ordeal of those being held and the agony of the relatives looks set to continue Von mahun for inside story so let's bring in our gu guest in the Israeli town of pesah is Udi goren a cousin of one of the captives detained in Gaza who has taken part in the bring them home now campaigns in West Jerusalem is gearon Basin a former hostage negotiator and founder of the Israel Palestine Center for research and information that's a joint public policy Think Tank and in Tel Aviv is AKA Elder a political analyst veteran journalist and author of Lords of the land the war over Israel's settlements in the occupied territories a warm welcome to all of you udia if I can start by with you of course we appreciate the the huge uh amount of Anguish this has caused for the likes of you and other families who have been affected by the captive situation those captives of course held in in Gaza can I start by asking you what it was like to find out that your cousin had been kidnapped and indeed taken to Gaza yeah um it was a complete shock it's you know it's it's something that's so far removed from our world that it's something you hear that happens in you know in in developing countries and in places that are not considered like we consider ourselves you know a western Faith Sovereign democracy um and it's just a situation that's that's completely taken everyone out of balance to have you know your cousin not detained being kept prisoner he's a civilian being held hostage it's unimaginable to to this very day it's it's unimaginable and AKA if I can bring you in in your view how receptive has the Netanyahu War cabinet been in responding to the demands that have been growing by the Day in Israel to secure the release of these captives well n i I think that it depends which uh Network they watch and which newspaper they read uh netan is very busy these days actually his trial has just resumed and U he thinks about his own future and this is the context that you have to put into your question um they are very careful to meet the uh family but at the same time they haven't got anything to offer them like in this meeting yesterday uh they want to have it both ways they say well uh we will not stop until we wipe the Hamas off the uh face of the Earth but at the same time we will do everything to bring the people back they know netan and Gan the minister of defense that they are responsible personally because it's not just people who were uh lost in a war or they were taken hostage in war it's a blunder it's a huge blunder and the blood of 1,200 people is on their hands and the future and the whereabouts of now about 200 civilians and soldiers right that uh we know very little about What's happen to them right now while we talk and gersan just responding to something that AKA mentioned there this uh final meeting that uh Benjamin Netanyahu granted to some of the family members of those held in Gaza that was on Tuesday in which he reportedly said it's currently not possible right now to bring them all back at once from a negotiating perspective what does it mean for the families to hear a message like that coming from the prime minister right first of all I think it's important to note that it's probably the first time the Prime Minister told the truth because the price that Hamas is demanding for bringing all the P all the hostages home is a price that the government of Israel the Army the people of Israel I sense are not willing to pay at this time it's a double price one is freeing some uh 7,600 Palestinian prisoners including 559 of them serving life sentences for killing Israelis another 130 of the terrorists who were caught in Israel on October 7th but Hamas is also requiring a cessation of the war meaning that they would emerge from the tunnels and their bunkers being Victorious and this is a price that Israel is not willing to pay so it seems very correct because the only way of bringing all the hostages home is through a negotiated agreement with Hamas otherwise it's going to have to rely either on a partial agreement or on military operations aimed at search and rescue which are very dangerous right we'll get on to talking about the prospects of a negotiated solution to all of this but first Udi can I ask you from what you've heard of the experiences of people who have been released from Gaza what concerns you the most about their experiences what really concerns us all is that they might share the same fate as their captives because we now know that they're affected by the Israeli bombings even though we know 100% that the military is not going to strike anywhere they think there might be a hostage and yet they don't know everything so we know they're affected by it we know that they're not only might be injured by it but it also scares them to death as they don't really know what's happening around them they could be taken anywhere they have been moved around and aside from that the you know the the daily life it's they're not on vacation they're some of them have been tormented uh there's no food in the Gaza Strip for everyone let alone for them and the the living conditions are dire those who were held in the tunnels suffer tremendously from the health risks that you can imagine there are in staying in a damp uh tunnel with no air no proper ventilation with unbelievable humidity um and every day that passes is just further risk to their Liv to their actual survival G in response to that whichever way you want to rotate this whatever happened on October the 7th has to be classed as an absolute failure of Israeli intelligence Military Intelligence given the amount of money International money particularly from the United States that's poured into propping up the Israeli Armed Forces reports also of a number of Israelis were killed by the Israeli military itself how much confidence is there in Israel about this current bombing camp campaign in Gaza when it comes to securing something resembling a lasting peace yeah unfortunately I think that too many Israelis believe the Israeli government the spokespeople the army military people the minister of defense and the Prime Minister when they say that this bombing the renewal of the war will create more pressure on Hamas in order to release the hostages where it could actually be the quite opposite we don't know everyone is guessing it is a guessing game of military people against other people like myself who who don't buy this line that the military pressure in increases the chances of releasing the hostages I think it might actually be the the quite opposite and it might actually lead to the death of too many of these hostages and udy I mean the majority of of UN members even the United States are now showing a degree of of disqui about about the war that's currently being waged in Gaza with this in mind how receptive do you think the Israeli government is to public International criticism of what's happening I think I would largely agree with what garon has said um I think that the the general public opinion and it's also reflected by the government is that aside from the fact that uh you know we suffered such a tremendous loss and loss of faith in on October 7th but people in is is are really scared they are scared and they're demanding the government to persist and I don't think that everybody realizes the repercussions that we're we're uh we're discussing right now that these two Targets do not go together and the one of the messages we're trying to convey is that we think that in order to move forward Israel must deal with the Western border and the safety of its uh civilians and absolutely something must change in this Regional order but with this objective in mind and when you have another objective that's rescuing 136 lives one is time sensitive and the other one would definitely take months at least months to do so the the priority between the two must be clear when there are civilians lives on the line that every day may be their laugh right I can see all nodding your heads to what UD has just said Gan if I can ask you this what happens to this pervading sense of righteous indignation when it comes to perpetuating this conflict to reach its Ultimate Game of destroying herass that of course is what Netanyahu wants to do I I think that the fact that Israel faced the biggest trauma in its history in fact the biggest trauma of the Jewish people since the Holocaust impacts directly on the decision making of the government the Army and with the support of the people the overriding objective of the war to dismantle hamas's ability to other govern and control the territory of Gaza again seems to me to be overriding the desire of the public to bring the hostages home there was a brief period during the time when the hostages were coming home when there was a ceasefire that it seemed that that was the number one priority but when the torture of every night watching whether or not hamamasu is going to release these people and the humiliation that they went through as they were being released created the mood once again in the country where the wart War objective seems to be once again overriding unfortunately for the lives of the hostages and their families who are continuing to go through this torture every day AKA your thoughts on that where this sense of righteous indignation currently stands in Israel well I I believe that we have to put it and this is where the Americans are putting this uh in in a broader context Israel has also to offer the uh facilitators of a possible deal uh primarily Qatar Egypt and the United States how Israel sees the day after uh Hamas of course is now under great pressure they have uh thousands of fatalities and ke let me let me ask you this because how Israel perceives the so-called day after also is impacted on how Israel sees the Palestinians going forward as well is there much sympathy towards the pl of Palestinians in Gaza and indeed the West Bank since October the 7th given of course the high civilian death toll in Gaza and of course the thousands of Palestinians continue to be detained in the West Bank it's a very good question that uh if you put it forward to prime minister netan he will tell you it's not the time to deal with it as well as with the series of blunders and the War uh but the United States I understand insist on getting much clearer answers because uh this today uh is the 61st day since uh the uh terrible incident in uh uh in around Gaza but the the Americans and the qataris who are deeply involved in the negotiations for the deal that will bring the uh captives back home they also need to know how Israel sees the the end game and uh the Israeli public needs to know that because the deal to get up now the captives is part of a comprehensive settlement that will bring also about half a million soldiers back home and you need to understand every Israeli family knows someone who was either killed or kidnapped on October 7th so everybody is personally involved in this let let's take a look at the negotiating process in a bit more detail Gan returning to that I mean because for seven days it seemed like the process was wor didn't it until of course it rapidly collapsed Israel blames Hamas for not handing over military captives Hamas says it wants to increase the number of its prisoners released in return for widening the category of captives release of course there is a precedent for this you were involved in it directly in the exchange of galad Shalit the Israeli soldier who was held for five years by Hamas and he was exchanged for 1,027 Palestinians why are swaps on this scale or indeed all for all swaps apparently out of the question right now I I think that the negotiations didn't break down over the new demands of Hamas for a l larger number of prisoners to be released I think that is doable and I think the Israelis will have no choice but to agree to that what I understand is the main problem is that there remains 14 or 15 young women between the age of 20 and 30 who remain as hostages in Gaza and they were the ones that Israel wanted to bring out and according to what the intelligence has been telling us they've undergone abusive attacks and rapes sexual abuse by their captors and the captors the Hamas no longer want to release them because of the stories that they will have to tell this is what we understand is the reason and if this is the case this is beyond something that Israel is capable of negotiating on there will be another deal made I believe there's a chance for it to release the elderly the young the the people who are not Soldiers the sick and the wounded and Israel released hundreds and maybe thousands of pris rers in exchange for them but this story of the young women is very very painful and if it's true it's horrendous right as far we as we are aware gean that is now subject to a un investigation looking to allegations of war crimes on on both sides of the Divide because they have no access right the international V cross right it it has also been uh denied by herass um we need to obviously apply a degree of healthy skepticism okay well there's no reason for us to believe Hamas in its denial there absolutely no reason whatsoever we know that there was mass raping that took place at the music festival in raahim on the day that the massacre of 370 young Israelis took place there as well right well I hope uh given the circumstances and investigation if given access if given more information is able to independently verify this UD if I could ask you this what the perception would be uh for Israelis for there to be a much wider much broader number of Palestinians released if that meant the possibility of all the captives in Gaza also beinged I think that it would stri it would spark a huge discussion in Israel but overall we know that the there is a very large support in the public and and and awareness that this would have to be the price of uh the return of the hostages there are more people that are for it than against it and of course this is something that would have to be communicated well by the government let alone you know that we are now living through this trauma of which is the one that initiated this attack and was one of the people released on the gilad chalit um the gilad shal deal and yet Israel has ways to not only to communicate and make this happen but also also to be much smarter about the just to remind our viewers just to remind our viewers Yaya sinoa now perhaps one of the most Wanted Hamas figures in Gaza at the moment who was released as part of the swap with gillad Shalit um AA if I could bring you in on this because however you look at this it looks as if the fate of Israelis the fate of Palestinians on both sides are inextricably linked there is no way you can solve one situation without resolving the other yes and uh I I believe that uh both sides are looking for an opportunity to raise a flag uh even if it's a white flag uh but at the same time they need the victory image or the victory footage and as you mentioned uh capturing or making him raise a white flag can bring an end to uh the tragedy on both sides do do you see that do you see that as being regarded as a strategic victory for for nyaho to be able to claim if he is able to locate Yaya Sina would that be enough well strategic Victory is putting an end to the conflict and promoting a two-state solution negotiated solution I I think that this is a kind of a media victory for netan and maybe for Hamas everybody needs to be able to declare Victory after so many fatalities and such a big damage to Gaza and to the Israeli economy and Prestige right gentlemen as as we approach the end of the program I I I want you to give us if possible a brief final thought on perhaps what needs to be said to the Israeli War cabinet that isn't perhaps being heard loudly enough at the moment if I could start with you AKA uh I think that the Israeli cabinet is in a big dilemma actually I don't envy them uh it's doomed if you do it's doomed if you don't the expectations of the average Israeli in the street is uh to get the captives back but that it will not happen to us again and I don't think that anybody there is no Israeli politician uh academic or a journalist that can guarantee uh even you know somebody was suggesting to pour water to pump water from the sea and U and pour it into the tunnels but what the captives out there so okay uh I don't see any easy solution right no easy solution gon if I can bring you in we're in the closing couple of minutes gon very briefly right well I'll tell you what I told members of the war cabinet they have to make a an offer to Hamas that they can't refuse and what I mean by that is that we need to make an offer to bring home at least all the civilian hostages the women who are left there the elderly the sick and the wounded at least those and that's more than half of the hostages and they have to be willing to tell Hamas what they're willing to do which is a large number of prisoners in exchange okay thank you udy last few seconds think outside the box Israel is renowned for making things happen in face of adversity and in face of situations that are impossible soide the Box bring all of them back home okay well thank you all uh for your thoughts throughout this discussion thanks to all our guests Udi guran gersin Basin and AKA Elder and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting
