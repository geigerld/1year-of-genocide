well meanwhile gaza's Health Ministry has declared a polio epidemic across the strip the World Health Organization announced on Friday it would be sending a million polio vaccines to Gaza after the highly infectious disease was discovered in sewage samples there humanitarian agencies have been expressing concerns over an outbreak due to the deteriorating sanitary conditions and the lack of Access to Health Care well let's get more on this with hin kodari she joins me now on the line from deral Bala in central Gaza hind as we were saying earlier we've been hearing These Warnings for months now this is a highly contagious disease that had broadly been eradicated from most parts of the world talk us through how bad this could get in Gaza well it all started with hepatitis A Hepatitis B diseases um weird stuff on people's skins without knowing what these are now they discovered a highly infectious disease in seage samples and later on they noticed that this was virus CV V2 in waste water especially in those areas in and in the middle area and why in those areas because the Israeli forces have been asking all the Palestinians to evacuate from Rafa from different areas from the Northern areas to the middle middle area Palestinians have been living in the streets Mak naked camps without having access to bathroom without having any hygiene without having easy access to Water Sanitation sewage is everywhere garbage is piled in streets and this is the least of what health officials are saying they're saying that this is only a start of a wave of new diseases now the the minister of house was unable to track any of those cases and why is because they do not even have the equipment or the tools or the lab supplies to record those cases and even if one someone was affected with this they won't even have the ability to treat uh such cases now since ra incursion started and the Israeli started um taking over the Philadelphia Corridor there has been no medical supplies entering the go there has been no medicines entering and it's making the health situation collapse every single day now according to health officials they're not only treating uh people who are injured from Israeli air strikes but they're also treating Palestinians with htis a htis b and there's an out outbreak of skin diseases among children especially those who are living intent this is only the start according to the officials but the the ongoing uh garbage pile the suwage people across the streets shattered across the streets not even having access to bathrooms is the main reason of why this uh uh disease and this uh virus is um is across Gaza and both of the doctors said that this is only the S of the waves of diseases the Gaza Sur is going to face hind Kari there with the latest for us reporting from darl Bala in central Gaza thank you hind Margaret Harris she's the spokesperson for the World Health Organization she joins me now from Geneva Margaret for more than 25 years I believe the Gaza Strip was polio free then just last week polio was detected in in six out of seven routine sewage samples I mean we know in war scenarios it creates the environment for polio to spread but where did it come from so basically it comes from somebody's gut uh that's what the sewage samples tell us that at least quite a few people because those samples were from hunis and from Dera Bala and it was six of seven as you've correctly reported so that means that probably more than one person now does have the virus in their gut and that also tells us that we need to urgently be able to get in there and vaccinate all the children and provide the level of services the level of care that was the norm in Gaza before this this conflict Margaret so there are different strains of polio I understand this particular strain that's been found is vaccine derived polio can you explain that for us what and what that might potentially mean for spread to too so it's actually a variant that's developed it originally a long time ago was vaccine derived but it's managed to get into populations and turn into a variant just as we saw with covid there are many variants and we have tracked this variant in different parts of the world and again wherever we see it pop off we do a big vaccination um response to and that usually shuts it down so that's again why the was water surveillance is so so important but in this circumstance and again we've got a clear way to respond to get the vaccination in there but we have to have the the end of we have to have the security we have to have the means of getting the vaccine into Gaza and to the children a vaccine's no good if it's sitting in a vial or sitting in a truck so uh there is an answer but the answer is we need a ceasefire well let me ask you in the event that there isn't a ceasefire you're saying that you are going to try to roll out 1 million vaccines what is your plan for Access and if this is this vaccine derived polio strain are there implications for what type of vaccine can be used oh yes we we know what type of vaccine will work the oral po polio vaccine works very well because essentially this is a virus that gets into the gut goes in comes out the other end that's why Wastewater is a very important way to detect it so putting an oral um vaccine in does the job but as you say the critical thing is being able to reach all the children now we're going to make every effort to do that because we continue to provide that service through the partners through all the health workers in Gaza who haven't stopped working as you know they've done their very best but just getting around the strip just getting to all the children just bringing the children safely to where they can be vaccinated is almost impossible unless we're given at least a pause in the fighting to do what needs to be done Margaret I understand there has been some vaccination taking place during the course of this war and there has been some collaboration with the Israeli authorities to ensure that that happens I was looking at some of the numbers before the war polio vaccination coverage in Gaza was well over 95% last year it was 89% those sound like fairly High numbers yet we are seeing this now how bad could this get given the the pre-war immunity so indeed you're right in fact Gaza was a model it was one of the best in the region um shining example of what could be achieved because there was such good Primary Health Care because there had been a lot of work to really build that up a network of good Primary Health Care Services but you know if you I've often spoken with uh the the the nurses and doctors who run those Primary Care Health Centers like the rest of the population they've had to pick up their things and run so many times so they're there and they have continued to vaccinate whenever possible but again we've remember we're now into the 10th month of this conflict so that's a whole generation of babies that have been born you know pregnancy is 10 months nine months 10 months and they many of them have not had the opportunity to be vaccinated so it's not just hold know it's all the other things that protect our children from the diarrhea Ro diseases the other diseases that in the past killed children we need to be able to provide that protection of course Margaret so far it seems that the cases have been mild and asymptomatic we haven't been hearing about paralysis for instance in the cases of polio how quickly could that change so most polio 75% of polio May well be a symptomatic it's it's like many viruses the problem is if you are one of those who get the severe form you can be paralyzed for life or you can die so that's why it's such an important disease and we were at on the point of eliminating it the other thing about polio is it's a disease it just stays in the human population so with vaccination we could have eliminated it from the world but with the conflicts breaking out around the world all that work all those millions of dollars all all those millions and billions of men and woman hours have been wasted because we've just gone backwards so indeed you're right um and at the moment I mean you the outbreak we're looking at is an outbreak we understand from the Wastewater surveillance which tells us that the virus is there but we at this at present we have not had a case of acute paralysis reported to the World Health Organization Margaret Harris there the Organization speaking to us there from Geneva thank you so much for your time Margaret and we wish you all the best with the vaccine roll out thank you so much for hosting me make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Al jazer
