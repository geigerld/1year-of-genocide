Israel has targeted education in its war on Gaza it's destroying schools and universities and has killed thousands of students and teachers yet learning and teaching still go on in tense and makeshift classrooms how and why does gaza's educational Spirit remain so strong this is Inside Story [Music] hello welcome to the program I am Hashim education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world so said the late South Africa leader Nelson Mandela the spirit of his words live on today in Gaza through the determination of teachers and students to ensure learning continues despite Israel's genocidal aggression for decades despite Wars and occupation students from Gaza have excelled internationally in fields like medicine engineering and the Sciences as well as arts and the humanities too Israel clearly recognizes the importance of Education to people in Gaza manifested through its destruction of most of the strip schools and universities some demolished by Dynamite when air strikes weren't enough educational leaders like Professor have been assassinated while thousands of students and teachers have been killed in the war so how does education keep going in Gaza what's the long-term impact of Israel's war on this generation of school children and students there we'll be discussing all these issues with our guest shortly first this report from Laura Khan education can shape the future and change lives but that's far from the reality these children face in their makeshift School in kanun they're determined to learn in the ruins of their teachers home there's a strong response from the children as they want to return to education instead of wandering the streets or feeling lost our goal is to provide activities and help alleviate the psychological pain that children are experiencing that includes anxiety fear and the trauma from the things they have seen around 625,000 registered students would you to go back to school in Gaza this week yet this is the state of the education infrastructure in the strip 85% of school buildings have been damaged or completely destroyed and nearly 10,000 students killed the UN says the few schools Still Standing are being used as shelters for those without anywhere to go and even those are being attacked by Israel's military the UN relief and works agency says no official schooling is available in any of its 200 schools with many of them being used as shelters for displaced Palestinians the agency says its teams are still providing recreational activities and psychos social support in some of its schools Gaza traditionally has a high literacy rate among its youth many who attended un schools have gone on to excel in high level professions including NASA engineer Lai albas uni and writer poet and Professor rafat al- arir who taught and inspired generation of young Palestinian writers in the strip if we stop caring about stories if we stop telling our stories if we stop listening to our parents we create space we create vacuum for others to occupy this virtual space in our past in our heart Alara was killed in an Israeli air strike in December he attended the Islamic University of Gaza that was destroyed in an air strike last year libraries and lecture the theaters that once facilitated students dreams are now just remnants of War this was isra University a modern Hub where engineering law and finance were taught to thousands of students it's one of all 12 universities that have been destroyed among streets that are no longer recognizable lie Twisted Metal and piles of concrete and children clutching pens and paper plastic sheeting used in tents provides no security the Persistence of the children of Gaza to learn reflects their resilience and their hope that there must be a better future than the reality they live in Laura Khan for Inside Story Al to zero let's bring in our guest in Gaza Omar Salah is an English teacher at the University College of applied science says he was awarded a place at Durham University in the UK but couldn't leave because of the war on Gaza in Los Angeles L basun who's from Gaza is a Power Electronics lead engineer who worked on the Ingenuity Ms helicopter team with NASA GPL and was educated in the trip in Doha Ahmed is the co-founder of we are not numbers a Palestinian youth Le nonprofit project in Gaza welcome to the program gentlemen Omar do you have any idea of your St students are still alive or constantly on the move from a shelter to another thank you for having me first and U actually we are uh we have been recently started working on um online teaching asynchronous online teaching because we can do this a synchronous way and uh despite all the challenges and the and all the difficulties we are facing these days uh from electricity from from a place for Education there's no it's really really hard to find a place for education and and well equipped also many of my students uh sadly were killed during the genocide and uh we are talking not just we are talking about more than 600,000 students who were deprived from the education from the right of Education it's a whole it's a whole generation actually and uh and my University it's myself Islamic University I have been uh deprived also from continuing my Master's Degree uh drat made his so rest in peace he was my supervisor and in my ma thesis but uh I I couldn't he he was murdered uh and and I'm not able to continue my education they are giving a p priority to other students who are studying bachelors and it's not just our alleng from the the teachers uh side despite all that so also students side students are not able to find a place to for Education internet is really SC you can't find a good place for internet and you're not talking about just uh browsing it's it's uh you need to watch videos you need to download lectures you need to have exams so it's all a in asynchronous way uh which is really difficult and many students are trying to leverage cafes they go to cafes they are there are some internet uh points in the streets they Tred to connect with it and it's really really weak internet connection so despite all that we're talking about internet connection uh there's a problem with a place you can't find a place most students are going try to move miles to a place to find a good place for for learning okay uh it could be this is one of those moments where the top priority for students in Gaza is just to fetch water food and help their par as their biggest concern is their own Survival could you share your your feelings with us when you see those pictures of children walking between the rubble on the streets of Gaza I mean it's really it's really sad uh like the level I mean how how bad you know like life God in Gaza uh I mean it's a constantly Massacre every day uh you know like there is no safe place you know I mean you see a lot of these students you know trying I mean a lot I mean a lot of kids you know like you just try to go after their you know just securing water I mean I talked to a lot of my cousins there I mean honestly like education become a secondary thing I mean most most schools I went to I mean I don't know if there is any of them actually still intact I mean every single one have been bombed uh you know so I mean but in the same time you know I mean I see kids actually recently like about a couple weeks ago I got a call from one of the one of the professors from Department of Education who actually was trying to coordinate a talk he was like you know teacher ing a class in in a tent so I mean you know seeing these kids still like have hope you know trying to be educated you know they were even still able to laugh uh I mean that's giv me a lot of hope I mean I don't think anybody I mean Israel always targeted educational system in Palestine I mean in Gaza even during during you know their civil administration of Gaza I mean there like many times they were closing our schools for any reason they just like make an execu then school will be closed for month at a time so a lot of time we had to actually study at home you know we had to like you know I mean people like always educated themselves you know so I mean that that will never stop so I mean there will always be hope and you know no matter how many school they take down we just we will rebuild them Ahmed do you see the Relentless bombardment of schools and universities as a policy to take away that Spirit of resilience among the Palestinians particularly in Gaza uh I believe yes of course Israel since the beginning of this war and even before this war Israel took it upon them themselves to destroy the economy of Gaza the education in Gaza the spirit of the people in Gaza and even we have to to talk about this even before this genocide started Israel had a policy to of ethnical cleansing in the West Bank and the first thing they would do in order to evacuate a village they would destroy the the the primary school in that in that Village and then they would force people to go out of of their homes and lands this is a policy of ethnical cleansing this is a policy of genocide that Israeli practice on the people in Gaza and Israel knows that the people of Gaza care a lot about education we are the most highly educated people in the Middle East and we care a lot about education so Israel destroys the the uh institutional the educational institutions in Gaza because they wanted to make it impossible to to the people of Gaza to live so that they eventually leave so this is a part of the ethnic cleansing policies that Israel is practicing on the people of Gaza and of course it is measured it is calculated it is intentional could you tell us what are your options next are you thinking about inventing new ways so that you can reach out to your students and help them navigate this particular year well uh actually I'm doing my best uh I have a decent internet connection in my uh camp and uh we are trying to uh to if if the most thing you can do is to if there if there's any inquiries or if children are facing any problem so we are leveraging some um of the classroom so students send their inquiries and if they have need need questions or anything they can contact me by number or they can uh uh email or anything so uh it's not just uh on my individual side I do my best to help but it's really it's it's it's out of my hands because I'm also a student and uh I'm doing my best to help because I'm having this problem so the best way I can do is to uh try to if they have any problem they contct me to do anything uh but but I'm thinking about is you you're you're talking about uh this is a deliberate Act of Killing and and uh it's a part of the genocide actually targeting the academics and and the students it's about 3,679 students were killed during the genocide and they are they are targeting the pillar univers educational uh uh facilities like the Islamic University other university and my University as well the place where I'm working it's fully demolished they are not just targeting anything they they're deliberating doing that and I I believe that education is a source of peace and it's a way of of resistance all also the colonizer knows that when when this when this community or this country are well educated they will resist they will understand but if if this if we suppress them then we we will colonize them mentally and physically they need the best they trying their best to not just uh put us down in terms of killing and destruction but also they're trying to do this mentally okay you you said you're hopeful uh God will tap into that Spirit of resilience and continue despite all the odds but the Ministry of Education the Palestinian Ministry of Education is saying that 90 all the schools are shut in Gaza 90% completely destroyed how do you see the educational system rebuilt in the near future in Gaza I mean you know that you know the school system I you know when I went to school I mean I remember my first grade I mean we're in a tent you know I mean because our class was being rebuilt and the school time so I mean that did not stop us I mean we still have teachers we still have students that's the only thing you need somebody who really wanted to be to want to be educated and I think you cannot kill that Spirit schools are just a place they're just a tool uh but you know I mean the most important actually this the students and their spirit so I mean once we get once we can stop this genocide I mean there will be a lot of opportunities to grow I mean you know I think the education would continue whether without their schools I mean you know I mean schools you know in the past I mean there were just probably tents you know could you know people could just study in a tent could people study on their own you know you cannot really stop the spirit of somebody who really want to learn and improve and better themselves so and I I think that's what we really have uh I mean everything else is just a tool that will assist us to advance further you know we can't constantly under suppression you know to even like you know like even the suppress our voices as educated Palestinian to just because they don't really like the word to see examples of of like successful Palestinian Ahmed 625,000 gazans already Ved likely to miss the school for the ne second year another 58,000 6 year olds who have registered for the first time for their first grade we're talking about a logistical nightmare even if the International Community is willing to commit cash and all the means tomorrow to try to put together a smooth year for students in is it likely to happen is it workable I think the situation is more uh dangerous than this let's imagine that today the war ends let's imagine that today the genocide ends what about the mental health of the people in Gaza what about the mental health of the students in Gaza we already know that before the genocide in Gaza over 80 or 90% of the students in Gaza suffered from psychological and mental uh disorder now after everything that they have been through during the past here how do you think these students will be able to go to school to study to get themselves educated this is a huge problem but I have all the all the the faith in the world in the Palestinian people I know that we will continue to study we will continue to go to schools whether they were tense or not but I mean right now we need to have this genocide end we need to stop this war and then after that we will need a lot of support we will need a lot of help from organizations from schools from governments so that we can rehabilitate the educational system in Gaza Omar briefly if you don't mind the Ona has launched the back to learning program in 45 of its shelters where basically you have the children children uh the teachers sitting with the with the students trying to set up games drama Arts music and different sports activities for them just to get a a semblance of what should be a normal time vibrant uh uh School Vibe is there something that you that could be expanded across Gaza do you see it happening across Gaza in the upcoming weeks actually in the in the upcoming weeks really it's really really hard and because most of the schools the ownable schools are being used as shelter for displaced people and U they are not even uh ready where did they take this old people out in order to start the educational system it's really hard but uh what I'm thinking what what I'm seeing actually is uh some organizations like uh uh like for example save save the children organization they're trying to make something uh to to in each Camp the for example in our camp it's it's not the organization it's our initial initiative we have a tent we try to educate the teach the our people our children in the camp uh the way we can uh because those children specifically in the primary levels they are in need for to be educated because their mind is not well established they need to keep being uh the their mind need to be uh active all the time and you we can't ignore them so we're trying to help them teach them in the tent what the way we can and some organizations are supporting that they are doing tents in the in the camps and teaching children specifically in the primary levels and that that's the most thing they are able to do but for H schools I'm not saying this is easy it's really hard but if the genocide ends uh there will be a solution for that uh schools that all about an end to the war in Gaza you've been talking time and again about education has been a source of Pride among the Palestinians particularly in Gaza you were born in uh uh uh Gaza you were educated there you moved to the United States of America you became uh an engineer then you helped the Mars helicopter Ingenuity program which completed 72 hours historic flight becoming the first aircraft to achieve a power control flight on another Planet it's phenomenal by by a young child who comes from a place like Gaza but do you have any concerns that despite all the optimism you still think about we could end up now with a Lost Generation for many many years to come I mean you know we definitely lost time you know so I mean I think you know Ian I don't know if I would say Lost Generation I mean you know I mean every I mean it's reallyy sad you know I mean what's happening I mean it's really depressing honestly but in the same time like I I don't know if we like lost a generation I mean we lost a year or two I mean you know I I use my father for example he had to because of the 1967 war school was canceled for a year and his exam was canceled and he had he spent two years before he was able to go to medical school so you know you I mean we didn't really lose that generation you know so I mean you know just if we look at the past I mean in 1948 the same thing happened uh you know but we you know that that just made us more stronger to continue to prove that we are worthy you know to be like to let make the word recognize who we are recognize the work we have provide the word you know in term of education and other knowledge which is I mean you Palestine in history I mean it's always been a source of knowledge you and no matter what happens we always going to rebuild I mean yes there is a lot of trauma affect the students you know I mean I think a lot of people probably like at this point probably hopeless you know but I think I think we'll overcome that uh I think the biggest thing will be like how is this whole system I mean a systematical attack here it's not only on education it's on even you know like you know on the H there's a lot of there's a lot of propaganda being spread about education of Palestinians uh you know I mean directly by Netanyahu I mean you know it's like which is you know but it's like you know there's a lot of it is just like unfounded like excuses and you know just part partially like to delete the Palestinian identity you know so you know but I I don't think they will be able to succeed at any of that and you know okay I think our our our kids will have you know will still have future whoever want to really be educated they will find their ways Ahmed you also have a story to share you lost 21 members of your family in October you launched a platform we're not just numbers so people can share their own stories about the agony and the blight of the people in Gaza are people in the west receptive to your the content that you publish on the platform oh thank you very much um I lost the 21 members of my family in October but two of my sisters who were killed in that home were teachers 14 of my nieces and nephews who were killed most of them were pupils who go to school and uh one of our co-founders if we are not numbers was this great amazing prominent Professor he was a mentor to us he said in his last words if I must die you must live to tell my story so we are living right now those who of us who survived this massacre who survived this genocide we are living to tell our stories to the world now when we are not numbers we we chose we decided to write our stories in English for the Western audiences because we know how the mainstream media in the west have failed the Palestinian people they have demonized and dehumanized the Palestinian people we are thighing our stories ourselves because we want to get ourselves ex exposed to the Western audiences of course there is a lot of reception uh in the west especially because the people in the west now more than ever they realize how they were deceived by their own media how they were blinded by their own media so there is a lot of reception that we're receiving in the West A lot of people are reading our stories for the first time they're reading and they're changing their perception about we are not numbers about people in Gaza because they're reading stories firstand from the victims of a human right violations in Gaza I have different angles to cover with you gentlemen so if you can be uh brief in your answer I would really appreciate Omar will virtual schools be the Practical best alternative now for now uh the most practical way to keep the uh the the educational system is using the online teaching but it is really it's somehow impossible to do the synchronous teaching which is like a live uh uh lecture something where we are leveraging the asynchronous way of teaching and stud we have we give students time we give them like deadlines like we give them uh some a huge period to do the deadlines uh to do their Stu work and uh to to submit their exams because we know that they are not able uh it's hard it it's challenging and somehow sometimes students have to move like miles in order to get uh to get the place and even it's not well equipped for uh for education and for us teachers there are some some places like hubs if if you know that like work hubs we have one we can go there but it's also what's available but it's hard I believe that sorry it's a it's a quick fix for the time being yes but I believe if we back to our uh ancestors we back to our grandfathers who who were displaced in 1948 uh they started from they started from T they start from very basic things the solution is not a very it's not hard to start the the educational system it's just a mentality and it's it's a prophecy to keep to surpass to surpass it to the generations and each generation comes give it give it to the other generation and it's like a prophecy so we need to try to keep to keep that cycle go ongoing as much as we can look un agencies are facing a problem which is basically they've been asking for donations to be able to put together the education system particularly in Gaza in the near future when the war is over but as you know the donors are not really excited about the potential of injecting more cash into education because they say they have other priorities food Aid hospitals and so on and so forth what could be the best scenario what should the Palestinians do or neighboring countries Arabs in particular wealthy Nations to try to help the Palestinians when it comes to rebuilding educational system in the future yeah I mean that's what I was like talking I mean there's like the big you know systematical attack on the organization like for own which is like bringing a lot of the funding and then you destroy I guess the majority the majority of their infrastructure so now you know they already were struggling with budget before this you know especially with some country reducing their budget so I mean so that that there will be there will be like a big like fiscal problem in term of like funding and the priority of the funding because now it's like you know like going to become like the health care the education that you know the education probably come secondary because you know we just trying to make people survive and give them food so a lot of the is going there way uh so I mean we you know there need to be like more uh you know like to help you know rebuild a lot of the school so they're going to need to be like a lot more funding uh you know TOA or to other organization to allow to allow the tools to to make it more accessible for every single s single person to be actually be able to go to to get education Ahmed what would be the best way to prevent a second year without access to school for people in Gaza even if the war continues the war has to end we can't allow this continue this to continue we can't allow this genocide to continue for more than a year enough is enough I think it is time that everyone every single person every single organization or all the governments they have to come and agree that this war has to end and when this war ends there has to be a lot of work done in Gaza we need a lot of support us Palestinians alone in in Gaza after this genocide I don't think we have enough capacity to revive and rehabilitate the educational system we need a lot of help from the organizations NOS human rights organizations we need a lot of help with the resources with the funding and but also and most importantly we need to have this war end and we need to make sure that no more genocides happen to the Palestinian people ahed I really appreciate your time the stories that you shared with us which are definitely going to resonate among the young children in Gaza desperate to go back to school despite the Relentless bombardment and the massive loss of life thank you and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by
