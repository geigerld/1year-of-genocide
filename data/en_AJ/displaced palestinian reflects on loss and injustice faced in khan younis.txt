Ta'imah, I live in the village of Al-Aziza Bani Suhaila. Go to a palace for us from our dear home to Khan Yunis, a quarter of Murad, Khan Yunis, a journey to Sharqa and another journey after that, and I did not find any comfort anywhere, knowing that I returned to the ruins of my destroyed house and breathed its air. I had better than all.  Something even though it is implicit, and God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs. Okay, what sin have I committed? As a man with a mobility disability and needing help, no, I did not find any of that. I built the house in 60 years. Every time I lose a penny, I put in the house, I put in the house, I put in the house.  We don't have any money or anything, and in the end you take him by force. I swear to God, I do not accept an enemy or a bad-mouther. I swear to God Almighty. This is a crime. Who wants to hold accountable? Who wants to hold accountable those who committed crimes against us? Who wants to hold them accountable? But we have no one but the Lord of the Worlds. It will happen at the beginning of all matters.
