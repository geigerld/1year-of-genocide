banned Al jazer gets shut down in Israel just as Israeli forces move into Raa is Italy's Prime Minister Georgia Maloney out to turn state-owned television into State controlled television and halfway through India's 6- week long election process we examine the narratives both in the mainstream media and on the social side this last week offered a brief moment of Hope for the approximately 1.5 million Palestinians trapped in Rafa supposedly the last safe space for civilians in Gaza Hamas had accepted the terms of a ceasefire agreement it looked like lives would be saved but on Tuesday prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the proposal fell short of Israel's key demands and now an assault on Rafa is underway coinciding with all of this has been the closure of alzer's news Operation in Israel our news coverage TV broadcasts and website are all blocked there that measure May Shield Israelis at least temporarily from the horrors that are being inflicted on Rafa but it will not stop this network from covering the story what it does signal to the world though and the Netanyahu government's allies abroad is that Israel's so-called democracy is not what it's cracked up to be the Israelis are trying to uh sort of portray this kind of as like an endgame that this is sort of the last Bastion City in the Gaza Strip where they're claiming that the military operation is not complete until the army goes in with troops to what they describe as dismantling hamas's remaining infrastructure the reality and practice of this is that RAF is right now the only hub for Palestinian life and society and refuge for people who've been displaced for the past 7 months from the northern strip all the way down to the South Rafa was supposed to be the red line that Israel would not cross its forces have coralled around 1.5 million Palestinians there more than half the surviving population after 7 months of punishing civilians with bombs and bullets you can add another betrayal to the mix having advised those civilians to take refuge there the Netanyahu government now calls Rafa the last stronghold of ham and within a day of rejecting a ceasefire that Hamas had agreed to that would have freed every remaining Israeli hostage Netanyahu sent in the troops for reasons that may be far more political than strategic so his desire to continue this genocide is both because he's genocidal but also because he is a survivalist and he wants to make sure that he remains in office the bigger issue is that it seems to be that there are no red lines back in March we heard President Biden say but there's red lines that if he crosses in the he cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead as a and he very quickly backtracked from that they've made a mockery out of the international legal system as we know it they've made a mockery out of um out of the genocide convention and the fact that Netanyahu continues to be able to do whatever he wants to do just shows you uh how genocidal he is and how genocidal the United States is as well of the four interviews in this piece you will notice that only one of them is via webcam the one we did in Israel we had no choice given that on the eve of going into Rafa the Netanyahu government banned Al jazer from the Israeli Airwaves and from reporting from there in announcing the police raids on alzer's offices Israel's Communications Minister called the network a threat to Israeli security because it broadcasts statements issued by Hamas what Al jazer really is is a clear and everpresent danger to the Israeli narrative it has journalists on the ground in Gaza documenting the story the way most international news outlets cannot since they have been locked out by Israel Western news outlets forced to cover Gaza at a distance have reported on the Israeli Crackdown on Al jazer but in an industry that usually stands up for its own there has been a noticeable lack of solidarity there Al jazer I think many people uh if if they do watch it would see it as some kind of propaganda they would see the news media outside of uh Israel is captive in a way to this pro-israel narrative and they don't consider Al jazer as one of their own so Al jazer is othered because it is funded by Qatar Netanyahu has attacked Qatar even though it's instrumental in mediating for a ceasefire so that's why there is hardly a ripple of dissent among foreign media but those of us who need that diverse view of what's happening in the Middle East know that that is false the notion that by broadcasting the statements of Hamas or interviewing people that the Israelis are designating as terrorists is supporting terrorism means that you don't actually believe in real journalism you know I follow the telegram feeds of the alassan brigades the the armed wing of Hamas and because I follow uh that feed in addition to Israeli government feeds I have a much more nuanced picture of what has happened on the ground the fact is that what they don't like about alzer's coverage is that it has the audacity to contradict the Israeli narrative or to Simply do the job of Journalism while the Israeli military and politicians alike have been making these claims for some time they have not been providing the evidence needed to support them it's not that Al jazer is advocating hamas's position it's that Al jazer is allowing people to make up their own mind including benjam netanyahu's own Minister of Justice who according to reports in two Israeli newspapers relies on alzer's coverage of Gaza the Israeli authorities would do better to focus on their own Airwaves the same government that just shut down a News Network for quote endangering Israeli soldiers has no issues when a senior official in the ruling lud party goes into an Israeli News Studio talks about Palestinian civilians in Gaza and comes out with this when you live here seeing those types of Clips is actually a daily occurrence this this is not an aberration we see almost daily uh politicians make these making these genocidal statements on television we hear them on radio in print it happens all the time we hear not just commentator but sometimes the journalists themselves making these exact same statements Israel is a country that is in genocidal fever and the reason that they don't want networks like jazer here is because they don't want anybody covering the genocidal fever that has taken shape inside is and if you look at Israeli media from the beginning of the war it's basically been a cacophony in support of the war there's this kind of popular consent for creating this kind of singular uh hegemonic narrative for everyone to believe in to allow the government and the Army to do whatever it needs to and that coverage is obviously not showing Israelis uh what is happening to Palestinians on the ground the number of people who are being killed any testimonies of how that war is being waged when that is your media environment then you're having a you're having society that is not able to confront the realities of what their country is waging a society that likes to describe itself as a democracy the only one in the Middle East Israel is the only true democracy uh in this region that is a narrative Israel's government constantly puts out there and it resonates with its media allies abroad who venerate Israel's democracy regardless of the crimes against humanity that it commits you're not Hamas Israel is a democracy and as a Jewish State uh supports and and believes in every life mattering and so but since when have apartheid States been considered true democracies just because they hold elections and what kind of democracy locks the global media out of a war zone that has become a slaughterhouse for civilians kills journalists there at an unprecedent ented rate and then bans one of the only news channels that has its own reporters in Gaza survivors risking their lives to get the story out we need to talk about that term democracy um Israel calls itself a democracy its citizens think of itself as a democracy but it isn't a democracy at all you could call it an ethnocracy with Superior rights to Israeli Jews you could call it a theocracy because it's captive to the religious elements and religious leaders and also the ministers that bring a uh a farri Jewish interpretation of uh Jewish law into uh the Israeli secular context so this is not a democracy that we're talking about perhaps nothing unmasks that in a more powerful way than that state which is supposedly the only democracy in the Middle East waging a genocidal war of extermination against the Palestinians while simultaneously trying to shut down the single most important Network that is broadcasting the other side of the barrel of the Israeli gun that is being pointed at the people of Palestine and fired non-stop for seven straight months to the tune of almost 35,000 confirmed deaths it serves as a very powerful symbol of a narrative based entirely on lies that somehow there's some justifiable aspect to any of [Music] this journalists at Italy's public broadcaster R have gone on strike salaries and working conditions are part of it the bigger issue is political interference and the politician they accuse of that is prime minister Georgia Maloney Tarak NAFA is here with more well journalist at rise staged a walk out over what their Union called suffocating control by Georgia Malone's Administration and an attempt to turn the network into quote a mouthpiece for the government the journalist union says it wants to stop political appointments in key editorial roles as well as the censoring of voices and stories that do not fit with the ruling coalition's far-right agenda it's common for governments in Italy to appoint loyalists to top jobs at Ry but since she took office in 2022 Maloney's perceived interference in the broadcaster has led some high-profile presenters and managers to quit this latest showdown between rise staff and the government goes back to April 25th Italy's Liberation day when a prominent author Antonio scurati was scheduled toer an anti-fascist monologue but just hours before the show was meant to air scurati was informed by Ry that his appearance had been cancelled for what the newspaper laua later revealed were quote editorial reasons scara's words were eventually read out by host at R Serena Borton in an act of solidarity for scurati and many others in Italy the whole Affair was a blatant Act of censorship one that fits into a wider pattern from Malone's government which is trying to remake the media as well as cultural institutions in its own political image journalists at the public broadcaster speaking off the Record say that for this government Ry is a symbol of the so-called dictatorship of the left they think if they control the media they will change the cultural narrative in Italy thanks T India is halfway through an election process a voting Marathon that lasts 6 weeks calling an election historic is a bit of a cliche but this one really does qualify should the ruling BJP and prime minister Narendra Modi win it would be the first Indian government to win elections back to back to back with three terms in office so the BJP is throwing all it can at this campaign Mod's face is everywhere there's been an avalanche of BJP advertising and then there are India's mainstream media Outlets the overwhelming majority of which are prooi the potential spanner in the works is the messaging from a collection of YouTubers putting out explainers critiques and interviews all questioning the bjp's otherwise dominant narrative many are journalists who gave up mainstream newsrooms for places in the online ecosystem Akash bannery is one of them he has 4 million followers and his videos are racking up the views Akash banery joins us now from New Delhi Mr banery on the surface this election looks like a done deal give us a sense of what Narendra Mod's appeal to the Indian electorate is built on well um to begin with I wouldn't say that it's all done and dusted um Indian elections tend to be remarkably unpredictable while Modi is definitely far up ahead things change very rapidly in Indian politics you see the Prime Minister a lot less confident you see him going back to his old tricks um so therefore I wouldn't say it's done and dusted a lot of modi's charm Charisma appeal comes from the fact is that people really find themselves attracted to this man who seems to be in control whether or not he is whether the data suggest that it's a separate issue this is politics so that is the charm which unfortunately for the opposition no one comes even close to so those people who are not very happy with Narendra Modi at this point of time they're not happy maybe what has happened 10 years after his rule fine he's the only guy around to vote for among the people unhappy with Mod's rule is the country's largest minority its Muslim population over the years Modi has left some of the ugly talk to his proxies on that but recently in this campaign he's been a little bit more vocal and some of the things he's come out with like this next bit uh sound a little bit dangerous so how do you explain this change of tack by Modi the fact he's a little more direct these days that is the question if if there was one question to be asked regardless of who wins who loses this election the one question to ask is what really happened remember as you pointed out Narendra Modi himself doesn't do the dog whistling he has enough and more people to do the dog whistling some Brazen calls to violence some hints of genocide being dropped here and there and suddenly after the first phase of election you see this man come back uh into his old role somewhere down the line the BJP has understood that the campaign of progress that India is on the right track India has developed people have more money is not really going to work and therefore harking back to the fear psychosis of the people majority versus minority 80% versus 20% these 20% are going to expand they're going to take away your space your political space they'll become the Prime Minister etc etc the sad truth here is that this tactic has never failed Narendra Modi it has always yielded him good electoral results so the so what he's doing he's doing fully aware of what he's doing and it may just work also for him we cannot discuss politics in India without talking about the mainstream media you used to work in that sphere you've since gone independent talk to us about how media in India has been transformed in the period of Narendra Mod's rule when I joined uh television uh media in 2004 2005 and the there was a prora of new television channels that were coming in television was on a high uh it was the aspirational job to be in and I thank my stars that I quit in 2012 because what has happened after 2014 is that the gradual takeover of mainstream media has happened uh by the BJP and there is a term minology also that is used for the mainstream media in India which is called GOI media is basically a media that sits in the lap of those in power and what has happened is that that media has really allowed Narendra Modi to take on a force which is much larger than him um you can imagine him as a senior of a family where his decision should not be criticized so no idea that he can come up with can be a bad idea every idea is a good idea and if it fails it's it's it's the implementation so the media really has allowed for the dumbing down of the political discourse uh and questioning of the opposition rather than the questioning of the government in power well you fled the mainstream media space you've succeeded you now have one of the country's most popular YouTube channels as a YouTuber does pressure still land on you in some ways walk us through that world so there are two levels of pressure uh I think the easier level of pressure uh is the direct level of pressure uh so for example trolling in India is an industry where you have people literally sitting on rows and rows of computer and doing work for a political party uh and of course uh the BJP really have the largest online social presence and saying anything against the establishment will really result in voluminous uh and really toxic abuse then comes the soft pressure uh in terms of people reaching out to you telling you subtly uh what are you doing why are you just asking questions to the government why don't you ask questions to the opposition um and and subtle hints would be dropped your way is that do watch out uh uh you may have trouble coming your way so that's a fear that one lives in I mean somebody asks me uh what's your business plan and I jokingly tell them it's to stay out of prison uh that's the plan um the worst of the pressure indirect pressure that's going to come in very soon are the kind of regulations that are being brought into effect already we have the new it regulations which basically can allow the government to pull down any YouTube channel Twitter handle based on National Security interest on top of that you have a new broadcast bill which will basically give the government a lot more Powers over even YouTube channels if the government or any of the citizens are not happy with any report that we do they can write to us and we are Duty bound to answer within 24 hours so technically they can bury Us in paperwork with 500 complaints on a day it's using the law against the people who are trying to uh maintain the Constitution trying to speak out for laws and values and using that very same law against them when we discuss politics in India we do tend to let audiences off the hook we don't really hold audiences accountable for the material that they seem so ready and eager to consume what has the success of Modi and the BJP revealed about how gullible or perhaps ideologically right-wing Indian news audiences really are do you buy that um that's one of the saddest Parts actually um I I I come from a generation of television that was degenerating then I come from this last 10 years of watching television and I always had seen um uh the silent spectator the viewer who earlier used to say oh what is going going on on Indian television oh this noise this hate that is going on in Indian television had I had an opportunity of watching something else I would have the Prime Minister has complete and remarkable Clarity on issues it's only after doing independent journalism doing a YouTube channel after so many years one gets to understand is those were just excuses nobody wants to watch sensible news nobody wants to watch just the facts the fact is that while the government is pressurizing mainstream media owning mainstream media people also love watching this kind of V bigoted content otherwise these channels would have gone out of business what the mainstream media what the government has been able to do is to tap in into that deep rooted bigotry that people have within them exploit it enable it and embolden people to go ahead and then speak out what was inside them their hearts so the fierce psychosis is is being played full on and this election will show us just how much fear uh you can inject into people aash bannery thank you so much for taking the time and walking us through the politics and the coverage of the Indian election thank you for speaking to us today here at the listening post thanks for having me over and finally last week we reported on the campus protest movement in the US including at Colombia University in New York where students and faculty were demonstrating against Israel's war on Gaza that same school hands out pullitzer prizes one of the most prestigious Awards in American journalism and when it announced its list of winners this past week one organization stuck out the award for international reporting went to the New York Times for its quote wide- ranging and revelatory coverage of hamas's attacks on October 7th and Israel's devastating response the paper W despite multiple issues that audiences have raised over the times's coverage of God questions over terminology emphasis and an Institutional pro-israel bias typified by a now notorious investigation that accused Hamas of using systemic rape on October 7th co-written by a former Israeli intelligence officer with zero journalistic experience that article was thoroughly debunked and got all kinds of push back in the times's own Newsroom but that's award-winning journalism in America the days we'll see you next time here at the listening post
