world content creators influencers they have multiple titles but these are the people who rule powerful algorithms and have millions following their Trends initially seen as prin Setters in lifestyle and entertainment influencers are increasingly playing a significant role in shaping public opinion their ability to reach millions of followers in a short time give them a unique platform to disseminate information raise awareness and sometimes even shape the narrative some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias to push their own personal agenda to control exactly what people think this is extremely dangerous to our democracy majority of you are very easy to manipulate social media is dramatically transformed how we receive and perceive information about wars and conflicts with real time unfiltered updates becoming Norm this has been particularly evident since the Arab Spring when the phrase emerged that this revolution won't be televised but tweeted it marked a pivotal change on how conflicts are reported and followed showing social media is no longer a tool only for communications but also one for mobilization as social media has evolved it's been joined by platforms like Snapchat Instagram and Tik Tok adding New Dimensions to how Wars are perceived documented and shared even US president hopefuls are paying heed on even blanket bans on apps such as Tik Tok we really do need to ban Tik Tok once and for all the war in Gaza is a clear example of this new social media Dynamic one which we'll explore over the next half hour bombing Hospital okay now tell them there's an Escape Route South to Egypt attention Palestinians head south to Egypt okay now bomb the Escape Route Nicole and rathborne talk to eler they say for the heart of hearing you have to shout the loudest and for the people who are unable to see you have to draw big figures what you do is taking war and misery and turning it into something funny let's start with you rwan why do you do it well uh I think first of all I have a spine and I understand basic moral principles and I think that it's a pretty cut and dry uh issue a pretty pretty obvious thing that's happening in Gaza and I want to use um you know my knowledge my whatever skills or talents I might possess to call attention to what's happening because it's awful Nicole you've been doing this for a while you do political satire uh why have you taken a real Focus onto what is happening in Gaza my reason is simple and I'm going to start by saying comedy is taken seriously when politics are a joke I'm saying this because when we do comedy and we're called unsensitive is a big and very large group of people that they don't know what's happening so satire and comedy makes them understand a little bit better about what we are trying to say that's a very good point that you touched upon insensitivity uh that's something that people think and especially when you talk about something a conflict which is so steeped in controversy where they're very uh you know opinionated sides on both ends uh how do you configure that this is insensitive and this is not because we're not referring I'm not referring to a public that already knows what's happening and for example we had a large conversation today by saying when something very sensitive is happening you cannot post comedy but I'm not talking to to a public that already knows the public who already knows supports my content but I'm having this kind of I'm calling them like snowflakes that they don't know what's happening outside and uh we have this generation that simply in Western World um they have no idea they live in a bubble so for them to understand any kind of very sensitive subject I have to come at them with a with a way to make them understand at least the humor or the jokes and eventually they will understand the the issue itself because I receive a lot of support from Arab countries but they know and they help my videos to have visibility but that's it's not my Target because I'm I'm speaking numbers and facts for example uh Spain a country that I I know very well uh it's divided in 20% people that know 20% people that they are afraid of speaking and 60% that they don't know how to put Palestine on the map right so you're connecting the Middle East to Europe r one you bring it to North America you've come here from New York and I see that you actually did did a did a skit on just walking in the street tell me how how did that idea came about and why did you do it uh yeah I come from the United States it's the global superpower I see it uh what's happening in Gaza as sort of sort of an outgrowth of us imperialism um and there's just a cartoonish sort of image of the Middle East in in America and um like Nicole you know I'm satirizing that and um so I think you're referring to me walking around in Doha and U sort of making it as if I'm seeing Hamas everywhere uh but that's sort of the image that you get from the Israeli propaganda system so I'm just sort of showcasing how silly that is and how idiotic it is it's not insensitive what we're doing what's insensitive is the atrocity that's happening we're merely calling attention to what's happening and we're trying to do it in a way like Nicole was saying we're trying to communicate these ideas we're trying to spread the message we want to be effective um we're we're going up against a you know a trillion dollar PR industry uh you know and we're trying to do that with uh with Tik Tok videos and I don't always do satirical stuff I mean even in this even in my satirical sketches there I like I I research them you know I try to you know impart a lot of education and history into the conflict that I don't think you're going to get from corporate media you know uh from Western media especially especially in the United States what was the response like because you reaching a demographic like Nicole said which doesn't know uh what's going on so how did people react to it because you you're seen as somebody who who does things that are funny and now you're changing gear and you're bringing something very serious into the equation see I don't see myself as like a comedian or or funny necessar neily I think there is some sort of humor in my personality and what I do but I I more so there's a seriousness behind it and it's meant to be educational you know I'm trying we're trying to combat propaganda uh so yeah I I received U mixed uh I mean any anytime you create something that's I guess a video that's sort of controversial you're going to get mixed reviews about it you know people want want me to stop or they want to they they issue death threats or or but a lot of people do get the message they do see what what I'm trying to do and and understand the truth in it and so I'm just sharing the message as best as I can and the people that's going to it's going to affect that's how it's going to affect them I mean I can't really say anything more about that about how it's going to be received I think a lot of people don't realize that doing a video on Tik Tok or YouTube or Facebook or Twitter would get you death death threats you you alluded to that are you is that a real issue are you seeing death threats does it affect you uh it doesn't affect me in in the sense that I'm going to stop or uh you know anything like that but uh yeah I mean I I get a lot of messages or emails uh or comments and I understand that you know if if people are indoctrinated uh by you know the us propaganda system for many years that they're going to not hear my message and and think well of it so uh but I think it's just part of it I mean so I just I don't I don't think it's I don't take it too seriously or too personally I guess I should say right and you've been receiving the same things right threats uh abuse and a lot of it why do you think that it is important for you to accept it and Carry On and why is it your work the work that you do is important if I don't have a passion for what I'm doing I cannot last in a trend by doing two three videos and just to feel good with myself if you have a passion you have to have um consistence and um you cannot see so many videos with butchered kids and so much blood and so much pain and not just go crazy so you need to have a passion in order to do this kind of content and you need to understand that after maybe crying because you see so much pain you have to uh go with your purpose and with your mission to make people understand and I'm not making only comedy it's a it's a political satire because when we're talking about Palestine and everything is happening we have to touch subjects like uh democracy and what democracy means and how customiz uh customized is um um according to the skin color to the rights to the country to the religion about the fake freedom I mean I'm European they say I'm free but if I protest for Palestine in Paris I get arrested if I speak against Israel because it they are committing genocide I'm I'm I'm speaking against the Jews and this narrative you cannot even imagine they say they're Democratic they have freedom they have the freedom to choose their own customized dictators because how can we think about the politics like diapers in Europe you have to change them and for the same reason so if you have the right and that power to choose your own politicians why don't you use the same power to be careful who you're choosing and their politics outside your the borders of your country so this is what I don't like they like to King Kong their chest that we're free we have democracy in Arab world people they don't understand they don't know they don't know that all the education the first alphabet came from Syria the oldest capital for example they don't my country Spain 800 years of Arabic domination of oma they left a culture behind and Europe when they went to other countries they left destruction and that's the difference so the two things that I want to touch on is that the words that you use you you repeatedly call it genocide one how did you reach that conclusion and two both of you talk about frustration from corporate media is that frustration only in the people of your age group of your backgrounds or are you seeing that in a wider audience which might be a lot younger and who's using the social media a lot more than than than the older generation my reference to corporate media is just the fact that they are uh completely invested in serving their constituents and those constituents are not the people of countries uh they're not workingclass people they're you know Elites whatever you want to call them and they uh have a separate agenda and uh so we're we're battling that I mean they they don't want people to know the truth uh it's the Israel Hamas War it's not the genocide of the Gaza Strip or it's not the illegal occupation of uh perpetrated by Israel you'll never hear these phrases in Western media uh as far as I can tell i' haven't seen that but that's what it is I mean these people are being ethnically cleansed from their own land and yes are being genocided and um you know it's we feel hopeless we feel helpless but what can we do uh so I'm a teacher I'm a you know I feel like my skill set is to communicate and uh articulate ideas and spread messages and so that's what I'm that's what I'm doing what about the audience I'm I want I'm more interested in to see where do you think your message is reverberating with who is who's listening to it who's watching it who liking it and spreading it and where are you getting feedback from so ideally I mean for anybody who is in the business of getting their message across you'd want to hear back on well whether that message was received I don't really pay attention to those things I'm one you know I'm using a social media platform uh that is very popular uh this is what we have now uh and you know decades ago you didn't have content creators you didn't have singular influencers it was more important for media corporations to set the agenda but like they were saying earlier today it's like the influencers the content creators are now becoming more and more powerful in this age of social media where you can pick up your phone and you can become the media itself and I think that's a powerful tool and I want to use that to you know promote working class values and principles and to call out you know injustices social injustices I mean how many people in the world know that Israel did under international law Israel has no right to defend itself how many people know that you know Hamas is an armed resistance group struggling for human rights uh you know there's two social groups in question here one has human rights and one does not have human rights but Hamas is classified as a terrorist group by the European Union States Israel right because it's terrorism when poor vulnerable defenseless people try to fight back against a militant police state but when that when that rich militant police state bombs a defenseless population that's called democracy promotion you know there's it's just a double standard at all times I I don't know what to do except for saiz it you know um because that's that's what we can do I mean I don't so Nicole double standards and hypocrisy is is something that keeps coming up in these conversations we were sitting with you with a wider group earlier as well uh why do you think it is important to highlight it and paint it to the world as such uh and and why does it exist because people they don't want to see their own defects nobody wants to hear when I'm telling them that they have double standards or that they are cruel they don't have a heart or they don't have Humanity nobody wants to hear that nobody wants to hear the fact that I'm going to give you an example every time I go to a cinema I have this publicity before donate for people in Somalia or any other country they need food at the end of the movie Nobody donated anything because people they don't like to feel guilty and that's why uh on the contrary of um Andrew I really like to study my public because we live in a world where everybody wants to feel a victim nobody wants to be the villain and they constantly constantly need I mean we live in a world where I cannot say I I have to believe that God is nonbinary or I cannot say Merry Christmas because people feel offended I mean they are going on the streets with those things a very vulnerable and very sensitive Community if today they're not marching for the penguins in Antarctica for not having gluten-free bread and I have to teach those people they need a villain I don't have a problem in giving them a villain I don't I targeting them actually because if I go with emotions I'm going to feed that kind of um ego that they have everybody's emotional everybody's a victim well when you give them a villain who's telling them what's the issue in the world they're going to study what I'm talking about just to come at me and tell me you're wrong so actually I'm doing the same thing that Western media does so I'm making them very outraged because honestly um all the the phones got smarter and the people the other way around so the all those devices are really smart and we need to understand that those devices are made by by a human brain it cannot be smarter than us but you know are lazy and everybody likes to complain and everybody wants to have this syndrome of I'm a victim don't worry I can give you a villain but a villain who will tell you the truth I'm going to make you so outraged that you're going to come at me and you're going to study what I'm talking about just to contradict me but you're going to find out in a process that what I was telling was truth so this is actually the same thing that they were feeding us but the only difference that I'm not using fake news so it's good I'm actually proud that they are giving me good examples and when they try to uh ban to to shut us up to censor us I feel proud if they don't do this that means I'm not doing anything right we are not trying to shut down the Israeli propaganda no we are just laughing it it's it reached to a point to be funny we're not trying to shut them up no no come at us show us what what what more you can do so when they're trying to censor me that means I'm doing something great I'm not going to go being a victim no because I started I don't mind being the villain just for them to understand so yeah I study my public quite well let's talk about the tools that you use uh social media is ever expanding uh their new apps new avenues of uh of getting your message across but you are using one particular application which seems to be getting through also uh making a lot of people angry including the United States government which is talking about banning this particular app why is it and why is that particularly your choice of medium it's a good question I think what I've learned is that Tik Tok is a a very powerful editing software and it's highly engaging um and you know I don't know it's just it's it's the thing that people are using now and uh there's never been something kind of like that um but yeah I find that uh I don't know Tik Tok is just it's not like I was I always banned on Tik Tok I was releasing music videos and I was already uh they I was making like you know uh political songs and then they banned me and then I didn't like Tik Tok for for a while but then uh I just figured I'd start talking about it because that's sort of how the the app works you know it works better when you're you know looking at a camera and speaking and I I had no idea that I was going to catch on and I mean this is I'm the the page that I started is only a few months old you know but it's somehow you know my message was you know um became popular and I'm just kind of going with it and why do you think that that particular choice of medium is important for you or do you think that it is you have to use all of those platforms to get your message across I'm using all of them um I don't know if Tik Tok I mean uh has some political thing behind to support I mean it supported a lot but it banned also a lot so it's just uh funny to see politicians like Nikki Haley being so outrage and saying that one hour of Tik Tok is turning our teenagers 177% more radicals like why are you so scared I mean you have all the media you can fact check everything we can get banned because we don't have the facts like Al jazer can fact some something and they can prove is true I I'm just Nicole why are you so afraid of me and the masses are important it's the first time in a long time that a massive group of people especially how we call it the Gen Z generation the the new generation that they are speaking and then imagine the frustration of paid propaganda to be taken down by so many many teenagers because we know that they paid millions and billions in apps in Google in YouTube and actually I don't mind the territory if it's Instagram or Facebook or Twitter I I don't care I just do the same what I need to say because my soul is burning and just take it I translate I can translate in all the languages I know and just who wants to listen will listen but I I'm doing my job before I know exactly who I'm talking to and I know exactly who going to get hurt and people have to understand that when they talk about this uh war and this situation it's not only only about the conflict itself we cannot even call it the conflict I mean the hypocrisy in Europe oh Russia and Ukraine I I I hate any type of violence but there are two armies fighting we don't see two armies here we saw mosad in movies that they are very strong the best army nuclear weapons against who against who they have they're kids with rocks and and they they have Hamas that they don't have the same Weaponry so we cannot talk about the conflict so when you see all this oh all the if they have blue eyes and they're blonde come to Europe you're educated but no if they are Arabs oh careful and and that's the thing it doesn't matter how you send the message if you know exactly how to and you have to study the other side as well because they did a good job for a very long time my last question to you is not just to content creators but serious broadcasters as well the war in Gaza has gone on for weeks uh it's not because of the DAR of information it's because of the actions that are deliberately being taken are you making a difference and if you're not what's driving you what's driving me I mean like I said I it's it's just having a spine and having basic moral understandings having critical thinking and I guess you could say just a commitment to uh principles uh basic principles what about Unico I have to say that Western world really failed Palestine and I want to represent here the Western World by saying that I'm really sorry and I have to wash the scenes by saying that if we didn't do it until today or until 7th of October and we start doing this uh we have to apologize first and uh we have to we have to understand that if if you don't have a heart it it takes just a heart you don't need anything else you don't need religion you don't need politic views you don't need anything but a heart to understand those things so what drives me it's I had rage and now I have passion because I think most of the countries of the world they are ruled by Israel but Palestine we think we're free in Palestine when Palestine freed us and showed us what human value values we lack this is what happened actually they're suffering and they are dying but they liberated an entire world and that for me is the most important thing and it's not enough anymore for me it's not enough to hop on a trend and feel good and it's not enough not saying that there are big voices in this world and they're saying we're not obliged to talk yes you are we are seeing your movies we are buying your music we are calling you influencers we trust you so yes people are obliged to talk about those things because it only takes a heart so this is my message if I have to condemn something today I condemn people who are silent and I'm really sorry from Western world that we failed them for such a long time rathon and Nicole thank you very much for talking to alday thank you thank you for having
