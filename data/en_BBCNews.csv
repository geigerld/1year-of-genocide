93WDYXl8658,Israel strikes southern Lebanon as Hezbollah leader condemns fatal device attacks | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel strikes southern Lebanon as Hezbollah leader condemns fatal device attacks  BBC News.jpg,"hello and welcome to today's verified
live the Hezbollah leader Hassan nasala
has given his first public response to
two days of attacks in Lebanon using
sabotage communication devices he
described the attacks as an
unprecedented blow to the Iran backed
militant group but vowed to continue to
fight Israel the number of people killed
by exploding pages and walkie-talkies
has risen to 37 with over 3,000 people
wounded the Hezbollah leader said the
operation CR C all red
lines thousands of pages were targeted
by the Israeli enemy and detonated at
the same
time with this operation the enemy
crossed all rules laws and red
lines he didn't care about anything at
all not morally not humanely not
legally let's go live to Beirut live to
our correspondent Hugo Bea Hugo you
listen to the entirety of that give me
your
analysis yeah I think it was very
interesting that he acknowledged that
this was a massive security blow
unprecedented uh in the history of uh
Hezbollah uh and uh as expected uh he
promised a harsh punishment uh but he
didn't give any indication of how this
response is going to be but I think it
was also interesting that uh there was
no change uh in hezbollah's position
again the indication is that Hezbollah
is not interested in an escalation in
this conflict with Israel we've seen
that uh for almost a year Hezbollah has
been attacking uh positions in Northern
Israel saying that this is in solidarity
with Palestinians in Gaza Hassan azraa
again said that this campaign these
attacks are going to continue unless
there is a ceasefire uh in Gaza so this
has been the main hope here to
deescalate the distinctions between
Israel and Hezbollah and those
negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza
have been unable to reach a deal uh
Hassan nazala also reflected on uh those
decisions that have been taken by the
Israeli authorities to add the return of
those residents who've been displaced
from communities in Northern Israel uh
as one of the war goals he said that uh
these um attempts by Israel will not
succeed and again that these attacks by
Hezbollah are going to to continue so no
clear indication of what Hezbollah is
going to do again has expected some
harsh words against Israel saying that
these attacks that happened here uh in
Lebanon amounted to a declaration of war
he said it was a massacre uh and again
uh reflecting on the suffering of the
population here over the last two days
Hugo as you were talking there we were
showing pictures of those Israeli jets
that screamed really low over Beirut
earlier at the start part of that speech
you've been there in the city over the
last couple of days I was talking to
someone from Beirut only in the last
hour who was saying how different the
last 48 hours have felt there what has
it been
like exactly and it has been different
because we've seen that this conflict
has been by and large contained to areas
along the border between Lebanon and and
Israel and now what's happened in the
last two days is that this conflict has
been felt by the population here of
Beirut and other parts of Lebanon and
obviously people here are scared they're
very angry as well uh because of the
extent of these attacks these are
explosions that happened as people were
shopping were uh with their families at
home children are among the dead um uh
but again uh these are explosions that
happened uh across the country and
including in several parts here of
Beirut creating Panic uh in the
population one of our producers received
a message from a friend saying that she
was uh replacing her Lebanese seam card
with an international one because he was
concerned that her phone could explode
so I think this gives you a sense of the
feeling here of how scared uh the
population is after those uh two days of
attacks you go live for us there in
Beirut thanks very much let's continue
with this with our chief International
correspondent Lee duet who's here with
me
leas it was fascinating listening to the
different stages of nasan HZ talking
there how weakened is Hezbollah do you
think well of course he put on a very
brave face today saying that their
Communications Network had not been
shattered but from everything that we
have seen and just the numbers alone uh
right across the country also in pagers
and walkie-talkies are exploding in also
in Syria and and in Iran it is clear
that their Communications nwor has been
crippled their confidence has been
struck um and also it you heard from
Hassan n that this was the most
devastating most humiliating blow
unprecedented uh for them so yes they
are in many many ways they are weakened
by it and the question will be they're
now the they will now feel HonorBound
and this is what we're hearing from
Hassan nasah he talked about a reckoning
they have to show that they are able and
willing uh to strike back and some of
our colleagues who follow his statements
really really closely are saying that
what's different in this speech this
time we've had many defiant speeches
from Hassan Nilla since the events of
October the 7th and throughout this
Rising tension along that Lebanese
Israeli border that he always says when
they're struck in the in the in the
aftermath we reserve the right to
respond at an appropriate time and place
this time he warned Israelis you will
not just hear the response you will see
it this time well that's interesting and
interesting that you pick out those
words what do you make of Israel's
strategy the sorts of decisions that
have been made over the last three days
adding a new war aim we saw that Sunday
night then talking about a new phase of
the war then moving troops to the North
of Israel yes there's been a steady drum
beat isn't there the eve of this uh what
has to be called a mass casualty attack
even though Israel says it has
pinpointed as you've been reporting
we've been reporting ever since they
happened they it was very discriminate
they went off in markets and Father's
hands when their children were close by
well just before that prime minister
Netanyahu in the security cabinet added
to their War aims the return of 60,000
Israelis from the communities along the
Lebanon border returning to them to
their homes they have been living as
displaced people ever since these
tensions started rising in October then
we had the pager account whether that
was coincidence or not there's a growing
view Matthew and I'm sure you've
reflected it on the program that it was
a kind of a use it or lose it moment as
is that some hisbah operatives
understood that something was wrong with
the system Israel had to use this weapon
um in other words or else they would not
would they would lose this kind of tool
and yet again today even with the
buzzing of the aircraft lower than ever
before there's this constant message
from Israel we know where you are and we
can get you even in your hands and only
in the last 10 15 minutes we've seen
Anthony Lincoln this time is in Paris
he's been shuffling around both the
region and other Western capitals again
asking pleading for deescalation but
every step is the the opposite of that
where is diplomacy do you think within
all of what we're seeing well Amos
Hawkin who is the envoy uh for President
Biden to work on the Lebanon front what
has been called since the beginning the
second front he was in Tel Aviv when
these tensions were ratcheted up when
they added this New Lebanon War aim uh
to to their their their list already the
the Gaza list including of course
bringing the hostages home Hassan n
today made it clear that the Border
would not be safe and calm that the
residents would not return home in the
North of Israel until there was a
ceasefire in Gaza that is the view of
Hezbollah that's the view of Iran the
only way to end this violence is to end
the Gaza War and yes Anthony blinkin is
continuing to shuttle going from he went
to Cairo to talk to the Egyptians who
played a leading role and there's a new
proposal on the table it doesn't seem as
though it's one that can be acceptable
to uh yes um to sinir from everything we
know about this most uh militant the
most uh even Hamas people describe as
the most violent in a violent
organization that he would not want to
leave the Gaza Strip but that offering
is now being put on the table it seems
from the reports that we've seen that in
exchange for releasing all of the
hostages that there would be so-called
safe passage for senoir and other Hamas
leaders to leave Gaza but there are many
who are saying that's just not the ilk
of Sino they're not going to leave I was
talking about Anthony lincol and the
message around Lebanon and deescalation
it's worth just playing that clip in the
next few seconds France and the United
States are united uh in calling for
restraint and urging DS alation uh when
it comes to the Middle East in general
uh and when it comes to Lebanon in
particular we continue to work to get a
ceasefire for Gaza over the finish line
and as we discussed uh with some of you
just a day ago uh in Egypt uh we believe
that remains uh both possible uh and
necessary but meanwhile uh we don't want
to see any escalatory actions by any
party that make that even more difficult
well it is an extremely difficult situ
ation at the moment for diplomacy a
final word leas because you have the
Iranians also watching they claim
retaliation yes they have unfinished
business according to them how dangerous
then is this moment that we've arrived
at this is the most dangerous moment
we've seen for decades in the Middle
East and a region that is all too often
plunged into this kind of a violence
there has never there have been many
sadly for people of the region many many
wars but there has never been this kind
of a war which draw draws in so many
players at the same time and so many
players willing to use whatever it takes
to get what they want to take Mr say",20240919
nzeRnUHmPwM,Hezbollah leader calls device attacks ‘a declaration of war’ | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hezbollah leader calls device attacks ‘a declaration of war’  BBC News.jpg,"hello and welcome to BBC News in the
last hour we've been monitoring a speech
from the Hezbollah leader Hassan nasrala
giving his first public response to two
days of attacks in Lebanon using
sabotage communication devices the
number of people killed has now risen to
37 with over 3,000 people wounded in a
moment or two I'll talk once again to
our security correspondent Frank Gardner
but let me tell you a little more about
what hezbollah's leader has been saying
because he accused Israel of been behind
behind that operation over the last
couple of days which he said crossed all
red
lines thousands of pages were targeted
by the Israeli enemy and detonated at
the same
time with this operation the enemy
crossed all rules laws and red
lines he didn't care about anything at
all not morally not humanely not
legally well that uh is still going on
we are monitoring that all the time with
our teams inside The Newsroom but Frank
Gardner our security corresp has been
with me through the last hour monitoring
what the hezb leader has been saying
worth just underlining hezb of course a
prescribed terrorist group by the UK Us
and other Western governments but what
have you picked out so far some of what
he says is true some of it isn't he said
our Command and control system is
undamaged oh yeah right it's absolutely
trash I mean they're in real trouble
they're reeling operationally from this
so they're in no position to fight a war
right now other than the low-level
exchange of far they're doing across the
border but where I think he's right is
where he says bring it on we welcome you
know an invasion by the Israeli Ground
Forces we will receive them here and
actually the last time Israeli Ground
Forces did go into Lebanon Southern
Lebanon in 2006 in a major offensive
they did get a bloody nose um it ended
in a very very
inconclusive uh sort of stalemate
essentially and Israel found Hezbollah
to be a much tougher nut to crack than
they thought um you know they had and I
said this in the last hour but they had
pre-positioned a lot of their anti-tank
devices they had some very powerful uh
russian-built cornet for example
anti-tank weapons uh mines that were
buried under the exact bit on the road
where they thought the Israeli tanks
would probably try and maneuver um so if
Israel does decide that it is going to
go full Tonto on this and do a fullscale
invasion of Southern Lebanon which will
be its third major incursion into that
country then in recent years then it
could be really quite painful for Israel
it's going to be very painful for
Lebanon if that happens um so what this
talk was about was not signaling here's
exactly what we're going to do here's
how we're going to fight back no it was
more of a pep talk it was rallying the
troops it was first of all paying
tribute to those uh First Responders and
emergency health workers who had rushed
to donate blood and to deal with the
wounded he uh hailed as heroes or their
Fighters who've been injured in this but
it was primarily saying we've had a
taken a big hit here we don't deny it
but we will be stronger from this we're
going to emerge more resilient and
actually don't underestimate the
resilience of organizations including
prescribed terrorist organizations like
Hezbollah and others to be able to
bounce back from things like this
because they hide amongst the people
This Is War amongst the people a and
he's repeated only again in the last few
minutes there'll be tough retribution
and just punishment for the blast we've
seen over the last couple of days I mean
Hezbollah sit there in Lebanon just
remind viewers I mean we've heard
comments and condemnation from the
Lebanese government in terms of the
civilians impacted by those explosions
how much influence control do they have
on the Lebanese government huge I mean
they are a political party as well I
mean it's very odd they are an anomaly
in the sense that they are both a
political party and a very much a part
of the fabric of Lebanese political life
alongside other parties Lebanon of
course is a multi-confessional
um country it's a it's a small place
where people speak French Arabic and
English you've got um Sunni Muslims Shia
Muslims and Hezbollah tend to be well
they are in fact entirely Shia Muslims
following the Shia branch of Islam and
you've got Drews you've got Christians
marinite Christians and so on you've got
all these different elements and so it's
been always a really difficult balancing
um act to try and keep the place on an
even Keel and of course they had a
horrific Civil War that lasted from 1975
till
1990 um and the fear now is that Lebanon
could once again be plunged back into
Warfare just as its economy is in a
really powerless State let's look at the
situation from the other direction your
assessment on the Israeli strategy
because of course it's a coalition
government we know that Benjamin
Netanyahu were extending the war aims
but under huge pressure from the far
right the extremist within his own
coalition government so in terms of
Israel's
strategy what do you discern from what
we've seen over the last couple of days
I think there may well be a bit of a gap
between what the military Chiefs want
and the security establishment on one
hand and necessarily what the
politicians want this is the mo let's be
clear about this this is the most
hard-right government in Israel's
history since 1948 the security minister
itamar bavier is um he's been convicted
of terrorism offenses he controls the
police um smotrich um is the um the
Finance Minister these people are very
much tied into the settler movement they
believe in not the West Bank and an
independent event ultimate State for the
Palestinians but this this is Judea and
Samaria and this is the god-given right
of the Jews to live there and they would
like to C they'd like to see the place
um cleansed as it were of um the
Palestinians who've been living there
for centuries so underlying all of this
all the stuff we're talking about here
in Lebanon and pages and Gaza and all
the rest of it underlying all of that is
this open running saw that the
Palestinians and this was brought to
light in the UN yesterday the
Palestinians want their own independent
contigous Homeland in West Bank with
East Jerusalem as their capital and most
of the International Community backed
them in that including Western
governments but it strongly resisted by
this government and Benjamin Netanyahu
the Israeli Prime Minister knows that if
he if he makes a deal that is against
the wishes of the far-right elements of
his government his Coalition will
collapse he'll have to call elections
and he will probably lose and many
people speculate that he will then end
up in court on corruption charges
possibly even facing jail that is the
backstory to what is going on at the
moment",20240919
vXrlq7A18S4,Fears grow of wider war as Israel sends more troops to Lebanon border | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Fears grow of wider war as Israel sends more troops to Lebanon border  BBC News.jpg,"Israel's defense minister says the
country is opening a new phase in the
war and the center of gravity is
Shifting to the north his warning came
hours after a second wave of blasts
swept across Lebanon exploding
walkie-talkies left at least 20 dead and
more than 450 injured yesterday hundreds
maybe thousands of electronic Pages used
by the armed group Hezbollah detonated
simultaneously killing at least 12 and
leaving more than 3,000 in hospital
tonight our security correspondent
Gordon Carrera looks at this new form of
technological Warfare I'll be talking to
our International editor Jeremy Bowen
amid grave fears this is about to
escalate across the Middle East today a
division of the Israeli Army has
relocated from Gaza to the North of
Israel reinforcing troops there well
let's go straight to Beirut now our
senior International correspondent Ola
garan is there
Ola so Sophie tonight we are in New
Territory this is a new phase of the war
Israel says so Hezbollah which is last
as a terrorist organization by the UK
and the US is also saying the same here
on the streets today in Beirut in the
Hezbollah stronghold of dahia we saw
fear and chaos and panic when reports
started coming in of a second wave of
explosions casualties were being rushed
away for treatment one young member of
Hezbollah said this is is a terrible
time for us we have never seen anything
like it we are encouraging our
supporters to get off the streets to go
home to try to stay safe now in the past
24 hours hezbollah's communication
networks have been Shattered by Israel
but it would be a mistake to say that
the organization is defeated far from it
it's promising revenge and we expect to
hear more about that tomorrow in a
speech by its leader Hassan Nala
Hezbollah coming to bury its dead in
South Beirut
today casualties of a new chapter in
Middle East Warfare killed not by air
strikes but by exploding pagers
apparently a message from
mosad among the dead an 11-year-old
boy but even the mourners weren't safe
suddenly the sound of another
blast chaos and panic filling the street
and a rush to evacuate one of the
Wounded the authorities say this time
walkie-talkies exploded not just in
Beirut here at a cell phone shop in the
southern city of
sidon Israel is being blamed for the
past 24 hours of unpr precedented
attacks well one more ambulance there
passing by we've been seeing them in the
last half an hour or so also fire
brigade trucks people have been looking
at the sky worried there are drones
they're beginning to leave the area to
get off the
streets the attacks began yesterday
afternoon with explosion ions in food
markets in homes in restaurants soon
casualties were streaming to hospitals
almost 3,000 wounded in an hour doctors
say many lost fingers and many were
blinded it has been a nightmare probably
this is the worst day of my life as a
physician unfortunately we were not able
to save a lot of eyes um I can tell you
that probably more than 60 to 70% of the
patients and ended up with with
eviscerating or removing at least one of
their eyes and we're talking about young
population about patients in their
20s from Israel no admission of
responsibility but the defense minister
yav Galant says a new phase of the war
is
starting Hezbollah which is Iranian
backed has been Waging War with Israel
since last October the two sides trade
in fire across their shared border over
the past 24 hours Hezbollah has been
shaken and humiliated but it's still
better armed than many
nations Israel too has plenty of
Firepower and today released this
footage of its troops training near the
Lebanese border A source told the BBC
that a second division of the army has
moved to the area there are growing
fears of allout war orar and BBC News
Beirut well these ongoing attacks have
stunned people in Lebanon and caused
widespread fear our security
correspondent Gordon Carrera has been
looking at this new form of
technological Warfare and he's with me
now nor Gordon these have been
extraordinary attacks taking
Communications devices people carry
around and turning them into weapons to
be used against them today handheld
radios walkie-talkies were exploding
suddenly in Lebanon this was what was
left of one of them it follows yesterday
afternoon when thousands were injured by
small explosions in people's hands and
Pockets this was the culprit a pager
which can receive text messages pages
and walkie-talkies are Old School
Technology but something Hezbollah
turned to recently because it feared its
mobile phones could be
tracked this map details the location of
injuries sustained in yesterday's attack
the vast majority in the capital Beirut
but how was it done today Washington
said it didn't know uh the United States
uh did not know about uh nor was it
involved in uh these incidents and we're
still Gathering uh the information and
Gathering the facts so what do we know
if we look at the debris of this pager
you can see part of a brand name here
it's gold Apollo now now that's a
company based all the way over here in
Taiwan the owners today said they'd not
made the pages involved though instead
they had licens making them to another
company called BAC Consulting now BAC
Consulting is based in The Bu Budapest
the capital of Hungary and the BBC's
Nick Thorp went to visit
today this is the registered address of
BAC Consulting here in Budapest and in
fact there's very little sign that
they're based here at all just a a piece
of paper with their name alongside 12
other company names behind the geraniums
very few people have been coming in and
out of this building all day no one
seems to know anything about this
company at all so this is debris left
from a pager after it exploded so Israel
looks to have intercepted the supply
this year of thousands of pages to
Hezbollah and here
tiny mounts of high explosive inside a
signal was then sent which meant 5
seconds after a pag of buzzed to say
there was a message it blew up something
similar may have happened with the
radios today supposedly Japanese made
they also arrived a few months ago but
why now one theory is that Israel's spy
agency Mossad had put in place the
capability to be used in the event of an
allout conflict in neighboring Lebanon
but has B became suspicious about the
pages and so mosad decided it was a case
of use it or lose it triggering first
the pages and then today the radios if
that's right then it's not quite clear
whether there is a wider plan behind
launching the attack it has sewn
confusion and fear and inflicted many
injuries but it may also spark a
response Sophie Gordon thank you well
our International editor Jeremy Bowen is
with me now it's almost exactly a year
since the October the 7th attacks how
dangerous a moment is this for the
Middle East I'd say really dangerous as
dangerous as any in the last Almost 12
months since those Hamas attacks which
by the way this last year has been the
most dangerous year since 1948 when
Israel fought and won for its
independence um why is it so dangerous
right now well that's because at the
moment there seems to be no possibility
of diplomacy getting through and D
escalating the situation that's because
it depends on a ceasefire in Gaza and
that isn't happening either now while
Israel has scored a really significant
tactical Victory here uh there is a
potential longer term serious strategic
downside because Israel has humiliated
its enemy in Lebanon there's no no
question about that but it doesn't get
Israel closer to its strategic aims the
things it wants to do that is to stop
the rocket fire over the border into
Israel 60,000 plus people have been
evacuated for almost a year from their
homes as a result of that they want to
go home and they want to push ESB as
well back away from the border I do not
see how these attacks get Israel closer
to that now Israel of course defends
itself self-defense against a a
terrorist organization is what it would
say uh but there are plenty of people
criticizing Israel as well for using
Force somewhat
indiscriminately as well as hitting
military targets those Hezbollah
Fighters also hitting members of their
family Killing Children Killing
bystanders in markets uh so Israel under
pressure with that and one more thing as
well uh the UN General Assembly is
sitting at the moment in New York and
there was a big vote today uh and by a
vote of 123 to4 with 43 abstentions uh
the general assembly supported a
Palestinian resolution saying that
Israel must end its unlawful presence in
the occupied territories within a year
it's non-binding but it shows just how
isolated the Israelis are",20240918
pNEb-dY3tRY,Hundreds of Hezbollah members reportedly injured by exploding pagers | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hundreds of Hezbollah members reportedly injured by exploding pagers  BBC News.jpg,"start with that breaking news from the
Middle East because hundreds of
Hezbollah Fighters have been injured by
their communication devices exploding
across Lebanon what's been described as
an unprecedented hostile act Iran's
ambassador to Lebanon is reported to
have been among those affected well let
me just show you the moment that one
pager exploded in a supermarket in
bayout there you see people rushing away
the explosion in the foreground
apparently it was in a bag been carried
by a man and that just one of the
locations and similar things have been
reported in so many different parts of
Lebanon in Beirut in southern Lebanon
other videos posted online show people
with injuries some of them really severe
ambulances have been seen rushing
through the southern suburbs of Beirut
to Hezbollah stronghold lebanon's Health
Ministry has called on staff to report
to hospitals and for people to donate
blood it said anyone with a pager should
immediately discarded unnamed security
officials say the pages were hacked by
Israel which hasn't commented Hezbollah
official called it the biggest security
breach suffered by the group well with
me in the studio is our security
correspondent Frank Gardner and Frank
these still the the early details of
this it was first being reported uh less
than two hours ago take me through first
of all what we know sure I mean it's
extraordinary this um almost
unprecedented I can't think of any case
where you've got a simultaneous almost
simultaneous explosion of so many
personal devices now these were not
mobile phones they were Pages which
sounds very 20th century but the reason
for that is that when the Gaza War uh or
conflict began after October 7th
massacre in southern Israel um an order
went out by hasbalah to its people not
to use mobile phones in case they were
sabotaged and the reason for that is
there's a bit of History here is that
back
in January 1996 somebody called Yahya
aesh who was known as El mandis the the
engineer he was the chief bomb maker for
Hamas and he was assassinated by shinb
Israeli intelligence with an exploding
mobile phone so people have always been
a bit wary of those and what H yet what
happened this afternoon was the almost
simultaneous detonation of these devices
these pages that had been used by
hundreds of Hezbollah not just Fighters
but Medics officials and others they
appear to have been tampered with at
some stage they've been ordered
relatively recently in some cases only
received with the last few days Israel
is not commenting on who might have been
behind it Frank before I ask you the
next question I want to put on the
screen again just that video of one of
the explosions because you were just
describing how there are so many blasts
and there you see it in the in the
foreground uh an explosion in a bag you
mentioned that it wasn't a mobile phone
it was Pages I'm reading here and it's
been quoted three security sources
talking to Reuters saying that the pages
uh that were detonated were the latest
model brought in by Hezbollah in recent
months so exactly as you're saying these
are all things that they had purchased
in the last few weeks yeah and that they
thought that they were doing the safest
option um interestingly these devices
are don't appear to be designed to be
lethal so they've they've um inflicted
some very n wounds some injuries on
people many of whom are in civilian
dress now they may or may not work for
Hezbollah they may be bystanders but you
know there's there are hundreds of
wounded have' been brought to hospitals
across Lebanon mainly in the southern
suburbs of dya in beut um but they are
for the most part low charge so you know
not packing enough to actually kill
somebody in the vast majority of cases
but to send a very strong message and
let's not forget that this comes on the
same day that Israel has extended its
War aims to include expelling Hezbollah
basically from the border so the low
grade ongoing conflict that Israel has
with Lebanon on the sou on that border
the joint border they've got has driven
roughly 60,000 Israelis away from their
homes and businesses on the Israeli side
of the Border a bigger number than that
on the Lebanese side hundreds of
casualties in total on both sides and
there's a lot of political pressure on
Israel's cabinet to deal with this once
and for all to deal with the problem of
Hezbollah firing rockets and drones and
missiles across that border they want to
push Hezbollah north of What's called
the Lani river which is technically at
the end of the 2006 War that's where it
was supposed to have stayed but they've
crept South and that's why there is this
ongoing exchange of fire Frank before I
ask you the next question let me just
show you the live pictures from one of
those medical centers that
we have pictures coming into us from
bayroot because large amounts of people
around one of those Hospital centers
there you can see just scores of people
waiting I suppose for updates and some
of the injured being taken to Medical
establishments like that now it is being
reported by reuter that Iran's
ambassador to Lebanon is one of those
injured you were making the point in
terms of the whole backdrop to this but
the fear has always been about a wider
war between Hezbollah and Israel
alongside that war that's already going
on with Hamas in Gaza this adds to all
of those fears doesn't it it does and
remember that uh it wasn't that long ago
on I think it was July the 30th that
Israel admitted assassinating somebody
called f shukar in the southern suburbs
very close to where most of this is
concentrated Southern subur was a beut
and he was a senior commander in
Hezbollah he was assassinated with a
Precision drone strike that hit him in a
building Israel um openly admitted it
that was followed of course a day later
by the assassination of Ismael hania in
Teran which Israel has not uh owned up
to but everybody assumes it was them he
was the political leader of Hamas so
after that hasbalah vowed Revenge um the
have there was a sort of flurry of
rockets from Hezbollah and Hezbollah
after that said right score settled for
now um this I think regardless of the
fact that Israel hasn't commented on it
is going to be laid at the door of shinb
or mosad Israel's intelligence agencies
Hezbollah will expect to demand some
kind of retaliation some sort of Revenge
um and Iran of course will probably
support them at least verbally and
diplomatically uh and possibly even with
Supply further weapons because Hezbollah
are the most powerful non-state military
force in the Middle East they are a
force to be reckoned with they've got a
massive arsenal of rockets which is sort
of poised should they choose to launch
them at Israel now the retaliation would
decimate Lebanon the Lebanese are saying
please don't our economy is on Dar State
we're on our knees please don't up the
war with Israel anymore than it is
already but that's why it's a very
febrile tense atmosphere and you're
right something like this could tip it
over the edge Frank Gardner thanks very

w1V9YrsK9QY,UN Gaza aid chief: World is failing innocent civilians | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\UN Gaza aid chief World is failing innocent civilians  BBC News.jpg,"the un's most senior official overseeing
Aid and reconstruction in Gaza has said
the world is failing innocent civilians
there after nearly a year of War ZD KARK
has been addressing the UN Security
Council and she described her assessment
of the ongr situation in Gaza as somber
and dark I can tell you every day that
passes life in Gaza is unlivable the
risks are high disease is uh
continuously at risk of outbreak
children are not in school people are
living in tents this is not the Gaza of
before the 7th of October it is Hell on
Earth so every day that passes impacts
people's
lives well let's speak to George morera
D Silva the executive director of un Ops
that's the UN Agency for projects and
services he's also the under Secretary
of the under Secretary General of the
United Nations and was at that session
that we played a bit of just now at the
United Nations today thanks very much
for joining us here on BBC News a really
Stark assessment there from your
colleague sigd describing Gaza as hell
on Earth uh we've been covering the
situation on uh BBC for close to a year
we speak to Aid agencies we speak to
people on the ground um what do you
think needs to change Beyond of course
calls from many organizations for a
ceasefire
thank you for um inviting me I I went
with Sig we both went to the security
Council today and de brief the the the
Council on the situation in in Gaza and
we were very clear about what is really
needed we need a ceasefire we need
humanitarian law to be fully respected
we need unimpeded access to Aid to those
most in it um but now we we're also able
to to show that what we have been asked
to do we delivered as you may recall uh
some months ago the security Council
decided to call for the creation of a
mechanism to facilitate the
operationalization of Aid into Gaza to
overcome the bottlenecks the delays the
redundancies the multiple inspections
and unops uh uh with the with the senior
coordinator for uh humanitarian Aid and
reconstruction in Gaza we work together
finding a solution that deliver results
today at the secret Council i' I've I've
been able to to brief members on the
fact that through this mechanism with
One Stop Shop uh database to approve all
Aid and also with the monitors on the
ground to speed up delivery we were able
to have all the The Crossings and all
the corridors to togethera being uh uh
operating in a smoother and swiftly uh
manner but at the same time it's very
clear that this is not about logistics
we may fix everything outside Gaza to
have uh less transloading less
inspections uh smoother operations um
better coordination more producti
ability at the end of the day if things
inside Gaza doesn't improve there is no
possibility to reach those most in need
um some people watching this might say
well that's all very well intended the
goal to try and have mechanism to try
and get more help and Aid into Gaza but
the very fact of the matter is that
that's not happening and it's politics
only really that can change
that yes it's political will it's
precisely the topic do you really
believe that you and sigd can change the
mood at the UN when it hasn't changed
for months on
end at least we removed other excuses or
pretexts because Logistics uh were uh
presented very often as an issue now
there is no no excuse um the the
mechanism is functioning uh in a well
manner so now it's very clear that the
problem is inside Gaza and it's not just
about DEC conflicting it's also about
these incidents that are not accidents
are incidents with un uh uh convoys
being targeted uh with a with a no
capacity to operate in in safe
conditions with humanitarians that have
lost their lives including a colleague
of mine from my agency yobs so this is
the moment where the political will
needs to Prevail
it's the moment where uh
um it's it's fundamental to to ensure
that uh we put in place our best
political and diplomatic capacities to
overcome this situation and George I
wanted to ask you about this because
Sigrid um actually on her visit to
Israel did meet senior Israeli officials
including the Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu what did she say about that
conversation um and does she believe
that anything may have changed as a
consequence of that
chat Sig has has managed to engage at
the political level with all parties in
the in the region and this has been an
important element to ensure uh that we
would have um always the chance to
engage and to better understand uh the
each other's position now we have more
data to reveal that issues need to be
fixed again through political will you
remember uh I came to to to to BBC and
other occasions that we were not knowing
exactly uh the rational for rejection of
materials for dual use now you go to our
database and you know exactly uh how
much Consignments have been approved how
many have been requested how many have
been rejected and why for instance from
the rejected Consignments out of the 37
Consignments that have been rejected 31
was just for the fact that it was
through unra so the fact that unra is a
consigner or a cons is a reason
to stop this so now everyone is more
accountable so you can ask the questions
with the data and with the facts okay
thank you very much for explaining some
of the work that you're doing um that's

and Donald Trump have attended a
Memorial in New York on the 23rd
anniversary of the 911 attacks it was a
much more somber Affair after last
night's head-to-head TV debate ahead of
the election in November there were
insults and a stream of personal attacks
and they sparred on issues including
abortion foreign policy and the economy
both sides claim victory after the
90-minute debate watched by more than 57
million people from Philadelphia is our
North America editor Sarah
Smith at a September the 11th memorial
service it was Donald Trump who
orchestrated a cordial greeting this
morning quite a contrast no camela
Harris striding across the stage last
night to demand a handshake from a
reluctant Mr Trump see you have fun
thank you it was contentious and
ill-tempered with both candidates in
attack mode stop with the continuous
lying about this stuff what she says is
an absolute lie yet again I said it at
the beginning of this debate you're
going to hear a bunch of Lies coming
from this fell excuse me I have to
respond another lie this former
prosecutor had come prepared to push his
buttons people start leaving his rallies
early out of exhaustion and boredom
provoking an unsubstantiated rant about
illegal migrants in Ohio in Springfield
they're eating the dogs the people that
came in they're eating the cats they're
eating they're eating the pets of the
people that live there just watch both
their faces he is clearly bristling with
barely contained frustration she's
enjoying mocking and laughing at him but
deadly serious when attacking him on
abortion rights the government and
Donald Trump certainly should not be
telling a woman what to do with her body
I have Miss Harris said she would try to
reinstate the right to have an abortion
but her vice presidential pick says
abortion in the ninth month is
absolutely fine he also says EX
execution after birth it's an execution
no a claim so outrageously untrue one of
the debate moderators had to step in
there is no state in this country where
it is legal to kill a baby after it's
born a fluster Donald Trump relied
repeatedly on attacking the current
administration's record on immigration
why are we allowing these millions of
people to come through on the southern
border how come she's not doing it
Democrats here say they are very happy
with how KLA Harris managed to keep
Donald Trump on the defensive going
after him hard getting under his skin
and leaving him looking angry and
rattled so flustered he made an
unexpected personal appearance to try
and spin his own verdict I say the truth
if I lose votes or gain votes I don't
care but uh this was my best debate I
thought it was very good I thought she
was very weak on foreign policy she was
very weak On the
Border at the same time a confident
Harris campaign immediately suggested a
second debate next month she wants it
because she lost do you have an answer
well I don't know I have to think about
it but if you won the debate I sort of
think maybe I shouldn't do it why should
I do another debate and we will win post
debate celebrations in the Harris Camp
were capped by a huge celebrity
endorsement as Taylor Swift declared
after watching that event she'll be
voting for kamla
[Applause]
Harris Sarah Smith BBC News
Philadelphia well as you saw there were
plenty of claims and counter claims our
analysis editor rosak kins was watching
the debate from Washington and has been
factchecking some of them Donald Trump
says the TV debate was rigged his
supporters are saying it was three
against one because the two moderators
fat checked him more than kamla Harris
but he said much more that wasn't true
immigrants in the City of Springfield
Ohio are eating the dogs eating the cats
they're eating the pets of the people
that live there the moderators
highlighted that ABC had contacted a
city official who had debunked this
claim and BBC verifier has also been
told there's no credible reports or
specific claims of pets being harmed
injured or abused by individuals within
the Immigrant community in total Trump
was fact checked or clarified five times
KLA Harris not once despite making such
claims as Donald Trump left us the worst
unemployment since the Great depression
that's not true in 2021 When Donald
Trump left Office Unemployment was at
6.4% in 2009 it was 10% on abortion
Harris said if Donald Trump were to be
reelected he will sign a National
Abortion B that's misleading Donald
Trump says he'll leave the states to
decide their positions and if these
statements went unchecked so did many
others by Donald Trump on immigration he
claimed we have millions of people
pouring into our country from prisons
and jails from mental institutions and
insane asylums this is not supported by
available evidence during one attack on
Biden and Harris Trump claimed we have
inflation like very few people have ever
seen before probably the worst in our
nation's history that's not true
inflation in the US peaked at 99.1% in
June 2022 and it's been above 9% at
various points in US history so claims
went unchecked others were challenged
and this was different to the Biden
Trump debate in June when CNN decided
not to fact check during the debate
though it did
afterwards this is another illustration
of how ever since Trump ran in 2016 the
media has wrestled with how to respond
to the volume of false and misleading
claims that he
makes in this debate both candidates
made statements that require correction
but Trump did so more than Harris it's
not biased or rigged to point this out
rakins there well our North America
editor Sarah Smith joins us now the
polls have certainly shifted since
President Biden decided not to run again
just how tight is this election
looking well the poll suggests that it
is still absolutely neck and neck so
although CA Harris today is feeling
confident after putting in a strong
performance that does not mean she is
assured a victory in November because
consider this there are only 8 weeks to
go until the election but it was just 8
weeks ago that the last presidential
election saw Joe Biden's candidacy
destroyed clearly a lot can happen in
that short period of time last night did
give voters a chance to see both of
these candidates head-to-head for the
first time they could compare
temperament and demeanor but they were a
bit short changed on policy detail and
as we keep saying because it's true this
election will be decided by very slim
majorities in just a very small number
of those key swing States Sarah Smith
our North America editor thank you and
you can hear plenty more on that debate
on the latest americast podcast it is
available now on BBC sounds",20240911

facilities being used by uh Iran and uh
Iranian supported proxies uh such as

main group in this Alliance of of
factions across the Middle East
supported by Iran the so-called axes of

goals here in this campaign is to try to
disrupt uh this uh infrastructure that

happened yesterday was one of the most
intense uh attack so far Reports say
that one of those locations hit was a

facilities or facilities being used by
Iran uh it said these were Iranian uh
these were Syrian uh sites uh and they
also describ these attacks as as a
criminal act by Israel now as you said
there wasn't any reaction from uh Israel
Israel uh rarely reacts to these reports
of strikes inside uh Syria but again I
think this shows you know how tense
these relations between Israel and Iran
uh has Spain uh remember that back in
April the Iranian diplomatic compound in
the Syrian Capital Damascus was hit a
number of senior Iranian military
officers were killed Iran then
retaliated with an unprecedented missile
and drone attack on Israel and most
recently in July the Hamas political

the Israeli military was believed to
have been behind this uh killing uh

projectiles being fired from both
directions across the border well let's

we broke in the past hour about that
shooting yes this truck driver had uh
driven towards the king Hussein Bridge
alen be border crossing as it's also
known and he'd opened fire after leaping
out of his truck with a gun he opened
fire on uh Security Forces there and he'
killed he killed three civilians now
they were described as civilians there
also apparently according to the Israeli
ad Ministry uh they are actually um
security private security people who
were shot dead uh the uh border crossing
as you mentioned has now been closed on
both sides um and uh so nothing will be
passing through there for a while and
the truck is being searched for the
possibility that there may be explosives
and then therefore further Carnage on
the way and how much does the uh
exchange of fire overnight between uh
Israel and Hezbollah add to concerns
around tension escalating in the
region well it's continued concern
really because there have been these
exchanges now since the beginning of the
war in Gaza but they've intensified
lately and August saw the biggest number
the biggest monthly number uh s across
the border uh of course in both
directions too because there were more
than 50 were fired by Hezbollah in
Lebanon uh early this morning and Israel
also uh fired quite a few missiles
rockets at uh at Lebanon to knock out
rocket launch sites um and apparently
yesterday uh three uh emergency workers
who've been trying to put out fires
caused by these projectiles um were
killed but it's going to add to tensions
because the speed are very large is
really operation in the West Bank for
more than a week that only recently
stopped in Janine uh leaving at least 39
people dead and this is fueling concern
that if it if it carries on spiraling
this violence you know we could see
something uh not that far distant from
the awful events happening in Gaza yes
it adds to tensions and perhaps also
adds to the pressure on the Israeli
government because of course we've been
uh hearing of increasing levels of
protests just bring us the latest on

protest and uh during that protest uh it
reached a stage where the Israeli forces
fired it's what I would to say with two
shots and one of those shots uh hit uh
Mesi in the head and uh she was taken to
hospital H where she later died the IDF
say that they are reviewing this
incident uh they say that shots were
fired against what they called uh a man
who was
instigating uh Violence by throwing
rocks uh the organization which which
has run this protest denied that it was
violent in any way and said that uh Mesi
was 200 meters away from the police from
the soldiers when this happened so
either way you know there will be
different accounts of what happened uh
but clearly a young American woman with
Turkish Origins um has died uh as a
result of this incident okay and and
like you said she is a jeel national
what's Washington what comments have
Washington made on this
incident well the Americans so far have
said that they think it's a deeply
disturbing killing uh that's the the
message from the white house uh they've
also said that they've asked the
Israelis to um investigate the United
Nations have called for a full
investigation and the family uh have
asked they say that an Israeli
investigation would not be adequate to
use their language they say they have
asked uh President Biden to order a full
independent an investigation to try and
get to the bottom of precisely what what
happened because you know people die
very frequently in the West Bank as a
result of shootings between clashes
between both sides uh and sometimes
there are investigations sometimes there
are not and it is often very very hard
to get to the bottom of precisely what
happened and the problem here is that
any kind of so-called independent
investigation is going to have to rely
on the acquiescence of the Israeli
authorities and that's not always
forthcoming and there has been a
significant amount of increase uh
increase in violence in the West Bank uh
James just just talk us through the
latest
developments Well the West Bank is an
incredibly violent place and has been
ever since uh hamas's attack uh on
Israel in October 7th last year well
over 600 almost almost 700 Palestinians
now have died in the West Bank so not in
Gaza in the West Bank as a result of
violence much of it involving clashes
between Israeli settlers uh and
Palestinians clashes that are quite
often ignored beted by Israeli forces in
the West Bank uh and it is a source of
huge concern in Western capitals and
amongst diplomats that the West Bank
violence spirals out of control and
triggers uh another Uprising some
diplomats talk about maybe another front
in a war which began on the 7th of
October but has long spread outside of
gaza's borders and so that is the fear
here that is why Western capitals the
United Kingdom the United States and
others keep putting sanctions on Israeli
settlers who they believe are conducting
illegal operations and they are putting
pressure on the Israeli government to do
more to restrain these settlers who do
not have the full support in any way of
Israeli Society but whom the is at the
moment the Israeli government led by
Benjamin Netanyahu depends on their
support and that's why violence like
this continues in the West Bank James

by a Jewish settler

his aggressive actions against
Palestinians
frequently captured in mobile phone
footage filmed by peace
activists since the war in razza began
locals say Moshe is responsible for
forcing families including theas to
leave the Hamra area but Moshe paints a
different picture of his presence here
he is part of a movement to expand
Israeli territory that began decades
ago in
1967 following a war with its Arab
neighbors Israel occupied the West Bank
and Raza not long after Israelis began
establishing settlements in the occupied
Palestinian territories claiming a
historical and religious connection to
the Land There are now more more than
140 Urban settlements across the West
Bank where more than half a million
Jewish settlers live amongst three
million Palestinians but Moses shavit's
Farm is different it's what's known as a
hering
Outpost it gives settlers access to vast
areas of land which has led to Violent
confrontations with Palestinian
communities
most of the settlers in the West Bank
are Israeli citizens which pay taxes do
their uh military service and are low
Keepers citizens okay they don't break
the low AI Mizrahi is a former head of
the Israeli Army in the West Bank
whenever you put outposts illegally in
the area it brings stands with the
Palestinians that are living in the same
area most Urban settlements have been
approved by Israel's government and are
legal under Israeli law but outposts
like Moshe shavitz don't have government
approval and are therefore illegal under
Israeli law many are subject to
demolition orders but these are rarely
carried out the UN says both settlements
and outposts are illegal under
international law

this while Ultra nationalist settlers
were once at the fringes of Israeli
politics today they hold key positions
in prime minister netanyahu's coalition
government
their political rise has been a boost to
extremist settlers living in

establish new outposts all over the west

announced um some sanctions against um
violent settlement who were carrying out
criminal acts in the West Bank Moshe
shavit was one of the settlers
sanctioned by the UK and later the US
and the EU for violence and harassment
against
Palestinians just weeks after the
measures were announced a local camera
crew filmed an open day at his
farm speaking candidly Moshe lays out
the strategy behind his Outpost
a key body supporting settlers is the
world Zionist organization or
wzo it's been around for more than a
century and was instrumental in the
establishment of the state of Israel in
1948 one of its ski departments is the
settlement division which describes
itself as an arm of the Israeli State
it's a body which runs very very very
big part of a land which had been
expropriated by the Israeli authorities
in the West Bank to different Israeli
settleman or settlers the settlement
division doesn't publish details about
its individual dealings with
settlers but contracts obtained by the
settlement Watchdog pieace now help us
understand
more they show how the settlement
division allocates large areas of land
for grazing and farming throughout the
West
Bank but the contracts forbid the
building of any
structures one of them is for an area we
know well
Hamra what you see here you can see this
is the contract between the W Zoo yeah
and a settler which we hide his name and
you can see this is the area which was
allocated to him the red stains on the
map
yeah this is here this is where we are
right now there's only one settler here
in the area where the her this is M the
name in the document is redacted we
cannot be sure if it's mus shit's
contract but the date matches when he
arrived in the
area but we have also found evidence of
the wzo allocating land to two other
settlers that have set up illegal
outposts and who've later been
sanctioned
internationally Israel doesn't publish
official figures for the number of
illegal outposts but the BBC has
analyzed data on outposts from settler
Watchdogs organizations and the
Palestinian Authority verifying each
location using satellite imagery social
media posts and Israeli government
Publications we have independently
verified that almost 200 illegal
outposts have been established in the
last 30 years almost half of them since
2019 the un's top court has said all

there is a gate there's a gate as far as
we're going to get we want to speak with

ahead of its targets for polio
vaccinations day three of a mass
campaign and so far has inoculated about
a quarter of the children under the age
of 10 the program began over the weekend
it will take place in three locations
Gaza City Rafa and then in the north of
the strip with localized ceasefires
being arranged Dr harinda Silva is a
doctor working for UK Med it's a one of
the UK's medical NOS he's in Gaza and
he's been deeply involved with the polio
vac program thank you very much for
coming on I mean we've been talking
about the challenge of reaching
traumatized children getting them to
come forward with their families are you
encouraged actually by the progress
you've made in in recent
days I I am very encouraged actually and
it's very surprising with how the health
system is set up here in terms of the
destruction of Water Sanitation hygiene
Etc and the ability to move freely over
the past three days we've vaccinated
1600 children and it's going
fantastically well I'm hoping tomorrow
is our last day here at our type one
clinic and we'll have more children
vaccinated by the end of that day I'm
looking at these pictures of the
children coming forward when you see
them face to face how do they appear to
you how do they
present so it's a range of things um
unfortunately most of the children here
are malnourished um very thin some are
stunted depending on the age they are
and again it's just the look of
destitution as well which is quite
shocking and tragic when you see it when
you see children up close and and most
of the children that we see have skin
conditions uh unfortunately because of
the destruction of Water Sanitation
hygiene so we're looking at cases of
Scabies very bad impo and fungal
infections as well the work you're doing
obviously relies on this8 hour pause in
the fighting uh in the specific areas
where you're working has it been
strictly
observed so what we've seen at the two
um field hospitals that UK Med runs our
operations have been working as normal
and uh for us so we're very grateful
that we're able to get the football in
being able to send our community
engagement team out to bring children
and uh speak to the families and get
them to bring their children to the
vaccination Center that we're running at
the moment 2.8 million people in Gaza um
anyone of any age unvaccinated can
contract the disease are you satisfied
that the wider population is
protected it's it's very difficult to
see there was always before um this
conflict started it was vaccination
acceptance so um there was 99% and the
uh population has dropped down to
89% and
obviously with the unvaccinated
population who have been born throughout
this conflict that's and the younger
children I'm hoping that the 95% vaccine

of the polio virus will be met Dr harena

Middle East and Benjamin Netanyahu says
that the UK's decision to suspend some
armed sales to Israel is shameful
posting on X the Israeli Prime Minister
said the decision will not change
Israel's determination to defeat Hamas
adding that Britain's misguided decision
will only embolden Hamas he said Israel
is pursuing a just war with just means
he added with or without British arms
Israel will win this war the UK
suspended 30 out of 350 arms export
licenses to Israel saying there is a
clear risk the equipment could be used
to commit serious violations of
international law it follows a review by
the foreign secretary David Lamy who
says the government had a legal duty to
review all export licenses a foreign
Office document outlines the government
assessment that informed this move and
it focuses on three key factors
humanitarian saying Israel has not
fulfilled its duties to ensure essential
supplies get to people in Gaza with
insufficient levels of aid treatment of
detail
with a government assessment saying
there have been credible claims of the
mistreatment of detainees and conduct of
hostilities saying it's not possible to
reach a judgment on allegations about
Israel's conduct due to mass casualties
and difficulties in getting reliable
information from Gaza well UK arms sales
amount to just 1% of Israel's defense
Imports amounting to around 42 million
pounds in 2022 the suspended licenses
affect equipment like parts for fighter
jets helicopter Ops and drones the UK
defense secretary says the move won't
have a material impact on Israel's
security and insists the UK remains a
staunch Ally our determination to stand
with Israel to be part of the collective
defense if they come under direct attack
again as they have done before remains
Resolute and
absolute well Britain's Chief Rabbi is
amongst those who have criticized this
decision ifra mvy said on X it Beggars
belief the British government a close
strategic Ally of Israel has announced a
partial suspension of arms licenses he
added sadly this announcement will serve
to encourage our shared
enemies well I'm joined Now by Sir Alan
Duncan a former member of Parliament and
UK government advisor member of the
conservative party of course uh when in
active in politics um so Alan Duncan
thanks for being with us what's your
response to this um Announcement by the
British government uh not so much an
advisor as a former foreign minister
actually but doesn't that doesn't matter
too much uh I think uh the government
has got this absolutely right indeed I'm
surprised that it wasn't done a long
time ago uh under the conservative
government uh beforehand um I think
probably what has happened is that the
advice the legal advice inside the
foreign office and the department of
trade is so clear uh that they cannot
legally continue with some of these arms
exports to Israel and given what's
happening with the use of arms I think
this is a a proper thing to do anyway
because I think that Israel is out of
control I think that its response to
October the 7th has been utterly
excessive and
indefensible uh and so I think this is
the right decision and I hope that all
leadership contenders for the
conservative party will confirm that
they adhere to international law and
therefore agree with this
decision do you think it goes far enough
because obviously you're you're you're a
known um you've known been known
politically here in the UK for um not
being fully supportive of of everything
that Israel has done I mean how far do
you think the UK government should be
going yeah well I think they should go
further and more than that I'm I'm quite
a serious critic of what the uh Israelis
have done I think their conduct has been
despicable for a long time I mean this
is much more than about the excessive uh
activity in Gaza where we now see over
40,000 uh deaths many of them children
women and the complete destruction of
their habitable space I mean what
they've also been doing in the meantime
and I think there's been insufficient uh
International condemnation this is they
have raised their activity of
colonization on the West Bank so what
you have is massive settler violence uh
supported by the Israeli Defense Force
uh which is why I think there is an
added element to the illegality of what
Israel is doing that on the west bank
they are taking over their neighboring
country's land and what you have is
settler violence they're armed uh
they're bashing up Palestinians whose
rightful land it is and doing so with
the support of the IDF which means that
to all intents and purposes you have
state-backed terrorism in the West
Bank many would say that that your
position politically effectively plays
into the hands of Iran and withdraws
support for a key UK Ally which is
important for you know British national
security I don't think that argument
holds one jot I think what really
matters is a defense of international
law and I think I would suggest that
whenever you are interviewing anybody uh
including the chief Rabbi to say do you
agree that un resolutions which say that
uh West Bank settlements are illegal uh
mean that indeed they are illegal and if
they don't accept international law
you've got to throw back the question
well who then is the
extremist okay so D we will leave it
there thank you very much indeed for
joining us",20240903

netan who has asked for forgiveness from
Israelis for not being able to bring
back alive the six hostages who were
found dead in Gaza on Saturday we were
very close he said we were nearly there
in a televised address he remain defiant
in his demand that Israeli troops must
continue to control the Philadelphia
Corridor in south of Gaza something
Hamas has rejected Corridor along the
Egypt Gaza border has emerged as a
primary sticking
in ceasefire talks he said it's a
Lifeline for Hamas their oxygen and it
will determine Israel's future let's
hear some of what he said I am begging
for your forgiveness that we did not
succeed bringing them home alive we were
very close nearly
there and I would like to repeat once
again this
evening Israel will not move onto our
normal
agenda after that Massacre Hamas will
pay a very heavy price for it the war
against this axis of Evil in this
specific war against
Hamas the first crack and of course that
doesn't bring about a deal whatsoever
but the first crack was when we went
into ravak and we took over the
Philadelphia Corridor and and the RAF um
trans Transit point because that was
literally their way they actually could
breathe and their oxygen they were
hoping that Iran or hisbah would come
and save them now that they're hoping
that International pressure would
now extricate them from that situation
but the only effective change that would
be enabled would be if we hold on to the
Philadelphia Corridor and not vacate it
not evacuate it because once we leave it
we'll never be able to go back so that's
a taste a sense of what Netanyahu was
saying in that address just in the last
90 minutes 2 hours or so a little
earlier President Biden said that a
final deal for a ceasefire and the
release of hostages held in Gaza is very
close to being presented to Israel and
Hamas by mediators but he told reporters
he did not think that the Israeli Prime
Minister was doing enough to secure an
agreement Biden spoke to reporters as he
arrived at the White House to meet us
negotiators let's have a listen you
planning to present a final hostage deal
for the uh both sides this week we're
very close to that what makes you think
that this deal will be successful in a
way that the other deals were
not hope friends Eternal Mr President if
do you think it's time for p prime
minister Netanyahu to do more on this
issue do you think he's doing enough no
Mr President so that last answer there
The crucial one is he doing enough no
answered President Biden well let's take
you to Israel itself now because there
has been plenty of criticism uh by many
thousands of people in Israel at well
aimed at uh prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu these are the live pictures
from Jerusalem people out on the streets
urging uh their leader to do more to
bring the hostages home there have been
protests on the streets of Jerusalem
similarly large prot protests in Tel
Aviv as well happening right now they
were taking place actually on the
streets as Benjamin netan who was
holding that televised address well a
little earlier a strike went ahead today
until a court ordered people to end it
and returned to work the Nationwide
industrial action caused flight delays
and also hit medical centers schools and
businesses our Middle East correspondent
Lucy Williamson
reports Israel's protesters and their
prime minister are old
acquaintances calls for a hostage deal
have brought long established opponents
onto the streets but the shooting of six
hostages in a Gaza tunnel last week has
broadened this movement they say and the
mass demonstrations in Tel Aviv last
night were a turning point I think the
news of the six hostages the fact that
they were
alive and murdered
right before they could have been saved
that broke it after last night's Mass
protests people are back on the streets
again there are growing public and
political demands on Israel's prime
minister to make a deal but Benjamin
Netanyahu protected by his parliamentary
majority isn't
listening but then much of the country
isn't
protesting the one-day general strike
today largely unobserved even in left
leaning Tel
Aviv a Court ruled that the strike was
political and ended
it these protests are part of the well
established opposition to Israel's prime
minister analysts say and so far little
threat to him I think that
netan knows better than I do the best
thing is to let it uh play as a safety
valve to do some V ation and let people
say we hate you you are
murderer uh enough is
enough two of the protest most vocal
activists not in the street today but in
the cemetery the parents of Hostage hsh
Goldberg pollen burying their son for 23
years I was privileged to have the most
stunning honor to be hersh's
Mama I'll take it and say thank you I
just wish it had been for
longer tonight in Jerusalem the
demonstrations began again Mr Netanyahu
is used to opposition on the street but
he's also facing demands from the US
president and his own defense minister
those demands may be harder to ignore
Lucy Williamson BBC News
Jerusalem let's speak now to Aaron David
Miller Senior fellow the carnegi
Endowment for International Peace Think
Tank he's previously been an adviser on
Arab Israeli negotiations to both
Republican and Democratic
administrations thank you for coming on
the program thanks for having me so can
I ask you about that pressure on prime
minister Netanyahu from people in his
own country out on the streets yet again
right now and from the US president uh
there Joe Biden what's your assessment
of his position you know it's a rare
combination you now have massive public
protests on the streets you have the
Israeli Minister of Defense openly
charging uh in during a time of War at a
cabinet meeting uh that the prime
minister is advocating his moral
responsibility and failing to make a
choice you either have the Philadelphia
Corridor or you can free the hostage and
you have some pressure from the
administration but I have to say that
the reason we we are where we are is
because in negotiations
only when two parties believe that there
is urgency to close when the advantages
of closing the deal outweigh the
disadvantages of keeping it open to have
an agreement and within the last three
days you've seen a demonstration the
absence of urgency number one the
decision by Hamas who issued
instructions presumably that on the
approach of IDF soldiers keeping in mind
the Israeli operation to free hostages
in nro in central
Gaza um that they were to be
killed that act in my judgment has
created enormous room for Benjamin met
netan to maneuver and it's constricted
the room and the margin for pressure
from the Biden Administration the second
act was Nan's uh press conference today
in which he turned the Philadelphia
Corridor literally into the full Crum of
Western civilization and the only the
only alternative there's no alternative
but is really control in order to beat
the and he referred to it three times
the access Access of Evil summoning up a
a a quote from um former President
George W bush in a speech in the wake of
911 so I think this these two leaders
are simply unwilling they are able but
they are unwilling to make the kind
of arrangements and concessions
necessary to even get a phase one deal
which I still continue to believe is
doable but well I you you've laid out
there pretty clearly and without a great
deal of optimism but I'm going to ask
anyway you heard President Biden saying
he you know thinks a a deal ready to put
to negotiators on both sides is pretty
close when you hear that it sounds like
given the position that the leaders have
put them M themselves in you don't think
there's much chance of it actually
happening anytime soon I think if the
administration puts this last chance
final proposal on the
table unless barring some fundamental
11th hour change of heart it seems to me
they're going to get the administration
is going to get at best a yes but and if
the administration believes this is
truly the last chance and they do get a
yes butt what do the administration
going to do stop negotiating stop
engaging I've seen this movie in
negotiations many times you should only
put a final proposal on the
table uh and if in fact the parties uh
are not prepared to accept it you need
to be serious about walking away and
frankly I don't think the Biden
Administration in in the next 70 days in
anticipation of one of the most
consequential elections in modern
American history has the luxury or
option of walking away we are in a
negotiators called the saac with no easy
or quick way out president said Hope
Springs Eternal Aon David Miller we must
leave it there but um really appreciate
us for you well you lending us your
expertise and insight in those
negotiations thank you one final
significant update from this afternoon
the UK foreign secretary David Lamy
announced a partial suspension of arms
Sports to Israel this is after a review
Into the country's compliance with
international law when taking military
action in Gaza let's take a listen the
assessment I have received leaves me
unable to conclude anything other than
that for certain UK arms exports to
Israel there does exist a clear risk
that they might be used to commit or
facilitate a serious violation of
international humanitarian
law I have informed my right honorable
friend the business and trade secretary
and he is therefore today announcing the
suspension of around 30 from a total of
approximately
350 to Israel as required under the
export controls act let's speak to our
political correspondent Harry Farley in
Westminster Harry good to see you so we
should put this in some kind of context
I suppose the UK isn't a a great
exporter to Israel in this regard and it
isn't a complete ban or anything like
that but politically talk us through the
significance here yes that's right leis
you it's important to make those points
it's not an arms embargo it's not a a
complete ban on weapons exports you
heard David Lamy Lamy the foreign
secretary there saying you know it's
about 30 of 350 existing licenses but as
you
say uh politically this is a very
sensitive issue for the labor party the
governing party here in the UK because
they lost several seats they would have
otherwise been have been expected to win
in the general election earlier this
year to candidates independent
candidates largely standing on uh LA Pro
Gaza tickets particularly campaigning on
that issue now interestingly since David
Lamy was speaking just a few hours ago
the government has published a summary
of how it made that decision to suspend
some arms licenses and crucially it says
that it's not simply based on Israel's
conduct in Gaza it says despite the mass
mass casualties of the conflict in Gaza
it has not been possible to reach a
determinative judgment on the
allegations regarding Israel's conduct
of hostilities but rather this decision
is based on two par two other factors
humanitarian the assessment that the
government has done is that Israel has
not done enough has not done all that it
could to allow humanitarian Aid into
civilians in Gaza and also the
assessment or the summary of the
assessment that the government has
published says there have been credible
claims of mistreatment of detainees and
the volume and consistency of these
allegations suggest at least some
instances of mistreatment contrary to
international human humanitarian law so
the decision is been has been based on
that concern about treatment of
detainees and on the concern about the
not enough humanitarian Aid getting
through into Gaza not simply based on
Israel's uh conduct in Gaza Harry thank
you very much for talking us through
that",20240902

news regarding the Middle East because
the UK foreign secretary has just
announced a partial suspension of export
arms licenses to Israel he made that
announcement in the House of Commons in
the last 20 minutes or so a partial
suspension it covers 30 arms export
licenses uh we will play you the clip of
David Lamy making that announcement in
the comment here in the next little
while but more pressure clearly on
Israel and the Prime Minister we've seen
those comments in the last hour or so
from Joe Biden saying Benjamin Netanyahu
is not doing enough to actually secure
that new hostage and ceasefire deal now
the UK foreign secretary making this
announcement and of course all the while
today we've had that general strike with
thousands of people on the streets
adding yet more pressure on Israel's
prime minister well as I said that
announcement just made in the last
little while from David Lamy so let's
hear him speaking there in the British
House of
Commons it is with regret that I inform
the house today the assessment I have
received leaves me unable to conclude
anything other than that for certain UK
arms exports to Israel there does exist
a clear risk that they might be used to
commit or facilitate a serious violation
of international humanitarian

350 to Israel as required under the

equipment that we assess is for use in
the current conflict in
Gaza such as in important components
which go into military aircraft
including fighter aircraft helicopters
and drones as well as items which
facilitate ground targeting and for
transparency this government is
publishing a summary of our assessment

have stopped work and schools and
businesses across Israel have been hit
by a nationwide strike and protests
people are demanding that the government
secure the return of hostages still held
by Hamas the one-day strike was called
by the Trade union Federation histadrut
a court ordered the strike must end
around half an hour ago with organizers
saying workers had been ordered back to
work these latest protests began after
the bodies of six hostages were found in
a tunnel beneath Rafa in southern Gaza
the Israel Defense Forces say they were
killed shortly before troops reached
them on Saturday one of those found was
American Israeli hsh Goldberg pollen in
Jerusalem where people are holding a
procession from his home to the cemetery
where he will be buried uh we are seeing
evidence of the outpouring of uh feeling
that the government must do something to
secure the release of other hostages
well the impact of strikes uh aren't yet
isn't yet fully clear uh as we mentioned
flights have been delayed and diverted
at Israel's main airport benor and as
part of that action but several cities
and municipalities said they wouldn't
take part and the government said the
strike was
political uh it is affecting businesses
Banks and government Ministries and some
elementary and middle schools closed
earlier uh closed early while hospitals
and health clinics are running at a
reduced capacity major bus companies are
also taking part in action with roads
blocked by protesters Sunday night saw
tens of thousands of people protesting
across Israel calling for a hostage
release deal some accus prime Min
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
government of not doing enough to bring
home those taken by Hamas it's not clear
how many hostages remain in Gaza Hamas
kidnapped 251 people and killed 1,00
others during its attack on October the
7th the Israeli military responded with
a ground and air offensive aiming to
destroy Hamas more than
40,700 people have been killed in Gaza
since then according to the Hamas run
Health Ministry well let's speak now to
our Middle East bureau chief Joe floto
who joins me from Jerusalem and Joe I
just wonder with the uh labor Court
ruling supposed to have taken effect a
short time ago ordering people uh to
stop their strike action what's actually
happening on the streets
look I think it's fair to say that this
strike while it was widespread and uh
affected pretty well every municipality
in the country was not as devastating as
those protesters really wanted last
night was undoubtedly a massive show of
grief and anger directed at the
government for not having concluded a
deal and one of the biggest protests
ever to take place in this country I
think uh but this morning we haven't
seen that momentum continue to the agree
that people would have wanted and as
such there's a question about how much
political pressure that is going to put
be putting on the government yeah that
is a key key question isn't it Joe how
much pressure does it put on will it
lead to some sort of change in in in
policy but I do see here that the
hostages and missing families Forum has
announced several more protests to take
place across Israel later on
today yeah they're determined to keep
this going and they're angry
as we saw last night is palpable
obviously uh the first degree of shock
and and condemnation goes to Hamas
that's a given for having uh murdered
the hostages under its care but many
people not all but many people in this
country feel that after nearly 11 months
of this conflict the government should
have done more to have concluded a deal
now the Prime Minister here says very
clearly the fact that these hostages
were killed shows that Hamas doesn't
want to deal and he is determined to
continue to what he calls total Victory
but several people within his own
Administration some of the hostage
negotiators who've been speaking
anonymously and other people within his
office say that he himself uh is trying
to block a deal that would leave Hamas
in any way
intact and because of that we're still
11 months into this conflict without a
hostage negotiation and without the
hundred or so who remain inside G are
both alive and dead on the Israeli side
being
released Joe thank you very much for
that Joe
floto and udie gorin is the cousin of
tal hamay who was killed on the 7th of
October and his body taken by Hamas Mr
Goran gave me his reaction to the
protests and strike as far as we're
concerned we the labor the labor Court
can decide whether we protest or whether
we strike or not I think it it really
does um uphold only to the unions and so
forth um and other businesses that
choose to abide by the court but I think
at this point in time when there is a
true very strong sentiment and I think
noga has put it very well there's a very
strong sentiment among the Israeli
public that this government does not
represent the vast majority of the
public in its decision not to have um
not to have a deal that would bring the
hostage is back then at this point I
think we are allowed to to do what we
think is right in order to do what is
right and that is saving people's lives
and udy you're joining us straight from
those protests give our viewers a sense
of what it feels like to be in the midst
of that today I'm actually joining you
right now from the knesset from the
Israeli Parliament where we hostage
families come every week to speak in the
different committees and speak to the
parliament members directly and try to
you know break some of these
um alliances that noga has describe and
influence the the the ministers and the
Parliament members this way and later on
there will be uh first of all there's
another funeral today we've had six
funerals in the past two days of the
hostages that were just murdered three
days ago and uh from the from the
funeral I'll be going to another protest
later tonight in front of the Prime
Minister in
home obviously we have reported on many
many protests by relatives of the
hostages and and the bereaved indeed uh
it hasn't caused the government so far
to change its Position will the action
today change that do you think I don't
think there's one specific action that
would change their mind I think that the
main thing is persistence and that is
true to any public campaign it's
persistence it's believing in what's
right it's believing in what we're doing
and I think that after 11 months of uh
of this war which is the longest Israel
has ever had and at this point where we
know where the divides are between
Israel and Hamas in terms of the deal
and we know that these gaps can be
bridged then we need to be saying this
over and over again and when I say we
it's not just the families we is the
Israeli public we is the foreign
governments that have to do with this
conflict that have influence over the
Israeli government that have influence
over Kamas we should all be saying
enough is enough we need to end this war
we need to save people's lives we need
to bring the hostages back and bring
some alleviation to the Gans and make
sure that we have an agreement that
secures Israel's future and make sure
that that October 7th does not happen
all over again and that has to do with a
regional uh with a regional deal that
would keep Israel safe and on the other
hand that we start building Gaza because
the gazans are also suffering
tremendously at this point in time and
the fates of these two people have been
linked for ages now and it's more
obvious than ever at this point in time

families of Israeli hostages are holding
a general strike to press the government
to reach a deal to free those still held
by Hamas it's already been inflicting
some flights on benorian airports in Tel
Aviv and businesses schools and other
forms of Transport have also been hit
well the stoppage is a day after the
Israeli Army said it had recovered the
bodies of six hostages who were taken
during the attacks of the 7th of October
that led to mass demonstrations in
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Sunday with
the organizers calling on the Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to negotiate
a deal with Hamas to bring home the
estimated 100 remaining hostages
Sunday's protests were largely peaceful
but some crowds broke through police
lines blocking a major highway in Tel
Aviv while our correspondent John nson
is following the story after the biggest
protests in Israel since the start of
the war in Gaza with hundreds of
thousands of people demonstrating across
the country today A general strike so
thousands of businesses are going to be
closed some schools universities
government Ministries Banks uh some bus
uh networks uh so we're expecting a
major hit on the economy here today in
Israel and the outrage against Hamas is
a given but these protests are not about
that these protests are against the
government of prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu who is accused of pursuing his
own personal political Ambitions and his
survival uh in in sacrifice of a hostage
release and ceasefire deal in Gaza Mr
Netanyahu insists that the best way to
get the remaining hostages out of Gaza
is to keep applying military pressure on
Hamas however many many many people in
Israel don't feel that way including
some of the hostage families they have
accused Mr Netanyahu of having the blood
of their loved ones on his hands there
were chance of murderer at last night's
uh protest and it's not just the public
it is also within his own government so
we've had reports in the last week of a
shouting match between the Prime
Minister and his defense minister yev
Galant uh who says that in effect Mr
Netanyahu is blocking this deal with
Hamas that the world's diplomats have
been pursuing now for weeks and months
as I say Mr Netanyahu up to now has re
has rejected that pressure and he says
that it is Hamas who are the murderers
and that they will be pursued and
punished John donison there our
correspondent let's speak to the former
conservative MP aliser Bert also served
as minister of State for the Middle East
thank you very much for being with us um
when we look at events in Israel with
these protests today um what political
effect do you think that might
have the scale of the protest is
certainly
unprecedented there's been thousands of
people demonstrating regularly against
prime minister Netanyahu firstly for uh
internal political reasons and then sort
of post October the 7th lately in terms
of his handling of the of the crisis but
the scale of the protest the vment of it
and the sense that the prime minister's
strategy after October the 7th of
seeking total victory of the elimination
of Hamas and the recovery of the
hostages has proved to be a failure
because it was impossible he was advised
that you couldn't do both uh and that
advice has been borne out by experience
and the circumstances of the murders of
the six hostages that have been reported
have just increased the the the anguish
of uh many of the population of Israel
that's what we've seen whether it will
change breson netanyahu's policy is
difficult to estimate because he is
trapped by some in his cabinet who do
not want him to make a deal with Hamas
those the extreme rightwing ministers
and he himself has set set on a course
where he can only succeed by delivering
what he has already promised even if
it's impossible so it's very hard to say
what the immediate impact on the
politics will be and you know even if he
was to be swayed by what these protests
when activists say that they want a
Hamas hostage deal have they spot out
exactly what they're prepared to concede
for
that hostage families and friends in
Israel that I've spoken to and many
people have said they just want the
hostage back the terms of the deal are
of less consequence at present than
physically returning those hostages that
are still alive and sadly the remains of
those who are not and the desperation
was evident in the faces uh and the
comments of the families over the
weekend the assumption is it will be a
deal for the return of Palestinian
prisoners being held by uh by Israelis
both on the West Bank and elsewhere um
but the actual terms of the deal seem to
matter less to people protesting than
just the desperation to get the hostages
back and they feel strongly that the
priority that should be allocated to
getting the hostages back has not been
the priority of prime minister Netanyahu
and the government hence the vence of
the demonstrations and the anger of
Defense Minister y Gallant of the way in
which the Coalition is handling the
crisis at present and O it's obvious as
to why s family and friends of the
hostages will absolutely prioritize that
but the government also has to to
balance the future security of Israel as
it sees
it that is right but everything since
October the 6 has changed it would
appear that the security of the state of
Israel which prime minister Netanyahu
and his supporters had predicated on
dividing the Palestinian leadership
Community supporting habas covertly in
Gaza preventing the establishment of a
Palestinian state has fallen apart uh
and the anger in Israel is directed at
the failure of that overall political
security policy as well as the atrocity
that took place on October the 7th for
which Hamas Bears complete
responsibility so the wider security of
Israel is indeed uh in in question now
and that calls for a different political
solution which will require Israel to
think of U an overall settlement which
will involve the West Bank East
Jerusalem as well as Gaza and it will
require the abandonment of those who
believe that the extinction the state of
Israel is still possible so a lot of
political changes necessary in order to
secure the peace and security of Israel
to which it is entitled as well as the
self-determination of the Palestinian
people and justice for them it is not
impossible and negotiations have always
faltered when they've got very difficult
but if there was ever a time to press
the case it's now aliser Bert thank you
very much indeed for being with us",20240902

dying they said as a direct result of
the prime minister's failure to sign a
deal outside Mr netanyahu's office today
they've been shouting murderer many
people here think he simply doesn't want
a deal and if a deal is no longer
possible they say then the hostages are
no longer valuable to Hamas hostages do
not return When guns are
shooting the region does not go quiet
for the time necessary to return
hostages when guns are
shooting the irony is that fighting did
stop in central areas of Gaza today for

paused the fighting since

named them as Israelis Alexander lobanov

called his death tragic and
reprehensible saying Hamas leaders will
pay for their crimes the missing
families Forum has again urged Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
agree to a ceasefire for the release of
the remaining hostages elsewhere three
Israelis have died after their vehicle
was fired on near the city of Hebron in
the occupied West Bank well with me now
is Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic uh
Muhammad let's start first of all with
the news of the bodies of six hostages
that have been found what more do we
know about the operation in order to be
able to find them and recover those
bodies so the operation was to secure
just a tunnel where the Israeli forces
found an alive hostage last week aladi a
bedwin hostage so the Israeli forces was
just trying to clear the tunnel and they
found the bodies there so they didn't go
there upon uh and intelligence
information or something they just found
them while they are searching the tunnel
so the circumstances around the killing
so uh the Israeli there is exchange of
of accusations the Israeli Army saying
that Hamas kill killed them
intentionally and the Israeli Prime
Minister Benyamin Netanyahu just issued
a a statement a few minutes ago saying
that we will continue to free all
hostages and Israel will not
rest until we reach the killers means
you know he's int inciting that the
military operation in Gaza would
continue but Hamas issued also a
statement and they said uh that they
were killed in an Israeli shelling and
they said that what they described as as
practicing genocide in Gaza and the
support of President Biden to Israel as
they said is the cause of the death of
these hostages so there is this exchange
of accusation between two parties and
how much does this add pressure on to
the Prime Minister we heard there uh the
comment from the hostages families Forum
they've also said that uh prime minister
Benjamin netan should take
responsibility for abandoning the
hostages indeed today is a big day for
Israel in Israel as the is Sunday as
everybody came from the Sabbath we saw
in the evening last evening a big
demonstration asking the uh prime
minister Netanyahu to strike a deal
there is a call by
the families of the hostages to for a
general strike in in in Israel there is
already strike in the secondary school
there supposed to start today and it did
not uh start and they are calling the uh
the Labor uh um syndicates or unions to
call for a a wide strike to try and make
this moment where they found the bodies
of this hostage a turning point to try
to convince the Israeli government to do
some action the Israeli Prime Minister
canceled the annual the sorry the weekly
meeting of the Israeli government that's
happening every Sunday morning he
canceled this meeting and there will be
a meeting on 400 p.m. local time uh to
uh to address the issue this meeting was
called by the defense minister yuav
Gallant who is already was vocal about
his disagreement with the Prime Minister
Israeli Prime Minister bamin netan in
his approach of insisting of having uh
permanent presence permanent military
presence of the Israeli forces uh in
Gaza so the situation now in in in the
Israeli territories is really in high
tension and as you mentioned there is
also attention in the Western Bank and
in Gaza well Muhammad stay with us we'll
come back to you in a moment but let's
now go live to Jerusalem and to our
Middle East correspondent John donison
John we were talking there about the
divisions in Benjamin netanyahu's
cabinet how much does this latest
development add to
that well I think Muhammad's right it
reflects the divisions within the
government but also the divisions within
Israeli uh Society but Benjamin
Netanyahu in his short statement this
morning said uh Those Who Kill hostages
do not want a deal referring to the
allegation from the Israeli military
that these hostages were brutally
murdered in their words by Hamas shortly
before the bodies were found you have to
remember though that back in November
last year we had a ceasefire temporary
ceasefire where hostages were being
exchanged for Palestinian prisoners
every day that went on for about a week
with roughly 10 hostages a day coming
out and a lot of questions being asked
about why didn't Israel continue with
that process for a longer period and
then some of those who we now know have
died uh might have been freed the
certainly the hostage uh families Forum
saying today that the people whose
bodies have been found today would have
been alive today if a hostage deal could
have been done and we have heard reports
haven't we of uh Mr netanyahu's defense
minister uh disagreeing with him as well
and and accusing him of putting his
emphasis on uh deploying IDF in the
Philadelphia Corridor over the hostages
what more can you tell us about
that yeah well the last time the
security cabinet met earlier this week
uh there are reports of a shouting match
between yab Galant and prime minister
Netanyahu yab Galant saying that this
insistence on in leaving Israeli forces
in the Philadelphia Corridor that's the
Border area between Gaza and Egypt was
blocking a deal that is something that
Mr Netanyahu has insisted uh he is going
to pursue and and continue with you have
to remember that within his government
government there are also more Hardline
elements who want Israel to be doing

Mr nety as he has been now for months of

but also from Israeli citizens and in
particular those hostage

hearing about three Israelis who've been
killed after their vehicle was fired on
uh near the city of heon what's the
latest on
that yes well you'll be aware looks me
that for the past four or five days
there have been intensified Israeli
military operations in the north of the
West Bank targeting uh Palestinian
militants at least 20 people people have
been killed in those raids and Strikes
on Palestinian cities and Israel says
it's trying to protect its citizens from
attacks well in the south of the West
Bank bank near Hebron which is the
biggest Palestinian City in the occupied
West Bank three Israeli police officers
were killed in a shooting attack
overnight on their car uh and uh we not
got the details of their names yet but
certainly that is a another dangerous
development in the West Bank which the
warning is that there could be a war in
the West Bank similar to what's we've
happened has been happening in Gaza for
the past 10 or 11 months John thank you

workers are preparing to roll out a mass
vaccination program for polio in Gaza
which will rely on a series of limited
pauses in fighting between Israeli
forces and Hamas the World Health
Organization says it will need to
vaccinate at least 90% of children aged
under 10 for the campaign to succeed its
campaign was organized after a
10-month-old baby was partly Paralyzed
by the first case of the virus in Gaza
in a quarter of a century on Saturday
Medics vaccinated children at One
hospital in a symbolic move ahead of the
official campaign from Jerusalem our
Middle East correspondent yoland Nell
reports just two drops as the UN begins
vaccinating against polio in Gaza a dose
is easy to give but carrying out a mass
immunization campaign in a combat zone
is a huge challenge parents of the first
vaccinated children are relieved
I was worried and afraid because this is
scary the polio disease this disease
makes the children unable to
move baby Abdul Rahman was crawling
early but now his mom worries he'll
never be able to walk he was the first
child found to have polio in Gaza in 25
years and it paralyzed his leg because
of the war he wasn't vaccinated and now
Medical Care is limited
abud wants to leave and be treated he
wants to live and walk like other
children I feel a lot of guilt that he
didn't get the vaccination but I
couldn't give it to him because of our
circumstances displaced five times the
baby's family now lives in a crowded
tent camp in deab balah in central Gaza
raw sewage flows through streets nearby
conditions are ideal for diseases to
spread especially polio which is highly
in
infectious since discovering the virus
un agencies have been racing to set up
an emergency Mass vacination program and
with war raging they've negotiated three
localized 3-day pauses in fighting with
Israel and Hamas un officials say the
plan is not ideal but it's workable with
no end in sight to the war the hope is
that at least one new source of
suffering can be eliminated
yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem well still with me is my
colleague Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic
uh Muhammad we are seeing some live
images now of the vaccination roll out
actually underway we're seeing images
from a hospital in De Al Bala where um
babies and children are receiving the
polio uh vaccinations uh how significant
is this in what is was potentially a uh
humanitarian crisis with the outbreak of
polio it is very significant it is a
very happy moment where we see some kind
of normality of life in Gaza where
children were going to hospital to have
vaccination it is very very delightful
uh moment in in in the midst of all the
wars that's happening in the West Bank
in the uh in in in Israel and in the
northern of Israel and funnily enough or
I don't know it's not funn it's it's
it's hard to describe but not too far
from this location in Al brige in Bridge
refugee camp there were a Israeli
shelling and one person at least were
killed and there were a shelling and in
eastern Gaza and one person at least
killed but people are really adamant as
you can see the 2,000 workers from the
local uh health authority in Gaza and
with the with the cooperation of the
World Health Organization and the UNICEF
and the UN officials 2,000 people are
really determined to have this campaign
successful as a successful event well

floor beneath it what appears to be a
drain too small for a person to fit
through you hear a lot of comparisons
here now with the war in Gaza this is
still a very different situation but

Began Abdul Rahman has played a role in
pausing it something world leaders have
struggled to do earlier this month Abdul
Rahman was diagnosed with polio the
first case in Gaza for 25
years the family nine children in all
live in a camp in central Gaza displaced
multiple times from their home in the
north the constant moving disrupted his
vaccinations his mother says others in

like other children abdur rahman's
diagnosis is raised fresh alarm over
conditions in gaza's camps the phased PA
in fighting with will allow Medics to
vaccinate more than half a million
children in stages across the territory
but the conditions that caused this
crisis are worsening say Aid
organizations and their Solutions are
not straightforward due to the
insecurity the damage the road
infrastructure and and population
displacement but also based on on our
experience with this kind of campaigns
uh globally and worldwide the three days
might not be enough
to to achieve adequate
vaccination Israel's prime minister was
clear that this was not a ceasefire the
war has so far been resistant to both
diplomacy and disease but preventing
another layer of tragedy is seen as one
small victory what the eu's foreign
policy chief called a drop of Hope in a
sea of
Despair Lucy Williamson BBC News
Janine well Sam Rose director of
planning it unra told me more about the
vaccination program I mean we're deeply
deeply concerned about the the levels at
which it can be it might may be at
there's one confirmed case that that
your reporter referred to there may be
may be many more uh because the health
system here has been decimated largely
over the past 10 months the bombardments
the destruction of of clinics the
collapse of water and and and sewage so
Solid Waste Management infrastructure
the malnutrition these are precisely the
conditions in which a vaccine like this
reemerges a vaccine which had been
eradicated for more than 25 years inside
the Gaza Strip has reemerged so we're
deeply deeply concerned and at the same
time we welcome so much as everyone here
does the rest bite for for just a small
amount of time from the bombings from
the evacuation orders that we hope will
allow us to administer a successful
campaign working closely with the World
Health Organization UNICEF the the
Ministry of Health and and and other
partners but as you said this is a
massive massive effort we just really
really hope that that that it will be
successful for the children we're
vaccinating the the disease reemerging
of course rather than the vaccine
reemerging but just just explain for us
how you actually get to all the children
and how can you be sure that that all
the children there will be reached is is
three days
enough three days perhaps isn't enough
as your previous interview he said and
this will be three days across three
different areas of the Gaza Strip the
southern governorates the middle
governorates and the the northern
governorates the vaccines most of them
have now arrived in Gaza the the the
Personnel who are who will administer
those vaccines who will register the
children who are raising awareness
amongst the community have been hired
have been trained are are out there but
doing anything in Gaza right right now
is incredibly difficult surviving the
night is is is is very difficult so we
Face a number of of challenges the fact
that there will be causes humanitarian
pauses the fact that there will be no uh
evacuation orders make our lives more
easy it means that we can distribute the
the vaccines the fuel the staff to the
areas in which they need to go and unra
my organization will be vaccinating up
to half of these children we've taken on
about 1,00 of our Personnel will be
involved and we'll be vaccinating at our
primary health clinics that we have at
Health points that we've set up in areas
that people have been vaccinated to we
have mobile teams who work in the dozens
and dozens of schools where hundreds of
thousands of people Sheltering and we
will do what would previously have been
house to house but now is tent to tent
largely given the realities of the
situation in which people live but
reaching that more or less M magic
number of 90% of children will be very
difficult because we don't quite know
how many children there are we don't
know how many are still alive we
certainly don't know precisely anyway

Palestinians killed on the third day of
a major Israeli operation in the
occupied West Bank eyewitnesses say
Israeli undercover forces attempted to
detain a man in a village near Janine
when they tried to flee their car was
struck by an Israeli drone Israeli
forces are now thought to have withdrawn
from the city of taram where five
Palestinians were killed on Thursday
well I'm joined by Sharon husk a member
of the Israeli Parliament the nesset for
the national un party thank you very
much for being with us today um do you
support the government's operation in
the West Bank because you will have seen
leaders from the UN from other countries
have have expressed concern at the
escalation in the
region well the IDF is protecting and
defending our children our citizens
these operations are operation to
eliminate Terror cells violent cells of
Hamas today uh that was one of the heads
the terror cells of Hamas in Janine that
was eliminated the two that were with
him were actually from the Islamic Jihad
and from the fat which is tied to the
Palestinian Authority it means that ever
since I think it was two days ago when
khed mash who is a senior Hamas leader
who called up for everybody in Hamas in
Judea in Samaria the West Bank to go out
on and and act and and and commit acts
of terrorism of murder of suicide
attacks suicide bombings so right now we
are on the guard and are trying to
eliminate that threat for our
communities for our children can I just
put to you a statement from from the
British foreign office which says the UK
is deeply concerned by the ongoing IDF
military operation in the occupied West
Bank we recognize Israel's need to
defend itself against security threats
but we're deeply worried by the methods
Israel's employed by reports of Civilian
casualties and the D ruction of Civilian
infrastructure now the UK is obviously a
long-standing
Ally and and political supporter of
Israel but you know the British
government is expressing its concerns
today so look here in Israel we are
fighting a multi-front war against Iran
Iran is sending its tentacles from all
around from Lebanon from Yemen from Iraq
from Syria and is trying to ignite this
violence from within as well including
Judea and Samaria we expect our allies
our friend to stand beside us when we
are actually fighting on our survival
this is our second Independence war and
you know that if Hamas wouldn't have
opened this murderous most violent
attack that Israel's has actually
everever uh uh uh um ever experienced
this would have never happened before we
didn't want this war this is this is
happening at the same time um that that
many International uh players are trying
to help a resolution a peaceful
resolution and the concern is that even
with those security concerns that Israel
obviously has that this escalation is is
going to further ignite those tensions
and not yield not lead not help lead to
a peaceful resolution which is
presumably what everybody wants Israel
once uh the hostages
returned absolutely gaita I mean don't
forget a ceas fire will be possible when
all of our hostages are back we have
more than a hundred brothers and sisters
and parents and babies and grandparents
who are being held in the dungeons of
torture of Kamas being abused being
sexually abused being starved uh we have
released one of the prisoners a Muslim
Israeli uh uh hostage that Kamas kept
for 10 months he returned 25 kilos less
he said there was no food they were
abusing him I mean any other country
would have never stopped looking for
their family members for their Community
for 100 hostages and will not stop until
they will be returned I I mean this is
what any country would have done and
this is what we are doing here in
Israel and obviously I'm so sorry if if
you don't mind we'll have to leave it
there but um thank you very much indeed
for being with us and uh we do
appreciate your time today thank you

the second day Israel says five
Palestinian Fighters were killed whilst
hiding in a mosque in the city of taram
according to Palestinian sources the
death tollar has now risen to 17 people
since Israeli military operations began
the BBC has not been able to verify
those figures earlier the UN Secretary
General called on Israel to Halt its
major military op ation in the north of
the territory immediately well I'm
joined by our Middle East correspondent
John donison who is in Janine John just
bring us up to date with what's going on
where you
are well here in Janine eight
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
forces since yesterday uh one person
today and we just actually saw an
Israeli uh military bulldo ahead towards
the refugee camp which sits behind me in
uh need so this operation is ongoing a
lot of the focus is in taram as you say
which is a Palestinian City to the west
of here just driving into Janine this
morning all but one road uh was closed
blocked off by the Israeli Army and we
were told and warned by uh Palestinian
taxi drivers that their cars were being
shot at uh by Israeli soldiers Israel
for its part of course says it's
carrying out a counterterrorism
operation and is trying to protect its
citizens and what is the the response of
the people that you might have spoken to
and how are things likely to unfold in
the next few days have we got had any
guidance from the Israeli
military well in terms of what people
are saying to us here we were just
basically asking people on the way into
Janine whether it was safe uh to go in
and people are obviously worried
normally this is a vibrant bustling busy
uh City and today it is absolutely
deserted all the businesses virtually
are shuted up and no one is out on the
streets everyone is in their homes as
for how long it's going to go on uh well
we don't really know Israel uh says as I
say that uh they are determined to
tackle uh militant groups here in the
northern West Bank they say that they
have been stockpiling weapons is alleges
that those weapons are being funded by
Iran and certainly when I was in taram
late last year you do see people uh
militants with very very uh
sophisticated weapons which cost a lot
of money on the black market now people
tell you that many of those weapons are
actually being smuggled in by criminal
gangs from Israel although some smaller
weapons are coming in uh from Jordan and
John um have the Israelis given any
further information or is it known on
the ground about which militant groups
are operating
[Music]
there well the one they uh are sort of
making uh the most announcements about
is a senior commander in nor shamps the
refugee camp uh in taram he is
affiliated with Palestinian Islamic
Jihad and they say he was killed uh
yesterday uh in a Israeli operation
there we have had a statement from
hamas's military Wing which came late
yesterday saying six of its members have
been killed but we are also aware from
doctors at the hospitals in this part of
the West Bank that a number of civilians
have also uh been killed too John
donison thank you very much there live
in Janine for us well a little earlier I
spoke to Aisha Mansour the West Bank
director for medical aid for
Palestinians and she told me about her
work and what she has seen on the
ground thank you for having me um our
work focuses on supporting the
healthcare system and part of it is also
supporting the emergency response uh
since yesterday we're seeing the largest
Invasion by the Israeli military into
the West Bank since the second and since
2002 we woke up yesterday morning to
news that the Israeli forces have
invaded the towns of Janine tulam uh and
Tas as well as nabas later cutting off
the North and limiting access to the
north um with you know major major uh
attacks going on in those towns and what
does that mean what does that mean for
the people that you are working
with yes I mean today the news is that
there have been 18 people uh killed um
with with our partners our partners are
reporting that um accessing Healthcare
and accessing the injured have been very
difficult uh during this Invasion the
paramedics prcs Palestine red crescent
Society has reported that their teams
are having difficulty being able to
access patients and injured in order to
for them to provide the health care
needed and and take them to the
hospitals that are needed we're also um
hearing from our partners that hospitals
are being blocked and um anybody coming
into a hospital or leaving a hospital is
being checked um ID checked by the
Israeli military and uh in in terms of
uh how many of your staff were able to
move around and how they are affected
too can you give us a sense of of you
know how big your charity is without
obviously giving away any difficult
details yes um most our team members are
based here in ralo where I'm based and
actually yesterday on the day of the um
Invasion our team members were supposed
to go up to Janine um to meet with some
of our partners including the Palestine
red crescent Society Unfortunately they
weren't able to go because of the
invasion so so these kinds of regular
invasions that have been occurring um
since 2023 but more even more frequently
since um the war on Gaza from starting
last October uh these invasions have
really limited the ability for our team
to travel and access um those areas to
to follow up with our partners it's also
limited the work of our partners our
partners are are having more and more
difficulty uh accessing the healthc care
facilities accessing the patients and
really uh under International
humanitarian law um healthcare workers
should be able to to do their work they
should be able to access patients
patients should be able to access the
healthcare services they need they need
and they should be able to do all of
that safely without being attacked uh
who reported that since October last
October there have been over 500 attacks
on Health Care personnel and Facilities
this is against International
humanitarian law obviously the the
Israelis
um might push back on the term Invasion
and they said that they are targeting um
militants you know terrorists as they
put it um in terms of the the risk to
civilians for any military operation can
you give us a sense of of what life is
like in terms of where people live how
densely packed people
are yes well um based on the reports
we're receiving from our partners uh
people are unable to leave their homes I
mean they're they're basically stranded
in their homes uh while all of this is
happening um while this is happening the
Israeli forces are Destro destructing
the infrastructure so the water system
is destroyed electricity isn't infected
communication lines are are impacted so
people are stranded in their homes
without electricity without water
without being able to go out um in fear
of the snipers and uh one of our
partners reported that some people in t
Kim tried to leave their homes and were
shot out and they immediately returned
to their homes uh about a month ago just
to give you an example about a month ago
we visited and I along with my team we
visited tulam Camp to visit one of our
partners and on the way to the camp we
saw the destruction that had happened
from a previous incursion Israeli
incursion I mean the whole side of the
road one side was uh was fixed and we
were able to drive despite it being a a
dirt road still not paved but the other
side of the road was extremely um dug
deep in very deep down people living on
that side of the road would not be able
to leave their homes because the road is

increasing in the West Bank since the
Hamas attacks of October the 7th with
the UN saying more than 650 Palestinians

violence against Israelis this latest
massive operation involved Israeli
forces simultaneously entering the
cities of Janine tulam nablo and tubas
in what the Defense Forces called a
counterterrorism strike from Janine Lucy

delivered quietly at first Israeli

been killed Hamas says six of them were

on us from the sky and there was an
explosion I was unaware of what was
going on when I put my hand on my chest
it was all shrapnel in
blood in Janine army vehicles surrounded
the city's two main hospitals ambulances
stopped and checked by military Jeeps

government to use Gaza as a model for
dealing with armed groups here saying
that Iran was backing them and that this
was a war for everything that Israel
must win the IDF and our security forces
are operating in tarim Janine and other
places from which murderous attacks have
been launched we will fight to eliminate
terrorism wherever it
emerges almost 600 Palestinians have
been killed in the West Bank by Israeli
forces since the Hamas attacks but
Fighters here are still presenting
Israel with new tactics and new threats
Israel's Army has been targeting the
same areas in the same cities week after
week for the past 10 months determined
to dismantle the armed Palestinian
groups based here now it's launched a
wider more coordinated operation across
the West Bank on a scale not seen for 20
years in alfar camp near tubas mobile
phone footage showed showed red cresant
staff lined up against the wall of their
compound in front of Israeli
troops arriving in Janine today the West
Bank head of the red cresant you've had
10 months of these sorts of incursions
how worried are you by what's happening
today I'm very much worried because it
seems there's a new stage there's a new
uh they are escalating scaling up their
operation when they talk about
evacuating civilians
and using the Air Force to bombing the
camps this reminds us of
Gazza as night fell explosions and
gunfire from Janine's refugee camp dusk
can be a signal to test the Army's
control the war in Gaza is changing this
conflict an old front creating new fears
in the face of a regional War Lucy
Williamson BBC News
Janine and Jeremy boen is with me our
International editor Jeremy another
escalation in this region yeah um West
Bank at Boiling Point um now if you
listen to what Israel says they say it's
all about Iran Iran is behind uh an
increase in Palestinian violence armed
groups well it's no secret that Iran
does support Palestinian armed groups
someone has to pay for their their
Weaponry there's no question question
about that but why escalate now when
Israel has been hitting these same
places for months and months and months
and arresting thousands of people
killing hundreds well the root of it is
is of course the long conflict over
control of the land between Israelis and
Palestinians uh there's Politics as well
uh Netanyahu is said very emphatically
there will never be a Palestinian State
uh the Palestinians want this land the
West Bank as a big part of theirs so by
I think by doing this prime minister
Netanyahu is weakening the Palestinian
Authority which does want a Palestinian
State and which the Americans say should
be a big part of the future not just in
the West Bank but in Gaza which again
that is something Netanyahu is very much
against so weakening his enemies there
in the Palestinian State and also today
as well part of the the the growth of
violence has been the activities of
armed settlers the Americans sanctions
the settler group and a notorious
settler leader today saying extremist
settler violence causes intense human
suffering is bad for Israel's security
Now um last Point really that the
Israeli government's position is that
all this land is Jewish land

today Israeli security forces have been
carrying out a major operation in the
north of the occupied West Bank thought
to be one of the biggest such operations
there in years the Palestinian red
Cresent says at least 11 people have
been killed six reportedly died in a
drone strike near Janine and five in an
air strike in the alaras refugee camp in
the Jordan Valley while Israeli Army
claims it has killed nine Palestinian
terrorists with reports of military
activity in toam Janine nablas and tias
it's believed to be the first time in 20
years that at least four West Bank
cities have been targeted simultaneously
Muhammad Taha from the BBC Arabic
service explained why the West Bank is
known as an occupied territory and how
the area is governed the West Bank is is
is described as occupied by the UN
Security Council decisions because these
areas were supposed to be uh Palestinian
areas the also the oso uh treaty between
the Palestinians and Israel are
dedicating this area to be uh self uh
self uh controlled by the Palestinian
Authority uh and across the years the
Israeli authorities approved many
establishing many settlements in the
West Bank the difference between the
West Bank and Gaza that the West Bank
has got Israeli citizens has got
settlers their numbers are are are
nearly half million people and the
situation is very fragile Gaza has all
primarily Palestinian people living
there but now with the with the Israeli
presence in Gaza is making things really
difficult and also also by separating
the northern Gaza from Southern Gaza by
narim uh Corridor is making things
really difficult for the people there
Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic while our
Middle East correspondent yoland Nell
told us a little more about the
operation I mean what we've been hearing
from local journalists really is it's in
terms of the scope as well as the scale
of this um that it's being compared to
the days of the Palestinian second inada
or Uprising some two decades ago um I
mean it's hard to get a lot of
information cities like Janine the main
entrances have been uh closed off by
Israeli forces uh preventing journalists
from getting in uh but what we've been
hearing from there is that Israeli
forces are surrounding um at least two
of the hospitals um and we've also been
hearing reports of gun battles going on
in the urban refugee camp there that has
been the subject of so many Israeli
military raids in the past um that of
course involving Palestinian armed
groups and Israeli soldiers uh but also
ongoing action in other places in tolam
in nablas uh in the North of the dordan
valley where a Palestinian ambulance
crew says that say that after a drone
strike they've been struggling to reach
some of those wounded um because uh that
the Israeli forces are still present
there as well um I mean the Israeli
military has not said very much
officially about what is going on it's
talked about this being a
counterterrorism operation involving
different Security Forces we've had the
Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz
who's come out in particular to talking
about how the Israeli military is acting
with full force he said in the north of
the West Bank and he accuses Iran of
backing Palestinian armed groups to
really open up a new front he says um
against Israel um and says that this
action is necessary to deal with them
that they may have to adopt measures
such as those seen in the Gaza Strip uh
including temporary evacuations of
Palestinian residents I mean that is
something that will really alarm
Palestinians we've had a comment also
from the spokesperson um for the
Palestinian Authority president Mahmud
abas uh he has been saying that what's
happening is escalating uh the ongoing
war in Gaza and saying that it will lead
to dire and dangerous results for which
everybody will pay the

evBDb0NNblw,Gaza: Has Israel taken enough action to prevent incitement to genocide? | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza Has Israel taken enough action to prevent incitement to genocide  BBC News.jpg,"Israel has a genocidal intent against
the Palestinians in Gaza the charge of
genocide leveled against Israel is not
only false it's outrageous the highest
court of the United Nations has ruled
that Israel must take all measures to
prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and
punish the direct and public incitement
to commit genocide but Israel has been
accused of allowing controversial
statements to
continue BBC News Arabic has
investigated statements by Israeli
leaders soldiers and on the internet we
ask what action has Israel taken since
the ruling at the international court of
justice since hamas's attack on Israel
in October 2023 and Israel's subsequent
military campaign in Gaza both sides
have used inflammatory language some
Hamas officials have made speeches about
repeating the acts and Hamas leaders
have been accused of war crimes but
because Hamas is not a state it cannot
be taken to the
icj Israel however can be taken to the
icj it has signed the genocide
convention and incitement to genocide is
also punishable under Israeli National
Law but what is considered a genocidal
act the UN defines genocide as acts
committed with intent to destroy in
whole or in part in National ethnical
racial or religious group the convention
outlines five punishable acts one of
which is the direct and public
incitement or call to action to commit
genocide the deputy speaker a member of
the prime minister's C party made these
comments weeks after the icj's
order he'd previously called to burn
Gaza in a postern x he said he deleted
it following a request from the platform
but he didn't
apologize and controversial comments
have been made since the ruling by those
in Israel's government
[Music]
this call by Israel's national security
minister for Palestinians to leave Gaza
voluntarily a population of more than 2
million was made just two days after the
icj
ruling common calling for the expulsion
of Palestinians from Gaza have been made
by soldiers on the
ground since October 7th there have been
videos by IDF soldiers mocking and
celebrating the destruction of
Gaza the IDF told the BBC that it
handles videos posted by Soldiers with
command and disciplinary measures and
that in some of the examined cases it is
concluded that the expression or
behavior of the soldiers in the footage
is
inappropriate we consider the the
calling to uh displacement of the Gaza
population as part of the ethnic
cleansing that is ongoing in Gaza that
is part of the of the genocide certain
statements let's say by itamar benir and
others you know I'm definitely not going
to defend such statements but they do
not rise to the level of genocide
certainly un special reporter Franchesca
albanesi however says we can see that
it's impossible to return Gaza to what
it was because 70% of it has been
destroyed because over 33,000 people
have been killed 14,000 of whom are
children so the
incitement against the people of Gaza
has translated in fact into into uh
concrete actions so there is a direct
link I mean it cannot be missed
Franchesca Alban's criticism of Israeli
policies in Gaza have been strongly
contested among others by Israel and its
Ally the United
States in Gaza this link between what
politicians say and what's echoed by
soldiers was a core part of South
Africa's case during the icj hearing in
January they claimed Israel's political
leaders military commanders and persons
holding official positions have
systematically and explicit terms
declared their genocidal intent and
these statements are then repeated by
soldiers on the ground in Gaza and gave
this
example this speech was addressing
soldiers before the ground offensive in
Gaza amalik comes from Biblical story
where Israelites are ambushed by the
amalik people and God commands
destruction women and children
included the war against amalik is
described as a me of war in Jewish text
it is a war commanded by God and
includes defending Jewish life under
which it is considered obligatory to
fight I think Nan's reference to Amal in
the modern context of this war was
highly problematic was um using a term
that's vague and could be understood in
different ways in order to Rally support
um especially among the religious um C
prime minister netanyahu's office says
he was talking about Hamas in connection
to amalik and not Palestinian civilians
to understand the reach of the term
amalik the BBC investigated online
mentions since the start of the war
filtering those to ones associated with
Gaza war and narrowing that down further
to mentions just in Hebrew we collected
over 3,600 mentions and found they
reached a total of 6 million users
mention speak around the time of Mr
netanyahu's speech and again at the
beginning of December when this video
went

viral this religious language and
ideology has become part of the
messaging within Israel at least in some
communities it was also expressed at an
annual conference that took place for
all Zion shivas Jewish religious schools
in
Israel Rabbi ilaali gives a lecture
which he describes as being about the
treatment of civilians in Gaza the
following clip went viral and has been
watched over a million times we have
added our own verified translations
one description of a me for war which
Rabbi Mali discusses in his lecture
includes a Commandment that states do
not allow a soul to live we contacted
Rabbi Ilah Ali about his
lecture his legal representative replied
saying the rabbi's lecture has been
grossly
misrepresented and that he made it very
clear that anyone following the biblical
commandment today would be causing the
Army and the nation extreme
harm the rabbi said that it is forbidden
to harm the civilian population from a
child to an old
man we managed to track down the full 47
minute lecture and Rabbi Mali thus
conclude the following
however earlier in the lecture he
discusses the position of Jewish text in
relation to civilian populations and
says this
it Ma a lawyer from the Israeli group
tag me ear that campaigns against racism
and discrimination ask the police to
investigate Rabbi Mali on suspicion of
incitement to commit genocide violence
and terrorism he says he's waiting to
hear if that will
happen two days before the court hearing
in January Israel's attorney general
said any statements calling for
intentional harm to civilians contradict
the policy of the state of Israel and
may amount to a criminal offense
including the offense of incitement
currently several such cases are being
examined by Israeli law enforcement
authorities and while no report has been
made public the icj confirmed it
received the report it requested from
Israel on what action it's taken the BBC
has not been able to verify whether any
criminal investigations have been opened
to determine if statements could be
inciting
genocide whether there investigations of
course depends on whether in their view
uh any arguable incitement to genocide
has happened Hamas hides behind
civilians and inevitably some of those
civilians have uh regrettably and
tragically been harmed the BBC contacted
Israel's State Attorney Police
Commissioner and Ministry of justice for
comment only the ministry of Justice
replied saying they have to balance the
constitutional right to freedom of
speech while safeguarding against
harmful
incitement it's a case the icj issued
the interm order because a final verdict
will take years and while there's no end
inside to this deadly and long-standing
conflict between Israelis and pales
inian inflammatory language from both
sides
continues it's unclear what Gaza will
look like or how it will be governed
once a final ruling is eventually issued

reading on the wires that there have
again been protests today from hostage
families who are blocking major highways

the forces that were uh involved in this
operation there are still between 60 and
70 hostages being held in Gaza who are

says that it's had to Halt its
humanitarian operations in Gaza it comes
after the Israeli military issued a new
evacuation order for the area where AID
workers were operating from the UN is
the primary Aid distributor inside the
territory which has been devastated by
10 months of war between Israel and
Hamas the UN agency unra one of the key
humanitarian groups working in Gaza
spoke about the deteriorating situation
the space that people have been confined
to is so minimal um there are tanks uh
in areas that used to be designated as
safe areas um and this is just another
Testament to there being nowhere safe in
the Gaza Strip people have nowhere to go
there is nowhere to find safety it's
very limited access to humanitarian
resources um because the humanitarian
operations are also being displaced
Within These evacuations orders and the
humanitarian response here is being
completely strangled and limited to our
ability of what we can do well elsewhere
in the region Medics say one Palestinian
was shot dead by an Israeli settler and
five others were killed in an Israeli
air strike in the occupied West Bank the
Israeli Defense Forces confirmed the
strike in noam's Camp east of the city
of tarum and said its Target was what it
described as a command room of a
terasa let's speak to our Middle East
correspondent yoland now first of all
yand tell us more about this uh these
incidents in the West
Bank um so certainly n Shams is an urban
refugee camp in the north of the West
Bank it has seen successive Israeli
military raids uh particularly since the
start of the war in Gaza and we're
hearing from Palestinian Health
officials that there were five people
who were killed in this air strike on
house uh in the camp uh two of them were
children aged 15 and 16 this is where
the Israeli military has said um a
command center had been set up by
Palestinian armed groups um this was an
attack that took place about 10:30 local
time last night also um last night
there's videos on social media where you
can see um that people are rushing
around in this small village uh close to
Bethlehem in the south of the West Bank
called Wadi Rahal um and these bursts of
gunfire this is where local people say
that armed settlers entered into the
village late at night they started
attacking homes when men went outside uh
one man was shot and killed three other
people were wounded there has been a
real increase in Israeli military rates
in the West Bank since the start of the
war in Gaza with the Israeli military
saying it's acting against what it calls
terrorist groups and at the same time
there has been this surge in Violence by
extremist settlers um attacking
Palestinians and taking over more land
your land for the moment thank you very
much let's go live now to rala and speak
to Mustafa bouti General Secretary of
the Palestinian national initiative Dr
bouti thank you very much for joining us
here on BBC
News in is in Gaza um the IDF say that
they give warnings to civilians when
they're about to launch a strike to what
extent if any does that happen in the
West Bank
well uh I don't believe they do that in
Gaza but they definitely don't do any of
that in the West Bank people suddenly
find themselves subjected to air strikes
it is important to remember that West
Bank is an occupied territory by Israeli
Army since 57 years and when Israel uses
air strikes against occupied people it
is a total violation of international
law since the 7th of October Israel
conducted 80 air strikes on different
places in the West Bank in mainly in
refugee camps like n Shams and the tul
Karim refugee camp uh the outcome is
that 640 people have been killed
including no less than 170 children and
all these 80 a strikes there were during
there these attacks there were no
warnings
whatsoever Israel says that the Target
in the West Bank was a command room of a
terror cell is how they've described it
to what extent the talks sorry do answer
that well I don't think a 15 and 16 year
children are are are Terror leaders I I
think Israel lies and they continuously
lie and the biggest lie here is that
Netanyahu claims that he wants to have
peace but at the same time Netanyahu
does not want to end the war in Gaza by
continuously undermining all
negotiations and now he wants to expand
the war into the West Bank but they just
regarding those talks though Hamas have
not even turned up have they no they
have they've been in Cairo and they have
received all the proposals and they've
discussed them and they responded to
them but they've not done so directly
have they it's been via other conduits
no no no we we never had Israel would
not sit with Hamas to negotiate neither
would the Americans all the time
negotiations happen through mediators
which are Egypt and Qatar so nothing
changed Hamas was there but Netanyahu is
under mining the this is not my opinion
this is even the opinion of many people
from the security Israeli apparatus and
from the negotiating team who are
leaking to the media that Netanyahu is
undermining the negotiations cont
continuously because he doesn't want to
achieve an agreement he wants this war
to continue he wants to keep his
occupation of a
and he knows that the end of the war is
the end of his political career and he
doesn't even care about the Israeli
prisoners who are dying because of
Israeli bombardment as well and of
course these negotiations do go on and
they're supposed to result in the
hostage release as well as a ceasefire

MA1EF-iL4ZY,Israel and Hezbollah exchange heavy fire in major escalation | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel and Hezbollah exchange heavy fire in major escalation  BBC News.jpg,"we begin in the Middle East the United
States says it's working to prevent the
conflict between Israel and the Lebanese
group Hezbollah from escalating into a
regional war after Sunday's heavy
bombardments the UN Secretary General
Antonio grz has called for an immediate
end to hostilities on both sides in a
televised address hezbollah's Secretary
General Hassan nazala said that the
delay in the retaliation attack for the
assassination of its military commander
last month was to keep Israel on edge he
also said they still have to assess the
impact of its barrage and did not roll
out another strike from Tel Aviv
Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel's
air strikes were not the end of the
story and added they had destroyed
thousands of hezbollah's short range
rockets and no progress on the Gaza
ceasefire talks in Cairo either Hamas
which has now left the Egyptian Capital
said it rejected new Israeli conditions
and accused them of backtracking in on
promises Israel denies changing its
demands since a last round of talks in
early July all for more on this we can
speak to our Middle East correspondent
in Beirut Hugo Bea so Hugo we heard that
Hezbollah isn't rolling out further
attacks Benjamin Netanyahu is saying
it's not the end of the story where are
we yeah I think it was very interesting
that last night the powerful leader of
Hezbollah Hassan azrah gave that speech
essentially he said that the attack was
over the retaliation for the killing of
fad Shuka the senior Hezbollah Commander
was assassinated by Israel here in
Beirut a month ago and Hassan nzala also
said that gave indications that uh no
major operations against Israel were
being planned so I think he was trying
to deescalate tensions with Israel uh
yesterday there were concerns that those
attacks could uh lead to a major
conflict between Hezbollah and Israel
we've seen that so far this violence has
been relatively contained to areas along
the Lebanon Israel border uh nzala did
say that uh the group could attack
Israel uh again but given everything
else in the speech I think this seemed
to be something that had to be said
rather than uh a threat against Israel
uh and the Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu also y today said
that uh what happened was not the end of
the story and again I don't think it's
surprising that he's saying it uh he
needs to keep all his options on the
table he's under a lot of pressure to
act against Hezbollah to allow the
return of tens of thousands of uh
residents who have been displaced from
uh communities uh in Northern Israel but
uh behind the scenes there have been
indications that both sides have said
they're not interested in further
escalation obviously this doesn't mean
that the conflict between Hezbollah and
Israel is over but again we see
indications that uh they're not
interested in a major conflict that
could have catastrophic consequences not
only for Lebanon but also for uh Israel
and uh the main hope uh of of a
deescalation here is a ceasefire deal in
Gaza and we've seen that the latest
round of talks for a deal uh in Cairo
ended yesterday without a major
breakthrough
so what's the the state of alert there
then Hugo in in in light of the recent
events yeah so for weeks uh we've been
waiting for this uh response by uh
Hezbollah and uh the work concerns that
this could lead to a major escalation
and there have been fears here in
Lebanon that Hezbollah could be dragging
this country into another confrontation
with Israel uh many people here still
remember what happened in 2006 uh the
war between Hezbollah and Israel the
devastation caused by the conflict not
only to areas of Southern Lebanon but
also to parts of Southern Beirut and
many people you know fear that history
might be repeating itself it seems now
that uh you know worst case scenario has
been averted at least for now there have
been these indications from Hassan
nazala that the group is not interested
in uh in an escalation of these
hostilities with with Israel and even uh
in Israel we're seeing that there have
been some signs that uh you know the
Israeli government is also trying to
prevent a major escalation with
Hezbollah but again uh there has been a
lot of anger uh from residents in the
north of the country they say that they
have been under attack uh almost every
day with rockets being fired from
Hezbollah and they've been urging the
Israeli authorities to do something to
uh
push Hezbollah away from the border and
to allow the return of tens of thousands
of people who have had to flee their
homes in Northern Israel because of this
violence happening along the border okay
Hugo Bea in beir thank you very much
well for more let's speak to Yosi bin
former Justice minister of Israel and
one of the initiators of uh Israel
Palestine Oslo Peace Accords thanks very
much for your time here on BBC News
let's pick up with those peace talks
then in light of what's happened is is
there any chance of those uh talks
having a positive
outcome yes I believe that uh Israel
doesn't want to continue this war it is
really long
overdue and I hope that this is also the
situation on the Hamas Side ER the point
is that it is not peace talks of course
it is it is talks about a ceasefire
hopefully a long ceas fire and uh the
other side is not recognizing Israel and
Israel is not recognizing Hamas of
course and to get to the decision makers
on the other side is very difficult so
what you hear is is rumors from time to
time or
a declaration of one of the Hamas people
but the groups are there I mean the the
the teams uh are there negotiating still
and I hope that it will end by an
agreement this agreement is not going to
be an historic one but it will put an
end at least to the
current situation whereby people
innocent people are killed and and you
don't see any
Horizon the US is saying it's it's
working to prevent the uh any conflict
escalating what what can they do to move
on these peace
talks well they are doing a lot they are
actually the main player not the only
one because you have Qatar and you have
Egypt but it is a very important
player and I think that they can put
push the the parties directly indirectly
they have their own ways and and I hope
that eventually reason will prevail
and it would be possible to put an end
to it I mean we are there in in a kind
of an ongoing war from September October
the massacre of
Hamas in the southern of side of the
part of Israel and nobody is is gaining
anything from this war just losing we
know obviously the elections uh in the
United States are coming up presumably
Netanyahu will be watching those closely
and I I was just saying that with the uh
elections in the US uh coming up
Netanyahu were presumably watching those
very closely to see what
happens yeah but I I don't think that
this is going to have any
direct impact first of all the the
elections are very close but uh the the
20 of January is further and we have to
put an end to this situation much before
I think that waiting for the 20th of
January and hopefully netanyahu's
candidate will not
win but even if he wins I think that
waiting for him is
a is a kind of betting because you never
know with this person ER I mean Trump of
course what is he going to do what is he
going to say he may surprise the world
this way or another if God forbid is
elected and it was and if it is as I
hope Kamala Harris it it will be the
same kind of a policy like the the
current policy of President Biden okay
we have to leave it there Yosi bin thank

issued a 48-hour state of emergency in
the country now meanwhile Hezbollah that
it launched more than 300 rockets and
drones at Israel and targeted 11
military sites in response to the
killing of its top commander in Beirut
last month the group has said this was
an initial response and that it has
completed phase one of an attack on
Israel these are live pictures from the
Israel Lebanon border which has had a
number of missile strikes in the last
couple of hours and this was the idf's
announcement earlier from IDF
spokesperson rear Admiral Daniel
Hagi from right next to the homes of
Lebanese civilians in the south of
Lebanon we can see that kisala is
preparing to launch an extensive attack
on Israel while endangering the lebanes
civilians we warn the civilians located
in the areas where kisala is operating
to move out of Harm's Way immediately
for their own safety hisis bala's
ongoing aggression risks dragging the
people of Lebanon the people of Israel
and the whole region into a wider
escalation Israel will not tolerate
bala's attacks on our civilians we are
operating in self-defense from kisala
and any other enemy that joins in their
attacks against us and we are ready to
do everything everything we need to
defend the people of Israel there's the
IDF specs person Daniel hagari well
meanwhile the Pentagon has said in its
words the US is postured to support
Israel and the President Joe Biden has
instructed officials to maintain close
communication on developments well Laura
blumenfield is a Middle East analyst and
former senior policy adviser on the
state Department's Israeli Palestinian
negotiating team she told us more about
the strikes and reactions from both
parties the Israelis have called for a
48-hour period of emergency their
Secretary of Defense their defense
minister Galant um you know is is
calling on the population so it's not
just one night you know one and done on
the other hand so much about these
exchanges of since October 7th has been
not so much about being strong but being
smart and so it's kind of our
intelligence versus your intelligence
kind of battle here the Israelis were
clearly caught by surprise on October
7th the shooker assassination was an
intelligence coup for Israel as was the
hania assassination um into heran so I
think his Bala is is feeling like they
need to show that they can in some way
penetrate um and kind of shift that kind
of dignity back into balance it's
possible that you know they they already
have it's horrible to say but wounded
one person in AKO which is quite deep
into Israeli territory that that might
satisfy the need uh you know for
publicly Saving
Face now also just one update for you
the Lebanese Ministry according to uh
news agencies as well as local reports
uh is saying that one died in the
Israeli uh strike in uh the south of
Lebanon our News correspondent John
donison is in Jerusalem and he told us
about the fears of escalations in the
region this is clearly a significant and
ongoing escalation we're not at the
point of fulls scale War yet but that is
clearly uh the fear not just here in
Israel but in Lebanon and The Wider
region Israel saying around a 100
fighter jets uh were used in this
operation last night hitting around 200
Targets in Lebanon now if that's the
case then that is the most serious
attack on Hezbollah since the full scale
war between Israel and Lebanon uh back
in
2006 now you know in the last few weeks
we've seen intense diplomatic efforts to
try and stop the crisis in Gaza
escalating into a wider regional
conflict uh but the United States has
warned that the failure to get a ceas
fire and hostage release deal in Gaza uh
could see uh this escalate into wider
regional conflict at the at the moment
judging on what's happened to this
morning you'd have to say that those
diplomatic efforts have not worked and
John hisbah has said that this was in
response to the killing of its top
Commander fad shuk on the 30th of July
of course there's also the fact that
isil hania was assassinated in Iran uh
and that Iran which backs hisbah also
vowed a strong response I wonder whether
putting all of this into context can we
see this as Tit for Tat or is that the
real risk that this could uh meet
further responses from Hezbollah as well
as
Iran well I think TI fat kind of
downplays the significance of this you
know when Israel assass uh is believed
to have assassinated the leader of Hamas
is melhan in Teran uh the day before
they had assassinated uh as you say a
very senior Hezbollah commander in Le on
F shoker and we have been waiting for
some sort of response from Iran and from
Hezbollah now in the past few weeks that
response has not really come there has
been some crossborder activity between
Hezbollah and Israel in the north but
not really significant until this
morning and we've not had any kind of
response uh from Iran to uh the
targeting of Ismael hania inside the
Iranian Capital so the fears have been
for the last few weeks that that
response was coming
uh and certainly from the north from
Hezbollah we've got something this
morning and John uh you're in Jerusalem
we've been hearing these reports of
sirens that have been uh blaring in in
Israel as well in certain cities um I
wonder what your assessment is of the
security situation in Israel especially
given that the New York Times is
reporting that uh this attack by
Hezbollah was also aiming Tel Aviv
yeah and of course Tel Aviv is deep into
Israel it's in central Israel really so
uh that would be hugely significant if
they manag to penetrate uh Israel's uh
missile defense system uh here in
Jerusalem this morning I have to say it
feels relatively normal I'm sure lots of
people will be waking up and reading the
news and have uh concerns we did see
some military helicopters flying uh
across the sky earli this morning some
heading north uh but certainly in
Jerusalem it feels uh relatively normal
at the
moment well a reminder you'll see a QR
code on your screen that will take you
to our BBC News live page on our website
and app where our correspondents are
providing updates and Analysis our BBC
News Room is also bringing in any
reaction and information as it comes in
the meantime here on the news channel
let's speak to our senior International
correspondent who's in southern Lebanon
that's Alla Garen Alla uh good to have
you now given all your experience and
your time there could you put this into
perspective for us because the New York
Times is reporting that Tel Aviv was a
Target we know that benguan is now open
the international airport is open but
when you look back at this war how
significant an escalation is
this well we know that the Israelis are
saying Tel Aviv would have been targeted
but that didn't actually happen because
of their preemptive strike we're
certainly in a new stage as a day we had
been expecting this retaliation for some
time now it was at the end of last month
that an Israeli strike killed a senior a
top Hezbollah commander fuad shuker in
the heart of hezbollah's stronghold in
southern Beirut a place called dahia and
Hezbollah had vowed it would respond now
similarly the Iranians had vowed they
would respond for the assassination of
the Hamas leader ISM hania in tran both
had held off and the feeling had been
that they were waiting to see how the
ceasefire attempts being uh led by the
Americans and the Egyptians and the
cateres would play out well certainly
Hezbollah is waiting no more they said
in a statement this morning that this
was the first phase of a large scale
operation and that its full response
would take some time and that the
punishment will be harsh and severe now
I think we need to look carefully at the
targets that were hit by hbet today so
far uh they were 11 military targets
inside Israel so not critical
infrastructure not civilian areas but
military Targets this is according to
Hezbollah we have had no reports from
Israel yet of any casualties and
certainly no reports of Civilian
casualties similarly on this side in
Lebanon the Israelis have hit U more
than 200 t targets they say but we have
not received any reports of Civilian
casualties I should tell you as day that
about 30 or 40 minutes ago in the Hills
behind us we saw two very large plumes
of smoke um from two two detonations two
explosions Israel had obviously struck
close to the Border area which is in
that direction but I think the key to
this is that so far we are not being
told that any civilians have been
injured or killed because that again uh
could be the the trigger for another
escalation it's by no means clear when
Hezbollah plans to carry out its next
phase it says it will happen uh but it
certainly may not happen today so I
think for now uh Israel has got its
preemptive strike in Hezbollah has
managed to fire by its own account
320 Rockets into Israel and sending some
drones so for the moment Hezbollah has
made its Point H now we have to see if
Israel is going to take further action
all right Ola Garen there thank you for
all that insight and again Alla there
has raised that there are still a lot of
questions that haven't been answered uh
including uh verifying the nature of
those military targets uh as well as how
things could develop of course",20240825

the latest developments now from the
Middle East the un's defense secretary
Lloyd Austin says he has spoken to his
Israeli counterpart to discuss a range
of issues in the region including the
ongoing exchanges of fire on the Israel
Lebanon border and the need to finalize
a broader ceasefire deal well it comes
as un officials have confirmed the first
case of polio in Gaza for 25 years with
the disease partially paralyzing a
10-month-old baby the head of the world
Health Organization has said he's
Gravely concerned that efforts are
underway to roll out a vaccination
program in the coming weeks well let's
speak live to our correspondent in
Jerusalem wah Davis who's there and we
let's start with the final part of what
I read out there is a considerable alarm
at that development there of polio in
Gaza not just from the
who now we've heard from other un
agencies today confirming what had been
suspected that polio was now present in
Gaza it's been confirmed today that a
baby has been infected with polio and
has been partially paralyzed and of
course polio is a highly infectious
disease and the big concern is here
given the San sanitary conditions given
humanitarian crisis in Gaza that it
could spread very very quickly it's one
reason why the UN has called for for a
ceasefire not just for military reasons
but to actually allow more vaccines to
be brought in and for those vaccines to
be distributed effec itively Israel has
pushed back um a couple of times in in
last few days on this saying that a
number of well hundreds of thousands of
vaccines have already been sent into
Gaza but of course the problem is that
with such a large displaced population
with people living in such difficult
conditions and with a war going on it's
very difficult to administer uh most if
if not all of of those vaccines so some
vaccines we learn have gone in again in
in the last 24 hours but with this
confirmed case of and with the potential
for a much bigger spread that is another
one of the the considerations here and
why some people are calling for a cease
fight so those vaccines can be delivered
and administered in terms of those
ceasefire
negotiations again all the pointers
pretty bleak as it stands how close are
we or how far away are we to getting any
sort of
deal well the honest answer is that we
just really don't know there are
conflicting reports coming from uh
around the region according to Hamas
officials who've spoken to the BBC now
Hamas are not actively part of these
talks in KIRO there has been no progress
they have received nothing updated they
have received nothing uh as far as they
concerned that persuades them that a
ceasefire agreement is any closer there
are unconfirmed reports in parts of the
Israeli media that they are perhaps
close to a breakthrough and perhaps a
new proposal will be delivered by the
negotiators to Hamas who aren't part of
the talks what we do know is that
Israeli Egyptian and American
negotiators are in Cairo the sticking
points from the outside might not seem
to be that big the biggest contentious
issue seems to be what Israeli troops
would remain in which parts of Gaza in
the event of a ceasefire there's an area
the Border area between Egypt and Gaza
where perhaps both the Egyptians and
Hamas would want the Israelis to leave
from Israel uh through Benjamin
Netanyahu has indicated it wants to
retain some sort of Israeli presence in
the area at the end of the day it
depends how much both leadership the
Hamas leadership in Yaya Sina and the
Israeli Prime Minister in Benjamin
Netanyahu how much they're prepared to
compromise uh in order to achieve a
ceasefire and of course the return of
the hostages but uh not much concrete
news coming out of Egypt as we speak we
Davis there in Jerusalem thanks a lot
for that thank you",20240823
Xl78GbeuIzs,US President Joe Biden stresses importance of ceasefire in Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US President Joe Biden stresses importance of ceasefire in Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"let's turn our attention to the Middle
East now during a phone call with the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu President Biden stressed the
urgent need to reach a ceasefire and
hostage deal in Gaza the White House
said they also discussed us efforts to
support Israel's defense against what it
called all threats from Iran and proxy
terrorist groups including Hamas let's
speak to uh my colleague uh s shahata
from BBC Arabic who's in Cairo side we
were led to believe last week after the
talks Drew to a close in K that they
were due to start in Cairo where you are
what's
happened uh no news about any uh
resumption of the talks uh because uh
some of the Hamas members of the
political Bureau of Hamas uh said that
they are not willing for any new
negotiations because they send the reply
to the proposal announced by uh Mr Biden
the American president on 2nd of July so
they don't accept any conditions more uh
demands from the Israeli Prime Minister
Mr Benjamin Netanyahu uh so there is uh
from Hamas sides are not willing to any
new negotiation in new conditions in
addition to that within the Israeli
negotiation team there is reports about
disagreement between Mr n from one side
and some members of the negotiation team
regarding the some of this members want
the deal to be done as the American
wants but Mr Netanyahu seems uh to put
more conditions which are not accepted
even by Egypt or Hamas so now it's like
a deadlock and no one knows uh will uh
the negotiation will be restarted again
in in Egypt or not how is this affecting
the
apparent optimism that some were
expressing last
week yeah that optimism came from the
American but like uh from Hamas side and
Israeli side is no optimism because
Hamas like uh members of the political
Bureau uh several of them said like the
Mr n put more obstacles the hostage
family put pressure on Mr Netanyahu to
reach a deal but there is some staking
points between the two sides especially
after What's called the bridging
proposal by the United States announced
by uh Mr blinkin the American foreign
minister which was not revealed publicly
but there is some dis agreement
especially the uh talks about the
presence of Israeli forces along the
Philadelphia Corridor or Salah Corridor
uh and the Nim Crossing which separate
between the North and Central and South
of Gaza so and within the plan of uh
which accepted by Hamas and announced by
Mr Mr Biden there is three stages of
this plan and there is disagreement
about the names of the uh prisoner
released and the numbers and and the
withdrawal of the Israeli forces because
the Mr Netanyahu repeatedly said there
is a red line about fighting Hamas until
he demolish Hamas and there is no signs
he demolished Hamas yet after almost 11
months of the war since uh 7th of
October so there is some staking points
especially the presence of Israeli on
the Philadelphia Corridor which is not
accepted by Egypt or Hamas n because
Hamas said they need the people
evacuated or forced to leave their house
in the north to go back but the Israeli
put conditions that should be monitored
because you don't want to allow any uh
militant uh according to the Israeli and
Mr Nan to go to the north without like
being monitored and screened so there is
many sticking point disagreement so the
optimism came from the American side but
from the concerned side the Israeli and
the Palestinian there is no
optimism s for the moment thank you very
much s shahata from BBC Arabic speaking
to us from Cairo
in Israel a funeral ceremony is being
held for one of the hostages whose
bodies were recovered from Gaza earlier

southern Gaza these are the pictures of
the men who had been captured in
southern Israel during the Hamas attacks
on October the 7th five of their deaths
had already been announced but one was
previously thought to have still been
alive meanwhile US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin has been in Egypt where
he is pushing for a ceasefire and
hostage release deal in Gaza he's met
the Egyptian president Abdul fat Ali in
Cairo Anthony blinkin has said it was up
to amas to agree to a bridging proposal
for a ceasefire deal in Gaza after he
met Israeli officials in Tel Aviv Hamas
has issued a statement saying claims by
the us including President Biden that it
was backing away from a ceasefire deal
amus leading Hamas says it's Keen to
reach a cessation of aggression and
remarks by the US Administration give
Israel the green light to continue the
war Hamas also accused the US of bias
towards Israel let's show you the latest
pictures we have from Gaza where Hamas
officials say at least 10 people have
been killed in an Israeli military
attack on a school that was housing
displaced people the IDF claimed that
the strike targeted Hamas fighters who
used a hidden Command Center in the
school the UN says almost 500 school
buildings have been directly hit or
damaged during the current conflict well
let's hear now from sahiro Shaham he's
been speaking about his uncle Abraham
Munda he was taken hostage by Hamas
fighters on October the 7th my uncle was
was kidnapped from his house from his
home in kibuts N Ro on that Saturday by
Kamas
terrorist this happened October 7th on
October 8th he was abandoned by his
government and on October 9th he was
abandoned by the government and on
October 10th and this continuously goes
on went on until the day that he died he
saw television and got and heard some
radio broadcast I'm sure sure that he
heard what is going on in Israel it must
have broke his heart to see that you
know people from his own government are
objecting to sign a deal that will get
him back home so yeah Hamas took him but
the continuous abandonment is on the
hands of the Israeli government they had
plenty of opportunities to get him out
together with all the other hostages
together with in in so many cases we
have counted 18 cases of the government
of Israel torpedoing the initiative to
get the hostages back 18 in the last 10
months well on those talks Anthony
blinkin as I mentioned is in Egypt
traveling with him is our state
department correspondent Tom bitman well
the intention of secretary blinkin is to
try to drive this deal through you know
we've had a fair amount of expectation
mixed with optimism from the Americans
about their hopes for trying to push
some form of breakthrough they have
thought within even the next week or so
I have to say the mood on the ground as
we've moved from Israel here to Egypt
simply hasn't matched that expectation
what we heard from secretary blinkin on
Monday night was him saying that prime
minister Netanyahu had accepted the
American bridging proposal the language
from the Israelis themselves has been a
a bit less emphatic than that although
the Israeli Prime Minister saying that
he was committed to this um proposal but
some suggestions within the Israeli
press that this has been perhaps more
mediation uh or negotiation between the
Americans and the Israelis to get to a
position than it has been between the
Israelis and Hamas so far the purpose
here in Egypt critically is to discuss
perhaps the main sticking point and that
is prime minister netanyahu's insistence
as he's put it that there remain Israeli
troops in the so-called Philadelphia
Corridor that part of the Gaza Strip in
the South that borders Egypt here um he
believes That's essential to Israel's
security so they can't be weapon
smuggling for Hamas to rearm itself as
for Hamas they say that's simply amount
to continued Israeli occupation and
therefore it is not an end to the war
the Egyptians are critical on this
because of course they share that border
with Gaza that will be a key component
of the discussions um between Mr blinkin
and president president CeCe here and
then we move to katar where um there
will be further discussions with um key
officials in Doha they of course like
the Egyptians crucial to the
negotiations and speaking directly to
Hamas Tom bitman there as he was saying
katar absolutely critical when it comes
to these talks so let's get the
perspective now of naah fani who is
former director of Qatari defense
intelligence joining us from Doha always
good to have you with us who at this
point is holding up the
ceasefire thank you Lucy for having me
well currently I think what's uh holding
up the ceasefire is that the negotiation
isn't over uh we've seen reports uh that
uh Israel agreed on bridging proposals
and then as you reported uh earlier the
Israeli media kind of Pok some holes
into that obviously the attacks today on
the the evacuation Center as I see the
numb in front of me growing to 12 killed
doesn't help that that news happened and
that thing happens in the same day um as
well as Hamas Hamas has to understand
that it won't get everything it needs
and I think qatar's job with the United
States and Egypt is to focus both
parties on three main points number one
the end of hostilities and and a
ceasefire number two release of all
hostages uh per a plan that agreed by by
both parties and number three
humanitarian Aid
making the perfect the enemy of the Good
Will neither help the Israelis or the
hostages or the Palestinians and the
civilians in Gaza but on that first
point how will it ever be overcome when
Israel wants to have a deal that will
allow it to continue the war whereas it
seems that Hamas wants a ceas file deal
that ends
it well that's the point if Israel wants
a deal without a deal that that is by
definition a non-deal um a lot of
Palestinians are suffering the families
of the hostages Israeli hostages are
suffering I think the Israelis and the
Palestinians represented here by Hamas
and Gaza have to reach the uh
understanding that they won't get
everything they want uh they won't get a
perfect solution but a a bridging
solution that could lead to a further uh
peace negotiation should be the goal
we're past we're way past a perfect
solution that was months in the past now
the the whole region is trying to avert
a regional conflict and and stop more
death and Destruction for Gaza and
hopefully return the hostages we have
seen this optimism though expressed by
Anthony blinkin and the US team it is
not been echoed by any of the other
parties how would you say you feel at
this moment are you optimistic that any
kind of deal can be
reached I think by Nature that we've
hadn't have this uh of an advance as per
the reports that we're getting in months
in just by that fact I am a bit
optimistic but very cautiously
optimistic because an optimism in
today's atmosphere and and and today's
um reality is different than optimism a
year ago uh today we have to be
optimistic while enduring a continuous
death in Gaza today 35 uh killed in Gaza
and and the number unfortunately is
going uh possible Widing conflict so
that type of optimism is I think what
the negotiators
the mediators have and what I have and I
think in the next couple of days we will
we will see if that optimism was well
placed or unfortunately another
opportunity has St between our fingers
noan it's always good to have your
thoughts and have you with us thank you
for joining us from Doha thank you",20240820

security agency a statement from the
hostages families Forum says that the
recovery of the bodies crucially
provides their families with necessary
closure the immediate Return of the
remaining 109 hostages can only be
achieved through a negotiated deal it
adds well this comes as the US Secretary
of State Anthony Lincoln has traveled to
Egypt as he continues to push for a
ceasefire and hostage release deal these
follow talks in Jerusalem yesterday
where Mr blinken said that Israel had
accepted what he called a bridging
proposal and he then urged Hamas to do
the same well a little earlier we were
joined by our correspondent John donison
who shared his Insight on this yes well
in a short statement from the Israeli
military and also Israel's intelligence
agency the shinb they said the six
bodies were recovered in carun in the
south of the Gaza Strip the six bodies
were yagev bab Alexander dansig avam
Munda yuram meta Heim Perry and nadav
Powell who was a British Israeli Citizen
and all apart from 79y old avam Munda
were already uh presumed to be dead it's
thought there are up to 70 hostages who
are still alive alive being held in Gaza
and in the last few moments we've had a
statement from Israel's prime minister
Benjamin netan who of course has faced
considerable criticism from some hostage
families for not doing enough to free
those who are being held and he said our
hearts grieve over this terrible loss
and this Grim news comes as there was
hope that some kind of bridging proposal
for a ceasefire deal would be taking
some form of shape Anthony blinkin the
US Secretary of State who is now in
Egypt hoping to push that forward seemed
a little bit more optimistic than
arguably Benjamin Netanyahu when it
comes to this bridging
proposal he did but I think the truth is
uh that the Americans and Anthony
blinkin are the only ones who seem to be
saying that this deal is close he said
in his statement after meeting prime
minister Netanyahu yesterday that Israel
had accepted and supported this
so-called bridging proposal to get to a
ceasefire and hostage release deal Mr
Netanyahu in his statement was far less
forthcoming he simply said it had been a
good and important meeting with Mr
blinken and Hamas for its part has also
been skeptical they of course are not
even taking part in these latest
ceasefire negotiations at the moment
they've said any uh suggestion that
there has been progress is an illusion
now as you say Mr blinkin is in Egypt
today and then later katar and he's
going to be uh getting those two
countries to continue to put pressure on
Hamas to sign up to this deal but I
think the truth is that while the
Americans might be working towards a
certain timetable I think they'd like to
get a deal done while the Democratic
Convention is taking place at the moment
and certainly before the US presidential
election in November I don't think that
the key players in the region and that
is prime minister Netanyahu and the
Hamas leader in Gaza Yaya sinoa there's
no sense really that they are working to
the same
timetable John Donis there reporting
from uh Jerusalem there Anthony blinkin
of course right now in Egypt so where as
and when we get more details we're just
monitoring the live shot there but as

course bring that to you",20240820

putting uh this bridging proposal on the
table to try to bring Israel and Hamas
together to overcome the outstanding
issues that following on from this Doha
Summit last week where you had the US
and Cat and Egyptian mediators present
along with an Israeli negotiating team
now if you look um at the comments while
the Americans are sounding positive I
mean really from the the latest
statements from Israel and and from
Hamas as well um you know not that same
positivity um certainly from the Israeli
Prime Minister's office um they're
saying that Hamas is sticking to its
positions of of refusal um Hamas has
really accused the prime minister's
office of adding uh new conditions uh to
the negotiations which they say are
meant to sabotage the talks I mean you
can look at the different sort of
sticking points as they emerged coming
out from from both sides um really first
of all moving from the first phase of
the three-phase plan um which is
supposed to be the ceasefire and hostage
release deal with Palestinian prisoners
being released uh from Israeli jails as
well uh and then moving from that first
six week phase into the second phase
which should be uh working towards a
full ceasefire uh that is a problematic
area you also have um where Israeli
forces would remain in the Gaza Strip
which strategically important locations
um Israeli forces want to remain in uh
after the Gaza War Hamas of course has
been demanding a complete Israeli
withdrawal from Gaza and and then also
so we're we understand there are issues
around um the Palestinian prisoners that
will be released from Israeli jails as
part of all this as well you landel
thank you very much over to Tom now and
you've been traveling with the US state
department parties and there's been
ramping up the language but what other
pressure can the US put on on making
sure that these parties come to
resolution well the way they are trying
to apply pressure is by creating a sense
of urgency and you heard it there with
Anthony blinkin saying this is maybe he
said the last chance and that there
should be no more excuses I think the
problem is that that sense of urgency
and in effect a deadline being imposed
by the Americans looking ahead to a week
from now where they're hoping to get
some kind of break through and to get it
over the line as Anthony blinkin has
said that deadline is being imposed by
Washington rather than the sides at War
here and that matters because for there
to be enough incentive for both both the
Israeli Prime Minister and the leaders
of Hamas to clinch this deal they have
to feel that sense of urgency too and my
senses we're not really at that point
and that's why I think the American
optimism is really outmatching what you
feel on the ground here the approach of
Mr blinkin who is by his nature a pretty
cautious US Secretary of State has been
quite a traditional one which is to show
sort of tough love when it comes to the
Israelis in general and Benjamin netan
who in particular is not one for the
sort of diplomatic arm wrench the
question now is about how tough and how
much love and I think um we're going to
see that over the next few hours he's
due to hold u a small press conference
here in Tel Aviv this afternoon I doubt
we're going to be hearing particularly
sort of critical messages against Mr
Netanyahu himself as opposed to many of
his critics both at home and abroad who
believe that he is sort of stringing the
Americans along uh for his own political
survival Mr Netanyahu himself says that
he's just simply pushing for a tough
deal against Hamas in order to ensure um
Israel's safety but the fact remains
that the Americans do not have a strong
track record in this conflict in terms
of
leveraging um the Israelis to change
course at critical moments when they
have wanted to now they dispute that
really uh when you push them on this
they believe that they did get the
Israelis to do more about opening up um
humanitarian assistance um and also to
to pull back the um scale of the
offensive particularly in the south of
the Gaza Strip but I think many critics
of the Americans will say they simply
haven't applied enough leverage and now
you have what they are themselves
describing as a critical moment where
they have to push both sides but in this
part of the trip Benjamin Netanyahu over
the line as they put it make him take a
deal and stop trying to squeeze more
concessions out of it I don't have the
sense yet that they're really doing that
and Tom briefly where does Mr linoln go
go next after this on to
Egypt yeah um we head to Egypt um
tomorrow uh crucially there will be you
know the Egyptians are one of the most
important mediators in all of the this
along with the kares um the role there
is that they're able to pass messages
much more directly uh to Hamas and Gaza
uh and so that is another part of
applying this pressure and the Egyptians
also crucial when it comes to that
sticking point that yolan was talking
about around the south of the Gaza Strip
because Mr Netanyahu said that he
insists that Israel will remain present
uh along the so-called Philadelphia
Corridor that's basically um the border
with Egypt Israel says that's to stop
smuggling and to stop Hamas rearming
Hamas say it simply means continued
Israeli occupation and therefore not an
end to the war so this is a fundamental
Point um Brett mcgurk who's one of the
key Administration
envoys uh here in the region has been
working on that with the Egyptians over
the last couple of weeks trying to
create this sort of bridging um proposal
which is meant to bring the two sides
together on this their statements both
of them last night were very defiant um
sticking to their positions digging in
that may be in part tactical in terms of
negotiations but no signs yet of a
breakthrough on that so I think what
he'll be doing in Egypt will be crucial
to that particular Point Tom bitman
thank you very much indeed",20240819

including the US they've described the

serious and constructive said they were
taking place in a positive atmosphere

the Middle East and President Biden has
said the prospect of a ceasefire deal is
in Gaza is getting closer but is not
there yet it comes after the US Qatar
and Egypt put forward a new proposal for
a ceasefire and the release of the
remaining Israeli hostages Hamas
reportedly have rejected the new
conditions proposed at the talks in Doha
the three mediators issued a statement
on the second day of talks that
suggested that the new proposal closes
the remaining gaps The Talk have paused
but will resume next week earlier the
UK's foreign secretary David Lamy said
that he was told by Israeli ministers
that they hope they're on the cusp of a
deal over the war in Gaza he was
visiting Jerusalem with the French
foreign minister Stefan sour and Israel
announced that the US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin and the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected
to meet in person on Monday meanwhile
the UN has described a deadly attack by
Israeli settlers on a village in the
occupied West Bank as horrific the
settlers set cars and houses a blaze as
they descended on the village of jit
armed with batons rocks and Molotov
cocktails at least one Palestinian was
killed and others seriously injured
thousands gathered in jit for the
funeral of the man killed in the settler
attack David Lamy condemned the violence
as abhorent the scenes
overnight of the burning and the
torching of
buildings of the the molotov
cocktails thrown at
cars of the widespread
Rampage and chasing of people from their
homes is a Bor and I condemn it in the
strongest of terms the UN has recorded
hundreds of settler attacks since the
Hamas assault on Israel last October BBC
verifies Merlin Thomas has been looking
at video posted on social media of this
latest latest incident this was a scene
in the village of zet in the occupied
West Bank after a group of Israeli
settlers reportedly attacked various
properties and vehicles the Palestinian
Health Ministry has said that at least
one person has been killed we've been
investigating online footage of the
attack and its aftermath to try to piece
together what
happened the village is located here
just west of Nablus in the West Bank and
CCTV has emerged online showing a group
of individuals setting a car on fire
outside a house and the Tim stamp on
this footage shows 1949 which appears to
be consistent with what eyewitnesses
told the BBC of the attack taking place
just after Sunset which is around 1920
note also these distinctive arches here
which we use to verify other footage
like this clip here we see those same
arches and the arrangement of the nearby
buildings and roads confirm the location
of this house to be on the southern edge
of the village now on this CCTV footage
take note of the pillar here and the
empty baby walker cuz this V video shows
two men setting fire to another building
in the village we've confirmed this by
matching those details that I just
pointed out to you with verified image
of the aftermath note again the baby
walker here and the pillar there prime
minister netanyahu's office has
condemned the attack and said that those
responsible for any criminal act will be
caught and prosecuted let's speak now to
our correspondent Jenny Hill who's in
Tel Aviv and Jenny there have been quite
a few developments in the last few hours
if you could talk us through them uh
most of all in the last few minutes
we've just had a a statement from
President Biden saying that the Gaza Tru
deel is closer than we have ever been
but it's not there
yet yeah I think there are two key
takeaways here first of all reaching
that deal is going to take more time you
know these negotiations were dubbed the
last ditch Summit now mediators are
saying they're going to have to get
their technical teams to keep working
before officials resume their talks in
Cairo by the end of next week secondly
the US and the other mediators Qatar and
Egypt are determined to get this deal
past the post and that I think is why
we're seeing the US Secretary of State
blink due to visit the region in the
coming days due to hold talks with
Benjamin nanyu the Israeli Prime
Minister uh on Monday we've heard from
Hamas too um first of all the statement
that was released by negotiators today
said that a proposal had been put
forward which um built on recent points
of agreement and bridged remaining gaps
well Hamas a senior Hamas leader has
told the BBC that this does not include
a commitment to Implement what was
agreed upon early in July now Hamas had
not participated in this round of talks
because they protested um against what
they said was Israel's imposition of new
conditions on existing proposals they
said they were not prepared to enter new
negotiations so everything hangs
essentially in the air right now but the
negotiators who met in Doha know that
time is not on their side first of all
there's the human cost of this war just
yesterday the Hamas ran Health Ministry
in Gaza said that the number of dead was
now past 40,000 since the war broke out
in October and those negotiators know
that achieving a ceasefire and hostage
return deal is crucial if they're to
stop the conflict in Gaza from spilling
over into a wider allout Regional War
they're also painfully conscious that
Iran and its proxies including Hezbollah
have threatened to attack Israel is in
retaliation for the recent assassination
of hamas's political leader in tan um
Ismael hania it's hoped that while a
ceasefire and hostage deal remains a
prospect that attack could be mitigated
limited Iran might be persuaded not to
carry it out at all okay thanks very
much for now that's Jenny Hill for us
there in Tel Aviv let's speak now to
Laura Blumenfeld a Middle East analyst
and former senior policy adviser on the
state Department's Israel Palestinian
negotiating team thanks very much to you
uh for joining us and just seeing some
of the the quotes that are coming
through just in the last few minutes
just shows how complicated this is we've
got President Biden saying we're not
there yet but we are closer than we ever
been and I've Just Seen A uh Reuters
report saying quoting a Hamas official a
senior Hamas official speaking to
Reuters saying quoter saying the US
Administration is trying to create a
false atmosphere what is your an
analysis of of where these talks are at
at the
moment uh well if you're asking me for a
headline I would say the question is is
the US Qatari Egyptian bridging proposal
a bridge too far and you're right to be
concerned because as I learned working
at the state department under President
Obama on the Israeli Palestinian
negotiating team um the devil is in the
details um so we can that we can breathe
easy over the weekend I you know I hope
fingers crossed that there'll be no
retaliatory strike but we are going to
be on edge at least until next week when
those those lower level teams are
hammering out the details um the
principal negotiators are going to
reconvene next week and that's when
we'll really have an answer and do you
have an understanding of what those gaps
were that they they say this new
statement closes those remaining gaps do
you know what they
were well look there's a lot of secrecy
surrounding it um some of them are are
kind of obvious which is whether Hamas
can rearm um the Israelis are saying
they need to control the Philadelphia
quar which is the southern border of
Gaza along the lines with Egypt so that
they don't have to fight this fight
again in a year in three years in four
years they want it to be kind of one and
done um you know Hamas is asking for a
permanent ceasefire Israel is interested
more in a pause I say it's all language
because you know they're at permanent
War these two parties and so a real
ceasefire is not even realistic a
permanent peace well and there's a
conflict at the top of the Israeli
government isn't there in in terms of
you have these disagreements within the
team at the top we've got we've had yav
Galant the defense minister saying
certain things about criticizing this
this aim of total Victory as being
nonsense and then Benjamin Netanyahu
saying that that is what he's after you
know total Victory um it's so
complicated isn't in terms of of of that
side of things the political situation
at the top in
Israel well nothing quite focuses the
mind like a gun at your your head and a
gun is at netanyahu's head right now the
only way that Iran and Hezbollah can
save face right the Western Nations have
said to them Stand Down in terms of
retaliation for those twin
assassinations the only way though that
they can save face is is if they can say
they forced netanyahu's hand and there's
now a ceasefire I have confidence I
guess what gives me hope is actually the
people of the region Israel as you all
know is a rockus democracy it's you know
from the right to the left they don't
hold out their opinions they were
standing there with megaphones as the
party uh negotiating team departed for
Doha saying don't come home unless you
bring the hostages the same can be said
of the Lebanese people they can still
taste the dust from the rubble of 2006
when Israel went to war with Hezbollah
they don't want to see their economy and
their infrastructure decimated and in
Iran they just elected what they
considered to be a moderate president
who was interested in in improving
relations with the West so they're
listening to their people across the
region we'll get that ceasefire what do
you think though that Benjamin Netanyahu
is going to accept uh this this deal I
mean do you think that that that
influence will
work well watch the meeting on Monday
with secretary blinkin um you know our
defense secretary uh Austin has been in
close contact with Galant we know that
that's a very smooth working
relationship it's been harder for
secretary blinkin he's got to navigate
the internal politics let's see the
looks on their faces when they come out
of the meeting on Monday and don't
forget that the Democrat National
Convention is also starting on Monday
there's a lot of pressure on this
Administration and to bring it to a
peaceful conclusion part of it is you
know electoral politics it's an ugly
kind of optics for there to be people
demonstrating outside of their own
convention from their own actual
supporters yeah okay thank you so much
for talking to us I really appreciate
your time that's Laura blo and felt them
and least analy thank you",20240816
yNeFh-sj7Ek,Gaza ceasefire talks resume for second day in Qatar | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza ceasefire talks resume for second day in Qatar  BBC News.jpg,"hello I'm Lauren Taylor we start in the
Middle East Gaza ceasefire talks are due
to resume in Kat after what a Us
official has described as a constructive
first day of discussions on Thursday
Israeli representatives are attending
but Hamas which runs Gaza has stayed
away accusing Israel of changing its
terms since previous rounds of talks a
Hamas official also reiterated that any
agreement must achieve a comprehensive
ceasefire a complete Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza and the return of the placed
on Thursday the Hamas run Health
Ministry reported that the number of
Palestinians killed in Gaza has passed
40,000 although Israel disputes the
figure later the families of Israeli
hostages still held captive in Gaza
following hamas's October the 7th
attacks gathered to demand a deal to
secure their release with several
thousand marching in Tel Aviv a little
earlier our Middle East correspondent
Yulan Nell gave me a sense of how the
seire talks have gone so
far well we had a White House spokesman
say
late yesterday that they had got off to
a promising start the Israeli media this
morning has been talking about guarded
optimism saying it's a positive sign
that the Israeli delegation that was
sent the negotiating team uh decided to
stay overnight despite what they see um
as some security risk in Doha and that
they are continuing these talks with us
cat and Egyptian mediators uh today now
Hamas as we were saying has not sent a
delegation along to the these indirect
talks um but of course Hamas leaders are
present in Doha and what mediators have
been saying is they have ways um to get
messages back to Hamas um so this is not
seen as as being um the obstacle that it
may appear to be and you land in the
meantime development on the West Bank
Israeli political leaders including
Benjamin Netanyahu and two far-right
ministers have condemned a large group
of Jewish settlers who went on the
Rampage in a village in the occupied
West Bank setting houses and cars on
fire settlers some of them wearing masks
were armed with batons rocks and molto
Cocktails as they descended on the
village of jit at least one Palestinian
was killed another seriously injured and
it's a reminder that youan that there's
violence quite often in the West Bank
that is less well reported than events
in
Gaza that's right although we've had
these strong comments coming from
Israeli leaders the president calling it
a pogram for example um this is by far
you know far from an isolated incident
um we have the UN AA agency which has
been monitoring attacks on Palestinian
civilians by extremist settlers saying
that since the start of the war in Gaza
they have um found something like
1,250 attacks by settlers um on
Palestinians and there have been on top
of that you know something like um 17 18
Palestinian communities where people
have been forced by by settler
harassment away from their homes um
those communities in some places um
having uh settlers move in setting up a
temporary outposts there those are uh
sort of seeds of settlements um that are
not even authorized by the Israeli
authorities all settlements seen as
being illegal under international law we
had the White House also coming out
quickly to condemn uh what is happen
saying that such violence against
Palestinian civilians was unacceptable
and must stop there have been lots of
complaints from the International
Community from Israeli NOS as well there
is a sense of impunity when it comes to
a lot of these attacks uh you do not see
prosecutions by the Israeli
authorities let's speak now to Nomi
bakov a Middle East expert and Associate
fellow of International Security program
at chattam house who's in our
Westminster Studio thanks very much
indeed for being with us I just wonder
what your impression is of the the talks
that have restarted in Doha and the
progress so far and How likely it is
that there'll be some kind of a a
concrete outcome this time round thank
you very much Lauren for having me um on
the show this morning I think that the
talks are very serious I think we're at
a critical stage we're at a make or
break stage and I think that is known
not only to the three mediators Qatar
Egypt and um the us but also to Israel
and Hamas and therefore um we are at a
um pivotal moment a Breaking Point and
I'm cautiously optimistic I think talks
are going well and the lines have been
drawn dra they're very very clear and
hopefully there will be an outcome of a
an agreement on a framework uh it's not
unlikely that all the details will be
ironed out today but it is very much my
hope and the hope of the mediators and
the parties that a framework will be
agreed and thereby the implementation
will be what is going to um need further
discussions Beyond today now Hass are
not attending directly but they are
based Doha some of the some of their
political uh fellows are based in in
Doha so they presumably will get some of
the feedback from the talks do you think
it makes any difference that they're not
uh directly attending no I don't
actually I think that given that the
Hamas leadership is based in Doha they
are essentially a part of the uh
negotiation but in in any event the
Israelis and the Hamas Niks are not
sitting in the same room with the
negotiators so they are being um updated
regularly by the mediators and feedback
is coming in so I think yes they announc
that they're not sending anyone but
they're actually there what do you
expect in terms of any kind of
retaliation from Iran or hisbah for the
uh killings of the of isma Hanah and
also the hisbah commander recently there
was some talk that perhaps if a
ceasefire in Gaza were achieved that
might be be taken off the table do you
think that they will still go ahead
anyway with some kind of form of
retaliation well I think everything
hinges on the outcome of these current
negot negotiations so um hisbah have
vowed to um retaliate for the
assassination of H shuker for which
Israel took responsibility and um Iran
have vowed to retaliate for the
assassination of isma Hanah the
political leader of Hamas on their soil
you know into Iran two weeks just over
two weeks ago that said um there have
been tremendous diplomatic efforts both
behind the scenes and openly to ensure
that no retaliation takes place um at
and that a chance is before a cease a
chance for a ceasefire agreement is
being given and the Chance is now so I
think everyone everything hinges on the
outcome of this particular negotiation
if an agreement a framework agreement
will be reached I don't think we will
see an Iranian and Hezbollah immediate
retaliation if an agreement is not
reached on the other hand then I think
we're all doomed and I think we're going
to see a very serious coordinated uh
retaliation with between uh um Iran
Iran's many long arms proxies in the
region and hisbah noi Yakov thank you
very much indeed for joining us thank
you thank you Lauren",20240816

BBC News
Jerusalem well let's now to speak to
Jenny Hill who is in Tel Aviv Jenny uh
these figures striking indeed and no
doubt as added impetus as if it were
needed to attempts to strike a peace
deal
yeah you're quite right this will lend a
new urgency um to the negotiators who
are gathering in Doha trying to hammer
out that ceasefire and hostage return
deal um 40,000 plus deaths now reported
by the gazen Run Ministry of Health um
it's worth of course emphasizing that
Israel does not allow International
journalists including the BBC into Gaza
so we can't independently verif y that
figure but um the the numbers given out
by the Ministry of Health um are
considered credible by the World Health
Organization although Israel has
repeatedly disputed them um Hamas um and
the Ministry of Health have always said
that the vast majority of those killed
and injured in this war are civilians
Israel told the BBC quite recently that
around 15,000 of the people killed are
in its view terrorist that's the word
that it uses but you know once again
it's a reminder of the ongoing suffering
of people in Gaza we learned recently
that some 60% of the buildings in the
strip have been um significantly damaged
or destroyed um so a reminder to the
negotiators who are in Doha that this is
all about human
lives Jenny what are the prospects now
um for some sort of deal given the
backdrop that we are seeing
and uh the risks associated with not
striking a peace
deal well those negotiators know that
the stakes quite simply couldn't be
higher quite apart from trying to bring
about an end to that war in Gaza most
here consider that a ceasefire and
hostage return agreement will stop that
conflict from boiling over into a much
wider Regional allout War as you know
these talks are coming at a time of
extremely high tension in the Middle
East the US has been really pushing to
get this deal across the line um the
director of the CIA is expected to
participate in the talks there's been a
lot of urgent diplomacy gone on in
recent days Israel itself has sent a
high level delegation to the talks um
among the people represented are the
Chiefs of both the intelligence and
Security Services now Hamas says it
won't participate either Direct or
indirectly to date it hasn't ever sent
people to participate directly the
current stance is based on its protest
that as it says Benjamin Netanyahu has
introduced new conditions uh in addition
to existing proposals they say that's
not on um he denies that but um Hamas
will be kept informed we understand by
mediators mediations of course led by um
Qatar and Egypt so those talks are
expected to go on it's hard really to
say what outcome we're likely to see one
of the unknowables here is the impact on
those neg negotiations of a change of
leadership at the top of Hamas following
the assassination of the group's
political leader isma hania in Teran a
couple of weeks ago um we've seen a
successor appointed in the shape of uh
Yaya sinoa um he's believed to still be
in hiding in Gaza he's also widely
considered to be a much more Hardline

L79KqCN4FHI,Kamala Harris says 'too many' civilian deaths in Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Kamala Harris says 'too many' civilian deaths in Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"the US vice president and Democratic
presidential candidate kamla Harris has
added her voice to International
condemnation of the loss of civilian
life in Saturday's deadly Israeli air
strike on a School Compound in Gaza
around a thousand displaced Palestinians
had been Sheltering in the building at
the time of the Dawn strike the Israeli
military insists that it used Precision
missiles to Target what it claims was a
Hamas Command Center in the compound the
director of a local hospital said that
the facility had received 70 bodies and
the remains of at least 10 more people
Israel disputes those figures well this
is what Miss Harris said on the campaign
Trail take a
listen you know yet again there far too
many civilians who've been killed I mean
Israel has a right to go after the
terrorists that are Hamas but as I have
said many many times they also have um I
believe an important responsibility to
avoid civilian
casualties well the Biden Administration
has has also responded to news of the
attack a White House National Security
Council spokesperson says quote we are
deeply concerned about reports of
Civilian casualties we're in touch with
our Israeli counterparts and we are
asking for further details we know Hamas
has been using schools as locations to
gather and operate out of but we have
also said repeatedly and consistently
that Israel must take measures to
minimize civilian harm just hours before
the bombing the US state department
announced that it's releasing $3.5
billion do worth of weapons for Israel
part of a larger Aid package approved
earlier this year by Congress now this
report from Jenny Hill contains images
that you may find
distressing anguish
bewilderment Israel struck Before Dawn
shattering the sanctity of morning
prayer thousands of displaced civilians
were Sheltering here a place of Refuge
suddenly a scene of
Carnage there isn't any safe place this
woman cries no place is
safe where is the world he asks why does
it stay silent in the face of these
crimes how many times have gaza's
ravaged walls echoed to the sound of a
mother's grief um says three of her sons
were
killed I'm 80 she sobs I've never seen
anything like this before the way
they're bombing us is Like An
Earthquake but Israel claims this was a
legitimate Target that the school housed
a Hamas Command Center in a statement on
social media an Israeli Defense Force
spokesman said around 20 Hamas and
Islamic Jihad militants were operating
out of the compound Israel's repeatedly
struck school buildings in recent weeks
each time they insist they conceal Hamas
bases and each each time they insist
they strive to minimize civilian
casualties the strike comes at a time of
heightened tension in the Middle East
International governments are urging
Hamas and Israel to agree a ceasefire
and hostage return deal as soon as
possible and extensive diplomacy is
ongoing to try to stop the conflict in
Gaza from spiraling into an allout
Regional
war and as Palestinians mourn dead and
take shelter for another fearful night
it's hard to see hope in the ruins of
Gaza Jenny Hill BBC News Tel
Aviv well I've been speaking to Muhammad
Taha from BBC Arabic who explained the
amount of pressure Israel was coming
under lots of condemnation International
condemnation to the amount of Civilian
death in this strike
Algeria the Arab country is re Westing a
an urgent meeting for the UN Council to
discuss the matter and lots of calls to
Israel to uh constrain H Israel however
continued Shilling some parts of Rafa
khun and asked uh lots of parts in in
eastern kanun to evacuate we expecting
more strike in the coming hours this is
what's happening normally when they ask
people to evacuate Hamas denied uh
completely uh that there were Fighters
uh of them in in the compound or in the
prayer area Israel issued a statement H
named uh 20 people or so who are Israel
saying they are belong to Hamas and they
were in the compound isra Hamas said
these Fighters were killed previously in
in in in previous occasion and there are
clear instructions for their Fighters
not to mix with the civilians and even
if there were fighters in the in this
area they wouldn't be praying with the
people in the school you mentioned that
International condemnation from the
likes of Algeria also the White House
and uh vice president Kam Harris saying
too many civilians are being killed in
this conflict the possibility of a un
security council meeting is that likely
to exert any pressure of course uh
because now there is a mounting pressure
on Israel to return back to the
negotiating table uh on Thursday as
suggested by the United States if the
United if the UN Council would come and
and have a a statement that's calling
both parties to return back to the
negotiating table that would be uh a
positive uh and it it could also uh it
could also um uh Place pressure on
Israel to avoid such uh such U targeting
to uh shelter places because it it
became a systematic uh practice from the
Israeli Army that they would Target
schools hospitals and places that they
are taking uh shelter and even though
places that the Israel army would
suggest that they are safe places but
they return back and strike these places
and also reports today amid concerns of
a broad Regional War an exchange of fire
between Hezbollah and Israel what more
can you tell us yeah this is uh this is
an uh another front that is open now in
in this war we saw that hisbah struck
new
places
uh mahat alone and safad in Northern
Israel and uh wide areas in Al Jal in
Northern Israel also Israel rep
by by by by by shelling some parts in
southern Lebanon like Al and Ma Sal
there are fears as always that hasah
would would retaliate for the killing of
fad shuk their leader and also the
expected reply from Iran for the killing
of isma H well let's go straight to our
correspondent Jenny Hill who is in Tel
Aviv good to see you there Jenny um just
bring us up to date with the
latest well um the US arguably Israel's
greatest Ally and of course a major
supplier of weapons uh has expressed its
dismay at the strike as that
International condemnation mounts we
heard from vice president carela Harris
who said that yet again too many
civilians uh have been killed she added
that Israel has the right to go after
Hamas but it also Bears a special
responsib ability to avoid civilian
casualties the Israeli military
continues to insist that it used
Precision missiles to Target what it
claims was a Hamas Command Center within
the school compound um it's published a
list of the names of 19 people killed in
the strike which it says were either
Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives um the
big question of course as you've been
asking all morning I imagine is where
does this leave any hope of a fire and
hostage return deal because of course
the strike came at a time of very
heightened tension in the Middle East
with International the International
Community urging both Hamas and Israel
to get to the negotiating table um and
agree upon a ceasefire and hostage
return deal Cara Harris herself
reiterated those demands um but listen
to what Hamas had to say in reaction to
the strike they described it as a
horrific crime and said that Israel in
effect had escalated the um conflict so
this morning in Gaza as people continue
to mourn their dead absorb the shock and
of course pray for those injured the
prospect of Peace seems very remote
indeed and Jenny how are those comments
from the likes of Harris the White House
we know that Algeria for example also
calling for a un security council
meeting how are they being received
there in Israel I imagine it depends on
who you speak to
well of course um I mean Israel says
it's going after Hamas um as a matter of
of self-defense um the Israeli leader
Benjamin Netanyahu has said you know his
aim is to completely dismantle the
organization um a lot of the Israeli
press um are publishing what the Israeli
military are saying that this was um in
effect a legitimate Target um we've seen
a string of similar attacks on schools
in Gaza by the Israeli military in
recent weeks and each time we see a very
familiar um pattern the Israeli military
will say well um there was a Hamas
Command Center or base within that
school schools of course are no longer
being used as Schools they're largely
being used um as shelters by the many
many displaced people of Gaza um but the
Israeli military say each time they go
out of their way to avoid civilian
casualties with for example the use of
precision missiles and the use of
intelligence that they've gathered um so
we are once again in a familiar routine
I think what perhaps makes this
particular strike Stand Out is the
number of dead of course that is why we
are seeing such International outrage
and and calls for an urgent return to
the negotiating table our correspondent
Jenny Hill in Tel Aviv Jenny thank you
very much",20240811
M1u1ECx_Nlw,Dozens reported killed in Israeli strike on Gaza school building | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Dozens reported killed in Israeli strike on Gaza school building  BBC News.jpg,"and that is gaza's Civil Defense Agency
saying that about 100 people have been
killed in an Israeli air strike on a
school on Gaza
City well we can go straight over to our
correspondent Jenny Hill who's in Tel
Aviv Jenny good to have you with us just
bring us up to date with the
latest yeah this is being described as a
horrific Massacre by gaza's defense um
agency Civil Defense Agency which is run
by Hamas they say that three Israeli
Rockets struck the school in the darj
district of Gaza City this morning they
say that the school was being used as a
shelter for displaced people and there
are suggestions that those people may
have been at morning prayer when the
attack happened it is then reported that
a fire broke out following the strike
with emergency workers uh scrambling to
rescue people from inside the building
now the Israeli military has confirmed
the strike but they say that the school
was housing a Hamas command center it's
the second strike on a gazan school in
as many days and in fact Israel has
repeatedly struck schools in Gaza in the
last week or two each time the military
insists that they are in effect pursuing
legitimate targets that the schools are
housing Hamas bases they also insist
that through the use of precision
missiles and intelligence they are doing
their best to mitigate the loss of
civilian life
our correspondent there Jenny Hill in
Tel Aviv Jenny thanks for bringing us
the
latest and I am joined in the studio now
by Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic who's
also been following the very latest uh
Muhammad we've seen some really
devastating scenes this morning many too
graphic too horrific for us to be able
to broadcast fully but just tell us more
about what you've been seeing there and
apparently the velocity of the these
smart missiles that Israel used is
causing the bodies to be uh to be uh cut
and the bodies to be un un
identified uh actually we saw uh
different shelling in Gaza so we saw
this shelling with heavy bombs that are
destroying the whole buildings
completely uh and we saw these smart uh
bombs that are targeting very very
precise uh targets uh so the difference
between having a massive attack on a
place that could Target the the the
5,000 people who were uh were sheltered
in this uh in this school that would
have left us with hundreds of people uh
dead but targeting the prayer area
precisely in the school left the school
building in large intact but the the the
building that has been affected uh is is
the prayer area that and left more than
100 people died there were uh we
understood that there were around 300
worshippers uh praying at that time when
this High Velocity bum uh three rockets
as we understand um um strike that
prayer area and caused this amount of
death but unfortunately the horrific
scenes that we saw and that we cannnot
uh U
presented to viewers is because this
high velocity of of missiles Muhammad as
we know uh Israeli authorities say that
they were targeting a Hamas Command
Center within that school so I just
wonder do we know then whether there was
the possibility for these civilians who
presumably were seeking shelter to
receive any kind of warning about this
in many cases the Israeli forces would
issue a warning to the the people uh
before uh targeting a building or a
school or a hospital they ask people to
EV evacuate they ask people to move from
fighting area but apparently in this
time Israel wanted really to Target uh
Hamas members who are were apparently
praying at the time we understand that
Hamas members are religious people and
they are an ideology they are fighting
for a cause fighting for sake of as they
say sake of God sake of their Nation
sake of of of having a a an independent
state so they would be praying at that
time in the morning prayer which is
happening with their local times between
uh 4: and 5 a.m. in the morning so when
Israel just struck that uh prayer area a
few minutes after the beginning of the
area they would know that there are
members of Hamas were praying at that
area so they didn't care much of giving
a warning they wanted that
Target no matter how civilians would die
in that attack and know Muhammad you and
I have been looking at images throughout
the course of the morning families
crowding around people that they have
lost people who are injured there at the
hospital but I just wonder at this stage
in the conflict realistically what kind
of hope is there for the health system
for these hospitals to actually be able
to really save the lives of people who
have been injured to treat people when
we know that the health system of course
um has really been facing the
consequences of this ongoing conflict
unfortunately the health system in Gaza
cannot deal with such incidents there is
an only one Hospital working in Gaza
which is alahi hospital is partially
working uh the hospital that we saw
picture of is sha is not working
properly alifa compound is out of
service al- madani hospital is out of
service there are many hospitals that
are out of service I heard reports that
are saying many doctors are were
arrested by the Israeli forces many uh
doctors were killed this
system relying so much on the foreign
aid or also the doctors that are
volunteering to come from foreign
countries or other countries to come and
help in their leave time or in in their
free time but unfortunately the
hospitals they do not have uh enough
equipment uh enough medications or
enough facilities to deal with that and
this is the biggest biggest question now
if there are men more than 100 people
died there are uh maybe a a similar
number of injured people who cannot find
any uh Medical Aid and unless uh the
world would would do some something for
these people by by by rushing to to save
their lives and and and making sure that
they are civilians Worth to be lived
live and give them give them uh the
opportunity to to to heal and and
continue with their lives and viewers
will just be able to see there on their
screens the very latest pictures there
of the scene at that school there in
Gaza Muhammad Taha from BBC Arabic
across the very latest developments
in this story as ever we thank you for
being with
us well we can speak now to I'm in the
professor of Middle Eastern studies at
the Australian National University thank
you very much for being with us um we
know that more ceasefire talks were
expected to start next week in light of
what we've been seeing and what we've
just been discussing there with our
correspondent Muhammad that strike on
the school in Gaza uh over 100 people k
according to Hamas authorities where
does that leave the situation in your
assessment this further complicates the
process of negotiating ceasefire and it
is a slap in the face of all those
countries and that is Egypt Qatar the
United States United Arab amates which
have really wanted a seire to be
inforced and I I it is very clear that
that Israeli leadership does not want
ceasefire and they are still determined
uh on their original aim that they must
really wipe out U Hamas but in the
process they're also killing so many
civilians
now and and it's that's why the whole
thing is become so horrific and the
Israeli attack on this school really
comes on the top of uh attacking two
other schools in the last week which
have resulted in a killing uh of scores
of innocent children which basically
amounts to an Israeli policy of trying
to wipe out the second generation of
gazans so that they are not going to be
able to uh Prevail in the future and as
we know Israel has said that it is
targeting a Hamas Command Center at a
school there but just taking a look at
the picture more broadly we know that
Yahya sinoa now the head of Hamas all of
these things taken together how do you
think this is comp
licated the possibility for peace for
any kind of meaningful breakthrough
during those upcoming ceas fire
talks I mean as you said it is making it
very complicated and this is the we were
told by the Israelis months ago that
they cleared hamos out of the Gaza City
and yet they keep continuing bombing
Gaza cities and also all those areas
which they have said that they have uh
destroyed Hamas and how long they going
to really continue to do that they can
always claim that there is Hamas members
somewhere and as a result they can kill
also hundreds of innocent people and
this is what is really happening and I
think in the view of many analysts this
constitute what what you what can be
called State terrorism I mean this is
what Israel has been trying to do and
it's be become extremely provocative and
and basically trying to inflame not only
the Palestinians but also all those
people who sympathize with the
Palestinian cause in in the Arab world
and the Muslim world and of course as we
know the US UK among those governments
uh which view Hamas as a terror
organization as well um I just want to
talk about the broader backdrop of this
um and that is of course Israel waiting
to see if an attack from Iran Rises how
closer do you think this war could be
edging towards spiraling into a broader
conflict here well it is really aging
towards that and uh of course uh there
is a lot of pressure on Iranian
government at the moment uh to restrain
itself but at the same time not the
equal amount of pressure has been put by
the United States and other allies of
Israel to restrain Israel from these
provocative actions uh Israel is has
continued to Target uh um hisb figur uh
amamos figures as well as Iranian
commanders and sites and that does not
really serve the cause of bringing about
peace and stability uh I think we are at
a flash point at the moment and if Iran
and hisb uh carry out their promise of
responding to to Israeli attacks uh then
we will see the beginning of uh a major
regional inter Inferno that nobody may
be able to control it at the end and I
think this is uh the this is now the
right time for the United States
particularly for the Biden
Administration to really pull Israel
into line and they can only do that by
stopping supplying of arms to Israel
which enable Israel to continue this not
only against Hamas and Gaza but also
targeting uh other uh supporters of uh
Palestinian cause in the region you
mentioned there the Biden campaign I
just wonder how you think that this will
be viewed internationally cognizant of
the fact that the Biden Administration
um is now also looking at a Harris
campaign do you anticipate any pivot in
strategy from the US bearing in mind it
is the close IST Ally of
Israel well Camila Harris has voiced
stronger support for ceas fire and also
observation of uh human rights by
Israelis and Gaza uh and of course that
is irritated to the leadership
particularly prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu uh and I think this sort of
Massacre uh cannot really help uh the
situation as far as the Democrats are
concerned and I think now the Democratic
candidates will have to really come out
and to express their horror about the
whole thing but then on the other on the
other hand you have the Republican
candidate the former prime minister to
Trump who has said that uh if he wins
the election then uh um he will give the
whole of the West Bank and Gaza to
Israel so there is a a real uh debate
going on in the United States at the
moment and but Israel Lobby is also very
active in the United States to make sure
that only those who are elected that
support or the Israel and it remains
absolutely committed to Israel uh
Supremacy in the region and we should
just say uh there that Israel once again
says that it was targeting a Hamas
Command Center in a school we are
nevertheless seeing a very high civilian
casualty number Aman cyel professor of
Middle Eastern studies at the Australian
National University we thank you for
your time my pleasure",20240810

Northern Israel are preparing for a
potential conflict with the
iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah
the port city was badly hit during the
second Lebanon war in 2006 and is
expected to be a Target once again a
Middle East correspondent Jenny Hill
visited the city and sent this
report deep underground a place of Last
Resort this car park now a hospital if
there's an attack on Hyer the vast
bunker will shelter the sick and take in
the injured when when when when is it
going to happen nobody knows we talk
about it a lot where in general people
are optimistic we hope it's going to be
in short
duration there are operating theaters a
Maternity Ward a command bunker and
supplies to keep going for 3
days they tell us here they're fully
prepared for an attack Israel insists
it's ready for any eventuality and yet
you can sense the unease you can feel
the
fear this port city is vulnerable
Lebanon and hezbollah's Rockets are
close by just look across the shipping
Lane you can see the Border it's a
taking time bomb any minute now it could
be like an alarm will I die will I have
time to go home to my family it will be
probably drones or Miss
and it will be problematic for us to
evacuate H but for who opened his coffee
shop 6 months ago the constant threat
has dulled the fear are you
afraid I'm not
afraid for the mayor of hia sleepless
nights he ran the city when Israel was
at war with Lebanon nearly 20 years ago
I'm very sad about it that there is a
fork in the Middle East
with their leaders are only concerned
about destruction killing fighting
instead of
building so Hyper's doctors continue to
prepare their Fortress hospital but
International diplomacy is ongoing hope
still perhaps they'll never have to use
it Jenny Hill BBC News
Hyer well let's now speak to our
correspondent Hugo Basher who's in
Beirut so Hugo we have The View there
from northern Israel in haa how about in
Lebanon where you are how are people
viewing the prospect of an escalation
the conflict between Israel and
hezb well Katherine everybody here in
Lebanon is waiting for this response
from Hezbollah yesterday we heard from
the leader of Hezbollah Hassan nazala uh
who said that uh the group is going to
retaliate after the assassination of a
senior Commander by Israel uh last week
here in Beirut in the group's uh
stronghold in the southern suburbs of
Beirut and he said this response is
coming uh it is going to be strong and
effective and that Hezbollah couldn't
treat this assassination as any other
attack so uh again uh everybody here
waiting to see what Hezbollah uh is
planning to do but obviously they are in
a very difficult position because they
know that they need to send a message
that this was uh
an attack uh that was uh significant for
the group it happened in the group's uh
stronghold here in Beirut in the capital
of the country but also um they need to
give a response that is measured uh so
to not provoke a huge Israeli response
and we know that some inside Israel are
in favor of of a of an attack of a
military campaign against Hezbollah tens
of thousands of Israeli resid
uh in Northern Communities uh remain uh
displaced because of these attacks that
have been happening along the border
between Lebanon and Israel almost every
day so there is the fear that uh this
expected uh response from Hezbollah
could trigger uh a reaction from Israel
and this could lead to an escalation of
hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel
and obviously uh in the last few days
countries have been urging their
citizens to leave Lebanon uh flights
here have been cancelled uh suspended
many tickets have sold out so people who
want to leave the country have now very
limited options but still uh there's no
sense of panic here uh there's no uh
there are no signs of people desperately
trying to leave Lebanon but the entire
country and the region uh is now waiting
for this response from Hezbollah and
Hugo we've heard from Hezbollah
congratulating Yaya Sena on his new role
as the overall leader of Hamas now just
tell us a bit more about the reaction
there in the region to Yano Sina
assuming this
position exactly so um Iran and
Hezbollah congratulating uh Yahya SWA
for this nomination uh many here seeing
this as a uh as a sign of defiance uh
because he was obviously the leader of
Hamas in Gaza now he is the leader of
Hamas replacing ish who was assassinated
in tan so he's consolidating his power
over Hamas obviously he was one of the
masterminds of the October the 7th
attacks on uh Israel and we also had
reaction from Israel saying that this
was another sign uh of the need uh to uh
kill uh Yahya SWA and also to destroy
Hamas now it's very interesting that he
is believed to be hiding uh in uh the
vast network of underground tunnels in
Gaza but he continues to dictate uh
hamas's actions especially when it comes
to the ceasefire and hostage deal uh
negotiations in Gaza so uh Anthony
blinkin the US Secretary of State again
said that he remained the primary
decider when it came to this uh deal and
the Hope obviously uh is that a deal can
be reached uh for a pause uh in the
fighting in Gaza also for those hostages
to be released but there's also the hope
that any kind of ceasefire in Gaza could
help deescalate tensions across the

WEEg2HWdzEg,Hamas names Yahya Sinwar as new leader | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hamas names Yahya Sinwar as new leader  BBC News.jpg,"now Hamas has announced that Yaya senoir
Israel's Most Wanted man has been chosen
as the new head of the group he succeeds
is hania who was assassinated in the
Iranian Capital Teran last week well
let's take a look at Yaya sina's
background he has most recently been
serving as the leader of hamas's
military Wing in Gaza Israel holds him
along with others responsible for the
October the 7th attack on Israel which
killed around 1200 people and saw more
than 200 kidnapped the 61-year-old was
born in the hanun refugee camp in
southern Gaza his parents were refugees
after his education he was arrested by
Israel at the age of 19 for what they
called Islamic activities 2 years after
the formation of Hamas when he was just
25 sinoa set up the Fe internal security
organization al- Maj in 1988 sinoa
allegedly planned the abduction and
killing of two Israeli soldiers he was
arrested and imprisoned after a murder
conviction by Israel our diplomatic
correspondent Paul Adams sent this
analysis from Jerusalem we understand
that the appointment of Yahya Sina as
the leader of Hamas was unanimous by the
organization's leadership uh it was
always likely in the wake of the
assassination of isma hania an
assassination blamed universally uh on
Israel even though Israel has yet to
comment directly on it it was always was
likely that Yahya Sina would be uh the
figure to take over there were one or
two other candidates uh but Yahya Sina
is by far the most prominent and I think
what it tells us is that uh hamas's
reaction uh to the assassination of is
hania is one of total Defiance uh by
killing uh if not a moderate definitely
the most pragmatic uh member of Hamas uh
Israel has now secured as the leader of
Hamas the most radical uh the uh figure
within the organization the man most
committed to the use of violence uh the
man generally regarded as the Chief
Architect of the Dreadful Hamas attacks
of October the 7th last year uh there is
no interlocutor now uh for Hamas outside
of the Gaza Strip everything is now
going to be in the hands of yak sinat
frankly most of it was already before
this uh but he is now the if you like uh
Undisputed uh political and military
leader of Hamas it is going to make it
very difficult if not impossible uh to
conduct negotiations it's all a very
cumbersome process of getting messages
in and out of the Gaza Strip uh none of
that is going to be made any easier as a
result of this as far as the Israeli
reaction is concerned well perhaps they
anticip ated that their attitude towards
Mr sinoa is the same as their attitude
towards anyone associated with Hamas
which is that he is a terrorist leader a
man with Israeli blood on his hands and
that uh the they will not rest until he
like isma hania is dead Paul Adams

believes it needs to punish Israel to
prevent further instability in the
region it comes amid fears that a major
escalation is imminent that follows last
week's killings of the Hamas political

the Lebanese group Hezbollah which has
vowed to avenge the killings a growing
number of countries including the US and
Saudi Arabia have urged their citizens
to leave Lebanon as soon as possible
while in Gaza the Hamas run Health
Ministry says the death toll from the
war has now reached
39,6 23 people it comes after an Israeli

housing displaced people the Israeli
military said it struck Hamas in what
they called control rooms in the school
buildings our Middle East correspondent
yoland Nell has more yeah I mean a lot
is going on diplomatically um with these
different overtures towards Iran
particularly through uh Arab countries
in the region to try to urge restraint
but as you say it's really seen as such
a humiliation what happened um in tan
last week with the assassination of the
Hamas leader isma Han um so you know
Iran of course backs different armed
groups around this region they include
Hamas they include uh Hezbollah as well
and now there is this raised expectation
of an attack on Israel a major attack by
Iran uh that could involve its proxies
as well what we've seen um in the past
day is a continuation across the Israel
Lebanon border of these exchanges of
fire between uh the Israeli military and
Hezbollah uh but really the expectation
is of something much greater uh that is
imminent and you've got the Pentagon
that has moved um some of its major
military assets um to the region it's
treating this not just as um
a way of showing its Ironclad support
for Israel but as we were hearing there
a way of also um protecting its own
interests its own forces around the
region which could uh be potential
targets as well I mean Israel is uh
staying defiant we've had this meeting
that lasted about 4 hours um discussing
different possibilities for a response
to an attack from Iran the different
scenarios that may come about we heard
from the Israeli Prime Minister B
Netanyahu a couple of times yesterday
basically uh that Israel was ready for
any kind of scenario we believe that the
US um according to reports is
approaching different countries that
were involved in that Coalition that
helped Israel to thwart a direct attack
from Iran back in April uh that included
uh the UK it included France and Jordan
as well um to see if they will be
involved in repelling another attack a
similar attack if that were to happen uh

says it's stepping up America's military

Regional tension grows the Department of
Defense says it aims to strengthen

said on Friday night that in the coming
hours the world would witness
extraordinary scenes and very important
developments while the announcement came
after a funeral ceremony in Qatar for
the Hamas political leader Ismael hania
who was killed in Iran on Wednesday
Hamas and Iran have outow revenge for
the strike that targeted Mr hania
although Iran and its allies have blamed
Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has not claimed responsibility for his
death let's speak to our correspondent
intell Jenny Hill hi Jenny let's start
with the American uh preparations talk
us to what we know about what they're
doing yeah the US has said that it will
be sending an extra Squadron of fighter
jets to the region um as well as
warships stating that America's
commitment to Israel's defense is quote
Ironclad now it's not the first time
we've seen such a scenario perhaps
you'll remember that in April uh Iran
fired more than 300 drones and missiles
at Israel Israel was able to intercept
them shoot them down with the help of
the Us and other allies nevertheless it
is a reminder of just how dangerous and
significant this moment is I'm here in
Tel Aviv on the beach front where it all
looks and feels very relaxed people
getting on with their daily lives but
people here are uneasy we know that Iran
has vowed along with its proxies revenge
for two assassinations that of the Hamas
political leader and a senior Hezbollah
Commander everyone knows something is
likely to happen but it's not clear what
that retaliation will be what kind of
scale we'll see or indeed when it might
happen so this is a country on high
alert um a number of International
Airlines have suspended flights to and
from Israel and ministers in the Israeli
cabinet were sent home this weekend with
satellite phones um for use in the event
of an attack which throws out any kind
of communications Network um as you know
there's urgent diplomacy going on right
now to try to stop Israel war on Gaza
which began um following the October 7th
attacks from exploding into a region
wide conflict and that's why the US's
intervention now is not only about um
providing help to Israel militarily but
also focusing on ongoing efforts to try
to diffuse the tension um the Pentagon
spokeswoman said yesterday um that they
still think escalation is not an
inevitability um America urging all
parties in this to look at potential for
a ceasefire um it's worth remembering of
course that you know there are two
groups of people um in all of this whose
voices have become somewhat lost in the
geopolitics people in Gaza because don't
forget Israel's war on Gaza goes on
there were people killed there last
night in a number of strikes um those
people know that right now a ceasefire
looks very remote and then there are the
families of Israeli hostages who are
being held captive by Hamas in Gaza
still they know that a chance of being
reunited with their ones um it's greatly
diminished right now um one potentially
positive note Benjamin Netanyahu the
Israeli Prime Minister has sanctioned an
Israeli delegation to travel to Cairo
potentially as early as this evening for
ongoing negotiations on a possible
ceasefire but as I say right now tension
is high the world is watching the Middle
East and hoping that a crisis can be
averted and Jenny just briefly could you
talk us through what we know about the
events in the West Bank
there yeah um it reports suggest that um
a local leader of hamas's military Wing
in one part of the West Bank so not a
senior figure um has been killed in an
Israeli uh strike um it's also I think
serving to illustrate the fact that
normal daily events are going on here as
you know um the Israeli Defense Forces
are committed to dismantling Hamas it's
struck
it's leadership so they keep going after
any Hamas um anyone within the
leadership chain although we we believe
this chap was very Junior within that
particular structure also worth pointing
out that the daily exchange of fire um
from Hezbollah and Southern Lebanon and
the Israeli defense fors in Northern
Israel continues you know um people talk
about an escalation there's already a
lot of violence going on um on an hourly
daily basis um in this part of the world
the fear of course that any escalation
could see that violence explode into a
very um different level Jenny thank you
very much for that we're going to take a
look at the wider geopolitics now we can
speak to mun Abu Noah retired Jordanian
Air Force General thank you very much
for coming on the program thank you uh
talk us through your reaction to the US
at re sending the reinforcements
through this is sort of a a
demonstration at the same time putting
pressure uh on hisbah
Iran uh and to prevent a wider uh
escalation of the war so that's what's
uh but will this change the his and
Iranian regarding the retaliation of
hania killing that was a
great insult for Iran so I think the
retaliation is coming I I can't de to
end with this uh uh
situation probably in two weeks time
that's normally the Iranian patient for
the call and they calculate everything
carefully before committing anything and
what kind of what do you expect from the
retaliation what kind of decisions will
Iran be
making I think it's going to be
different like uh the previous one
shooting 300 missile
or the ballistic missile same time they
will use this uh mainly in high value
Target or center of gravity Target in
Israel uh everything will be calculated
not to expand or widening up to a
regional conflict because if this happen
and nobody can control that in a way uh
there will be a catastrophe in in the
Gulf area mainly with these all Field
closing B Mand and Heros by Iran the
whole world will be stopped in that
matter and I think the American they
need more troops uh uh like three to
four carrier in in the area and almost
400,000 Soldier to conduct such a war
and I don't think the
alliance America cannot conduct a war in
the region with no Alliance and and I
don't think with the diplomacy ET trying
to contain the matter and uh not to
widen up the escalation this is the main
thing okay and as Iran calculates its
next step and other countries in the
region wait for that what is the role of
other countries in the region which
countries specifically will be saying
what to whom
here the Middle East is shattered
country they
the attack and uh same time Iran and its
Alliance
Brooky uh they want to finish this job
and you know stop the war in Gaza hisbah
said stop the war in Gaza and will stop
the attacking Israel that's the main
thing and I don't say I don't see that
the war in Gaza will stop or a ceasefire
will reach because uh without without
knowing exactly what's the day after in
Gaza Israel is committing a genocide and
gazan people C the whole world so that
so uh it would be difficult and I think
this is if it stayed like this this will
be an endless war and Forever War that's
the way I see it it's very hard to fight
ideas and the gazan and the paltin and
it's from generation to generation they
will k carry on resisting that Israel is
became sort of uh I'll say it clearly a
threat to a
regional stability and Security in our
part of the world they have to go for
diplomacy solve the
problem ceasefire on G Etc otherwise

funeral in the qari capital Doha of its

assassinated in Iran on Wednesday his
body has been taken to a cemetery
outside the city where he's been laid to
rest hundreds of mourners attended the
funeral prayers at the state mosque
officials from a number of Arab and
Muslim countries attended as well as
prominent figures from fata the main
rival Palestinian faction to Hamas
well Hamas and Iran have both vowed
revenge on Israel which has so far
refused to confirm that it carried out
the attack all this has heightened
anxiety about a wider regional conflict
in the Middle East and ceasefire talks
to stop the war in Gaza and to secure
the release of Israeli hostages now seem
to be at something of a standstill well
our Middle East correspond ol garen's
been telling us what form the
retaliation may
take I I think we could very possibly
see that Iran will want to do something
different it will want to Signal very
clearly uh that this is a response of a
different order because of the nature of
what happened uh at 2 A.M on Wednesday
morning in Teran in the heart of the uh
Iranian Capital when Israel as is widely
believed uh was able to assassinate not
just an Iranian Ally but the political
head of Hamas who only hours before had
been meeting the Iranian supreme leader
ayat Ayatollah Ali hamay who of course
the day after then uh was saying funeral
prayers over his casket in tran so I
think the Iranians will want to do
something that looks and feels different
I think there is every possibility that
they will try to engage their Regional
allies we've already had Hezbollah
promising Revenge we've had Hamas
promising Revenge the houthis on on a
week toe basis are anyway carrying out
attacks on international shipping going

um he' he'd actually been living in in

on that strike uh which which killed uh
hania um but we heard um Benjamin
Netanyahu uh Israel's prime minister of
course saying his country had delivered
uh crushing blows to its enemies in
recent days uh Hamas has uh said that
the death of hania will have major
repercussions on that let's bring in our
uh Middle East correspondent yolan Nell
who's in Jerusalem so yoland as we're
looking at those pictures uh from uh
katar that we're getting coming in live
tell us more about what we are hearing
about those potential
repercussions well certainly Israel
remains on a very high state of alert uh
security wise um that killing of Isel
hania came on the back of the
assassination of a Hezbollah Commander
um which Israel says um was carried out
um in response to his uh the Hezbollah
uh killing of uh 12 children in a rocket
strike in the occupied Golan Heights
last weekend um and the expectation uh
really is that um you know both strikes
were really involving figures who were
too senior they cannot be ignored they
also real security breaches as far as
hasbalah is concerned with this
Commander uh being killed in its
stronghold in the south of Beirut and
also um is hania although Israel says it
was not responsible it's widely blamed
um for his assassination and he was
killed in tan inside an accommodation
block that really belongs to the Islamic
revolutionary guards there um so there
is an expectation of a real response we
had last night a speech by the Hezbollah
leader Hassan n that was closely
listened to here he talked about how the
killing of its Commander meant a new
phase in the conflict with Israel and he
said too that there would be very well
studied retaliation he also referred uh
to Iran of course Iran is a key back of
Hezbollah also uh supports Hamas and
said that Hamas uh that rather Iran
could not remain silent um with the
killing of that Hamas leader on its soil
um so I mean what we've seen going into
both uh the main Israeli and Lebanese
airports a number of flights being uh
cancelled or delayed uh we know that uh
we had the uh Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu speaking last night
to uh the US president to Joe Biden the
White House said that they discussed US
military deployments to support Israel
against missiles and drone strikes but
we also had Joe Biden talking to
reporters afterwards and when he was
asked about the a killing of is hania
and what it meant for a ceasefire and
hostage release deal he said that it was
not
helpful we we seeing more detail too
about actually how uh isma hania was
killed what what do you think that tells
us about Israel's um if if it was indeed
Israel Israel's
capabilities I mean the indications
according to reports um after there were
initial reports that this was some kind
of of an air strike perhaps even one uh
involving a rocket launch nearby that
the latest reports um including in the
New York Times quoting well-placed
security officials um including in Iran
uh speaking Anon anonymously suggest
that actually a bomb had been planted in
that accommodation which appears to have
been used routinely by is Han on his
trips um to Teran um and that is what
killed him and his bodyguard it seems to
have been a very precise attack because
we know that uh others including um
other leaders of armed groups from
around the region were staying very
close by uh and they were not affected
by this um the Iranians haven't said
much officially about what exactly
happened here um but this does suggest a
very precise uh intelligence operation
uh and that could be another reason why
uh Israel has not commented here um it
did say that it had not carried out
through the military spokesman any um
additional air strikes Beyond those
which it had had already taken
responsibility for in the region in
recent days y LEL in Jerusalem for now

says it's received intelligence in the
past few hours that confirms that the
head of hamas's military Wing Muhammad
Dave was killed in Gaza last month
Israel's defense minister Yol gal yev
Galant says his death is a significant
milestone in the dismantling of Hamas
Muhammad da was targeted in a strike on
a compound in the hanun area on July the
13th the Israeli Army said at the time
that another Hamas Commander was killed
but said it did not have final
confirmation on the fate of Dave well
Hamas said that he survived the attack
but did not provide proof it comes as
tens of thousands of people are
attending the funeral procession in tran
of Hamas political Chief Ismael hania
who was assassinated in the Iranian
capital on Wednesday Iran has threatened
a harsh punishment for his killing which
it blames on Israel we can speak to our
correspondent our Middle East
correspondent yolan Nell who's in
Jerusalem uh yolan can you just tell us
the significance of this announcement
that uh Muhammad Dave was killed in that
attack yeah I mean there's the timing
first of all just after we've had the
news of these other two uh targeted
killings in the past couple of days the
Israeli military ping out this short
statement confirming that in this strike
in the south of Gaza uh two weeks ago it
did in fact uh kill um this man he was
long at the top of Israel's most wanted
list Muhammad Dave um and really is seen
as an architect of the 7th of October
attacks the head of the Hamas military
Wing uh in Gaza and somebody who really
had a leading role in the organization
for something like 30 years had been
very much involved um in building up
that network of tunnels in which he was
believed to have continued during the
war
uh to command um many of the the Hamas
military activities he was also very
much involved in in building up its its
bomb making capabilities but he was
somebody who was so very much a shadowy
figure he very rarely um was seen uh um
and really you know didn't appear uh in
public even just his voice I know that
he was in the past the subject of
several Israeli assassination attempts I
remember during the 2014 War standing on
the rubble of his home where his wife
and two of his small children were
killed but where uh he
survived um we're just getting some
footage yand um that I just want to
bring to our viewers this is IDF uh
aerial footage that uh claims to show
that uh July the 13th incident where um
the uh IDF is saying that Muhammad uh uh
Dave um was killed um and
presumably presumably that moment that
he was killed there that we are seeing
um Israel's defense minister yev Galant
has has said this is a a significant
milestone in the dismantling of of her
Mass um what do you think could be the
then the implications of this being
revealed I mean it had been suspected
that he was killed but really the facts
um were unclear and we've had um a
picture that yav Galant the defend
Minister put out um on social media
where he is shown um Crossing off the
picture of Muhammad Dave from uh the
Hamas command list the list of people
that um Israel is really going after in
in Gaza and I think a lot of focus now
will be on what happens to Yahya sinoa
who is the leader uh of the Hamas
political Wing in Gaza also seen as
having really masterminded the 7th of
October attacks he uh now stays at the
top of that wanted list but I think
Israel has really wanted to show uh its
own public and the world that it is
determined to go after those who carried
out those unprecedented um attacks um
that killed something like 1,200 people
last year Israel also believes that by
putting this pressure on Hamas um
ultimately it will make it more possible
to get to a ceasefire and hostage
release deal that it can agree to uh
yoland for now thank you very much let's
uh speak to our security Cy
correspondent Frank Gardner for more on
this so Frank we we heard that Iran has
uh vowed Revenge after um the the death
of uh Ismael hania and and now this has
been announced what what do you think
could be the potential escalations
here well I think it's pretty news for
ceasefire talks it's very good news for
Israel this is somebody who as Yulan
says that they've been after for some
time Muhammad Dave is a hugely
significant figure he's been described
by the Israel is today by Israel as the
assama bin ladin of Hamas so um I'm not
quite sure that that's an accurate
description because he was a military
commander rather than the sort of
necessarily the kind of intellectual
brains which was more yaka sinoa but
this is somebody who they've been
targeting for a very long time as Yan
says has been hiding in tunnels he's
somebody who they would have liked to
have killed right at the beginning of
the whole Gaza uh ret iation operation
for the October the 7th raid um and
along with yaka sinoa he's right at the
top of the tree that they've been trying
to cut down to try to dismantle hamas's
military operation Muhammad Dave was 58
he was born in 1965 in Khan Yunis the
same place that he has reported to been
killed in and he's been leading the
what's known as the aadin Kasam brigades
which is the military WI of Hamas now I
remember that Hamas is a prescribed
terrorist organization by many
governments um and therefore some people
in Israel certainly don't make any
distinction between its military or its
political wings but nevertheless he's
very much he was very much the military
commander on the ground in Gaza while is
hania who was killed in tan in that air
strike was the one shuttling around
based in Doha doing a lot of the
negotiations a lot of the talks
what do you make of the timing of this
announcement Frank do you think this is
information that has just come to light
to the IDF or do you think there is a a
a strategy and the timing of this
information being
released it's hard to say I think
probably you need to be in Jerusalem to
know the kind of intricacies of that but
certainly um Israel is is lashing out in
all directions at the moment it's
basically trying to send out deterence
to those who are attacking it or uh
tending to attack it that there are
punishments for this that there is a
cost with this so they've hit the
houthis in Yemen they've hit Heda Port
because the houthis have been sending
explosive drones towards Israel and one
of them was able to get through and
reach Tel Aviv um they've hit Hezbollah
they've hit the senior Commander there
in beut uh even though Western
governments have said please don't hit
beut don't trigger a huge great big war
across the Lebanon is Israel border but
nevertheless they did that in a
calibrated targeted strike I think some
people are going to be asking if they're
able to eliminate somebody in one of
these targeted strikes albe it there are
civilians probably killed alongside that
why is it taken the deaths of 39,000
Palestinians in this 10mon long Gaza
operation when there's simply after
dismantling Hamas as a military
organization so it's been a fairly
weapon that the Israelis have used to
hit Hamas so
far what do you think will be the wider
implications across the world I'm
particularly thinking about the the US
response uh to this
news well the US has been very
supportive uh of Israel's military aims
they've been a lot less supportive and
increasingly uh concerned at the rising
number of Civilian casualties at the
what they consider to be the unaccept
able High number of Civilian casualties
caused by Israel's operations in in Gaza
and at the same time there is rising
concern in the UN and the International
Community at what's going on in the West
Bank that tends to get ignored um in all
the uh action that's going on on the
Israel Lebanon border and also in Gaza
but what's going on in the West Bank is
um according to uh International workers
that I've spoken to Aid workers and
others it's pretty bad in terms of the
um appropriation of Palestinian land uh
the persecution of Palestinians been
having their Olive Groves burnt that
they have farmed for decades and the in
there have been plenty of recorded
instances of the Israeli police and
military simply standing by or even
assisting as settlers um attack
Palestinian communities there so all of
that is feeding into sense of
hopelessness um so while Israel is
certainly will be Israelis will be
congratulating themselves today on the
deaths of of Muhammad and
um sh in hisbah in beut and to to some
extent is malania as well um
nevertheless it doesn't change the fact
that the Israel Palestinian situation
has yet is a long way off being resolved
um and that's that that's the
fundamental driver of this conflict that
there is still no independent
self-governing state for the
Palestinians they are still occupied and
that's feeding into the
violence Frank Gardner we appreciate
your assessment on that thank you very
much",20240801

hamas's political leader Ismael Hana he
was born in a refugee camp in Gaza in
1963 and was a key member of Hamas from
its Inception he was imprisoned by
Israel several times and at one point
was expelled to South Lebanon for six
months in 20 2003 he survived an attempt
to kill him by Israel along with hamas's
founder he was elected head of hamas's
political Bureau in 2017 and in recent
years he lived in Exile moving between
turkey and qar he had been playing a key
role in negotiations over a ceasefire
deal in Gaza and is the most senior
Hamas figure to be killed since the
groups attacks on Israel on the 7th of
October well Iran has declared three
three days of mourning for Ismael Hana
and the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Hami has promised what he called harsh
punishment against Israel meanwhile the
UN Security Council says it's going to
hold an emergency meeting Secretary

separate attacks in the space of just 12
hours on the senior leaders of two
iran-backed groups have raised fears of
a wider regional conflict Hamas says its
political leader Ismael Han was killed
during a visit to Teran early
indications suggest that he and his
bodyguard died when a rocket hit the
house where he was staying Hamas has
accused Israel of being responsible and
describe the killing as a grave
escalation well hours earlier Israel
said it had killed a senior Hezbollah
figure in a strike in Beirut the
movement has confirmed that far shukra
one of its top military commanders was
in a building targeted by Israel but
hasn't confirmed his fate Israel said he
was responsible for an attack that
killed 12 young people in the Israeli
occupied Goan Heights well let's start
this hour with this report from
yanel State media in Iran reporting the
assassination in its capital of this top
Hamas
leader a VIP guest isil hania had been
in tan along with the heads of other
Regional armed groups backed by Iran for
the inauguration of the country's new
president but these were to be his last
ever public
appearances in Gaza today news of the
killing worried many Palestinians about
the implications for ending nearly 10
months of war with Israel
if the leaders die the political leaders
where are we going children are dying
the elderly are dying the youth are
dying no one is looking out for
us I hope this will be the last
assassination and God willing the war
will end after this assassination we are
all
tired isma hania was from Gaza but had
recently lived in katar he was seen as
more pragmatic than Hardline Hamas
leaders still in the Palestinian
territory and have been overseeing talks
on a ceasefire and the release of
Israeli hostages now hostage families
fear a
setback I don't know how this news
affect the deal but I wish I really wish
for all of the forces around the world
that We Gather in order to bring our
people back
home I hope our politicians will know to
make these news
into the release of the hostage
just hours before the tan attack Israel
had targeted a senior Hezbollah
commander in the Lebanese Capital beout
it said he was responsible for a deadly
rocket strike in the occupied Golan
Heights last weekend fears were already
running High about the possibility of
retaliation and a wider
War now with a ran announcing three days
of mourning for ish and vowing a harsh
and painful response the Middle East is
even more on edge Yol anell BBC News
Jerusalem well our correspondent barara
plet aser is in Jerusalem now Israel
never comments on these types of
assassinations and I asked her whether
this time was any different not so far
no and again in the most recent briefing
with the prime minister's office the
spokesperson was asked and he said we're
not commenting on this incident um but
we do know that after the October 7th
attacks which were led by Hamas the
Israeli government had said that they
were going to Target all of the Hamas
leadership including the political
leadership so they have kept that uh
threat current uh throughout the past 10
months and there was a strike against a
political leader the deputy political
leader in Beirut in January so I think
the entire region and probably uh most
other people do believe it was the
Israelis who carried it out there was a
brief moment on social media when a a
picture of is is hania was posted by the
government press office here with with a
a graphic saying on his graphic across
his face saying eliminated but that was
taken down very quickly so clearly the
Israelis don't want to um own this uh
publicly uh but as I said they had been
uh they had been saying that they would
be targeting the leadership the question
really is now why they would take this
particular opportunity especially when
Mr hania had been very heavily involved
in ceasefire talks uh that many were
hoping would result in at least a pause
in the conflict in Gaza yes there is
that obvious question about why now now
and the implications on exactly what
you've just mentioned but are there is
anything being reported about how
exactly this attack was
done yeah we don't know exactly how it
was done we do know that it took place
at 2:00 in the morning according to
Iranian media and also that it was very
precise because there were other Hamas
leaders in the building as well as a
leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and
they were not hit it was very much aimed
it seems at ishia which means that the
Israelis had very good intelligence
about where he was uh perhaps because he
was attending an event that had been
pre-organized the inauguration of the
Iranian president so maybe they had time
to get Intelligence on it the the
Iranian media initially reported that it
was a missile fired from outside the
country but there have been other
reports saying that it was a rocket
fired from a nearby building which would
implicate uh that that which which
suggest there was some inside help for
the attack but we don't have any
confirmation of exactly how it was
carried out that was Barbara plha let's
speak live now to General Amir aivi
who's the founder of the Israel Defense
and security Forum General welcome here
to the program what is Israel's strategy
here well isra strategy I think from day
one is very very clear there is a clear
goal of War to eradicate Hamas as a
military entity and governmental entity
Hamas has a attacked
unprovoked killed 1200 Israelis raped
women decapitated head of children took
hostages burned people alive and this
organization cannot exist anymore not in
our region at least and step by step the
IDF is destroying Hamas militarily and
also targeting the leadership of Hamas
which are all vicious terrorists do you
think it brings peace any close because
the region has been on the brink for a
very long time taking out anir there on
Iranian territory killing a senior
Hezbollah leader in Beirut There Is that
real risk of this tipping over into a
wider War isn't there we are in war and
in war you need to First Win
decisively and then talk about peace
just as but not a wider war that is what
the Americans have been warning against
various allies have been warning against
a a wider conflict does this EDG us
closer to that wider
conflict well I think that you know and
I've s I've been saying that for the
last two years to the American
Administration and I'm saying it also to
the British uh government if you want to
stabilize the Middle East you need to
show strengths you need to POS a
credible military threat on Iran you
need deterrence we have a globe not just
the region the whole globe is is
completely
destabilized so the Americans the
Americans are wrong when they keep
urging Israel's prime minister not to
escalated is that what you're
saying I'm saying that Israel needs to
win decisively on all fronts the
Americans are wrong if they think that
appeasement works with Iranians with
this terrible regime they are wrong if
they think appeasement works with
theala it's not going to work we need
strengths we need to win decisively and
after we'll win we can talk about
Solutions and peace agreements and so on
peace agreements will come in the Middle
East following a decisive win of Israel
then we might see peace with Saudi
Arabia we might see maybe an alliance a
coalition that's many stages that's many
stages ahead I just want to ask you
about the immediate do you think this
brings any closer the release of those
hostages I think that H only really
military pressure is going to bring the
leadership of Hamas to the point where
they agreed to a deal they have rejected
everything that was offered for months
and months they don't show any
willingness to release hostages and and
the chief of staff of Israel the
Minister of Defense the prime ministers
are all saying the same military
pressure this is what will bring us the
hostages by the way this is what brought
us the hostages at the beginning when we
put a lot of military pressure but
you've also been sending teams to
negotiate and he was the principal
negotiator sorry can you ask again I was
saying you've also Israel been sending
teams to negotiating katar and he was
hamas's principal negotiator who is
there now left to negotiate
with well they see have khed Mas which
they can send they always have somebody
to replace but the leading leadership
will be targeted eventually all of them
also sinir which is hiding somewhere in
the ra region maybe kanun and the IDF is
seeking to find them I think that the
Palestinian Society are fed up of Hamas
I'm hoping that they will understand
they have no future with a terror
organization terrorizing them using them
as human Shields and taking them their
food from all the Foodies that is coming
from Gaza I think it's time to get rid
of this organization J we have to leave
it there but thanks for that perspective

yjpLM_j6d9w,Top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in Iran | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in Iran  BBC News.jpg,"we start this out with the breaking news
the Palestinian militant group Hamas has
said its political leader ishma hir has
been killed in Iran a statement from the
group said he was killed in an Israeli
raid on a house in the Iranian Capital
tan that he was staying in Israel's
military military is not commenting it
said the raid took place after he had
attended the inauguration of the new
Iranian president ishma hir had been
leading negotiations with Israel and his
death is likely to affect any chances of
progress Mass official described the
assassination as a grave escalation that
will not go unpunished one of Ishmael
H's bodyguards is also said to have died
so let's just take a closer look at who
Ishmael hir was born in the ashati
refugee camp in Gaza hir was a key
member of Hamas from its Inception he
was imprisoned by Israel a number of
times including for three years in 1989
as it cracked down on the First
Palestinian Uprising at one point he was
expelled to Southern Lebanon for six
months
in 2003 he survived an assassination
attempt by Israel along with the Hamas
founder shik ahed yastin 3 Years Later
Han was appointed a Palestinian prime
minister by President Mahmud abas after
Hamas won the most seats in national
elections however he was dismissed a
year later after the group outed abbas's
fatter party from the Gaza Strip in a
week of deadly violence kir had led
hamas's political operation since 2017
while living in Exile in katar
he was the public face of hamas's
diplomacy in Arab capitals and was
leading efforts to negotiate a ceasefire
deal in Gaza Han was considered to be
less Hardline and militaristic than Yaya
simoa who is the head of Hamas inside
Gaza well let's get more with our Middle
East correspondent Yulan n who is in
Jerusalem and Hugo Basher who is in
Beirut Yulan to you first what more do
we know about what's
happened well the reports are saying
that this was um an attack an air strike
at about 2:00 in the morning local time
on the residence where Ismael hania was
staying in the Iranian Capital uh he was
killed along with his bodyguard um we
don't have many more details than that
at the moment he'd been in Iran um along
with the leaders of other iran-backed
armed groups from around the region uh
for the swearing in of Iran's new
president they were seen very
prominently at that ceremony and also
meeting the Iranian supreme leader and
there's already been a lot of reaction
to What Happened One Hamas official
calling this a cowardly act saying it
will not go unanswered there have been
others saying that this could lead to a
a dangerous escalation and this killing
really did catch us uh by surprise I
mean it's not being claimed by Israel
when I asked the Israeli military it
said it did not comment on reports in
foreign media
um but this came just hours after Israel
said it had killed um a senior hasbalah
figure in southern Beirut um somebody it
said was responsible for a deadly rocket
strike in the Israeli occupied Goan
Heights the weekend and we'd really been
braced for several days um for Israel's
um retaliation there Hezbollah denying
that it was responsible for carrying out
that strike and it hasn't uh confirmed
the death of any of its leaders um but
already there had been fears that Iran
could be drawn in um if uh there was a
strong response to what uh Israel did in
Beirut um now we've got Iran saying that
its top uh Security Council is
considering its reaction to an
assassination um of this top Hamas
leader on its own soil so this is
another very dangerous moment and what
do you think think this means in the
immediate term for any hostage ceasefire
deal I mean as you were saying is Hu was
seen as being the sort of more pragmatic
more moderate face um of Hamas when
compared to the the hardliners like
Yahya sinir um and Muhammad Dave who
masterminded uh the 7th of October
attacks um still in Gaza um we're not
sure about what's happened uh to
Muhammad de but Yak Sina is believed to
still be in an underground bunker there
now it's very much putting more power uh
in the hands of Yahya sinwell when it
comes to any kind of negotiations on a
new ceasefire and hostage release uh
deal um isil hania had been um really
overseeing those negotiations uh through
mediators he was somebody who'd been
able to to travel around the region uh
still and attend meetings um and it's
not clear at this point who his
successor will be so this um is likely
to be a major setback um for any sort of
uh new deal on a ceasefire and hostage
release and it's not clear at this
moment what it means uh for the course
of the war in Gaza okay you land for now
thank you let's go to Hugo Basher who is
in Beirut uh Hugo what reaction has
there been by Hezbollah another Iranian
proxy there in Lebanon uh given that
this comes just hours after one of
hezbollah's senior leaders was targeted
by
Israel yes amantha so we had two
statements from Hezbollah this morning
one morning uh the uh death of the
killing of Ismael Han in Iran and the
first uh statement was the first
reaction we had from hisbah after the
attack that happened here in Beirut last
night confirming that the senior
Commander fuad shukar was in the
building behind me that was hit in this
Israeli attack so uh this is the scene
here in in southern Beirut this is the
Hezbollah stronghold here in the bayout
capital there is obviously a very uh
strong presence of Hezbollah members
also of the Lebanese military obviously
the streets here have been corned off
and shops are closed uh but streets are
getting busier here with lots of people
coming to the scene uh and obviously
lots of journalists here as well but we
had a very short statement by uh hesah
saying that emergency services are still
searching through the rubble they
confirmed that the senior Commander was
here in the building when this attack
happened last night just before Sunset
but they haven't confirmed that he was
actually killed uh yesterday the Israeli
military said that fuad Shuka was killed
they described this as a precise attack
he said he was a uh the Israeli military
said the senior Commander was a
right-hand man to the uh Hezbollah
leader Hassan nazala and he was also
described as being uh the commander
behind the attack that happened on
Saturday in the occupied Golan Heights
when 12 children were killed and uh the
Israeli authorities uh had uh promised a
response to the attack uh the Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Hezbollah would pay a very heavy price
and for days here in Lebanon there was
this wait for for for this uh Israeli
response so it happened last night it
happened here uh in this stronghold
Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut
and I think the fact that it happened
here in the Lebanese capital and perhaps
the first time that Hezbollah was
targeted here in Beirut could be seen as
a major provocation by the group we
haven't seen any indication yet about
any kind of plans for a retaliation but
I think it's inevitable that Hezbollah
is going to respond to this attack we've
seen that in the past when senior
commanders were killed by Israel
Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets
targeting military positions inside uh
Israel so I think a response now is
almost uh inevitable and obviously this
raises fears of the possibility of a of
an escalation in the hostilities between
Hezbollah and Israel so far most of the
violence has been contained to areas
along the border between Lebanon and
Israel tens of thousands of people have
been forced to leave their homes because
of the violence but there has been the
fear that this uh violence uh could
escalate to become something bigger even
though the indications have been that uh
Hezbollah and Israel were trying to
avoid a major confrontation but again as
yolan said this is a very dangerous
moment yeah the Iranian leadership
meeting uh imminently to discuss their
response to to what extent do you think
the Hezbollah response any reaction will
be led by
Iran yeah so Hezbollah is the main group
of these Alliance of factions and forces
across the Middle East supported by Iran
uh the so-called axis of resistance and
I think that there has been this
question uh since uh October the 7th
since uh the attacks by Hamas and then
this response by Hezbollah the level of
influence that Iran has over Hezbollah
and the other factions uh uh uh in this
uh Alliance I think Hezbollah here in
Lebanon is obviously a very powerful
force it's not only a militia but it is
also a political party with
representation in Parliament it is also
a very strong uh social movement here in
Lebanon so it does have uh a level of
Independence it does have uh its own uh
strategy and goals uh but there is some
level of coordination perhaps with the
Iranian authorities and obviously
Hezbollah just like Hamas is considered
a terrorist organization by uh many uh
Western countries including the us
including the UK and there's been the
fear here uh in Lebanon that Hezbollah
could be dragging uh this country into
another conflict with Israel lots of
people remember what happened in 2006
the devastation brought by uh the war
between Israel and Hezbollah there was a
lot of destru ction here in southern
Beirut also in southern Lebanon and uh
many people were concerned that history
might be repeating itself and this is a
very difficult moment for Lebanon for
years the country has been going through
a huge economic crisis uh around 80% of
the population uh estimated to be living
in poverty there's also a political
crisis the the country has been without
a president for almost 2 years so it is
a very difficult situation for Lebanon
uh and many here were concerned again
that Hezbollah was dragging this country
into another conflict okay Hugo for now
thank you",20240731

one woman died and dozens have been left
wounded it's not known if the commander
was
killed this is the building that was
struck by an Israeli drone we believe uh
three rockets hit the building as you
can see this is quite a heavily built up
civilian area but Israel says it had the
Hezbollah Commander it holds responsible
for the maal Shan's attack in its sights
reports about whether he actually made
it out alive but we do know there's been
at least one woman killed and a number
of people uh injured here tonight uh
this area of Southern beu was the same
area in which a Hamas official was
targeted and killed by Israel back in
January this year the big question now
though is what comes next because Israel
has said its response would be severe
and it said it would take a number of
days so this strike tonight here in
Beirut may not be the end of it
a new footage has emerged tonight of
Saturday's attack in the Golan children
playing quietly then an air raid siren
there was no time to take
cover it left 12 Dead all children and
young adults watching a nearby football
match Hezbollah which has fired
thousands of rockets and missiles into
Israel in the last 10 months denies it
was behind the attack the Iranian backed
group stands shoulder toosh shoulder
with Hamas but it's far better armed and
its Fighters more
formidable the conflict here was mainly
contained to border areas and Military
targets the unwritten rules of this
almost War but Saturday's attack on the
Golan on civilians has pushed Lebanon
and Israel to the brink the United
States and others have been working to
contain
things how Hezbollah responds to
tonight's assassination attempt and what
Israel does next next will determine
whether War here is inevitable Quenton
Somerville BBC News
Beirut well the White House says that an
allout war between Israel and Hezbollah
is not inevitable but as you heard there
there are widespread fears of an
escalation our correspondent Paul Adams
is in Jerusalem for us now and Paul
what's your assessment of the situation
tonight look Rita this was clearly a
very Target
attack Israel didn't just lash out after
the events of the weekend it took 3 days
to pick a Target and then went after
that Target it's also quite noticeable
that they have not issued any changes in
terms of the home front instructions to
civilians uh no indication that the
there is an anticipated uh significant
Hezbollah response that is interesting
uh Israeli officials are quoted as
saying that the ball is now in
hezbollah's court I think the Israelis
are convinced that this has been
successful in fact in the last few
minutes they've issued a statement
saying that they do indeed believe uh
that F chuker their intended target is
dead in fact the statement gives a long
account of his history of involvement in
attacks against Israel stretching way
back into the
1990s so I think they feel that this uh
was a very very deliberate very precise
strike Israeli officials have been
saying as Quint mentioned that Israel's
response would be tough but that it
could go on for some days so it may not
be an end of the matter and obviously
Israeli officials who've been meeting
late tonight will be very keen to see
what the response is I should just point
out one other development which is that
there have been explosions that have
targeted pro-iranian Shiite militias in
Iraq to tonight now we don't know who
was behind those attacks uh possibly the
United States possibly Israel but when I
spoke to a senior Israeli military
official over the weekend about Israel's
likely response he did point out he was
at pains to point out that that all of
this could be traced back to Iran",20240730

severe the the blast
was yeah we are seeing some pictures of
uh of the destruction uh at least one
building partially collapsed uh in that
area where this attack happened uh in
the southern suburbs of Beirut again uh
the significance of this attack is that
this happened in an area that is
controlled by Hezbollah in the capital
uh beut so Hezbollah may see this
Israeli attack as a provocation as an
escalation uh in the hostilities and may
decide that uh they have no other option
than uh retaliate so I think this is uh
the big concern here that this could
lead to another escalation in the
hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel
there have been reports here in Lebanese
media suggesting that at least one
person was killed uh several people have
been uh injured as a result of this
attack this is a densely populated uh
area of Beirut and this happened about
an hour ago just after halfast 7 uh in
the evening here uh in Lebanon and uh
the Israeli authorities have confirmed
that they were behind this attack uh
They said that the Target was a
commander that was behind the attack
that happened on Saturday uh that hit
the Israeli occupied golen Heights uh
killing 12 children and teenagers and
right after that attack the Israeli
authorities promised a a response a
severe response they blamed Hezbollah
for the attack we heard from uh the
defense minister of Israel saying that
Hezbollah had crossed uh a red line with
the attack and now this Israeli response
has ol had claimed an attack uh on
Saturday in the area of this explosion
but then after the scale of this attack
became clear it denied any kind of

scenes uh at the detention center it's a
camp uh for Palestinians who have been
uh picked up during the course of the
Gaza War um and it's really become uh
quite notorious with Israeli rights
groups uh International media including
the BBC investigating what's happening
there um we've been hearing uh in recent
months how uh Palestinian detes are
routinely Shackled to hospital beds
they've been kept blindfolded and kept
even wearing nappies um and really um
when the news broke that these soldiers
had been detained for questioning for
the the sexual assault of a detainee
believed to be a member of Hamas um
we're told according to Israeli media
reports that he had been left unable uh
to walk um well crowds gathered uh
outside the military base and then what
we saw was actually some of those uh
protesters breaking in as Israeli
military investigators arrived at the
site later on uh they broke in uh to a
second uh military base where there's a
a military court and really you know
that's got uh the Israeli military Chief
of Staff uh denouncing all of this
calling this unlawful uh Anarchy um
we've had the Israeli Prime Minister and
other figures denouncing it uh but you
also have um an prominent member of
Israel's Hardline government the cabinet
minister bezel smotrich who is from the
far and of course as you said there were
farri right members of parliament who
were among those who broke in at the
site well bezel smotrich said on social
media that the soldiers who had been
detained should be treated as Heroes not
criminals and yand what does this tell
us about divisions within Israel uh not
just between government members but uh
between you know different groups within
Israel and also uh within the
International Community over pressure
about how Israel is conducting itself in
Gaza yeah I mean so really what we see
here are the very partisan divisions um
that are on display in Israel at the
moment particularly with this Hardline
government in place uh the Israeli Prime
Minister relies on the support of these
uh far-right Ultra nationalist uh
parties he couldn't remain in power
without them and that is really fed into
to some of the political divisions the
social divisions that already existed
within the country and then on top of
that yes you know this other dimension
Israel is currently facing uh cases
before International courts it's accused
uh of war crimes a lot of accusations
over its uh conduct of the war in Gaza
International pressure it strongly um
denies uh those accusations of war
crimes and yet you know the Israeli
military always says it independently
investigates any cases of of wrongdoing
of alleged use that come to light and it
deals with them accordingly what you
have here is Israeli ministers even
apparently undermining uh the Israeli
military procedures yoland thank you as
ever for updating us from Jerusalem
there Benjamin Netanyahu says his
country will deliver a severe response
to the missile strike on the Israeli
occupied goolan Heights the attack on
Saturday struck a soccer field in the
town of melem killing 12 12 young people
Mr Netanyahu cut short a tour of the
United States to visit the site of the
attack on Monday he conveyed his
condolences to the local community which
is mostly made up of the Arab durus
minority on Sunday Israel fired on S sit
in South Lebanon it says belong to the
militant group hisbah Israel blames
hisbah for the attack an accusation the
group denies amiddle East correspondent
Hugo Bea is in South Lebanon with the
latest so the wait here uh in Lebanon
continues uh yesterday uh the prime
minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu
again said that Israel would respond to
the attack that happened on Saturday and
that this response would be severe now
we know that there has been intense
diplomatic activity trying to limit this
uh Israeli response the Americans in
particular are heavily involved in these
uh efforts to try to contain uh an
escalation of hostilities here and I
think the goal of these uh efforts try
to prevent an escalation that would put
Hezbollah in a position where the group
would feel they have to respond to any
kind of major Israeli attack uh and I
think uh an attack on the capital of
bayout Hezbollah has its base in the
southern suburbs of Beirut or any
Israeli attack targeting a Lebanese
civilian infrastructure could be seen by
Hezbollah as a major escalation as a
major provocation and could uh spark uh
a response by
Hezbollah that was Hugo Bea there",20240730

where concerns are growing about an
allout war after 12 children and
teenagers were killed at the weekend
when a rocket fell on a football field
in the Israeli occupied goolan Heights
the attack LED Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to return early from
the United States to meet his cabinet
which has authorized him and his defense
minister to decide when and how to
retaliate and we're just seeing that
Benjamin Netanyahu has visited the site
of that rocket attack in the goolan
Heights we're just uh hearing that well
let's talk now about this situation with
ha helier he's non-resident scholar at
the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace thank you very much for joining us
and just give us a sense in your view uh
as to how quickly this situation could
escalate and of course that is a big
fear that this could escalate into an
allout regional conflict
so thank you for having me on your
program uh I think the reality is is
that for the past 10 months there's been
the concern that the law of unintended
consequences could lead the region into
a fullscale regional war and uh for at
many points over the past 10 months I
think you've seen different actors be
very Reckless um in retaliating against
one another but also
underestimating how possible it is to
actually do quote unquote calculated
escalations um the Israelis have made it
very clear they are going to strike
Lebanon um it will be soon um I wouldn't
be surprised if it was in the coming few
hours but it will be soon and at the
same time they do not want a regional
War because it's one that they're not
prepared for so they will retaliate um
or they will claim that this is
retaliation because we still don't know
exactly what happened um in the goolan
Heights um but we do know that Israel
will
respond and the question will be can
they respond in a way that isn't going
to Tumble out of control in terms of
consequences and reprisals from hisb um
and I don't think we can be sure of that
I don't know what they have in mind or
what's planned um but I do think it's an
incredibly risky step that they are
planning to undertake as I said very
shortly you were saying it is very
difficult to have a calculated
escalation because of that law of un
unintended consequences you can never be
entirely sure what one action may lead
to um for for our viewers if you would
just tell us a little bit more about the
background to the goolan heights its
strategic significance and and the
reason for the the whole contentiousness
around this this part of the the
region so the Golan Heights is occupied
Syrian territory um Israel invaded it in
1967 and has occupied it ever since and
uh declared it annexed some years later
um I will say that more or less the
entirety of the International Community
recognizes it as occupied territory um
and I'm glad that the BBC continues to
refer to it as the occupied Goan Heights
because indeed it is as occupied
territory as Gaza as the West Bank as
East Jerusalem and the Sinai Peninsula
until the peace treaty between Egypt and
Israel um all of these were territories
that were taken in
1967 um it frankly doesn't serve at the
moment a quote unquote Strategic Benefit
I mean we've moved beyond that due to
the advances in technology and so on um
there are um quite long-standing
concerns around water and you know
connection to Water Supplies but you
know this is all an inheritance from the
1967 war you still have of course a
large Drew mainly Drew population in the
Golan Heights and they maintain quite
strong connections to their Syrian
identity um and it's also very peculiar
to see how uh how his baah would have
targeted them um there is an Israeli
military installation in the Golan
Heights so it may they aimed at that
sorry to uh bring you to uh the end of
your your thought there but we are out
of time HJ helier from the Carnegie

that the Israeli security cabinet has
basically authorized the Prime Minister
and the defense minister to decide on
the appropriate response and the timing
of that response um to that rocket
strike on Saturday and the country's
still very much uh reeling from this
attack in the Israeli occupied Goan
Heights the Israeli newspapers have the
pictures of of the 12 children aged
between 10 and 16 who were killed uh on
Saturday uh Israel's blaming the
powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah for
what happened saying it used uh an Iran
made uh missile Hezbollah continues to
deny its responsibility the threat from
Israel is that it's going to um exact a
heavy price from Hezbollah for what
happened what we've seen yesterday and
today has really been a continuation of
the cross border attacks relatively low
level that have gone on since the 8th of
October when Hezbollah said it was um
beginning to fire at Israel in
solidarity uh with Hamas in Gaza um but
the expectation from Israeli military
commentators is that something much more
serious uh is being planned uh they're
saying that there could be um an attack
on on a major hezb Target deep inside
Lebanon they're saying there's a
possibility that even Israel could
strike at Lebanese civilian
infrastructure the risk of course is
then what response would come uh from
Hezbollah which has a very big arsenal
of longer range Rockets um you've got
International diplomats all getting
involved to try to urge restraint to try

Israel says it has struck a series of
Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon
according to the Army terrorist
infrastructure was hit including
stockpiles of weapons it follows a
deadly rocket attack on the Israeli
occupied goolan Heights on Saturday in
which at least 12 people were killed
most of the casualties were teenagers
who were playing football in the town of
majal Shams Israel has blamed lebanon's
Hezbollah movement it has denied
responsibility Let's cross live now to
Jerusalem and speak to our correspondent
Barbara plat user welcome to you Barbara
tell us what's the latest on the Israeli
strikes the Israelis uh carried out
these strikes overnight in Lebanon in
the southern part of the country um
where those crossb conflicts has been
happening um over the past months with
Hezbollah but also further north in the
Baka uh according to the the Air Force
and that is uh less common for the
Israelis to strike there so I think that
was probably a message that they are
preparing for um uh for for a larger
operation and certainly that is what uh
the Israeli officials are saying the
language that they're using is very
tough the defense minister uh has said
we'll ensure that Hezbollah pays a heavy
price for this loss the Finance Minister
uh is is calling for the the the grp the
leader of Hezbollah to pay with his head
the for the foreign minister is saying
an allout war is approaching so the
rhetoric is pretty steep uh there's
going to be a security cabinet meeting
later today when the Prime Minister
returns from the United States to talk
about what the next step will be but I
think everyone is expecting uh that the
strikes that we saw overnight could be
just the beginning uh of how the
Israelis will respond and what more
details do we have about the rocket
attack on the goolan Heights in which at
least 12 people
died well that rocket struck a football
pitch where where uh children and
teenagers were playing football it it
frankly it could hardly have been worse
the all of the casualties are are young
people uh many of the names have been
released as well as the ages the
youngest was 10 the oldest was 16 uh and
there was one family that lost four
children so it's a real tragedy the
funerals are have started last night and
they will continue uh later today uh an
eyewitness said that the sirens did go
off when the rocket uh was in the was in
the air but there wasn't enough time to
get to the shelter the children were
running towards the shelter uh but the
the Goan Heights is very close to
Lebanon and so the time before the
warning came and the time that the
rocket struck wasn't enough and it
struck between the children and the and
the shelter so uh it was it was a very
very uh tragic and and uh strike and the
leadership of the community has
responded with great anger and great
anguish uh against those who Hezbollah
or they didn't name Hezbollah but they
said against the terrorists who launched
the strike but also against the Israeli
authorities saying that we really don't
have enough protection here uh because
we're right next to the border with
Lebanon we need to have more uh
protection we've had strikes before this
is just the deadliest one yeah Hezbollah
denying it was them but Israel the IDF
giving details about the rocket uh and
the bomb and saying it could only have
been
them that's right Hezbollah had been
carrying out some strikes earlier in the
afternoon on Saturday day for which it
claimed responsibility but uh it very
strongly denied that it had hit the town
of maal shamp so when the extent of the
damage became known uh based on what it
had said earlier it was targeting an
Israeli military base in the area so
it's possible that one of the rockets
misfired in fact that seems probable
it's interesting to see the reaction in
Lebanon because this conflict has been
taking place between Hezbollah and the
Israelis uh but other uh constituencies
in Lebanon have responded clearly
because they're very alarmed that this
is going to lead to a a bigger conflict
if not an allout War the head of the
Drew community in Lebanon and I should
say that the community that was hit in
Israel in the Israeli occupied Golan
Heights uh which is where M Mel Shams is
located uh was a community of uh Arab
Drews there are many Drews also in
Lebanon and the leader of that group um
did come out and condemn the killing of
civilians but he also said look
Hezbollah statement said they weren't
responsible we have to remember that the
Israelis um try to divide uh and sight
Discord and fragment the region with
their efforts and so he was putting the
emphasis on Israel rather than on
Hezbollah uh and calling for an
immediate cessation of hostilities and a
ceasefire the Lebanese government also
has made various statements it usually
stays out of of this ongoing conflict
but it again condemned the killing of
civilians but said uh that there must be
a sensation of hostilities the foreign
minister has spoken recently and he said
look I don't think hbal would have
targeted this community it's a community
of Arab Drews as I mentioned and uh and
we have a large uh number of them in the
country perhaps it was a mistake either
by Hezbollah or by Israel um but he
clearly was worried that this would lead
to a bigger conflict and he said we are
talking with Hezbollah uh and and asking
them not to retaliate at this present
time so I think uh the expectation is of
a strong Israeli strike and clearly the
Lebanese authorities are trying to
convince Hezbollah not to respond to
that okay Barbara thank you well we will
be live in Beirut in just a few moments

months into an allout War some kind of
Israeli response looks absolutely
inevitable if you think back a week or
so to that uh yemeni houthi drone attack
in Tel AV that killed one civilian that
triggered a major Israeli response and
so I think that is likely to happen we
are still in claim and counter claim
territory Hezbollah says that it was not
responsible for this rocket but at just
about the time when those first reports
of injuries were coming in they claimed
to have hit a nearby Israeli military
base so it does look likely that
Hezbollah was responsible and the fears

Hamas was launching attacks on Israeli
soldiers and also stockpiling large
quantities of weapons and that um every
attempt was made to reduce the number of
Civilian casualties but along with the
other attacks that have happened around
hunis uh in southern Gaza today it's
taken the death toll or the number of
those killed today so far in in those
attacks to more than 55 and Mark you
mentioned Han Unice we also mentioned in
my introduction about how the Israeli
Army has an evacuation order for
southern areas of Han units these are
areas of course that were previously
designated as humanitarian zones but the
Army is saying that this is all in
response to Rocket fire so what more do
we know about what's happening
there yeah well this is a strip of
territory it's actually called Al maasi
it's on the outskirts of Han Yunis it's
a coastal uh strip which is just 16
square km 10 square miles and it had
been designated a humanitarian Zone and
and it's massively overcrowded because
of course it contains hundreds of
thousands of people who had been told by
the Israeli Army to go there because it
was a place of relative safety I mean
all nowhere in Gaza is safe as you know
and and you know there have been attacks
on almasi in in recent weeks so it is a
place of relative safety what the
Israeli Defense Forces have now said
that they have adjusted the border of
the humanitarian Zone in that area
because they say that Hamas is operating
in a in in a in a a corner of it and
launching attacks on Israeli soldiers so
they have basically reduced the size of
the humanitarian Zone and dropped flyers
and sent messages to people telling them
to move that area it's the second time
in a week reini that the Israeli Defense
Forces have adjusted the boundaries of
that humanitarian Zone last week they
did so just before an operation by IDF
soldiers there in order to retrieve five
the bodies of five Israeli hostages
seized by Hamas on the 7th of October we
don't know what um kind of operation
would be launched now uh but the
Israelis say that they're preparing for
what they what they call a forceful
operation and an intervention in that
area",20240727

Harris has had what she describes as a
Frank and constructive meeting with the
visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in it the Democratic
presidential hopeful expressed her
serious concern about Palestinian
civilian casualties in Israel's war with
Hamas she also reiterated her unwavering
commitment to the US allies security but
urged Mr Netanyahu to agree to a
ceasefire deal let's hear some of what
Kam Harris had to say after the
meeting I have met with the families of
these American hostages multiple times
now and I've told them each time they
are not alone and I stand with
them and President Biden and I are
working every day to bring them home I
also expressed with the Prime Minister
my serious concern about the scale of
human suffering in Gaza including the
death of far too many innocent
civilians and I made clear my serious
concern about the dire humanitarian
situation there with over 2 million
people facing high levels of food
insecurity and half a million people
facing catastrophic levels of acute food
insecurity what has happened in Gaza
over the past nine months is devastating
the images of dead children and
desperate hungry people fleeing for
safety sometimes displaced for the
second third or fourth time we cannot
look away in the face of these tragedies
we cannot allow ourselves to become numb
to the suffering and I will not be
silent it is time for this war to end
and end in a way where Israel is secure
all the hostages are released the
suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends
and the Palestinian people can exercise
their right to Freedom dignity and
self-determination there has been
hopeful movement in the talks to secure
an agreement on this deal and as I just
told prime minister Netanyahu it is time
to get this deal
done a North America correspondent
presid David Wills gave us the latest
from Washington Benjamin Netanyahu met
with both Joe Biden and kamla Harris
today and the White House in a readout
of his meeting with Joe Biden said that
Mr Biden called for a ceasefire in Gaza
and for the release of the remaining
hostages as soon as possible as it put
it and carela Harris as we just heard
went further than that uh taking concern
registering her concern about the
growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and
saying that the time had come to do a
deal and she also said to Mr Netanyahu
that she would not be silent about the
suffering of the Palestinian people now
some here are taking that to mean that
she may adopt a different stance perhaps
a more aggressive stance towards Israel
than Joe Biden has done should she be
elected of course in the uh presidential
election in November kamla Harris has
been critical of the uh Israeli
Administration most recently back in
March and um a lot of people have been
looking to see what she makes of uh uh
Benjamin netanyahu's visit these these
last few days as some sort of indication
of how she would engage with the
israelies going forward",20240726

Netanyahu has addressed the US Congress
saying America and Israel must stand
together if they're to defeat what he
called the forces of barbarism he's
looking to boost support for the war
against Hamas in Gaza and has vowed to
in his words finish the job but
thousands of demonstrators gathered
outside the capital to protest about the
war and dozens of democratic members of
Congress refused to attend his speech an
American flag was burnt and statues
outside Union Station were defaced from
Washington Tom baitman
reports a short walk back into the
American Limelight after months of fraud
ties between the US leadership and the
Israeli Prime Minister here among
friends many Republicans but some
notable absences from Joe Biden's
Democrats Benjamin Netanyahu started by
thanking the president he rightly called
Hamas sheer evil he dispatched two
aircraft carriers to the Middle East to
deter a wider War
and he came to Israel to stand with us
during our darkest hour a visit that
will never be
forgotten he quickly turned to the issue
of hostages still held by Hamas with
families and one of those freed watching
trying to point to his accomplishments
Israel has already brought home 135 of
these hostages including seven who were
freed and during rescue operations
another outside the protesters came in
their thousands headed to the heart of
US democracy or as close as they could
get anger has raged over the huge
numbers of civilians killed in Gaza it's
shameful that he's been invited to speak
before Congress um it's shameful what
our government has been allowing to
happen and aiding and
funding you can see how the pressure has
been building on Benjamin Netanyahu and
then there are his critics at home some
of whom have accused him of not gripping
a ceasefire deal hard enough because of
his own political problems and so
arriving here at the US capital for him
is the big prize as he tries to Face Off
his
opponents the Israeli leader castigated
the demonstrated but there was more to
come inside the
chamber a silent protest from Rashida

woman to serve here roughly half the
elected Democrats in Congress are
believed to have stayed away with the
vice president carala Harris also absent
her office said due to a schedule clash

start in Washington where Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing
to address the joint houses of Congress
in a few hours time amid protests over
his handling of the war in Gaza on his
first trip since the devastating attack
by Hamas on October the 7th Mr Netanyahu
has said that he'll be seeking to
consolidate bipartisan support for
Israel but several us lawmakers have
said they won't attend in a statement
the number two ranking Democrat in the
Senate Durban said I will stand by
Israel but I will not stand and cheer
its current prime minister we protest
against Mr netanyahu's visit started
last night hundreds of Jewish
demonstrators saging a sit in at the
capital to protest against the war in
Gaza those people were later removed by
police so let's go back live to Capitol
Hill live to Katrina Perry who is there
for us and uh we've seen more and more
protesters Gathering quite close to
where you are I know you're going to
talk to Tom bitman our correspondent
who's among them in a moment or two so
aside from all of that tell me a little
more about the raw politics of what
we're going to get a little later in
Congress well this is a very divisive
issue here in the US obviously President
Biden standing so strongly and so
squarely beside prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over these past months since
those October 7th attacks but his
support is not universally welcomed not
even within his own party where there
isn't Unity somewhere between 30 and 50
Democratic lawmakers will boycott this
speech today you mentioned dick Durban
well the only Democrat that's senior to
him is Chuck Schumer he has said he will
be there but very many of his colleagues
won't many of them holding counter
events rallies and joining the protests
themselves um opposed to how prime
minister nanah who is handling this and
there are those who are protesting
because they want a stronger position in
terms of getting the hostages home and
those who are protesting because they
are want more done for the Palestinian
people in Gaza making the point to
President Biden that he will he should
tell prime minister netan Yahoo that the
war is against Hamas and not the
Palestinian
people a twin question here because
after the events of Sunday is there
likely to be much greater behind the
scenes pressure to get Benjamin
Netanyahu to sign up to that ceasefire
deal and a broader thought too because
right at the start October the 7th
America absolutely in lock step with
Israel there's been a subtle shift the
longer this war has gone on the way that
Israel has executed the war with
increasing concern just tell me about
both those
elements indeed well firstly President
Biden obviously not seeking reelection
that changes the calculation for him
personally and how he will now approach
his relationship with prime minister
Netanyahu who he will meet at the White
House tomorrow it now becomes even more
personal than it ever was for Joe Biden
he has a legacy that he needs to protect
now he has only a couple of months left
as president he doesn't want to be seen
as a lame duck president and this is
absolutely one of the goals that he
would like to deliver upon before he
leaves office in January a proud Zionist
he's spent so much of his career
standing close to Israel and particular
with prime minister Netanyahu but we
have seen that relationship change and
shift in recent months here in the
aftermath of October 7th President Biden
obviously traveling to Israel that
Embrace with Netanyahu there and I can
tell you here in the US there was almost
zero coverage of what was actually
happening in Gaza the ground swell of
support was very much towards Israel
that has shifted over the past months
and now there is a a growing and
significant public anger in this country
of what is happening in Gaza and the
death toll and the continuing horrific
humanitarian crisis so we're seeing
protesters here today who are coming for
a whole variety of reasons and we can
cross over now to my colleague
correspondent Tom baitman who is down
behind me somewhere here in the middle
of the protest Tom can you describe the
scene for us where you
are blood is on yeah I mean we got here
about half an hour ago and in that time
many many more protesters have arrived
speeches from the stage just getting
underway in the last 10 minutes one
speaker talking about tens of thousands
of people killed he said by Benjamin
Netanyahu what the protesters say they
want to do here is carry out they say a
citizens arrest against Benjamin
Netanyahu now clearly uh they're not
going to be able to get anywhere near
him if you look this way you can see uh
the Dome of the capital building in the
distance here I just took a walk up the
path here there are at this point you
know huge barricades dozens of police
they've tried to put effectively a ring
of Steel around the capital building uh
there was a van pulling up uh just as I
walked up there and boxes of cuffs those
plastic cuffs to Cuff people being
pulled out so already I think they're
anticipating the possibility or the
potential um for trouble here later but
at the moment as you can see things are
extremely calm and people peacefully
protesting um the organizers talked
about wanting to get tens of thousands
of people to come to Washington today
certainly buses were being laid on uh
from cities all over the East Coast so
the potential for a very very large
turnout as people try to make their
voices heard but crucially you know as
they get to the heart of American
democracy here their path is going to be
blocked as we get into the hours towards
Mr netanyahu's speech
and Tom talk to us a little bit about
the people who are already there what
are they saying to you about the reason
for coming here today to protest while
the prime minister is
speaking well overwhelmingly at this
protest and others you know they've had
recently that we've covered um people
talk about wanting to protest against
Israel's military offensive in Goda and
the scale of uh the uh numbers of
civilians killed by the Israeli
offensive uh fundamentally one of the
first reasons that's often quoted many
of the banners here are also about US
military aid for Israel that's an
absolutely fundamental issue not just in
the protest outside but of course
Katrina as you were mentioning the many
Democrats it seems that will boyot the
speech by Benjamin Netanyahu um the
Israel receiv received $3.8 billion
worth of US military assistance per year
historically cumulatively
recipient of American military aid
historically and that has been one of
the fundamental grievances particularly
among Democrats that they have tried to
push Joe Biden to change stack on to
change c um and there's only been that
one moment where a consignment of 2,000
bombs were held back um by the Americans
to the Israelis the administration said
at that point that that was over the
fact that they had such a huge imp
in densely built areas in Gaza now some
of that Consignment the 500b bombs were
since allowed to flow again but that key
point that relationship of military
assistance has not budged under Joe
Biden although he himself has talked
about indiscriminate bombing by the
Israelis in Gaza but he has very much
been frustrated ex exasperated by his
inability to cajo Benjamin Netanyahu to
switch course fundamentally over
humanarian crisis inaz
Li okay Tom thanks for that it is
obviously very loud where you are so
thanks for for bringing us that we will
speak to you a little later on prime
minister netanyahu's speech will take
place here behind me at the capital just
a couple of hours from now and he is
expected to use that speech to speak to
a number of audiences obviously the
domestic audience here in the US and the
lawmakers who ultimately have control
over various funding votes of support
Military Support to Israel but he's also
going to be addressing the domestic
audience back in Israel before he
boarded the plane to fly here earlier in
the week he himself was subject to many
protests in Israel it's the first time
he's left the country since those
October 7th attacks and there is a
ground swell of public feeling there um
against the what the prime minister is
doing to get those hostages back to
Israel who continue to be held by Hamas
in Gaza",20240724

until Thursday I spoke to our

user who told me more about the
situation in
hunis that military operation is
continuing the Israelis say they have
conducted more air strikes and they've
also destroyed uh weapons weapon stores
as well as tunnels they're going after
Hamas militants they say in the Eastern
districts of kanun now they thought they
had cleared this area earlier in the
year there was a sweeping operation in
the city of kanun and then they pulled
out in April but then they they said
that there had been increased rocket
fire from this particular area that
Hamas was regroup grouping so they'
moved in again but those evacuation
orders were then given to the people
living there so around 400,000 people
were living in this area many of them
having been displaced uh previously and
as you mentioned this was a part of this
area was had been designated uh a
humanitarian zone so yesterday we had
people fleeing with very little notice
uh just picking up what they could carry
and some of them running out uh but not
fast enough because uh you you were
saying that the casualty figures there
many were killed and in injured and now
looking for another place to stay um
they can go to the other designated
humanitarian Zone but that is quite
crowded with other people there aren't
that many services uh and as a un
official said uh the the the front line
keeps suffocating them it keeps moving
and people are constantly asking where
can we go now where can we go now um
there's no place safe so the this has
been again another Mass displacement in
Gaza and Barbara let's talk about benj
in netanyahu's trip to Washington as he
was leaving Israel there were protests
weren't there people saying he should be
staying and and working on a deal to
free Israeli hostages but he is in
Washington uh what are people saying
there about their expectations for this
meeting with President Biden and of
course he's going to be meeting kamla
Harris as
well well he's going he's gone to
Washington at a time of great political
turbulence hasn't he because uh Mr Biden
has said he will drop out of the
presidential race so Kamala Harris is
possibly probably going to replace him
as a candidate so Mr Netanyahu is
meeting with Mr Biden as well as Kamala
Harrison he's also apparently asked for
a meeting with the former president
Trump so trying to figure out what the
political landscape in Washington is
like but he is under great pressure to
agree to a ceasefire deal in order to um
bring a pause in the fighting and also
to release Israeli hostages that
pressure comes from the Biden
Administration for sure uh from the
Democrat from elements in the Democrat
party as well and from the families of
the hostages he met them in Washington
but before he left they were protesting
regularly telling him you've got to sign
this deal uh don't go to Washington
before you do so that that pressure has
accompanied him to Washington but it
started here in Israel Barbara PL user
well as you've been hearing the World
Health Organization is warning that it
is extremely worried about a possible
polio outbreak in Gaza its Regional head
says many people are living in shelters
with just one toilet for 600 people and
little access to Safe Drinking Water
let's speak now to Samir sah who is
director of programs at Medical Aid for
Palestinians Samir thank you very much
for joining us on BBC News you obviously
must share those concerns expressed by
the World Health Organization traces of
polio have been found in the sewers in
Gaza um but the last case was in 1984 I
believe How likely is it that you were
going to see an outbreak do you
think thank you for inviting me as you
rightly stated last case was 1984 and uh
it was 23rd of June they took seven
samples from a sewage site in Gaza and
they found that six of them were
actually positive for what you call
vaccine derived polio virus now this
vaccine derived polio virus comes from a
strain which is from the weakend live
virus which is given an oral polio crops
it is of massive concern because uh this
is a population that is under continuous
bombardment have been displaced multiple
times and there are children who haven't
been vaccinated for polio so if this
strain gets into children who haven't
been vaccinated or who have a weakened
immune system they will get polio which
leads to paralysis of the lyms how
contagious is
polio it's very contagious it it's
basically a feal oral transmission Route
so which means that it's from the waste
in the sewage and in the uh gutters
outside and at the moment because
there's no waste disposal happening it's
very likely that it's going to
spread given that medical facilities in
Gaza are overwhelmed as as we've heard
uh what approach are you going to try to
to be working on to to deal with the
situation if people have not had young
children especially haven't had vaccin
inations or have only perhaps gotten
partway through the course of
vaccinations I mean the only thing that
we can do at the moment is make sure
that children receive vaccination but
actually the solution is not just
vaccination the solution is that there
should be a ceasefire now the solution
is that there should be an increase in
the aid going into Gaza especially
access to clean drinking water and
access to medical supplies and Medical
Teams going in to give you an idea there
were 11,000 trucks going in every month
uh before the crisis started for the
month of June compared to 11,000 only
581 trucks went into Gaza so actually
not much Aid is going and then ceasefire
is also important because the repair of
the sewage system the repair of the
water supply system is important you
have to clean up tons of waste that is
on the streets of Gaza and you have to
rebuild roads you have to provide the
transport system so people can get into
medical facilities in fact the bombings
have to stop so that people can access
medical care and just finally briefly
Samir without a ceasefire currently
obviously to what extent can your teams
um mitigate the outbreak of of a disease
like
this it's extremely difficult it's
extremely difficult because uh if you
know there's zero electricity in Gaza at
the
moment vaccines need a cold chain which
means they need to be kept refrigerated
so even if you deliver a lot of vaccines
then there's a big challenge of keeping
them
refrigerated uh in fact even fuel is in
short supply inside
Gaza and so yeah our our response uh is
quite challenging it's very difficult to
provide the vaccines uh even with the
teams and even if you are providing the
vaccines you are not taking care of the
live virus that is in the seage system
already so you have to tackle that as
well Samir sa thank you very much
director of programs at Medical Aid for
pales
Ians and let's return now to the
political situation in the Middle East
and uh China says 14 Palestinian
factions have agreed to set up an
interim National reconciliation
government to govern Gaza after the war
ends it follows talks in Beijing between
representatives from each group
including Hamas and fata which is in
charge of the occupied West Bank the
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi who
attended the discussions hailed what he
called The Beijing declaration Let's uh
talk about this some more now with the
founder of China dialogue trust Isabelle
Hilton Isabelle thank you very much uh
for joining us many previous efforts to
uh to try to deal with antagonism
between Hamas and fata and various other
groups have have failed um how much
weight do you put behind this effort and
this
declaration well it it's quite a big
declaration uh it's significant in that
China doesn't usually you know take
risks like this um so China does have
quite a lot of heft um as you say a lot
of previous attempts have failed
including attempts broken by Egypt and
many other intermediaries and we have
nearly 20 years of hostility now between
these two factions but we are in an
extreme situation we've got the
continuing War and the devastation of
Gaza conflict on the West Bank and the
United States which is m in its own
electoral politics and therefore can be
you know has limited has limited effect
and and the
frustration that President Biden has
been unable apparently to restrain
Benjamin Netanyahu which is you know
causing waves in the region so for China
this is a big opportunity and and it's
one that they have steadily been uh
taking advantage of the talks began very
early in the year in Moscow and then
moved to Beijing in April in May China
hosted big uh Arab conference as part of
its uh now continuing diplomacy with the
Arab world in which China posited the
need for an International Peace
conference and now this so there's been
a lot of setting up of context here so
why I is China uh positioning itself
like this trying to broker some kind of
deal and and to what extent do you think
those involved in the talks in
Washington Joe Biden CA Harris Benjamin
Netanyahu to extent do you think they
will be paying attention to what's been
happening in Beijing well I think they
will be paying attention there is a
fundamental uh difference in approach in
that the United States insists that
Hamas must recognize the right of Israel
to exist and there has been nothing in
any Chinese statement to that effect so
we have you know essentially a very
different approach but the fact that
China's weight in the region has been
growing so much it has good relations
with Iran it has good relations with
Saudi Arabia it's one of the biggest
customers for Middle East energy it's a
supplier of renewable energy so
altogether China's uh position in the
gulf and and in what it caus West Asia
is actually getting very strong and the
United States is beginning to look as
though it can't quite you know
manipulate things as it as it used to it
can't quite bring a result as it used to
so for China this is a big win in terms
of its Global image just very briefly
Isabelle because we're almost out of
time interesting also that Ukraine's
foreign minister dimitro kba uh is in
China at the invite the behest of the
the Chinese they sent the invitation um
what might be happening there well I you
there has been it's interesting because
there's been very little contact between
China and Ukraine and I think China is
trying to trying to correct the global
impression of facilitating and
supporting Russia in its aggressive war
against Ukraine I think that is doing
diplomatic damage China again is trying
to present itself as a peacemaker It
produced a 12-point plan last year with
no diplomatic underpinning but it
continues to maintain a a posture if you
like of wanting peace okay Isabelle
Hilton founder of China dialogue trust

operations so the Israelis had carried
out a massive sweeping operation in the
city of Kanan yunes earlier in the year
against Hamas uh and then they left um
and now they're saying that the Hamas is
regrouping in part of the city and is is
attacking them uh in the Eastern
districts and so it's moving back in and
it issued this evacuation order telling
people there to leave right away now the
people there many of them had been
displaced from earlier operations and
they started to flee in panic almost
right away but not fast enough uh
because according to the health Ministry
uh which is with according to the health
Ministry about 70 people were killed in
200 uh injured and these displaced
people now are looking for new places to
go part of this area had been designated
a humanitarian Zone uh as you mentioned
they're going to another area that has
also been designated but that's very
crowded uh not much room for to put up
shelter not much services and also
frankly not safe a un official said this
the the front line keeps suffocating
them uh that it just keeps moving and
closing in on them and Barbara what is
known about the visit of Mr n Yahoo to
the US what's its purpose and who will
he now meet given the change in politics
there he was invited to speak to a joint
session of Congress that with that
invitation was initially put forward by
the Republican speaker um so he has gone
there to do that now the politics have
shifted uh in the meantime so he will be
of course meeting President Biden but he
will also meet Kamala Harris uh the
presumptive nominee at this point and he
has asked we are told and we understand
to meet with uh pres the former
president Donald Trump as well um so he
is going to be a hedging his bets I
suppose or laying the groundwork for
whatever might come but his message is
going to be the same I think as it has
been he's very much Under Pressure to
agree to a ceasefire in Gaza both by the
families of hostages and by the Biden
Administration and and some of the
democratic party he keeps saying no the
military pressure is working uh Hamas is
losing its Spirit he's just said the

last few minutes the un's top Court the
international court of justice has
delivered an advisory opinion outlining
that Israel's settlement of Palestinian
territories are in breach of
international law now it had been
examining the issue since the beginning
of last year uh I think we can take a
quick listen now to that opinion being
given
live the court considers it important to
stress as it did in its wall advisor
opinion I quote the Urgent necessity for
the United Nations as a whole to
redouble its efforts to bring the
Israeli Palestinian conflict which
continues court giving its opinion live
there in the heg I want to leave that
momentarily and just bring in our
security correspondent Frank Gardner uh
into this and Frank just explain to
viewers at home what exactly the court
has been looking into CU important to
underline that this has been going on
since before the October 7th uh attacks
by ham and the start of the Gaza
War that's right so this this this is
the international court of justice not
the international criminal court it's
issuing a um an advisory it's not
legally binding but it will be seen as a
basis for international law and it's
looking at it's examining the legality
of Israel's occupation of Palestinian
territor since 1967 particularly
focusing on the West Bank and East
Jerusalem and settlements therein and
it's a pretty damning verdict on
Israel's actions and policies there I'm
just going to because this is incredibly
legales and as you can imagine there was
a big Preamble as to what the framework
of their observ their work has been this
is delivered by the spokesperson for 15
judges they've been examining this since
2022 they took evidence throughout
February from around 50 countries and
their conclusions in brief are that
Israel's policies and practices are in
breach of international law the
continued presence of Israel in the
occupied territories is illegal and they
call on Israel to cease all new
settlement activity it particularly
focuses on the settlements and the
treatment of Palestinians in those
territories now Israel I think will um
they're unlikely to accept this in the
past that they have not accepted the
legality of uh rulings when it comes to
their occupation and Palestinian
territories but I think it's it's a
pretty hostile verdict for Israel this
okay Frank well we have to leave it
there I'm afraid but Frank Gardner

quite a difficult topic for the the

the weeks after the war started a lot of
people within the party supporters
members of parliament and other people
associated with it were concerned that
the leadership wasn't going far enough
in their eyes in condemning what was
happening and so Mr Lamy and K now have
quite a few number of decisions to make
on Gaza in terms of what's Happening for
example are they going to restart the
funding to the United Nations agency
that looks after displaced Palestinians
Palestinian refugees notably in Gaza
what does the UK government make of this
request we saw for an arrest warrant to

reports of 90 dead and we heard there
the Israeli Prime Minister saying
they're not sure actually they even got
their target so does all this mean fresh
scrutiny for
Israel yes I think the size of this
strike and the number of casualties
including reportedly many children are
likely to raise fresh International
questions over where and how Israel
targets Hamas leaders Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu a short
while ago gave a press conference and he
said he'd authorized the attack after
asking military Chiefs three questions
he wanted to know if there were any
Israeli hostages in the area what kind
of weapons would be used and also what
he called what the collateral damage
would be there was no reference in that
press conference to the 90 people
reported dead and none of the local

likely to be raised as a question

the number of people killed in an
Israeli air strike near the southern
city of KH Unice has risen to at least
71 nearly 300 more are said to have been
injured the attack happened in the
masawi area of hunis the Israeli
military has designated this area a safe
Zone urging Palestinians to seek shelter
there it says the strike was on a Hamas
a fenced Hamas area and described most
people there as militants these pictures
are of the moment of the blast an
eyewitness has described the scene to
the BBC saying it was like an earthquake
doctors at a nearby Field Hospital are
reported to be struggling to cope with
the scores of casualties well here's the
BBC's Nick beak with more on the strike
this is an area where Palestinians had
been told by the Israeli authorities
that they would be safe it was a
designated so-called safe Zone but
clearly what's happened is there's been
a huge air strike here what's clear is a
lot of people have been killed and that
figure could rise sharply it would seem
you talked about some of the video we
saw some of the video there and it
really shows a very graphic and
distressing scene this huge plume of
smoke an indication of just how big the
blast was this air strike was the damage
it did you've got families digging a
amid the rubble you've got other
relatives being consoled blooded
casualties being loaded onto stretchers
and in the nearby Q8 field Hospital
completely packed chaos there some
people some people being treated on the
floor it appears some children are
injured as well no word yet from the
Israeli Defense Forces officially but
interestingly the Israeli uh military
radio station is citing defense sources
three defense sources saying that this
was a very significant strike now we
don't know if that's significant in
terms of the loss of life which clearly
a lot of people have been killed here or
whether it was very significant in that
as has been the case in previous strikes
the Israeli military have targeted Hamas
individuals and we've seen lots of
people die as a result of that and we do
know there has been Fierce fighting in
this area in recent days just talk us
through what's been
happening you Han Unice is right in the
south of the Gaza Strip where the
fighting has continued as well as in
Gaza City which is gaza's biggest city
and other parts of the strip as well
with people being reported killed every
day so this is the reality I mean
there's one District of Gaza City itself
where the authorities said that they
recovered 60 bodies after a very intense
48 Hours of military operations by the
Israeli government of course the
government here says that the mission to
destroy Hamas continues and won't stop
until it's done all the while these
peace talks are going on but no
indication that they made a huge amount
of progress this week in the
conversations in in Doha also there were
some talks uh in Egypt as well and this
is The Bleak reality this is the horror
what we of what's happening and I think
the images we're seeing today speak for
themselves Israel's Army Radio has said
the target of the strike was the Hamas
military Chief Muhammad Dave well Hamas
has denied this let's bring in our Gaza
correspondent rushi abulu who is in
Istanbul rushi what are you
hearing yeah still no confirmation
denial from Hamas about this they said
what happened is a a war crime committed
by Israel targeting innocent civilian in
the so-call safe Zone what happened we
have been talking to many sources in the
area there was the the main strike that
hit a building which house some
uh you know uh Food Distribution Center
Then followed by about four or five
secondary air strikes around around the
the area one of them was targeting also
a a civil defense uh car that rushed to
uh rescue the the people so it's very
complicated sort of area because the
area where uh west of canun it's called
alasi it's the area that designated as a
safe Zone with about 700,000 people they
live there very crowded area that why we
have seen this huge number of casualties
about 71 confirmed killed and over 200
people were injured doctors are
struggling in three medical centers uh
to save people lives the number of
patient and the number of injured
arrived very quickly to the hospital is
huge and and and doctors are trying to
cope with the situation about Muhammad
Dev he's the command
military commander of Hamas he's been
targeted four or five times by Israel he
was seriously injured back in 2014 uh
War there is no confirmation yet from
Hamas about him but this is the highest
ranking uh name or military Chief and
he's the one who followed the 7th of
October attack by Hamas he made this
speech and uh he was addressing the the
people afterwards so it's quite
significant if he's the Target it is
very significant the area is significant
because it's the safe Zone and the
number of people killed is a huge in the
city and we were just showing a a
picture of Muhammad Dave back in 1996 so
a very old image but just talk us
through what we know about
him he was you know a mastermind behind
most of the Hamas attacks for the last
25 30 years Muhammad de is is is a well
known they call him
the the chief commander of the military
Wing he was until recently during this
war when the Israeli intelligence
released fresh picture of
him everybody thought that he was half a
person like he used to have a lot of
rumors about him that he's he lost his
hand in one of the he lost his eye he
lost his his wife and his brother and
Israel tried to kill him many many times
I remember for the last 20 years
covering
this conflict I have covered at least
four or five times when Muhammad de was
was a Target they tried to kill him
after the Hamas kidnapped gilad Shalit
in 2006 they tried to kill him in the
2009 war and they killed his wife and
his family members in 2014 in a house in
Gaza City and he was badly injured so
Israel has been hunting for him for a
very long time and if they good him I
think it's it's significant is he would
be the highest ranking person killed in
this world and Ry while we have you
we're just going to be showing some live
pictures now in K Unice there you go um
that is near to the blast sites near to
uh the hospital there you can see that
there are a number of people walking
around on the streets um we're hearing
since the start of the war
38,000 people according to the Hamas uh
Health Ministry have been killed what
are eyewitnesses saying to you uh you've
been speaking to some people on the
ground the um uh the Israeli military
saying that the strike was on a fenced
Hamas area uh others saying that this
was actually a safe zone for
Palestinians are you getting an a
clearer idea of where this strike took
place yeah just to explain the alasi
area is like a small strip of land in
the eastern western part ofun is near
the beach it's agricultural area with a
lot of farms and uh back
in October and November and December
Israel said this is the area is called
the safe Zone they were uh you know
ordering people from RAF from kanun from
all around the Gaza Strip to go there
because it's safe the area is like twice
the size of hro airport and it's very
densely populated area with thousands of
tins are there and many of you know
small makeshift houses were set up in
the in the area the area is really
crowded and according to Witnesses what
happened is like earthquake is about
three air strikes using you know fighter
jits in the area and about three four
secondary strikes maybe used drone or
quad cter drones in the area so it's
quite
big strike in a a significant area where
very crowded place near a market near
you know a food distribution center many
civilian casualties in the area we have
seen image of people digging in their
bare hand trying to get their uh you
know loved ones from under the the rubel
in the hospital there's too many
civilians we we have seen footage of wom
children are among those killed in the
area well as I said Hamas officially
deny Hamas officially said this is a war
crime and Israel is responsible for
killing innocent civilian in a safe Zone
Witnesses are reporting as I said
many civilian casualties are among the
people who were killed in the area very
conflicting report about the number very
conflicting report about the situation
for the injured very serious injuries
are still in the hospital but the
overall number is still 71 killed and
over 100 200 people
injured okay uh rushy uh there are Gaza
correspondent with the latest well um we
are just getting some more information
in uh the Israeli uh Israeli official
has confirmed Hamas military Chief was
the target of the strike this is
according to an Israeli official the IDF
struck Muhammad Dave and Rafa Salamar
ahead of the Khan Unice Brigade who were
some of the masterminds they say behind
the 7th of October Massacre now they
they're saying that this strike was
carried out uh within a fenced area
where according to its information were
there and only Hamas terrorists no
civilians as I say this is coming from

Unis yeah well eyewitnesses have been
talking to the BBC Nikki and they've
been describing this horrific scene
yesterday this was a site in the south
of the Gaza Strip near near the the city
of hanun and it was somewhere where a
lot of displaced Palestinian families
had been seeking shelter and safety
there was apparently food and water
there some of the children were able to
have lessons but this missile struck
yesterday uh without any warning and
eyewitnesses have described a graphic
horrific aftermath including women and
children having been killed some medical
officials are saying that at least 29
people were killed as for the Israeli
response to this they say they're
looking into claims that Ians were
killed the Israelis are saying though
that they yes they carried out this
attack but they were targeting an
individual who they said was a Hamas
operative who they say was involved in
the October the 7th attacks and that was
the justification for striking there as
you were saying this is the fourth
attack on a school that was being used
to shelter people in the past four days
and in the first three cases the Israeli
authorities said that they were
targeting Hamas politicians or Hamas
police officers or Hamas fighters in
these locations so that's why they were
they were aiming for them the Israeli
attacks also happening around Gaza
City yeah that's right and we've seen
quite an an increase in activity around
that place of course thousands of people
Palestinians having to move because of
the fighting ranging raging there Hamas
said that they've been engaging with
Israeli Fighters uh Israeli troops
claiming to have killed some of them at
the same time the Hamas leadership is
saying that the ongoing Israeli
operations are putting in danger and
threatening the peace talks that you
mentioned that are once again taking
place in Qatar today and there is some
optimism that sort of built up over the
past 10 days or so that the two sides
may be reaching an agreement but
obviously what happened yesterday
doesn't help at all and you've got the
Prime Minister here Benjamin Netanyahu
found to keep up the fighting to destroy
Hamas even though opposition figures and
also we're seeing some senior members of
the military here apparently believing
that the idea of completely destroying
Hamas just isn't possible to
do and Nick on these um ceasefire talks
you talk about optimism some of this
seems to be around that demand that uh
Reports say Hamas have dropped about uh
there being the permanent ceasefire
yeah this is absolutely the Crux of it
so what they're looking at at the moment
what they're discussing is a proposal
that was put forward by President Biden
back in May and it would involve
initially a six- week truce a pausing
the fighting during which time more
hostages taken by Hamas on October the
7th could be released and returned to
their families it seems in the past week
that Hamas has dropped this key demand
and they were saying that if there is
going to be this process right at the
the start the Israelis have to say this
will be an absolute complete ceasefire
and that the troops will go the tanks
will go and there won't be a resumption
of Israeli operations now if that is the
case if Hamas has uh said that's
something they'll
accept then potentially that does mean
that they are moving in the same
direction but as we've been hearing
publicly the proclamations from both
sides suggest there is Big tensions I
think interesting to listen to the White
House they've been saying that despite
all that's being banded about behind
closed doors and remember this is a a
private negotiation the two sides are
moving closer together they're not
hugely optimistic though the White House
they're not talking about any sort of
imminent breakthrough and if there is to
be one there certainly aren't any signs
of that coming at the moment Nikki Nick
big thank you very much latest there
from Jerusalem",20240710
-LzTW9al-Ko,Hezbollah says Israeli strike killed senior commander in Lebanon | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hezbollah says Israeli strike killed senior commander in Lebanon  BBC News.jpg,"now let's turn to the Middle East where
Hamas says it sent new ideas to qari and
Egyptian mediators aimed at ending
nearly nine months of war in Gaza with
Israel Israel confirmed its evaluating
what it described as Hamas comments on a
ceasefire and hostage deal meanwhile the
Israeli military says it's killed a
commander of Hezbollah in Lebanon in an
air strike these images were sent to us
by the news agency AFP which says that
they were posted online at that they
show the after Marth of the strike
Muhammad niman NASA is one of the most
senior Hezbollah figures to have been
killed in nearly 9 months of crossborder
clashes meanwhile Israel has also
approved plans for what is being
described as the biggest potential
expansion of settlements in the occupied
West Bank in more than three decades
Israeli officials have not publicly
commented on the latest seizure of 12.7
square kmers of land which comes amid
heightened tensions with Palestinians
because of the Gaza War well earlier our
Middle East correspondent yoland Nell
told us what more more about the deal
well this has come after weeks of very
little public diplomacy um Hamas saying
that it gave its response to Kat and
Egyptian mediators it's saying there's
um the Turkish uh involvement now in
this as well um and it says it's
responded in a positive spirit to the
deal that's on the table that's
basically the three-phase plan that was
outlined by President Biden back on the
31st of May that the US has been uh
pushing for very quickly we had a a
response from the Israeli Prime
Minister's office acknowledging that it
had got those Hamas comments um and
along with the mosad intelligence
service which is really leading the
negotiations um those were being looked
at they were being evaluated and in the
Israeli media this morning um there are
some guardedly optimistic comments with
um well-informed sources being quoted as
saying that there is something here to
work with so potentially some movement
but surely this this concept of
expanding the settlements in the West
Bank that'll take it a step back won't
it I mean certainly that will be seen as
being a provocative uh move by Hamas um
but when you look at what's been
happening um on the ground in Gaza I
mean really the key demands of Hamas the
main sticking points that we've seen
when it comes to trying to get a new
ceasefire deal that will also see the
release of the remaining 120 hostages uh
believed to be held in Gaza some of
those uh now said to be dead um what's
really the main sticking point Hamas is
demanding that it wants a full end to
the war as part of any deal it wants a
full withdrawal of Israeli troops from
the Gaza Strip um and then Israel has
been saying that as much as it's ready
to come up with a truce to release its
hostages it wants to be able to continue
uh fighting on in Gaza to continue the
war until it has destroyed hamas's
governing capabilities and its military
capabilities there so that the ceasefire
and hostage release deal um really is
very much about what's happening in the
Gaza Strip but what's happening in the
West Bank there have been these repeated
warnings that that could open up a new
uh front uh in the war if the situation
uh in the West Bank deteriorates further
and also of course as you were
referencing before um this real concern
Le internationally now that there could
be a much more uh dangerous war that
develops between Israel and the powerful
Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in
Lebanon yes and just on that just tell
us more about what we know about the the
death of this leader Muhammad niman NASA
your
land well he's the latest um quite
senior figure to be killed um and it has
been over the last few weeks that we
have seen a real intensification in the
barrages of rocket the numbers of attack
drones are being sent across the border
uh by Hezbollah and Israel responding
with retaliatory strikes including going
after um some you know Hezbollah
Fighters but also some more senior
figures within the group there have been
these attempts we've heard about the the
US um Envoy who's come to the region
trying to add diplomatic efforts in the
past weeks talking now to the French
also about trying to calm things down
diplomatically what Israel is really
demanding is that Hezbollah should be
pushed back uh from uh the Border uh its
border with Lebanon that there should
ultimately be some kind of deal to
decide uh on the actual final border
between the two countries as well and
what Israel Le wants is for tens of
thousands of its citizens to be allowed
to go back to their homes they've really
been uh displaced by this fighting that
started on the 7th of October um as the
war in Gaza began with Hezbollah saying
specifically that it was trying to draw
away uh is isi military resources uh
from the war in Gaza that that was its
way of supporting its Ally there Hamas

continued to flee from Han Yunis the
second biggest city after an Israeli
evacuation order the UN says that a
quarter of a million people have been
warned to move from the east of the city
they've been told to seek refuge in a
coastal area where there are few basic
Services Reports say that an Israeli air
strike killed 12 Palestinians who just
arrived there despite it being
designated as a safe Zone by Israel well
earlier I spoke to our Middle East Corr
respondent yolan Nell who gave us this
update so this is the latest evacuation
order from the Israeli military it was
issued on Monday evening and very
quickly we saw thousands of people uh
fleeing uh towards this Coastal area um
over in in the west of the Gaza Strip um
those scenes have been continuing
panicky chaotic people who've been
displaced already multiple times and the
reason just so many people are affected
in this part of Kanan yunes is because
the city although it had been largely
destroyed by an Israeli military
offensive that ended uh back in April
you'll remember that it was seen as
being a stronghold of Hamas well people
had begun to return to their homes there
even if they were camping out in the
rubble and then when Israel began its
ground assault in Rafa uh the
Southernmost city of Gaza back in may we
saw the UN said about a million people
fleeing from there and many of them
ended up uh in KH yunes uh now they're
on the move move again people saying
it's just really not clear where they
should go to uh for safety because as
you were saying um as much as there has
been some bombardment uh in the east of
of KH unun with the Israeli military
saying that one of the sites it hit was
a rocket launch site where Islamic
jihadist said to have launched Rockets
from uh on Monday uh but even in this
area that's been designated as a
humanitarian Zone we're getting a report
of an Israeli air strike that took place
yesterday um killing according to to the
reports we've seen from medic and local
people um a family who' just gone there
from unun have asked the Israeli
military for comments on that strike on
a building um where the family was
staying with other relatives of theirs
and they haven't yet been able to get
back to me with a comment so
difficulties when it comes to whether
this is a a a genuinely designated safe
Zone also the conditions on the ground
are we getting Aid through is the
situation improving somewhat at all when
it comes to getting aid distributors to
people or is it still a really difficult
situation
there I mean of course what's happening
now with this latest Mass displacement
of people is just going to complicate
things further but what we've seen
according to humanitarian agencies is
that the situation in the South and in
the center of the Gaza Strip has just
become um much much more difficult since
Israel launched its operation in Rafa
because uh that closed the the Rafa
Crossing with Egypt that was a main
crossing point for Aid coming to this
the most crowded part um of the Gaza
Strip you have most of the population uh
displaced and crammed down into this uh
half of the territory you land now there

Israeli military ordered evacuations of
part of the city in the South again a
ground operation has already taken place
there and people Express their anger
over being displaced once more they
announced that we should evacuate out of
the Eastern parts of kulas where should
we go tell us where to go when we were
displaced from Rafa we had to spend 2
weeks out in the
open we peace not war enough is enough
we are slowly dying this is unfair what
is our fault we are innocent
civilians it comes as Kat the arm of the
Israeli Army responsible for logistical
coordination issued a clarification
after the European hospital near hanun
was evacuated too they said the call to
move towards the al- mawasi humanitarian
Zone does not apply to the patients in
the European hospital or the medical
staff working there however on the found
evacuations had already taken place Dr
Muhammed Tahir is a British surgeon
who's been operating at the European
hospital near Han Yunis he works with
fuder scientific a group of medical
professionals he says he was ordered to
leave I'd been at Al nassa medical
complex where I was lecturing a medical
students I returned to the European
hospital to start my operating and then
uh we got the the news that the hospital
was being evacuated of course I found
that to be uh very very strange because
I always assumed the European Hospital
would be one of the safe havens in Gaza
um and yet the news was confirmed to us
that it was actually in the red zone and
had been um uh deemed unsafe our team uh
Mission uh and our leaders uh asked us
to leave uh and we've been hosted by a
very uh generous NGO by the name of
cadis right now but um prior to leaving
of course we witnessed all the uh
injured um of varying severities uh
forced to stay in the hospital and all
the persons and families that camped in
the hospital were
evacuating the state of uh panic and the
extent of the fear was extremely
palpable uh some people have nowhere to
go some people have nowhere safe to
be I asked our Middle East correspondent
Sebastian Usher what we know about the
current situation in the
hospital well I mean it's been a
slightly confused situation as you were
saying um the Israeli Army says that it
didn't issue a specific evacuation order
for the hospital but I think uh there
the medical staff and patients people
there seeing what has happened elsewhere
during the 9 months of Israeli offensive
against Hamas and Gaza what's happened
in other hospitals felt that uh the
safest thing was to evacuate and the
Health Ministry in Gaza run by Hamas did
Issue it says an evacuation order for
people to leave some of the patients
have been taken to NASA Hospital others
have found shelter elsewhere as you know
we are not reporting directly on the
ground we're receiving information from
uh our freelance journalists in Gaza we
we we don't know exactly the situation
of hospital at the moment how many
people are still left there but it
hasn't come under any attack as far as
we know uh the Israeli Army issued a
statement an hour or two ago saying that
it did carry out overnight strikes on
some of these areas towns and villages
to the east of Han yunas where they
issued the evacuation order on Monday
evening uh first of all in an audio
message and then online um and people
did start to leave then and then when
these strikes began to happen more more
more people started uh to flee their
homes now remember hunas is a second
City in Gaza it's a place that we saw
images of after the Israeli troops
pulled out a month or two ago when
people began to return home of total
devastation people described trying to
find their homes that they could no
longer recognize the streets where they
were but despite all that many people
did return as they were fleeing the
latest subsequent offensive against
Hamas by Israel down in Rafa where many
people have been fled to so what we've
been hearing and as what we were hearing
there in the interview you had with
someone from the area is that people are
once again on the move some people
who've been displaced already maybe five
or six six times Sebastian Asha there in
over the last few minutes we've heard
from the United Nations that they say
250,000 people in southern Gaza have
been affected by Israel's new evacuation
order so 250,000 people affected by that

news in the last at Israel's Supreme
Court has ruled that there is no legal
basis for excluding Ultra Orthodox men
from the military draft and that those
who are eligible for service must be
drafted well let's go live to our Middle
East correspondent yolan Nell who is in
Jerusalem yolan just explain what the uh
court has ruled this
morning well this is a decision by the
Israeli Supreme Court basically saying
that after a legal Arrangement uh
expired that allowed Ultra Orthodox
Jewish men to avoid conscription in the
military um that really there is no
reason for them now not to be uh
conscripted and this could affect tens
of thousands of men and also um will
affect the the funding the Public
Funding that goes uh to the Jewish
seminaries where they've been studying
uh if uh they continue um to have
students who are avoid military
conscription so this really has wide
ramifications in Israeli Society where
12% of the population now a growing
percentage of the population are Ultra
Orthodox Jews and is something that will
have real political implications too
with ultra Orthodox Jewish parties uh
playing a key role in the governing
Coalition for them this is really uh the
number one issue to avoid uh Ultra
Orthodox Jewish men from serving in the
military to allow them to dedicate their
time uh to religious study instead um
and it is something it's not totally
clear at the moment uh what the
ramifications of all that will be but
certainly it could lead to large numbers
of men uh being called up um and it
comes at a time such a important ruling
which is an issue that's been going on
for for decades really causing divisions
um in Israeli Society um but it's really
come to a head at the time of the war in
Gaza where we've got Israeli military
leaders saying that there is this huge
strain on the military and they have a
shortage of Manpower a shortage of
combat soldiers yes you mention the
ramifications particularly for Benjamin
Netanyahu in the government at the
moment while the war in Gaza is
continuing indeed and there had been
sort of attempts in the past by the
Supreme Court to put this issue back to
Parliament to allow Parliament uh to
rule on exactly uh what should happen
for Ultra or Orthodox men uh whether
they should continue to be allowed to be
exempt U from the military uh but there
has been a failure for that to happen
even with this uh current government you
can see uh within the Coalition that
there are real splits on exactly um what
should be allowed in terms of exemptions
um and that has led really at a
committee stage uh to Parliament just
kind of holding off uh on new
legislation even at a time when as I say
these legal arrangements had expired
there was now no framework the Supreme
Court said uh to allow Ultra Orthodox
men to continue to be Exempted um now in
Israel I mean just as a bit more context
the Army is really seen as being the
People's Army a place where people from
all walks of life go to share a joint
experience um in their late teenage
years um and that is really what is seen
as being the strength uh of the Israeli
Army and the beginning o of the state of
Israel the late 40s it was just a tiny
percentage of ultra Orthodox Jews um and
so allowing them to have exemption after
the population was really um just so
badly affected by the Holocaust was not
seen as being a big issue but as the
ultra Orthodox Jewish population has
grown and grown demographics have
changed in Israel this idea of sharing
the security burden more equally has
become a really hot political topic

you very much indeed",20240625

called the intense phase of fighting
Hamas in Gaza is nearly over allowing
troops to be freed up to be deployed to
Israel's northern border with Lebanon
where fightings escalated with the
Hezbollah armed group in his first
Israeli media interview since the start
of the war in October Benjamin Netanyahu
said he expected the ground operation in
the southern Gaza City of Rafa to be
completed soon but he said the war
wouldn't finish until the islamist group
no longer control RS the Gaza Strip
here's some of what he had to
say if there is an agreement it will be
an agreement according to our terms and
our terms are not to end the war to
leave Gaza and leave Hamas as it is I
refuse to leave Hamas as it is we need
to
eliminated well this comes as Israel's
defense minister yav Galant is in
Washington where he's holding talks with
us officials about the conflict and
about President Biden's ceasefire deal
let's go to our Middle East analyst now
Bastian aser who joins us from Jerusalem
Sebastian good evening to you there what
does yoav Galant want to get out of his
trip to the
US well what he wants to get out of I
assume is support as much as possible
from Washington for wherever Israel
takes this next both in terms of what's
happening in Gaza but perhaps even more
importantly perhaps because this looks
like this is the next stage perhaps of
what could be happening in the region
what uh is Israel might do in terms of
hasbullah on its northern border there
has
been quite a lot of tension between the
Biden Administration it's fair to State
and specifically the Israeli Prime
Minister Mr Netanyahu in recent weeks
and I think that you Gallant will be
trying to smooth that over but he will
also be trying to put the Israeli case
forward on these issues now from a
perspective of Washington I think there
will be very much an effort by the
senior officials that he's going to be
meeting to try and uh give the sense
that to take what is happening on the
northern border with Hezbollah into an
allout conflict is a danger a risk that
all sides have been warning about for
months and months and that it's
something that Israel could actually
have very negative consequences from
Lebanon undoubtedly will the rest of the
region and potentially would bring the
US actively into the Battle Zone so I
think these will be very um intense deep
talks whether the two sides will
actually come to any agreement on where
things go next I think is quite a big
question because there hasn't been uh
recently but that is very much to do
with M Mr Netanyahu and his stance and I
think the Biden Administration has
undeniably become very frustrated that
all the suggestions all the warnings
that it has been making to Mr Netanyahu
don't seem to have been heeded Sebastian
as you were talking there we saw
pictures of yav Galant arriving in DC I
think we have a live shot now as
protesters have gathered outside the
venue in Washington where Mr Galant and
Mr blinken are meeting Sebastian while
we still have you let's talk more about
this warning if you like from Mr
Netanyahu that the conflict in Israel's
North with Lebanon could escalate how
much of a concern is this not just in
the immediate vicinity but in the wider
region massively I mean Anthony blinken
the man who's about to meet you AB
Gallant has made I think at least eight
trips to the Middle East since October
the 7th and a big part of those trips
have been to go to all the regional
capitals the Arab capitals as well as to
Israel um to try to get as much of a
consensus as possible and as much of a
kind of driving force in the region as
possible to avoid this ES ating beyond
what is already of course a very very
difficult dangerous um and and negative
situation uh in Gaza these are the worst
possible fears that would be realized if
there was a real upscaling of the
skirmishes that have been undeniably
intensifying across the border between
hasbullah and Israeli forces
particularly in the past 2 or 3 weeks
this would take both Israel and Lebanon
and the Reg region into a whole new
dimension uh Lebanon as there have been
warnings from Israel from a military
from its uh from its government could
face the same kind of Destruction as
Gaza has faced that has been said
specifically by leaders in Israel but
also Israel could suffer much worse I
mean obviously October 7th the massacre
was a terrible terrible moment for
Israel but what hasbullah is capable of
goes far beyond what Hamas has been
capable of with its Rockets Hezbollah is
believed to have potentially up to
200,000 rockets in its Arsenal some of
those are Precision guided so they could
particularly Target sensitive areas in
Israel but I think more
significantly there is a potential at
the moment I think this is a huge if
that this would ever happen there is a
potential for hasb to launch barrages of
up to 3,000 to 4,000 Rockets into Israel
across Israel
for weeks at a time if this moved into a
dimension of allout conflict that would
have huge consequences for the people of
Israel and I think there's a great sense
of apprehension not just in Lebanon over
what might happen but amongst the
Israeli people okay Sebastian N Middle

you well Israel says it's fighter jets
have struck a number of Hezbollah
Targets in southern Lebanon overnight

Hezbollah missile attack and as we
mentioned Israel's prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu says troops in Gaza
may be redeployed to the border with

they are prepared for a wider conflict
as this goes on Lebanese authorities
have denied claims by the British
newspaper The Daily Telegraph that
Hezbollah has been storing Iranian
weapons in the only civilian airport in
the country Beirut International Airport
in response they organized a tour for
journalists and diplomats to the airport
to see for themselves BBC arabic's
Beirut correspondent Karen torb was
among
them this is part of a tour of bayout
International Airport it was organized
by authorities to refute reports about
hisbah storing Iranian weapons
here the claim was made by The Daily
Telegraph citing anonymous
whistleblowers who allegedly said that
the Shia islamist group is keeping arms
and missiles at the
airport we think it's just a
psychological and media War you must
remember the talk about weapons of mass
destruction in irq it might be different
but it's part of the psychological
warfare the article is ridiculous and
unprofessional Beirut Airport is the
only civilian airport in the country in
200 during the war between Hezbollah and
Israel it was hit flights in and out of
the country were halted there are fears
today that this could happen
again what could be different this time
is that hasbalah has also threatened to
retaliate in kind in case Israel strikes
Lebanese strategic positions and it has
released a video it said was filmed by

about the Israeli government's plan now
for Gaza and going
forward well I think the message that Mr
Netanyahu is giving there to a domestic
audience was one that we've already been
hearing from the Israeli government the
Israeli military over the past few weeks
but Rafa they very much made out that
this was the last major military
operation that they were carrying out uh
in Gaza that that that was where they
believe that the remaining Hamas
battalions were where hostages were
potentially and also where perhaps for
leadership of Hamas in Gaza was based
that's continuing uh we've had reports
that Israeli tanks will be moving into
the North and the west of Rafa uh we've
heard from uh the Hamas armed wing and
Islamic Jihad that they have been
fighting back with mortar bombs and uh
with rocket propelled uh um grenades and
there's also fighting that's continuing
in part of a center of Gaza too where
Israel doesn't have full control of a
particular area and in Gaza City we saw
over the weekend but there were strikes
uh on several locations so
this this this sense that Mr Netanyahu
is giving that the intense fighting is
over in Gaza that may well be true but
as he said and as we've heard from all
Israeli officials the actual war in Gaza
is not coming to an end there's no sense
but the
that Mr Netanyahu set himself as
anywhere over key thing that he said was
the redeployment of some of those troops
to the northern border where the battle
with Hezbollah which has stayed mostly
within red lines of both sides has again
been escalating and overnight there were
more Israeli strikes inside Lebanon on
what they said were hisbah targets you
mentioned the Israeli defense minister
yab Galant he's now in the US one of the
key things he's going to be talking
about where concern in the US and the
rest of world has been Rising is over
what might happen between the Israeli
forces and hasbullah and how that would
involve the rest of Lebanon and
potentially bring the region as the
concern has has been The Wider region
more directly into the conflict I think
that concern is probably at its highest
pitch at the moment and Sebastian is
there any sense of any return to talks
when it comes to a hostage ceasefire
deal well Mr Nar again he talked about
that but I mean what he would was saying
was that he isn't accepting a ceasefire
as things stand which is a permanent
ceasefire as a starting point now that
isn't what is in the current ceasefire
proposal that's a three-phase deal where
confidence would be built up in the
first phase where there'd be a temporary
ceasefire talks would continue and then
hopefully in a second phase there would
be a permanent ceasefire Hamas though
has continue to insist that it wants a
permanent ceasefire to be nailed in from
the start and there was there has been a
h response to what Mr Netanyahu said
last night uh to Israeli TV and saying
that as far as they're concerned that
shows that Mr Netanyahu is not
interested in a ceasefire deal at the
moment okay Sebastian",20240624

hour that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved the six
member War cabinet it was a widely
expected move that comes after the
departure from government of the centus
former General Benny Gant Netanyahu had
faced demands from the Nationalist
religious Partners in his coalition to
be included in the war cabinet a move
which would have intensified strains
with International Partners including
the United States well IDF spokes person
Daniel hagari has been speaking about
the decision in the past few minutes if
cabinet members are being changed and
the the method is be shed we we have the
the ashlon and we know the chain of
command we're working according to the
chain of command this is a democracy we
will keep on doing so and if the members
of the cabinet are being changed this is
the decision of this democracy of this
cabinet of this prime minister and we
will keep acting according to the
cabinet according ing to the law
according to the international law this
is what the IDF does did and will do in
the future Daniel hagari there well
Israel's military is expected to repeat
an 11-hour daytime tactical pause today
extending along 12 kmers of Road into
Gaza from a key Southern border crossing
the announcement of the plan to allow in
humanitarian supplies was criticized on
Sunday by the Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and several far-right
government minister isers operations are
being halted between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00
p.m. every day along the road that leads
from the Kem Shalom Crossing to the main
Salah Alin Highway which extends north
through the territory Aid agencies say
they still remain concerned about Safety
and Security our Middle East
correspondent yolan Nell has more from
Jerusalem although there's been a
political storm with the Israeli
military announcing this new Arrangement
um they're calling a tactical pause to
allow more Aid deliveries into Gaza um
that Arrangement is still in place we
believe it's in effect right now we've
had far-right Israeli ministers who have
descried this decision you've had the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu really criticizing the
military saying we have a country with
an army not an army with a country but
there are Israeli commentators at the
same time who are saying that this step
would have had political approval what
it's designed to do is to allow lorries
to reach the Kem Shalom Crossing from
the Gaza side pick up Aid and then take
it at least as far as a main north to
south road so it can be distributed uh
inside Gaza with more safety and really
that is is necessary since the uh
Israeli incursion of Rafa in the very
south of the Gaza Strip last month a lot
of Aid has got stuck at this main entry
point now with a full ceasefire in Gaza
still looking a long way off the Israeli
military is also now warning about a
wider War being possible with the
Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that
follows a recent intensification and
violence across the Israel Lebanon
border and we're expecting a key us
Diplomat Amos Hawkin to come here today
to try to reduce tensions along the
Israel libanon
border zoland now there uh let's just
take you briefly to osow where Philip
lazarini um from the United Nations
relief and works agency is addressing um
a press conference there um about Aid we
understand and that Aid getting through
uh in Gaza um we will bring you the uh
important lines from that um press
conference as we get it we have let's
just have a listen now of lawmaker
trying to label the organization as
being a terrorist or to try to get rid
of the organization from the occupied
Palestinian territories and we have also
regular L demonstration which turn
violent organized sometimes by elected
member of the municipality of
Jerusalem and will turn into Aron attack
in Jerusalem as you say espan these are
not just attack against un these are
attacks against the UN and this is a
reason why I have called member of the
security Council and the member state to
express outrage and to put in place the
necessary measure to prevent that this
become a new Norm because if we tolerate
this in the occupied Palestinian
territory this will be the new Norm
anywhere else in the world the last
point we were discussing is about the
day after or the day after the ceasefire
I prefer to say after the ceasefire once
there is a lower intensity of military
operation and we discuss indeed the top
priority of trying to bring back the
600,000 girls and boys on the age of
primary and second School living in the
rubel being deeply traumatized back into
a learning environment and the more we
will wait to do this Philip lazarini
there from unra um we are hearing him
speak in Oslo there at a press
conference um let's move on now to speak
to tal Schneider uh political and
diplomatic correspondent at the Times of
Israel uh thanks very much for your time
here on BBC News let's go back to that
story that we've had break
uh within the last half an hour that um
Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved uh the
six member War cabinet uh is that a
surprise to you that that's happened no
it's actually a five members War cabinet
it was set up uh immediately after the
beginning of the war in order to
accommodate Benny guns the the the
partner that you know stepped in to help
during the War uh it was you know a
special arrangement for this what they
called emergency government uh it became
less effective with time and that was
one of the reason benig Gans stepped out
uh Benny Gans is not the opposition
leader but he's leading in all polls to
be prime minister if uh there will be
elections so once he was out he is a
former Chief IDF also once he was out um
one of netanyahu's Partners the ex very
extreme right-wing itamar bangir said I
want to be part of this war cabinet and
n doesn't want him in those you know
very close uh close meetings uh and for
that reason I think he he broke up the
war cabinet in order not to include
benir in there but we have to say Israel
has um you know a cabinet a security
cabinet so this was like an extra you
know very near a war cabinet and now
authorities or or decision making will
go back to the just regular uh security
cabinet okay so does that mean will have
implications for um strategy in the war
going
ahead it well with the stepping out of
Benny gun I think itar benir and another
extreme partner batala smri both of them
have more leverage on the Prime Minister
as it is in the government or in the
cabinet so they have they can use their
you know they can threaten to to
dissolve you know the government at any
any minute they could have done this
also before but they had less power they
were diluted with benig Gans inside now
they have more um power over the Prime
Minister and we we have learned through
those you know very difficult months
that those two uh are very uh
influential on Net's decision making so
this is you know the the bad you know
the disappointing side of this very
extreme
government what will this mean in terms
of diplomatic relations do you think
will particularly the US will will will
there be any implications um with
disbanding the the war cabinet um for
relations with Israel going forward so
for example those two extreme ministers
are you know they are four uh more uh
settlements there are for you know they
oppose any type of of agreement with the
terror organization the Hamas uh when
you have to approve uh an agreement with
a terror organization and release uh
convict murderers that are sitting in
Israeli jails when you have to do that
you need to have a vote in the
government those two are you know they
they say it out loud they just they will
not just vote against it they will also
dissolve the government uh having said
that I think n still have a majority in
his own government to move forward a
deal such as that you know the
expectation of the Israel public is for
a deal there is you know huge majority
in the polls for a hostages release deal
that will also include releasing uh
convicted murderers terrorists I mean um
so and maybe end of War so there is huge
majority in Israel public for that and I
think Netanyahu still have the majority
in his own government to do that he just
knows from those two extreme types that
his government this is the end the
political end of his extreme government
if if they will you know they will
participate in the vote of course T

military has announced what it's calling
a daily tactical pause in part of
Southern Gaza but not the city of Rafa
it says the halting operations will be
during daylight hours to facilitate the
delivery of aid aid organizations have
repeatedly warned of a humanitarian
crisis in Gaza Israel meanwhile has
released the names of the eight soldiers
killed by an amass rocket in Rafa on
Saturday the deadliest incident for its
troops in months Israel's prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation
on Saturday following the deaths of the
soldiers here's what he
said with deep sorrow in heavy mourning
I bow my head together with all the
citizens of Israel and mourn the fall of
our heroic Warriors Deputy Company
commander in the Engineering Battalion
captain wasm mmud and other heroic
soldiers whose names have not yet been
released don't let anyone distract you
from the simple and clear fact despite
the heavy and staggering cost we must
stick to the goals of the wall
destroying the military and governmental
capabilities of Hamas returning all our
hostages making sure that Gaza will no
longer pose a threat to Israel and
returning our residents safely to their
homes both in the north and in the South
Benjamin naha let's go live to Jerusalem
and our News correspondent John donison
John I wondered if we could start with
what we know about this tactical pause
that the Israeli military's announced in
the last few
hours well to be honest it's not really
clear because initially we had a
statement from one branch of the IDF
saying that indeed there was going to be
a tactical military pause each day
lasting from 8:00 in the morning till
7:00 at night around the km Shalom
Crossing from Israel into Gaza and then
stretching over to the main Coast Road
which runs north to south in Gaza we've
since then though had another statement
from the IDF saying that it wanted to
bring Clarity that there is no cessation
in hostilities in Rafa or in southern
Gaza and that the operation to get Aid
into Gaza is continuing as normal that
followed a statement from Israel's
Hardline national security minister
itman benav who said that whoever made
the decision to introduce a tactical
pause was both evil and a fool how much
Aid is getting into Gaza at the
moment well according to Aid agencies
and the United Nations not enough there
is no Aid Crossing in from uh Rafa uh
from the Egyptian side of the Border
we've got thousands of trucks backed up
there waiting to bring Aid in some is
passing in uh every day through Kum
Shalom but as I say not enough according
to Aid agencies the uh us built Pier off
the coast of Gaza has been dismantled
this week because of uh rough Seas uh so
there just isn't enough Aid getting in
the UN is saying that more than a
million people in Gaza are facing
starvation within a matter of weeks
Israel disputes that they say there is
no humanitarian crisis in Gaza meanwhile
the fighting continues and we have the
deaths of those eight Israeli soldiers
on
Saturday yep eight Israeli soldiers
who've now been named they were aged
between 19 and 23 so uh pretty young
this was the heaviest loss of life for
the Israelis since Jan January uh what
apparently happened is they had been
carrying out an operation against
Palestinian militants in the early hours
of Saturday morning as they were
retreating from Rafa one of their
armored vehicles was hit with some sort
of missile there was a large large
explosion and all died uh immediately uh
Hamas is saying it targeted that ve
vehicle with some sort of anti-tank
missile a week ago or so we were talking
about the possibility of a ceasefire and
we've had uh more comments from uh the
Hamas leader based in Qatar
today yes this is coming from Ishmael
hania the leader of hamas's political
Wing who's in uh Doha and he has said
that the the counter proposals I guess
that Hamas put forward to that American
Plan uh American Israeli plan were
consistent what with what the United
States has been demanding that is is
contradicted by really what the state
department is saying they say were some
of the Amendments that hassad proposes
were reasonable others were just not
consistent with the deal and I don't
think those talks are really going
anywhere at the moment Anthony blinkin
the US Secretary of State is now uh left
the region his eighth visit to the
region and there is a feeling I think on
the ground that neither Hamas
particularly their leaders in Gaza or
the Israeli government led by prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu I don't
really think either of them are pushing
for a deal at the moment yeah
interestingly the Pentagon saying that
the Israeli defense minister will soon
visit Washington for talks with his us
counterpart because uh Washington still
would like a ceasefire if they could get
one wouldn't they
they do want one I mean frankly the
whole world wants one the United Nations
has pushed for it with that security
resolution backing a ceasefire plan uh
last week there's no doubt that the
Egyptians and the qataris who are
mediating uh want it but it all counts
for nothing really if the two main
figures who are calling the shots and
that is yayya sinoa the Hamas leader in
Gaza and prime minister bet Benjamin
Netanyahu uh don't want one now here in
isra Israel there are elements of his
government on the far right who have
said they will quit the government
forcing fresh elections and bringing
prime minister netanyahu's government
down if he does a deal so it's hard to
see that happening the Americans insist
that this is an Israeli plan that they
have signed up to it but Benjamin
Netanyahu has certainly not said that

significant proportion of gaza's
population is facing catastrophic hunger
and famine likee conditions after eight
months of war thousands of children have
been diagnosed with acute malnutrition
with me is BBC Arabic s shahata say
thank you very much for coming in so
tell us a little bit more about the aid
situation at the moment in in Gaza
there's problem of Aid delivery uh the
G7 uh leaders said yesterday they should
be uh more Aid going to Gaza without any
obstacle
uh the world food program uh said uh
that there is it War houses were hit
twice in uh in June in addition to that
there is uh obstacles for Aid delivery
because of increased fighting in
different areas especially in north and
Central and South everywhere in Gaza so
there is problem in Aid delivery uh to
add to that there is the US state
department impose a sanction on a a
violent extremist group is called tavf 9
which uh looted some Aid uh trucks and
blockade made blockade on a delivery to
uh to Gaza because he said he supporting
the uh hostage families and this what
they need but I think there is a
question mark about that uh in addition
to that there is some uh interviews with
the world food program with some people
in Gaza saying they have nothing uh to
eat in addition to the health situation
the World Health Organization says there
is no medical supplies even there's some
hospitals opened again partially like
Indonesian hospitals in the north of
Gaza but still there is no medical
supplies so is not functioning like uh
full capacity uh in addition to that
there is uh even the uh the interal
court of justice called on Israel to
allow aid for the need people in Gaza so
all of that you know like showing that
there is problem uh in delivering Aid to
people in Gaza people dying and there is
one report a child died yesterday
because of like hunger and there is tens
of children are facing that so the
hunger looming there is problems people
dying people suffering so there is
pressure and Oxfam in this context said
it's a time to action not talks because
talks time is is is over so now is
action time and it seems as though any
progress towards a ceasefire deal which
would also involve trying to get more
Aid in seems to stalled tell tell us a
bit about the situation with the
hostages because there's some some
confusion about how many hostages are
are actually still alive tell us what
what we think the latest is on that yeah
the leaders of Hamas one of them is AMA
hamdan talk to CNN and said like there
two uh hostages were killed RAF recently
because of Israeli raid according to him
and they said no military leaders in
Hamas know how many people of the
hostages died and how how many of them
like still alive so it's confusion
because of the fighting and where the
talks sto so there's a problem because
there is even like there is isra isi
managed to release four hostages in
operation but the result of it was
killing more than 200 people according
to the Hamas Health uh Ministry in Gaza
so the hostage situation is is dire and
is a problematic and the hostage family
calling for Mr Netanyahu to have a deal
but all indicators there is no deal in
the foreseeable future because of the
fighting going on and Israel refusing to
end the war and to uh concede to Hamas
conditions of full withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Gaza in addition to that end
of all end of the war and Israel not
willing to do that as a time as this
time and at the moment we don't we
haven't heard the response really
properly from from Hamas either have we
on on the hisbah um situation the border
with Lebanon and Israel the fighting's
been going on through throughout this
period since since October 7th hasn't it
there's been exchanges of fire in that
situation what's the situation there now

has been the recent days has seen

Hamas has issued a statement stressing
what it called its positivity in
negotiations on a new ceasefire and
hostage release deal in Gaza Hamas also
rejected a claim by the US Secretary of
State that they presented unworkable
changes to the deal Anon blinkin said
that American and other mediators will
work over the coming days to see if they
can reach an agreement for a ceasefire
in
Gaza well we are Middle East
correspondent yoland n is in Jerusalem
and joins us now on the line and um
yoland why do you think Hamas is issuing
this statement when the US Secretary of
State has already criticized their
response to the ceasefire
deal I mean really Hamas is coming out
here uh defending its own position we
heard um from the US top Diplomat
Anthony blinkin when he was in Doha
yesterday having um looked through this
Hass reply to the latest three-phase
plan that was outlined by President
Biden back on the 31st of May that Hamas
was uh demanding changes some of which
were seen as being relatively minor um a
later um a White House official said
they were not on anticipated those
changes but there were also changes
there which Mr blinkin described as
being unworkable and going Beyond uh
previous positions laid out by Hamas so
in this short statement Hamas says that
it had uh signed up to a deal back on
the the 6th of May but then afterwards
pointed out that Israel began uh in
Earnest its military offensive in Rafa
this ground and Air Assault um and then
it said also uh that um while Mr blinken
was speaking about Israeli approval of
the latest plan it wasn't hearing that
same approval coming uh from Israeli
officials so it's asking the US to put
more pressure on Israel uh to agree to
this new ceasefire plan and nevertheless
uh yoland at the end of his visit uh
blinkin saying he was optimistic that a
ceasefire deal could be reached how is
his latest tour of the region being
viewed
there I mean certainly this was a a Fast
Trip Around the region by Mr blink and a
very timely one uh given that the Hamas
response came through at this point it
was just after um there was a shift in
his Politics as well after the Centrist
Minister Benny Gan seen as someone the
Americans could talk to uh left the
emergency wartime government of the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu making him more reliant on
hardliners so Mr blinken knew that he
had his work cut out for him as he went
around the region trying uh to push um
Hamas in particular but also for Israel
to kind of sign up uh to this deal we
got the message from mediators that they
were going to continue their
negotiations to try to bridge the gap uh
between the two sides and some reports
um uh certainly in the Israeli media
today about what some of the changes are
um that Hamas um is demanding which give
us an idea of what negotiations May
Center on uh they're saying that Hamas
is wanting a complete say on uh exactly
which Palestinian prisoners would be
released from Israeli jails in exchange
for those Israeli hostages being
released uh by Hamas from Gaza um that
Israel should withdraw according to
Hamas uh in the first uh few days um of
the uh of the plan um they should
withdraw from the main road which is
currently dividing um the North and the
South of Gaza that would presumably
allow uh displace people from the South
to go back to their homes uh in the
north um other specifications around
that as well and they're also asking
Hamas apparently for uh International
guarantees that there would be a move
from the the first phase um of this
three-phase plan which is supposed to be
for a temporary truce with hostages
being released to the second phase which
is supposed to work towards a permanent
uh end to fighting and and see the
remaining hostages uh coming back and we
know from you know comments by different
Hamas officials they've had a lot of
concerns around that uh meanwhile we've
had Israeli officials in recent days who
have come out insisting that Israel uh
remains determined to meet its War
objective of defeating Hamas in Gaza

ZVSPXWE56h0,Hamas seeks 'complete halt' to war in Gaza proposal response | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hamas seeks 'complete halt' to war in Gaza proposal response  BBC News.jpg,"the US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin is heading to Qatar for the last
for the next leg of his latest Middle
East Tour it comes hours after Hamas
said it had given its former response to
a Gaza ceasefire proposal announced by
President Biden nearly a four T night
ago Qatari officials along with those
from Egypt acting as mediators confirmed
the response had been received with a
focus now on any Israeli response the
proposed ceasefire plan which was
endorsed by the UN Security Council on
Monday Night Calls for a six week
ceasefire that would eventually become
permanent and the release of all
hostages still held by Hamas in this
response Hamas says the ceasefire must
be permanent and Israeli forces must
withdraw completely from the Gaza Strip
well for more we can now speak to our
Middle East correspondent Yandell who
joins us from Jerusalem and your land
just to start off has there been much
reaction from the Israeli government to
that statement by
Hamas well there wasn't a formal
response that came out of the Israeli
Prime Minister's office we did get
confirmation that the Israeli side had
received a copy of the Hamas reply um
but there was an unnamed uh Israeli
official quoted widely uh in the media
who put out a statement and said really
that um this had changed all the main
and most meaningful parameters in the
three-phase deal that President Biden
had outlined on the 31st of May and said
that this amounted to a rejection of The
Proposal that's on the table I mean I
think what we have to wait for though is
still from the mediators themselves the
cateres and Egyptians say that they are
ready to continue uh negotiations and
the White House which is also such an
important player here has said that it
is studying uh the Hamas reply yand what
could this mean for any plans for a ceas
fire especially at a time when the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is
visiting the region yet
again indeed and Anthony blinkin has
really been pushing for um Hamas to
accept this deal also been putting
pressure on the Israeli side it seems as
well because although this is presented
as an Israeli initiative um the Israeli
Prime Minister has come out you know not
sounding like he's giving wholehearted
approval of this plan uh by any means
and he is in a very difficult position
where he's trying to keep his Hardline
coalition government together and there
are key ministers on the far right who
have threatened to walk away if Israel
goes through uh with this plan um
Anthony blinkin is going to be in a
really important place in katar um
during the day this is a timely visit
there uh katar of course not just an
important Regional mediator um as a goet
for Hamas and Israel but it also hosts
some of the Hamas political leadership
it's been really very important in
conveying messages backwards and
forwards and how much room for maneuver
do you think there is for mediators
because it seems that they've been at
this for months
now indeed and it does look like you
know the framework that was laid out the
three phases laid out by President Biden
are similar to other deals that we have
heard about um over recent months
basically beginning with u in this case
a six week truce in which many of uh
Israel's most vulnerable hostages still
held by Hamas and other armed factions
in Gaza would be returned um and the
idea is that that would then uh lead to
negotiations so that you could have a
longer term um what's actually called in
the deal that President Biden laid out a
permanent end to hostilities now this is
something that Hamas has specified that
it really wants it wants guarantees that
phase one will lead uh to phase 2 and
the complete withdrawal of Israeli
forces uh from Gaza but the isra I is
have been saying repeatedly that they
maintain the same goals in this war they
want to defeat Hamas um and remove it
from Power completely so it has no
political and Military capabilities left
in Gaza as well as to bring home all of
the hostages and to make sure that the
threat that they see uh from Gaza is
completely removed your land thank you
that's the BBC's your land now there in

States is making a major push to pause
fighting in the strip with diplomatic
efforts taking place both in the region
and at the United Nations the UN
Security Council endorsed a ceasefire
proposal for Gaza on Monday and it's the
first time the council has passed a
resolution demanding a stop in fighting
after eight months of war the resolution
urges both Hamas and Israel to fully and
quickly implement the three-phase plan
14 countries voted in favor and Russia
abstained a US ambassador to the UN
Linda Thomas Greenfield says the
resolution shows Hamas that the
International Community is
United colleagues today this Council
sent a clear message to
Hamas accept the ceasefire deal on the
table Israeli Israel has already agreed
to this deal and the fighting could stop
today if Hamas would do the same I
repeat the fighting could stop today
Linda Thomas Greenfield there well the
vote came as the US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin is visiting the Middle
East it's the eighth time he's been to
the region since the October the 7th
attacks Mr blinkin is fiercely
advocating for the ceasefire deal
proposed by President Biden 10 days ago
as part of that effort he's met the
Egyptian president Abdul fat CI on
Monday and has held talks in Jerusalem
with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for the latest I spoke to our
correspondent in Jerusalem Yulan Nell
and we started by talking about the
security council's endorsement of the
ceasefire
proposal well I mean first of all
diplomatically this was very significant
it's really strong International
endorsement of that plan that was laid
out by President Biden a three-phase
plan uh back on the 31st of May now of
course that was being presented at the
time as an Israeli plan that's been the
the US position since um but you know on
the ground um I don't think this is
going to lead to a breakthrough at the
moment as much as we have the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinken uh
back in the region for his eighth tour
uh since this War Began he's trying to
to push both sides into a full
acceptance um of this deal as he goes
about his his different meetings um but
you know Israel even in its response uh
at the UN its representative made clear
that the country military objective
remains uh to dismantle hamas's military
capabilities in Gaza as well as to bring
the hostages home and then you have
Hamas it's welcomed this vote but at the
same time it it's not given an official
endorsement of it either and you know
Hamas is very much stuck to its position
that it wants to have guarantees that
there will be as a result of any deal
that signs up to a full withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip a
full end uh to the War uh that is not
Israel's position andand as you
mentioned it's the first time that the
security Council has passed a resolution
to stop the fighting what could you
remind us of what this plan actually
entails this ceasefire
proposal well I mean this is um the most
detailed plan that we've had back in
March there was a resolution that went
through at the UN Security Council when
the us abstained but what we've had this
time is its closest Ally the US actually
pushing this text through to very much
reflect the text um of President Biden
um in his 31st of of May uh speech that
came out with much fanfare so the first
phase would be for a six- week truce
where we'd see many of the Israeli
hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza
being returned home uh in return for an
immediate truce and uh many Palestinian
prisoners being released uh from Israeli
jails the problem comes more with phase
two of the plan where negotiations are
supposed to continue um for what is
termed a permanent end to hostilities
with more of of the hostages coming out
at at that stage uh particularly uh the
male soldiers who who remain in
captivity and the problem really is
getting from that phase one uh to phase
two uh Hamas worries that Israel would
walk away after after phase one uh so
that's really where Regional Partners
come in to try to kind of give the those
guarantees and Mr blinken on his trip to
this region he's already been in Egypt
that's another country that's inol D in
mediations acting as a go between for
Israel and Hamas um he's going to be in
Jordan later in the day but then he'll
go to katar which is another uh country
which is involved in these mediation
efforts that was youran now",20240611

blinkin is in Israel as part of a
three-day tour of the Middle East in an
effort to boost support for a ceasefire
in Gaza it's the US Secretary of State's
eighth trip to the region since the war
between Israel and Hamas began last
October the visit comes as the United
States asked the UN Security Council to
vote on a draft resolution calling for
an immediate ceasefire between Israel
and Hamas it's also calling for the
release of the hostages still held by
the group earlier Mr blink told
reporters in Cairo that Egypt has been
speaking with Hamas as recently as today
the only party that has not accepted the
only party that's not say yes is Hamas
that's who everyone's waiting on that's
who the Palestinians in Gaza are waiting
on it's who the Israelis are waiting on
it's who the hostages and the hostage
families are waiting on does Hamas want
to end this conflict end uh this war
that it started or not we'll find out
but it's clear that virtually the entire
world has come together in support of
the proposal and the only open question
is will Hamas say yes well Mr blinken's
visit comes as the Director of the UN
world food program says her organization
has paused distribution of humanitarian
Aid into Gaza via a US built Pier citing
safety concerns Cindy McCain said that
following Israel's military operation on
Saturday to rescue full hostages two wfp
warehouses in Gaza were hit by rockets
and a member of staff injured gaza's
Health Ministry says more than 270
Palestinians were killed in the
operation Mr blinken's visit also comes
amid growing turmoil inside Israel with
the resignation of Benny gance one of
the most senior members of the Israeli
War cabinet which was set up after the
Hamas attack last October he had
threatened to stand down unless he felt
there was a post-war plan for Gaza with
a deadline set of yesterday Mr Gant told
reporters he wasn't satisfied this is
the moment he confirmed he was standing
down
unfortunately netan is preventing us
from approaching true Victory which is
the justification for the painful
ongoing price and this is why we quit
the national Unity government today with
a heavy heart yet we feel that it is the
right
decision the Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has called on Mr gance to stay
in the war cabinet he posted this
message on X Israel is in an ex exential
war on multiple fronts at Benny this is
not the time to abandon the campaign
this is the time to join forces we can
speak now to Benham Ben tblu who is a
senior fellow at the foundation for
defense of democracy uh in Washington
hello to you um as I was just saying
it's a very interesting time isn't it in
terms of the political situation uh in
Israel with B gans's departure and I
suppose what does this mean for for
Benjamin Netanyahu and is you know is he
going to be uh even more influenced I
suppose by the
right well it's a pleasure to be with
you right now it's very much an open
question the resignation of of Benny
yens as you know was really foreshadowed
or telegraphed with the warnings he had
issued ever since there was a Unity
government in the aftermath of the
October 7 terror attack uh but in
general uh this did seem to be a matter
of when and not uh if uh based on the
way uh the war at home in Israel uh was
going between different factions that
had constituted that Unity government
the heart of your question right now uh
it is very much uh an open question as
to will BB the current prime minister be
more beholden uh to that hard right an
ultra Orthodox faction uh to make up the
seats uh with the loss of Gans and Eisen
cat or will he try to move to the center
or center right I mean we're just um
hearing from Anthony blinkin there
saying that the only party who's not
said yes to this cisa um deal is Hamas
but we are also hearing from our
correspondent earlier Hugo was saying
that there are members of the of the
cabinet who are saying that they they
would not um be supportive they would
resign if he was to say yes uh to this
ceasefire
deal we'll have to really wait and see
and test that out I don't think the us
would have embarked prematurely on its
eighth trip in the region and now
pushing to move a political
understanding or agreement into the text
of the UN Security Council Revolution if
the agreement did not have some kind of
ta support or ability of Netanyahu to at
least deliver let alone other factions
but you did mention the secretary and
his trip uh and it's worth noting at
least based on what's reported uh that
he will be visiting not just with the
cabinet but also with those ministers
who had resigned or those former
ministers who had resigned yeah that is
interesting isn't it and bny gance was
calling for Netanyahu to set a date for
election is there any chance of
that uh in my view it's still very
unclear very fragile but very fast
moving okay um it's well it's certainly
a very interesting time isn't it in
terms of of what could be achieved I
suppose um in terms of the US and its
ability to put even more pressure on
there is still a long way that it could
go isn't it do you expect to see the US
get any stronger in terms of it putting
pressure
on I think right now it's anyone's guess
I would wait to see how a lot of the
Arab capitals react uh both to the
messaging in the leadup to Blink script
uh you know the the point about Hamas
being the only one to not agree to the
to the ceasefire proposal or the
ceasefire resolution idea uh was echoed
before blinkin W on his script by
National Security adviser Jake Sullivan
as well as many other White House
officials who had actually left uh
Washington for France for uh
commemorations yeah okay well thanks
very much for talking to us B and Ben
tbu a senior fellow at the foundation
for defense of democracy in Washington
thank you for joining us just seeing a a
bit of a readout from the meeting
between blinken and prime minister

this coming fall when it will be the
oneyear anniversary of This Disaster we
should go for elections and reach new a
new
government I call on to n set a date for
elections well let's go live to
Jerusalem now and join our correspondent
there John donison good morning John so
what's the reaction been to this so
far well look I think this is a
significant moment but it's not going to
bring the government of prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu down because his
Coalition still maintains its majority
in the parliament but you have to
remember that uh Mr gance joined the
government and the war cabinet uh in the
wake of the October the 7th attacks as
an act of unity and what this shows now
is that there is no Unity on how the war
is being conducted in Gaza and in
particular as you said in your
introduction in terms of a postwar plan
it also removes a relatively moderate
figure and Mr gance is a man with vast
military experience uh from the cabinet
and someone I think who was particularly
well respected by the Americans and I
think what people think could happen
here is it will see the government shift
to the right those more extremist
elements within the Israeli government
could have more say in particular itamar
Ben gavier the security minister uh he
has already said that he should replace
Mr Gant in the war cabinet and he is
someone who completely rejects the idea
of any sort of ceasefire deal with Hamas
so what does this mean for President
Biden's plan that was presented at the
end of last month Anthony blinkin is in
the region again and his uh his hope is
to try and persuade Hamas to come on
board but now Israel what Israel thinks
about that plan is changing
presumably yes I mean Mr blinken is
going to be trying to put pressure I
think on both sides he's due uh in Cairo
and then in Israel uh a little later uh
but he's he's got a tough job and those
ceasefire talks don't really seem to be
getting anywhere at the moment and the
danger is that if for Mr Netanyahu that
if he uh agrees to go ahead with this
ceasefire deal deal which he has
suggested uh he would do the of course
the Americans are calling it an Israeli
plan then the likes of Mr benav who I
mentioned earlier have said they will
pull out of the government and that
would bring the government down and it
would mean fresh elections and that is
something that Mr Netanyahu is
desperately trying to avoid so um it's
going to be fascinating to see what
unfolds uh in the next few days but I
don't think people are holding their
breath for any sort of ceasefire deal
soon okay John for now thank you very
much indeed John donison there in
Jerusalem for us",20240610

calling on the Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to hold elections Benny Gant
had set a deadline of this weekend for
Mr Netanyahu to outline Israel's longer
term strategy once the war in Gaza is

experienced figure and probably one of
the most experienced members of the war
Cabinet why is he left yeah former
General former head of the army one of
his political allies um Isaac CT has
also left with him another former
General um well he said he gave
Netanyahu an ultimatum 3 weeks ago to do
those things to have a plan for what
happens the day after so this is the
quote that in his press conference he
was going to say it all yesterday but he
put it off by 24 hours after that
hostage rescue he said fateful strategic
decisions are stuck due to hesitation
and uh procrastination out of political
considerations he's talking about
Netanyahu by political considerations he
means netanyahu's desire to stay in
power perhaps prolong the war when he
could be doing a deal and to avoid the
Reckoning with the Israeli people about
the mistakes that led up to the security
failures of 7th of October which a lot
of Israelis blame Netanyahu for now
gance is hoping that this move will
start the destruction of the net Yahoo
government and there will be elections
and the polls say that if there were
elections he would become the Prime
Minister but might backfire because
Netanyahu is uh reliant on the votes to
keep his Coalition going of ultra

says 274 Palestinians were killed during
Saturday's Israeli offensive on the
nerat refugee camp the operation led to
the rescue of four Israeli hostages
taken by Hamas during the October the
7th attacks they were freed during the
raid in broad daylight Israel has
previously estimated there were fewer
than 100 casualties footage from the
areas our AXA Hospital shows badly
wounded people lying on the ground the
top Diplomat Joseph Burell has condemned
the killings describing them as another
Massacre of civilians Mustafa bouti is
the Secretary General and co-founder of
the Palestinian national initiative and
he spoke earlier to my colleague maxing
croell and gave his reaction the latest
development in Israel and Gaza well
there is a great amount of anger because
in the process the Israeli Army
committed as Joseph pel said a horrible
Massacre killing no less than 218
Palestinians mostly children and women
bombarding whole neighborhoods for no
reason and injuring in addition to that
400 people many of whom will die because
Israel has already destroyed most
medical facilities and hospitals in Gaza
it was a horrible act uh of course we
want all the prisoners to be released
but there was another way to do that
which is to conclude a deal at this rate
at this rate Netanyahu will need 20
years of massacres to release the rest
of the 120 Israeli prisoners well Israel
of course disputes that this was a
massacre and it it does seem that the
number of casualties is contested but it
certainly with scores but Israel's view
is don't take hostages then we won't
need to free them and civilians won't be
at
risk do I do Israelis take hostages we
have uh everybody talks about the 120
Israeli prisoners or hostages as you
called them but nobody speaks about the
14,500 Palestinians in Israeli presence
including 5,000 who were kidnapped in
Gaza nobody speaks what was remarkable
is that the Israelis said that the
Israeli prisoners who were released were
in very good health condition and then
well well taken care of well except
except we know other hand on the the
other hand let me finish on the other
hand
14,500 Palestinian prisoners are
subjected to torture 52 Palestinian
prisoners have been killed already in
Israeli prisons since the 7th of October
the Israel the Israeli the Israeli
government contests those accusations
government spokes person of the Israeli
government 12 there are 116 hostages
left 40 of them I believed to have been
have died whilst in Gaza everyone always
talks everybody talks about everyone
talks about an either or situ situation
that that one thing is separate from the
other all of these issues are tightly
bound up you've mentioned this deal How
likely is it that you think a ceasefire
deal will really come to pass when we
we've got all of these different
elements which could force Hamas to dig
in or could force the or persuade the
Israelis that well we've rescued four
we'll try and get some more of the
hostages
out and tell you what Israeli leaders
say what Israeli opposition leaders say
they say that Netanyahu cares only about
himself he doesn't care about the
hostages who the Hamas who the
Hamas Mr B I know you you you've told us
that you have no link in any way with
Hamas but who do Hamas care about
they're using people surely as civilians
as human Shields and there will
inevitably be civilian casualties in any
sort of operation at all if that's what
if that
continues I would really appreciate if
you allow me to answer please your
questions uh and please don't interrupt
me uh I don't sometimes I'm I'm Sor Mr
I'm sorry it's it's an opportunity here
to explore some of the things that you
say before you move on to make a the
next Point each of your points requires
and deserves some
attention because you if you if you
accept only the Israeli Narrative of
course you will say so but you have to
to see our narrative as well and the
narrative here is that this whole
problem is related to the fact that
Israel is occupying us since 60 since 57
years Israel is displacing us since 76
years that's is the roots these are the
roots of the problem and there are
Palestinian prisoners I'm not defending
Hamas I don't belong to Hamas but I'm
saying there is a better way of getting
the Israeli prisoners safe which is to
conclude a deal and the deal would mean
release of all Israeli prisoners and
release of Palestinian prisoners some of
whom have been in Israeli jails for 43
years what and a complete and total
ceasefire and end of this war you know
how many people the Israeli Army killed
up till now 46,000 including for 15,000
children that's why gues the United
Nations Secretary General decided to put
the Israeli Army on The Blacklist of
Those Who Kill children along along with
Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas and
as I as you would expect Israel Israel
has rejected that label let me finish
here let me finish why do you keep
telling me what Israel says I am not I
you don't represent Israel I know what
Israel says I don't represent Israel and
I don't represent the Palestinians but I
was robust with the uh uh the Israeli uh
commentator I spoke to an hour ago which
you may not have heard this is not about
whose side I believe we're trying to
interrogate both narratives final
question from final question to you to
what extent is all of this a faia of
Palestinian politicians generally for
generations to get a grip of their own
situation surely there must be a better
way to run Gaza if if Hamas are the best
people have to choose from they'll stick
with Hamas are they really the best
option for the Gaza Strip you know this
is an excellent question
and my answer to you is that we would
have had much better leadership if we
were allowed as people to practice our
right of democratic elections who stood
against our elections in 2021 Israel who
did not support our free Democratic
elections United States of America why
don't the world allow us to elect our
leaders freely and democratically as
everybody else is allowed to do and as
your people are going to do in Britain
we need democ Ry we need the right to
choose our leaders and Israel and the
United States has no right whatsoever to
impose on us leaders or collaborators
that would sustain the Israeli military
occupation of Gaza which should not
continue it has to stop the end of
occupation is the way to get to peace
and democracy and prosperity for
everybody that was a Mustafa bouti there
speaking to Martin crool uh let me just
bring you a line of uh breaking news
that we have this is actually coming
from the Roy's news agency saying that
the um the Hamas armed Wing is uh saying
that three Israel hostages were killed
including a US citizen during that
Israel hostage uh operation that we were
talking about earlier in Gaza so that is
as I said coming from the Reuters news
agency um and in a video posted on uh
the um hamas's um telegram channel on
Sunday saying that the host were killed
um as part of that Israeli military
operation in which uh some of those
hostages that we were saying the four
hostages freed there well uh Yosi bin is
a former Israeli Justice Minister and
peace negotiator and he initiated the
Oslo Peace process and the informal
Geneva peace Accord and I spoke to him a
little earlier and asked him what impact
that that Israeli military operation
will have on further negotiations to
release more
hostages well I I believe that what
happened yesterday was of course very
important since Hamas doesn't show any
Readiness for exchange of the civilian
hostages the babies the old the elderly
people in their hands with the
Palestinian
prisoners H but apparently it may it may
have an influence on Hamas now if they
understand that Israel will not just
wait for the answer whether they want
such an exchange or not but if they
don't answer it will release as as many
hostages as it it can and it is not easy
and as you said there were civilian
casualties on the Palestinian side but
if Hamas is actually hiding the
hostages in the this civilian homes it
cannot complain about Israel trying to
to save them the impact may be ER I'm
not sure but I hope ER accelerate the
the the ER willingness of the parties to
negotiate about a deal in this deal all
the the hostages should be released and
the
Palestinian prisoners would release an
exchange a big much bigger much higher
number than the Israeli hostages but the
main question for me the main question
is whether we are going now to something
like the President Biden plan which was
offered already more than a week ago to
both sides or are we actually playing
games with each other not to be the ones
who are rejecting it wholeheartedly but
not accepting in and and whatever and if
Hamas is planning to remain
in Gaza which I believe is bad news for
the Free World we we heard that the H
master and health Ministry has said that
274 Palestinians were killed in that
raid four four hostages released as we
know does that seem proportionate action
to
you it is not a question of proportion
Israel is has all the right in the world
in my view to release these innocent
people these innocent babies and elderly
who are in the hands of of Hamas now it
it may cost a price and I'm very sad
really it is not just a liap service I'm
very sad to see a people who are be
becoming the on the Palestinian side the
victims of such act but they should
address Hamas and know that if Hamas is
hiding our people in these neighborhoods
Israel will not say oh since you did
such a a very
clever thing and hid them in those
neighborhoods we will not try to release
our people we should as long as Hamas is
not releasing them it is our role not
only our right to release as many
Israelis as
possible yes speaking to me there",20240609

Israeli soldier died but Hamas says more
than 200 Palestinians were killed in the
operation although that figure is
disputed Hugo Pasa has more from Tel

218 months ago they were in the Nova
music festival in southern Israel when
Hamas gunmen attacked more than 360
people were killed here this morning the
Israeli military carried out a raid of
the nerat refugee camp in central
Gaza there were heavy air strikes
Special Forces went
in the military said this was a complex
operation and based on intelligence
information the four hostages it said
were found at two separate locations in
the heart of the camp and were brought
out Under Fire Israeli forces have been
preparing for this rescue mission for
weeks they are underwent in intensive
training they risk their lives to save
the lives of all
hostages if there was relief in Israel
the operation meant yet more suffering

treat all the wounded many arrived
already
dead we were at home a rocket hit us my
two cousins died and my other two
cousins were seriously injured they did
nothing they were sitting at
home the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu visited the freed hostages in
a hospital near Tel Aviv he's been urged
to reach a ceasefire and hostage release
deal with Hamas today's rescue could
help lift some of the
pressure indeed Hugo one wonders what
all this could mean for ceasefire
talks well C this is the key question
after this uh rescue just hours ago here
in Tel Aviv thousands of people joined a
protest demanding a deal with Hamas for
the remaining hostages to be freed the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is under pressure to accept a
proposal that was laid out by President
Biden that includes not only the Rel of
hostages but also paves the way for a
permanent ceasefire in Gaza which is a
contentious Point here in Israel this
rescue operation has been seen as a
success by the Israeli authorities and
could change the calculations of the
Prime Minister but many will say that
will happen today is proof that it is
urgent to reach a ceasefire two
hospitals say at least 70 people were
killed during this operation and the

described it as a bloody massacre okay

country in the world and yet this year
its economy is set to grow faster than
all advanced economies according to the
international monetary fund later today
the Russian President Vladimir Putin is
hosting an international economic Forum
in St Petersburg our Russia editor Steve
Rosenberg is in St Petersburg with more
on what we can expect to hear from
President Putin well I mean it's an
international economic Forum so uh the
economy is going to be top of the list
we'll hear a lot about the economy and
certainly the Russian authorities are
trying to use this year's event this
year's Forum to say look we know we're
heavily sanctioned by the west but there
are plenty of other regions and
countries in the world ready to do
business with Russia so you know I
haven't seen this week many um CEOs from
America or Europe but delegations from
Asia from Africa from the Middle East
from South America so I expect president
Putin will make that point but apart
from the economy there's going to be a
lot I think about
geopolitics um that's been bubbling away
in the background in St Petersburg this
week the war in Ukraine The Soaring
tensions between Russia and the West in
fact earlier this week in St Petersburg
uh Vladimir Putin suggested that Russia
is considering uh supplying uh Advanced
conventional long- range missiles to
others uh uh to carry out strikes
against Western targets uh that would be
Russia's response to uh NATO allies
allowing Ukraine to use Western uh
missiles uh to strike Russian
territory Steve how is it then that
Vladimir Putin is able to prop up his
economy despite those sanctions how is
he circumventing
them yeah um With a Little Help from his
friends first of all so country like
India and China uh so for example Russia
has redirected um its oil exports from
Europe to India and China China's become
actually a Lifeline really for for for
the Russian economy but also Russia
continues to um make a lot of money from
its uh energy exports despite
International sanctions trying to slash
the amount of money that that Russia
earns from for example oil exports a lot
of money is pouring in and that is uh
being spent on the military on the
defense sector and that in turn is
fueling um economic growth uh probably
short-term economic growth because in
the long term uh a war economy that
we're seeing emerging in Russia is
hardly
sustainable and Steve Western Nations
have been criticized uh there have been
people saying that some of those
loopholes need to be tightened in order
for sanctions to have a real effect uh
on Russia what are we talking
about yeah that's true I mean for
example um the oil price cap now this
was a an idea that came up from the G7
Nations uh and EU leaders to cap the
price uh that Russia can sell its oil
around the world no more than $60 uh a
barrel that was the idea but Russia's
been able to circumvent that um and also
other um designed to U stop um you know
reduce the amount of of money Russia
gets uh from trade with with various
countries now recently the US Treasury
suggested um introducing secondary
sanctions on International Banks for
example that are doing transactions uh
with Moscow if that happens that will
put pressure I think on the Russian
economy uh and that is I think an area
of concern for the Russian authorities

for us hello land I understand there's
an investigation that is being held into
the deaths of these four hostages why is
that so the Israeli military says the
circumstances are still not clear uh
which led to the men's deaths um earlier
this year it appears during Israeli
operations in Khan yunas in southern
Gaza of course that was seen very much
as being a stronghold of Hamas uh as
Israeli Ground Forces moved in there um
and the Israeli military is promising a
full
and transparent investigation into
exactly what happened we did have last
month Hamas saying that nadav Powell um
the British Israeli citizen who was
killed um had died of his wounds uh that
he sustained in an Israeli air strike in
April um of course that's not something
that that could be verified we've only
just had uh his death being uh confirmed
um but you know the way that this was
phrased by the Israeli military is that
it is looking at all Poss possibilities
into how the men and how the men were
killed okay the United States uh telling
us that they have submitted this peace
plan uh proposal ceasefire proposal to
the UN Security Council a lot of
confusion as to who has said what and
who's going to do what just take us
through that
yolan yeah so in this un Security
Council proposal put forward by the US
it's really um calling on Hamas to
accept the three fa deal that President
Biden laid out on Friday really
presenting it as an Israeli ceasefire
plan to bring the hostages home um and
we had Egypt coming out saying that
Hamas was looking at it positively
although um it has not given an official
response the confusion really comes on
the Israeli side because uh just within
the Israeli governing Coalition it's a
fragile governing Coalition we've had
very uh mixed messaging um those on the
the far right two key ministers have
said that they would be prepared to
topple the government if there was
agreement to what was called a reckless
deal and then we had the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu really
coming out talking to an Israeli
parliamentary committee saying that um
he would not um go for this um unless it
meant there would still be full victory
over Hamas a full dismantling um of
Hamas it would not mean uh the end of
the war and he was really suggesting it
was possible for Israel to in effect
agree to the first first uh stage of the
plan go for that see many of the most
vulnerable hostages being returned home
during a 6 week ceasefire and then uh
resume the war of course if that's the
case it's something that it's very

every expectation that Israel will
accept a ceasefire proposal that would
begin with a cessation of hostilities

humanitarian Aid and an exchange of some
hostages for Palestinian prisoners as
pressure grows so does the fighting in
Gaza Palestinian media reporting a
series of Israeli air strikes on refugee
camps on Sunday in which they say about
20 people were killed feda alaraj is in
Rafa and she told us about the current
situation there the situation in Rafa is
is
unbelievably um horrific I can't really
describe it in words hundreds of
thousands of people are displaced yet
again like we were displaced to ra um
people are going back to places that has
no water no facility is no access
whatsoever but they are fleeing
literally for their
lives uh in terms of food like um uh the
markets are better than than other days
however the prices are still super high
the access to cash uh liquidity is
extremely difficult the use of banking
apps or banking transfers is also not an
option because of difficulties in
telecommunication and internet access so
even if we have a little bit more food
than usual in the market it's still
extremely difficult to get when you ask
me about the seire proposal to be super
honest I stopped caring I stopped
following these news for me it's just
another proposal in a series that has
failed so so far because to be honest it
seems that all the W put together uh
fails to hold Israel
accountable or even less to just manage
to stop them from what they're doing
here I'm concerned that I will not have
a future to be worried about at all so
that gives you an idea of daily life and
Rafa at the moment but nonetheless this
dpy proposal is on the table now here's
the view of what needs to happen for
that to progress from our International
editor Jeremy bar well they have to say
yeah we'll do the deal but also there
are a lot of granular details that they
would have to go through like for
example the ratio of released hostages
to prisoners what kind of prisoners what
might they have done and what sort of
hostages as well old people old people
and women including female soldiers
those sorts of
calculations uh the proposed proposal
that Biden laid out which he said of
course and it's been repeated by his
officials that it's a it's an Israeli
proposal it's what he said um is in it
there are six week blocks basically
where this would happen now uh of course
the issue is um is the politics on both
sides whether it's acceptable or not the
Hamas have always said they're fine with
the ceasefire as long as the ceasefire
means the war is over period and Israel
gets out of the Gaza Strip and from the
Israeli point of view since Biden made
his speech uh the prime minister's
office has made it clear that what
they're concerned about uh is sticking
with their objectives which is the
dismantling and destruction of herass as
a political and military force and that
of course as an objective has been
criticized because how do you actually
Define all of that and as well as that
one other thing of course it's the
Israeli political Dimension which is
that Mr Netanyahu is reliable is is his
government depends on the votes of
extreme Jewish Ultra nationalist parties
who made it clear that they're not at
all interested in these kinds of deals
in fact what they want to do is even go
in there set up a government in Gaza and
settle Jews in a lot of the territory as
well to pick up on one of those points
then Jeremy when you you hear Israeli
defense minister yov Galant he's been
speaking in the past hour or so backing
up uh Mr Netanyahu saying we not accept
the rule of Hamas and Gaza at any point
at any stage does that mean that the
ceasefire is just a non-starter when
that that's the perspective of Mr
Netanyahu uh well that phrase nonstarter
has actually has been used by his office
in the context of their their wider
objectives yes Israel is prepared to
have a SE f
once we've managed to they would say
destroy uh destroy hamas's rule in Gaza
and from the Hamas point of view they
know that in this kind of asymmetric
Warfare between a powerful State and a
militia group uh Victory from the
militia group is
survival uh and it's the fact that that
they they're still there at the very end
of things and the point being made by a
lot of observers including in a an
interview that's come up um today with
the former prime minister former Army
Chief of Staff Former Defense Minister
uh eood Barack and he said look Israel
is saying that when they've done Rafa
that'll be it he said no it won't be it
they have to send troops elsewhere into
the Gaza Strip the point is is that it
turned into an Insurgency or is turning
into an Insurgency in other words there
will be men with kalashnikovs and Rocket
propeller grenades popping out of holes
in the ground perhaps for months firing
them at Israelis and the fact they can
fire them is what for them counts as
resistance and a continuing fight and
for Israel might count as not fully
eradicating uh Hamas the you know close
allies of the Prime Minister have said
that this might go on for the the rest
of the year or longer Jeremy what's your
view of America's influence right now
and President Biden you made the point
that he has said you know this is an
Israeli proposal obviously trying to put
some more pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu
there but where do you think he's at
with
us well I I think I think Biden's quite
conflicted because his instincts are to
back Israel to the hilt but he has an
appalling relationship like other um
American Presidents particularly
Democrats have had with uh with Benjamin
Netanyahu uh from the very beginning
he's been offering them advice he said
look America's got your back we will
back you up and they've been doing that
sending over vast amounts of Weaponry
plus absolutely invaluable diplomatic
protection in the UN Security Council a
vetoing resolutions calling for ceased
Fires for example um and at the same
time Netanyahu basically has not been
taking his advice because he calculates
that he can speak over the head of the
president to Israel's allies of which
there are many in the US Congress but
Biden's problem is it's an election year
and the polls are saying that he's used
he in what will be a close election he's
losing vital votes because of what's
seen as um uh a support of Israel that's
gone above and beyond what America
should have done for one of its allies
that Israel critics would say have
sacrificed the moral High Ground it
might have had on the 7th of October and
that Mr Biden by continuing on one hand
to say look don't use these very heavy
weapons in civilian areas and then on
the other hand transporting loads more
heavy weapons 2,000lb bombs and the like
to the Israelis uh that that his
protestations therefore seem
unconvincing and Hollow but I think the
time has come now he said himself in
that speech he said look this war has
got to end and the argument he and he
said there will be people in Israel who
won't agree with this but the argument
that he makes is that Hamas cannot do
another 7th of October attack and so
that should be it but from netanyahu's
problem apart from the fact that he
might lose his Coalition over it which
for him is a big big deal uh he's
defined Victory as the eradication of
Hamas and if they stop now well clearly
with the senior leadership of Hamas in
Gaza uh still um at Liberty and with
their their their Fighters opening up up
on Israeli soldiers when they get the
opportunity then clearly Hamas is still
there",20240603

East where two key right-wing members of
Israel's coalition government has
threatened to bring it down if the Prime
Minister agrees to the latest peace deal
offer the Finance Minister bzel smotri
and the national security minister isir
benav have said that they were opposed
to striking any deal unless Hamas was
wiped out and last night in Tel avive
tens of thousands of people gathered to
urge the prime minister to accept the
ceasefire proposal which was unveiled by
by the US President Joe Biden groups of
protesters dispersed were dispersed by
Mounted Police and by water cannon so
let's discuss this proposed deal with
mju zi who is joining us from Doha a
professor of contemporary Middle East
politics at Qatar University Professor
zi what do you think hamas's leadership
group in Doha in katar where you are are
saying are they urging each other to
accept Joe 's
proposal as far as um they um announced
last night they looking positively to
the announcement made by President uh
Biden and they are willing to uh uh talk
about it and discuss it um further to
see more clear plan uh and uh more
details about the implementation um let
me just uh uh remind the viewers that
all of the proposed suggested in the
last few months actually all of them
sort of uh re restructure and re submit
of what had happened in the Paris
meeting a few months ago when the whole
uh uh mediators uh basically discussing
the whole crisis in Gaza so everything
we see now is actually started in Paris
in Paris discussion which is actually
happened a few months ago so the new
proposal is sort of amendment of that
discussion so what what is your
understanding then what what is
specifically different then with this
because arguably this proposal means
that does Hamas in your understanding
continue as is because ultimately
Benjamin Netanyahu the right of his
party will not accept
that list um according to President
Biden what he presented it was an
Israeli proposal and that proposal did
not mention three things one anything
about the day after
secondly anything about rebuilding Gaza
thirdly um about uh the complete uh
withdraw however if you look at the
three steps announced by Biden actually
there is a talk about stopping all uh um
uh I would say military activities but
they don't talk about complete saire so
there is a there is a a playing of words
can be seen all of the proposal they
talk about three stages
each stage 42 days and basically
followed by complete ceasefire and
within those there will be uh uh
basically all of the uh captiv will be
released there will be more Palestinian
also released there will be uh uh there
will be freedom to the gazan people from
South to go to the north narim Israelis
will withdraw from Whole Gaza um and
then they talk about uh basically
rebuilding in what Biden presented there
is no talk about the day after and what
that is what I think B now Netanyahu
trying to capitalize on and trying to
protect the proposal from uh uh his
cabinet members okay Professor maub zier
from the Kat University we're going to
have to leave it there we're out of time
but thank you for your analysis",20240602

accept a new Israeli proposal to free
hostages and bring about a lasting
ceasefire Mr Biden speaking from the
White House unveiled the three-part plan
which would begin with a six- week
ceasefire in which the Israeli Defense
Forces would withdraw from populated
areas of Gaza there would also be a
surge of humanitarian Aid as well as an
exchange of some hostages for
Palestinian Prisoners the president said
it was time for this war to end Hamas
issued a statement saying it was ready
to deal positively with any proposal
offering a permanent Ceasar and a
complete Israeli withdrawal well shortly
after President Biden spoke Democratic
and Republican leaders invited the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of
Congress the date of the speech has not
yet been set our first report this hour
is from our correspondent victon
Maven after almost 8 months of Israeli
response to the 7th of October attacks
by Hamas Gaza lays largely in Ruins with
the lives of Palestinians who call it
home turned upside down more than 36,000
have been killed across the region
according to the Hamas run Health
Ministry hundreds of thousands are
displaced and Aid is struggling to reach
them the conflict has put the US Israel
relationship under immense pressure but
in a surprise move President Biden
unveiled a new peace proposal and
ceasefire offer from Israel I know there
are those in Israel who will not agree
with this plan and we'll call for the
war to continue
indefinitely some some are even in the
government
Coalition and they've made it clear they
want to occupy Gaza they want to keep
fighting for years and the hostages are
not a priority to them well I've urged
the leadership in Israel to stand behind
this deal to despite whatever pressure
comes President Biden outlined a
three-phase proposal that would begin
with an immediate 6 we ceasefire at the
same time Israeli forces would carry out
a withdrawal from Gaza Israeli hostages
in Gaza would be exchanged for
Palestinian prisoners and 600 trucks of
humanitarian Aid would be delivered
there each day in the second phase Hamas
and Israel would negotiate a permanent
end to
hostilities the final phase would
include a major reconstruction operation
in Gaza with international
support among those urging Hamas to get
on board was foreign secretary David
Cameron posting on social media let's
seize this moment and bring this
conflict to an
end for President Biden resolving the
conflict has become a political
imperative ahead of elections in 5
months time he's been losing the support
of some younger voters and Muslim voters
both have been vocal in their
dissatisfaction at events in
Gaza for Palestinians in Gaza if hamus
agrees to this deal it will be the start
of a long road to rebuild some semblance
of the lives they once had Vincent
mcavin BBC News well with me now is
Muhammad T from BBC Arabic to discuss
this further Muhammad we've had
proposals before what's in this one and
what's new it is an Israeli proposal it
does not uh include a permanent
ceasefire it does not include a full
withdrawal from the Israeli forces from
Gaza which are the main two demands of
Hamas so what is hamas's response to
this so far Hamas said we are responding
positively to this uh these proposals
they say that President Biden said that
he he mentioned permanences fire he
actually me
mentioned permanent cation of
hostilities they say that he mentioned
full withdrawal from Gaza he only
mentioned withdrawal from the Israeli
forces from the inhabitant areas uh how
much pressure will be on Hamas now to
accept this and what is the next stage
do you see of these proposals going
forward of course there is a huge H
pressure on both parties on the Israeli
parties uh party on on Hamas party to
accept the ceasefire this war went so
far with about 40,000 civilians died in
Gaza with a
dire humanitarian situation in Gaza no a
single fully function hospital no school
working and this and these civilians are
really want want their life to come back
again along with the families of the
hostages that are expecting to to get
the hostages back huge pressures from
both sides to what extent they they
would they would refuse this proposals
and continue the War I highly doubt that
and on the Israeli side Benjamin
Netanyahu President Biden mentioned it
even he's under pressure from within his
own government to carry on the operation
until what they see is the defeat of
Hamas indeed these proposals from Israel
would guarantee to to isra to to have
presence in Gaza in in the inhabitant
areas that this presence will allow them
to restart the war at any time hunt
Hamas members at any time
being responsible in in the security in
Gaza it is all about who will appear
winning this war Nikki so if Hamas would
accept uh that they go to these
proposals without a guarantee of a
permanent ceasefire permanent withdrawal
they might appear that they lost the war
and if the Israelis would accept any
proposal that that would include
permanent ceire full withdrawal they
will appear that they lost this war M

comes well let's speak now to Tom
baitman who's in Washington for us Tom
you're a former Middle East
correspondent you know the region well
how significant is this proposal
this is a significant intervention
tonight Rita by the US president and one
designed I think to finally draw a line
and try to bring this war to a close now
at the heart of the announcement there
was one very significant expression
phrase uh by Joe Biden and that was
about a permanent end to hostilities he
called it a permanent cessation in the
second phase negotiated in the first but
after 6 weeks uh a permanent Sensation
that means an end to this war and the
critical point there is that had been
The crucial demand of Hamas all the way
through and one uh senior Administration
official uh telling me tonight that this
text gets uh Hamas extremely close to
what it had had already agreed to in
previous talks that later uh fell apart
so I think this is meant uh designed to
be seen as a major concession by the
Israelis to try and get a deal uh back
on the table and then over the line but
what about those crucial sticking points
well tonight Hamas have said that they
view what Mr Biden has said here
positively but one senior Palestinian
official familiar with the text has told
the BBC they don't see that guarantee to
an end of hostilities in there but also
President Biden putting pressure on both
sides to try and take this not just
sticks but carrots too an incentive
given to prime minister Netanyahu
tonight a joint address to both houses
of Congress and a Letter of Invitation
has been put to him tonight that's how
far Mr Biden wants to go to get this
deal over the line and the war ended",20240531
HtM_XeO1fUg,President Biden sets out new Israeli proposal to end war in Gaza I BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\President Biden sets out new Israeli proposal to end war in Gaza I BBC News.jpg,"for weeks now there have been talks and
anticipation around a ceasefire deal to
end the conflict in Gaza and for weeks
those talks and that anticipation has
led to nothing could there be a
breakthrough this evening President
Biden's been speaking in the last few
hours and he said Israel had submitted a
comprehensive new proposal for a
ceasefire to end its war with Hamas the
plan would involve the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from populated areas of
Gaza as well as the release of Israeli
hostages the president said the proposal
has been sent to the Palestinian side
and he urged Hamas to accept it let's
have a listen to more of what the
president had to say for the past
several months my negotiators of foreign
policy intelligence community and like
have been relentlessly focused not just
on a ceasefire that would ever that
would inevitably be fragile and
temporary but on a durable end of the
war that's been the focus of durable end
of this war one that brings all the
hostages home ensures Israel's
security creates a better day after in
Gaza without Hamas and power and sets a
stage for political settlement that
provides a better future for Israelis
and Palestinians alike President Biden
speaking earlier at the White House
while joining me now is our Middle East
correspondent Hugo Baga Hugo what is
different in this new proposal that's
come from Israel because of course for
weeks now we've been hearing of
different offers and deals from both
sides yeah regini so this proposal is
very similar to a proposal that was put
forward by Egypt which has been acting
as a mediator in in these negotiations
so it is a three-phase proposal uh the
first phase is a six- we uh ceasefire
that would lead to the release of uh
some of the hostages who are now being
held in Gaza uh and that it would see
negotiations uh happened for a permanent
uh ceasefire so we know that yesterday
Hamas said that it would not engage in
negotiations uh before the end of the
war and uh and we've seen that here in
Israel the Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has rejected any idea of a
permanent ceasefire in Gaza uh before uh
the end of the war so and before he
could achieve the the goals of the war
so it's very interesting that this plan
has been announced by President Biden he
didn't mentioned uh prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and also you know we
know that this is very likely to be
unpopular with uh some supporters
far-right supporters of the Prime
Minister who have rejected the idea of
reaching a deal with Hamas they say that
uh the war must continue until Hamas is
defeated and also until all the hostages
are freed because they say that mil
pressure is the only way to bring the
hostages back and I think the president
described this deal as a truly uh
historic moment and he said uh that uh
you know he urged Hamas to accept this
deal he said that this deal was
presented to Hamas by qat which has also
been acting as mediators in these
negotiations and so Hugo what comes next
then we wait for a response from
Hamas yeah I think now you know the ball
is on hamas's Court and uh we are you
know waiting to see what kind of
reaction is going to come from uh Hamas
uh we're also waiting to hear from uh
prime minister Netanyahu from senior
Israeli officials uh the speech by
President Biden came after the start of
the Jewish holiday here so I think it's
going to take a little bit of time uh
before we hear from some key Israeli
officials but again uh prime minister
Netanyahu has been under pressure from
the families of the hostages who remain
in capital AC ity in Gaza and also from
uh International leaders to try to
present a proposal uh for a a a
ceasefire and on the other hand Hamas
has also been you know under a lot of
pressure to accept the deal because
obviously you know we've seen that uh
you know the the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza continues more than 36,000
Palestinians have been killed as a
result of this conflict so now a new
proposal being put forward by uh by the
Israelis according to President Biden so
I think now we're still waiting to hear
what kind of reaction is going to come
from Hamas here go Bea in Jerusalem
thank you very much for that and we're
just hearing uh from the Israeli Prime
Minister's office a statement here
that's come into us by the Reuters news
agency which says the Gaza war will not
end until all goals are achieved
including the return of all hostages and
the destruction of Hamas we'll bring you
more reaction from all sides to those
proposals which have been announced by
the White house to the program",20240531

United Nations says the amount of
humanitarian Aid entering Gaza has
decreased by 2/3 since Israel began its
military operation in Rafa earlier this
month the Israeli military says it has
established full operational control
over the fideli corridor along the Gaza
Egypt border discovering dozens of
rocket launchers and at least 20 crossb
smuggling tunnels there so far a
national security adviser to Israel's
primee Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
he expects the war against has to
continue for at least another 7 months
let's go to Jerusalem now and speak to
our Middle East correspondent yolan Nell
um let's let's just talk first of all if
we can about um this fidelia Corridor
can you tell us a bit more what about
what it is and what Israel says it's
found yes this is the 14 km
strategically important strip of land uh
that lies on the Gaza Egypt border now
the Israelis saying that they have
effective control um of that Corridor
now and talking about what they have
found there saying there have been
multiple rocket launchers and rocket
launch sites they' found pointing out
that they say in recent weeks something
like 70 rockets and mortars have been
fired by Hamas from the Rafa area um
suggesting really that it was locating
some of these launch sites very close to
the border with Egypt uh to try to avoid
uh Israel going after them and perhaps
making a mistake and firing into Egypt
um they've also found they say some 20
tunnels which they believe were used to
smuggle weapons into Palestinian armed
groups like Hamas um and they say there
may be more of these tunnels they're
locating them and destroying them along
this border area now all of this is
likely to ratchet up tensions further uh
between Israel and Egypt Egypt's concern
will be that Israeli forces will try to
maintain a presence along this Border in
the longer term and also they've been
saying that you know Egyptian security
sources talking to the Egyptian media
that that the tunnels are being used
they say as an excuse by Israel to
justify its Rafa offensive um and they
say that uh they have dealt themselves
effectively with smuggling tunnels
particularly over the past decade okay
thank you so much Yan now for us there
live in Jerusalem we can speak now to
British Army veteran and chief executive
of the intelligence company Cil line
Justin Crump hello to you Justin how
we're just hearing it from yoland a
little bit about um what the Israeli
Army says that it's discovered how
significant is this that it now controls
that area of the
Border I mean it's a really important
piece of ground for Israel uh if you
think of any military force that's
attacking an adversary I mean one of the
things you want to do is surround the
adversary you want to cut that adversary
off uh from Supply and Hamas almost
certainly wasn't getting supplies
through Israel so Israeli suspicion has
always been on the border with Egypt um
certainly milit planning would assume
that there was some permeability of that
border whether it was the Rafa Crossing
whether it was tunnels obviously Egypt
would argue with that but from the
Israeli point of view controlling that
border Cuts Hass off um from further
Supply or does a lot to stop it from
doing that it also stops his Safe Haven
as you've heard there this um use of
that border area uh as an area that
Israel can't really strike because it's
too close to Egypt it's an area that
Hamas have used to stop our weapons to
launch weapons from uh and we've seen
examples of that and of course the
Israelis have found launch positions of
of rockets that were exploiting the
position so very important what we call
sort of vital ground or key terrain for
Israel in this war right and in terms of
the relations as y land was mentioning
between Egypt and uh Israel presumably
tensions will be heightened now because
of what's going on there yeah because
the agreement over Rafa goes back to
1979 and of course when Israel was in
the Gaza Strip there was an agreement
that Egyptian forces Israeli forces
would be matched by mutual agreement I
mean the two Nations have fought several
devastating conflicts in that area and
obviously neither side wanted to see the
other build up uh troops now obviously
that fell into abeyance when Hamas uh
were in Gaza when there was a blockade
of Gaza by both Egypt and Israel uh and
control of that U but we're now back to
the point that the Israelis are opposite
the Egyptians On the Border fence and
actually one Egyptian Soldier killed in
the last couple of days and what appears
to have been an exchange of fire with
the Israelis moving along the corridor
so um it certainly is more tension Egypt
arguing strongly that they have
controlled the tunnels you know and
saying as we've heard there it's an
excuse Israel pointing out the ttles but
to be fair it's not clear that all of
them crossed the border um but they're
certainly present along that area it was
certainly a big Hamas operational area
so I think Israel feeling Vindicated but
perhaps not as much as they'd like Egypt
feeling defensive but maybe with
something to actually take on board here
so a lot of surface tension how much
it's going to really affect relations uh
I think to be seen at the okay and what
about um this National Security adviser
to Benjamin Netanyahu saying that they
expect the war against Hamas to go on
for at least another seven
months I mean if you think of the sort
of conflict this is and you think back
to say the war on terror or something
like that the the military phase can
sometimes be the easiest part of it and
then you've got to build afterwards and
this ties in I think with the um the US
commentary that they want to see a plan
for the day after the fighting stops
because the fighting won't really stop I
mean I don't think Israel can achieve a
purely military Victory against Hamas
that settles this and then there will be
peace and rebuilding and prosperity this
is going to be a long running um saw for
Israel I think in terms of how they deal
with the future security and rebuilding
of the Gaza Strip uh and it's a real
question as to how Israel avoids it
going on not just another seven months
but another seven years I think at
various levels of intensity and
certainly they haven't achieved their
even stated military aims uh yet let
alone their political ones okay well
thank you for your thoughts appreciate
your time that's Justin Crump thanks

for the operation to be halted to
prevent the loss of more civilian lives
well Algeria has said that it would
draft a UN resolution calling for an end

previous resolutions and says it still
considers the Israeli campaign in Rafa
to fall short of what it deems a major
ground operation but it said that the
deaths on Tuesday of 21 more people in a
dis bled persons Camp were heartbreaking
Israel has denied firing on the area
well let's cross over live two Jerusalem
our correspondent there yoland Nell
joins us so yoland the White House
saying the US continues not to believe
that Israel has launched this what a a
fullscale invasion of Rafa in southern
Gaza despite that what does this mean
for the people already displaced there
where did they
go well that remains big question we've
continued to see people flee in the past
day of course heading north um along the
coastline um also to to Khan yunas um a
city that was previously um really
devastated uh by uh a fullscale uh
Israeli ground offensive there that was
seen as being a Hamas stronghold now
what we're hearing this morning is there
have been further Israeli air strikes in
Rafa um we've been hearing as well in in
the past day or so that um these have
been in the west of the city that's an
area where Palestinians had not been
told to evacuate from uh previously now
um we've also had Israeli Ground Forces
advancing into the center of Rafa and
along the Gaza Egypt border as well that
was important that assessment that came
from Washington last night really saying
that it still sees this as being a
limited operation not Crossing what it
has defined as its red lines um to which
would lead to uh US military aid vital
Aid uh to Israel uh being stopped um
they're saying that really they've not
seen at this stage um that Israel has
smashed into Rafa there's been hitting
multiple points um with lots of troops
on the ground but the US has said is
closely monitoring Sunday's deadly
strike um on that tent camp in the west
at tesan in which at least 45 uh
Palestinians were killed uh the Israeli
military had said that it used precise
bombs to go after two Hamas commanders
um in that area um the US saying that
those results the fire that broke out
and that was something that was tragic
we've been hearing from the Israeli
military that this initial assessment is
that there were um secondary explosions
at the size of the Munitions it used it
says could not have been responsible
suggesting that perhaps uh weapons held
by Palestinian armed groups in that area
um could have been to blame there is
this proposed un security Council
resolution that is now circulating uh
we're told put forward by Algeria
following the closed doors emergency
session uh that took place yesterday
they have said they would like to see um
an end to the killing in Rafa they
putting forward a proposal on that um
but of course we have had at the US
vetoing multiple uh resolutions at the
UN Security Council calling for
ceasefires in Gaza okay well yand as
always thank you very much for just
bringing us up to date of the situation
on the ground there Yan now live from

the Israeli military is continuing that
offensive in southern Gaza as my

War today the city's West and Center was

triggered in an Israeli air strike on
Sunday dozens dead survivors
spent there's more than one way to lose
a
life Israel says its operation in Rafa
is key to defeating Hamas and that
Sunday's strike on Hamas commanders in
the camp was carried out with precise
Munitions that would not by themselves
have caused so many deaths we're talking
about munition with 17 kilos of
explosive material this is the smallest
munition that our Jets can
use following this strike a large fire
ignited for reasons that are still being
investigated our munition alone could
not have ignited a fire of this
size while people fled today gaza's
Health Ministry said more than 20 were
killed in fresh air strikes to the West
over half of them

live 3 hours of breaking news let's
start in the Middle East and Israeli
tanks are now reported to have reached
the very center of Rafa The Heart of the
City in southern Gaza as Israel carries
out its most intense bombardment of Rafa
since the War Began hundreds of
Palestinian families who were already
dis displaced have fled temporary
shelters in Rafa Following air strikes
and tank Fire by Israeli forces
overnight well it all comes despite
International condemnation over that
Israeli air strike on Sunday which led
to a devastating fire at a refugee camp
killing 45 people including women and
children now the UN Security Council
will be discussing the situation in Gaza
later on well meanwhile the mil Israeli
military says it is investigating the
possibility it says that weapons stored
in a nearby compound caught fire from
its air strike on Sunday in Rafa here is
the Israel Defense Forces spokesman rear
Admiral Daniel hagari our munition alone
could not have ignited a fire of this
size i r repeat it our ammunition alone
could not have ignited a fire of this
size our investigation seeks to
determine what may have caused such a
large fire to ignite we are looking into
all possibilities including the option
that weapons stored in a compound next
to our Target which we did not know of
may have ignited as a result of the
strike as Daniel hagari of the IDF and
the IDF have promised a Swift and
transparent investigation into what
happened something which the UK foreign
secretary Lord Cameron has also called
for I think that uh what happened in
Rafa overnight really did did look very
very concerning very worrying and so
we're asking for that to be investigated
rapidly the Israelis have already said
it was a tragic mistake but we want to
see that properly investigated look what
I want to see is a stop in the fighting
we want a pause which has been offered
by the Israelis a hostage deal to Hamas
that would let prisoners out of Israeli
jails and have that pause because what
we need is to get the hostages out get
the aid in and have that stop in the
fighting which we can then turn into a
permanent sustainable ceasefire that's
what I want to see happen so that's the
foreign secretary Lord Cameron well our
a little earlier I spoke to our middle e
correspondent in Jerusalem Hugo PGA who
told me this is the first detailed
account we've had from the Israeli
military about their version of events
on
Sunday the Israeli authorities are under
uh you know a lot of pressure
International pressure after this attack
so today we heard from Danielle hagari a
spokesman for the Israeli military and I
think the message here in this briefing
was very clear we just heard from him
saying that uh the Israeli attack alone
could not have ignited this fire and
he's saying now that one of the
possibilities being explored is that uh
weapons being stored uh you know near uh
the target of this attack uh might have
caused this fire there was no evidence
of that uh he said uh that images posted
on social media uh from uh the aftermath
of the attack being analized by the
Israeli military and those images
according to him uh appear to show SA
explosions that he said uh might have
been triggered by those weapons that
were being stored uh in this site near
uh this um uh compound uh that was
targeted uh some other lines from uh
this briefing again uh he dismissed a
reports saying that this attack happened
uh in an area that had been designated
as a humanitarian Zone by the Israeli
military he said uh the target was uh
almost 2 km away from the uh
humanitarian Zone and he also said that
the target here was located 180 M away
from those STS so we know that uh after
this uh air strike uh there was this
huge Blaze uh at least 45 people were
killed as a result of this attack
including many women and and children
and again a lot of international
condemnation uh and human rights uh
organizations saying that despite what
the Israeli authorities have been saying
they know that there is you know a large
risk that you know large numbers of
people could be killed as a result of
these attacks because of the large
number of Palestinians who are now
seeking shelter in those parts of Rafa
that's Hugo baso there our middle EAS

something like 250 in a large Blaze
after the Israeli air strikes there
targeting the Israeli military says uh
to Hamas Commanders in that area um now
what we've been seeing um overnight is
uh more artillery shelling more Israeli
air strikes and that is sending people
particularly in the west of Rafa where
there weren't these Israeli evacuation
orders issued um earlier um in Israel's
military operations uh in Rafa uh we've
had people really fleeing um taking um
to the streets with all of their
possessions piling them up in carts and
in their cars and trying to find um a
place to stay further to the north uh
people heading to places that are
already crowded with displaced people
like uh hunis um and da balak um more in
the center of the Gaza Strip now um
really there has been so many
expressions of shock and an outrage of
what happened uh on Sunday night um the
Israeli Prime Minister called this a
tragic mishap um the Israeli military
says it's investigating what happened
there have been some reports in the US
media but quoting unnamed Israeli
officials suggesting that perhaps it
could have been some shrapnel um part of
the precise Munitions the Israeli
military says it was using there um that
ignited a fuel tank and caused this
catastrophic Blaze but Benjamin
Netanyahu also vowing to continue the
war against Hamas how much pressure is
he under from the International
Community versus at home from people
within his
government I mean look there's a huge am
ount of international pressure Israel
finds itself more and more isolated um
on the world stage after we had that
International court of justice ruling
last week um calling for an end to
military activities in Rafa of this
deadly strike that followed on um and
but domestically although we are seeing
continuing protests particularly um by
supporters and families of the hostages
still held by Hamas in Gaza people very
worried about the implications that all
of this could have um for efforts to try
to get uh new talks going indirectly
between Israel and Hamas on a new
ceasefire and hostage release deal um
but you know the the message from the
Israeli government has very much been
that Israel must protect its National
Security it sees Rafa as a stronghold um
of Hamas and says that its operations in
Rafa remain uh quite limited um it is
pushing we can see towards the West now

now and we begin with the Israel Gaza
war and there is growing condemnation of
an air strike near Rafa which
Palestinian officials say killed at
least 45 people including women and
children at a refugee camp an Israeli
government spokesman says the initial
findings of its investigation are that
an air strike against a Hamas compound
nearby set off a fire which killed the
Palestinian civilians the Palestinian
presiden in the occupied West Bank
described the strike as a massacre and
accused Israel of deliberately targeting
displaced people Egypt has also
condemned the attack and called on
Israel to implement the order by the
international court of justice to Halt
its military offensive in Rafa French
president Emanuel macron says he's
outraged by the Israeli strikes on Rafa
and Qatar also says it could hinder
reaching a ceasefire deal well it came
just hours after Hamas said it had
launched a rocket attack on Tel Aviv on
Sunday several were intercepted by air
defense systems according to the Israeli
military Dan Johnson has this
report this was Israel's air strike late
last night in southern Gaza it says
targeting senior Hamas figures with
Precision weapons but look what it did
to the nearby camp where thousands of
Palestinians were Sheltering Israel says
it was striking legitimate Targets in
line with international law
but many of these people had already
been uprooted many times through this
conflict suddenly we heard the sound of
a missile fatty says we ran and found
the street covered in Smoke we couldn't
see anything then we found a girl and a
young man who'd been blown to
Pieces women and children are among the
casualties here in what they believed
was a safe humanitarian
Zone this morning Israeli drones
surveyed the damage as people questioned
how this could
happen we heard a very loud sound and
saw fire the kids were screaming and all
the rooms surrounding us were made out
of metal sheets the sound was
terrifying we set up our tents here and
it has been targeted they killed our
children and burned our women and
elderly in the place they claimed was
safe this is our seventh time being
displaced earlier yesterday Hamas
reminded Israelis it remains a threat
Tel Aviv came under rocket attack for
the first time in months there are
questions over Israel's military
strategy and an international Court
ruling against it Israel continues the
military action that has been asked to
stop also Hamas is launching Rockets
against Israel so both sides doesn't
respect the ruling of the world Israel
says a review will examine this loss of
life but it's Palestinians who count
their dead and wonder where in Gaza they
can find
safety Dan Johnson reporting well ABI
Hyman is a spokesman for the Israeli
government he explained the objective of
the Israeli strike on Rafa what happened
last night sadly there is no moral
equivalence between the two things what
happened last night as we went after two
high value Hamas targets and it appears
from initial report
that somehow a fire broke out and that
was uh that sadly took the the lives of
others now I say it appears too because
it is under investigation and the IDF
investigates every uh every accident of
this of this nature to see what actually
happened well Shaina from the Norwegian
Refugee Council in Jerusalem expressed
shock at the strike in Rafa we are just
a shocked as everyone seeing the images
coming out of of Gaza late last night
and early this morning this is a clear
sign of why the the um implementation of
the icj's order last week on halting
military operations in Gaza is in Rafa
is so
necessary uh it's it's it's truly
unconscionable to think that that you
know it's almost eight months into this
we are still seeing images of of women
children civilians being targeted and
killed um in such a way the head of
gaza's largest United Nations agency
unra Philip lazarini says the strikes in
Rafa are a reminder that nowhere is safe
in Gaza I cannot comment on the
casualties because we haven't been able
to properly communicate with our team on
the ground I saw images they are deeply
disturbing and
horrifying um I think we have been clear
more than once there is no safe space in

Jerusalem okay let's speak now to Joe
ban who is the professor of Middle East
history at Stanford University in the
United States hello and welcome to the
program professor uh first off will this
ruling just the latest um against going
against Israel um in the past week make
any mark on their next
actions it won't make an immediate
difference because uh all of the Israeli
government officials who are responsible
decision makers have said clearly they
aren't going to obey the ruling uh so
whatever it says uh won't be uh make a
difference in the short run
so what is all this amounting to um you
know we had the ICC arrest warrants
we've now got this um we had the
Declaration by three countries um that
they would recognize it was Spain Norway
and Ireland isn't it that they would
unilaterally recognize a pal Palestine
state where is all this heading in the
long term so since October 7th we've
seen uh an accelerating Trend in the
International Community to really for
the first time uh take measures that
begin to hold Israel accountable uh
there's also the security Council
resolution that the United States
abstained on rather than veto so Israel
is becoming gradually more and more
isolated the United States to the extent
that it without reservation supports
Israel as it has been doing is also
becoming more and more isolated
in the medium to long run uh this will
ultimately impose serious constraints on
what Israel and the United States can
do um Algeria you mentioned the security
Council there Algeria of course the only
Arab State on the Security Council is
there anything that they could be doing
to push this matter
on they could be doing many things but
by and large most of the Arab
countries uh have never really uh stood
up to support Palestinian rights uh
Egypt uh Jordan Saudi Arabia are all
authoritarian Sunni states which are
effectively in an alignment with Israel
uh in a front against Iran and its
Regional proxies Hezbollah Hamas the
houthis in y
uh and that uh overrides uh all of the
popular sentiment that does exist very
broadly in the Arab world in support of
the Palestinian people what what would
override um Benjamin Netanyahu with his
insistence that he's not going to stop
what would stop him well Israel at least
for Jews is still a
democracy uh there were in the months
before the Hamas October 7th attack
demonstrations of hundreds of thousands
of Israelis every week uh demanding uh
ultimately that Netanyahu resign and
those demonstrations have in the last
month or so resumed and have uh become
quite large there'll be another one uh
tomorrow evening uh as well uh or well
actually it's this evening if you're in
your uh Saturday evening uh there's some
possibility that that kind of public
pressure uh will uh erode the legitimacy
of the government and force an early

um the jurisdiction of the Court can
they enforce this not really Clive no
it's not as if there's a world police
force out there to to go and execute a
warrant look South Africa asked for a
lot more than it actually got here so
while this is is chalking this up as a
victory if you actually look at the
wording it only applies to um Rafa
nowhere else in Gaza and there's
actually room in here for Israel to
actually effectively appease the courts
because the court says hold the military
offensive there if it may may bring
about the physical destruction of the
Palestinians so in essence it's saying
if you've got other military options go
for those on the enforceability the
Practical route for South Africa if
nothing happens is to go to the UN and
try and get a security Council vote but
then of course that becomes political
the US has a a block there so in reality
this is where law and diplomacy rubs up
and the court has tried to P pull off a
balancing act it stopped shorts Yes
again I'm talking about this being
genocide it's trying to find the

where judges at the international court
of justice that's the United Nations Top
Court have just ruled that Israel must
immediately halt its military offensive
and other actions in Rafa citing the
immediate risk to the Palestinian people
it also ruled that Hamas must
immediately and unconditionally release
its hostages let's listen to what the
judge who was speaking in the past half
an hour had to say the court recalls
that in ordance with article 75
paragraph 2 of its rules when a request
for the indication of provisional
measures has been made it has the power
under its statute to indicate measures
that are not in whole or in part other
than those
requested in the present case having
considered the terms of the provisional
measures requested by South Africa and
the circumstances of the case the court
found that the measures to be indicated
need not be identical to those
requested the court considered that in
Conformity with obligations under the
genocide convention Israel must
immediately hold its military offensive
and any other action in the Rafa
Governor which may inflict on the
Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of
life that could bring about its physical
destruction in whole or in part
the court records that it that in its
order of January 26
2024 it ordered Israel inter area to I
quote take effective measures to prevent
the destruction and ensure the
preservation of evidence related to
allegations of Acts within the scope of
Article 2 and article 3 of the genocide
convention end of
quote in the present
circumstances the court is also of The
View that in order to preserve evidence
related to allegations of Acts falling
within the scope of Article 2 and
article 3 of the genocide convention
Israel must take effective measures to
ensure the unimpeded access to the Gaza
Strip of any Commission of inquiry fact
finding Mission or ever investigative
body mandated by competent organs of the
United ations to investigate allegations
of
genocide the judge there the icj just to
give you some initial responses uh David
Mera spokesperson for the Israeli
government has said there is no power in
the world that will push us to commit a
public suicide because that's what this
is to stop our war against Hamas that's
repeating a line that of course a
consistent line that we've heard from
the Israeli government who I think are
meeting now there was a call for Mr
Netanyahu to meet um his top ministers
and Hamas um as reported by the Reuters
news agency has said that they welcome
the icj plan to send the investigation
committee into Gaza they say they would
promise any cooperation that they can
give um and they have said that they
welcome the decision on Rafa saying it
doesn't go far enough it's urging an end
for Israel's offensive on all of Gaza
and looking at uh whether the security
Council will now look to try and
implement this ruling well let's get
more now our diplomatic correspondent
Paul Adams is in Jerusalem and he told
us more about the immediate reaction
there in Israel if this was the The
Measure that was
anticipated uh uh with some debate as to
whether or not the court would finally
uh take that additional step uh no uh
reaction official reaction from the
government so far it's due to discuss
this ruling uh later today uh there is a
reaction from the Hardline Finance
Minister uh itar benav who has called it
irrelevant and ant and he's dismissed
the court as anti-semitic these are the
sorts of remarks you would expect to
hear from some of Mr netanyahu's more
Hardline colleagues uh but when it comes
to uh the order to uh to Halt the rough
or offensive I think we can expect uh a
big fat no from the government here uh
and I think they will probably complain
that the court uh in coming to its
conclusions only cited what the the UN
had told them about the situation uh in
southern Gaza the Israelis have been
arguing for some time that they are
taking steps not withstanding their
military operation in Gaza that they are
taking steps to improve the provision of
food and goods into the Gaza Strip it's
very noticeable for example that for the
three weeks or so after uh after May the
7th when the order to uh to launch the
offensive in
began only about 140 trucks of un Aid
entered through the Karen Shalom
crossing the most important crossing
point from Israel but and this was
something the court did not refer to
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
trucks of commercial uh food stuffs have
gone in through that very same route
allowed in by Israel escorted by uh
armed guards inside the Gaza Strip and
taken into the the marketplace in Gaza
there is food to be had in places a lot
of gazans can't afford it but that was
an element of Israel's response to uh
the situation uh in Gaza that the court
uh simply didn't allude to they also
obviously did not allude to Israel's
military rationale for attacking Gaza
the complete dismantling of the last uh
remaining battalions of Hamas and the
importance Israel would say of securing
the the border between Gaza and Egypt to
prevent the smuggling of weapons uh
which could lead to a future conflict
now all of this was was was was not
referred to by the court the court
obviously feels that of in excess of
800,000 people we think it's probably
closer to a million by now uh is
evidence of the increased risk uh to
life and and well-being of a huge
portion of the Palestinian population of
the Gaza Strip and that was enough to
persuade those judges who had not been
persuaded so far to say enough is enough
this operation has to stop Paul Adams
there speaking to us a bit earlier uh
from Jerusalem and just to let you know
that since we SP Paul um David mener
who's a spokesperson for the Israeli
government um did give some reaction to
the news uh to the BBC and he said there
is no power in the world that will push
us to commit a public suicide because
that's what this is to stop our war
against Hamas uh we understand the
Israeli government are meeting or going
to be meeting soon to discuss this
ruling uh We've also had reports on
Reuters of Hamas reaction Hamas
apparently calling on the UN Security
Council to implement the icj court of
justice decision welcoming the ruling
and uh welcoming the call for an
investigation an inquiry saying that
they would cooperate with that also
we've had a response from the
Palestinian authorities saying they
welcome the decision as again reported
by Reuters um news agency saying that it
represents an international consensus to
end the war on the Gaza Strip um
according to a Palestinian presidential
spokesperson we will keep you across all
the reaction of course we're going to be
looking to the US to see uh what the
White House say whether this has any
impact on Biden's current position of
ongoing support for Israel though of
course he has warned repeatedly uh the
Israeli leadership not to go into uh

murdered by Kamas while escaping the

their bodies were taken into Gaza
Israel's Army is fighting in areas to
the South and center of Gaza and jabalia
to the north where it says it found this
Hamas Arsenal with its stockpile of
heavy weapons this Hamas video released
today weeks after Israel said the area
was
cleared in the South Aid routes into
Gaza have been largely blocked by
Israel's operation in Rafa the UN says
more than half a million people have
fled seeking safety sh delter and food
today the first test of a new pier and
modular Causeway built by us and British
forces to get Aid in a Lifeline for Gaza
to relieve the pressure on local
populations and distant
politicians un L's waited on gaza's
Shore to receive the shipment temporary
shelter kits from the UK alongside aid
from the US and United Arab Emirates
welcome it we we hope that it can be
effectively scaled up but it is no
substitute for a proper opening of
borders it's expensive and it's
inefficient but we hope that it will
work but the new pier was little comfort
for some of those watching from the
shore they want to bring us food they
should bring us back to our homes they
should stop the Bloodshed they should
come and see how we're living on the
streets Israel's allies are taking on
gaza's growing humanitarian crisis with
a $300 million response that will Salve
not solve Lucy Williamson BBC News
Jerusalem so that's the latest from the
Middle East but what does the future of
Gaza look like in the short and the
longer term well I've been talking to
the Palestinian ambassador to the United
Nations Riyad mansur and asked him how
he sees the political future of a
postwar
Gaza how do you see the future of Gaza
this war will have to end one day what
is the political future of Gaza when the
war is over in your
view the first thing that we need to do
and that that is our top priority and
the top priority of the Arabs the
Muslims the nonaligned movement all
peace loving people is to stop this
Carnage and this aggression and this war
against our people to save lives to send
food and medicine and water and
humanitarian assistance to scale as
suggested by the Secretary General of
the UN and to stop the crime against
humanity of the forced transfer and for
the isra occupying forces to withdraw
from Gaza once we have these things put
in place
we will be able to devote our thinking
and our energies into what need to be
done to rebuild Gaza and to put life
back together in the Gaza Strip but
surely you need to be thinking about
that now that future for Gaza you need
to be thinking about that now we know
you the Palestinian Authority F have had
talks with Hamas in Moscow about a kind
of unified approach would you work in
government with Hamas despite what they
did on October
7th our government you know declared you
know from the beginning of this
aggression that the uh uh we have one
unified one government that is
responsible for the Affairs of the
Palestinian people in the O occupied
part of uh the state of Palestine
including the Gaza Strip the West Bank
and East Jerusalem and in in fact
significant portion of the budget of the
Palestinian National Authority is being
spent all the time to uh the uh the the
employees of the National Authority in
the Gaza Strip and it never stopped and
it continued to uh to to take place
including during these seven months of
aggression against our people so that's
that's in terms of the responsibility in
terms of the detail
it is very difficult to put anything in
place as long as there is uh Israeli
occupying forces uh still in uh in in uh
occupied Gaza Strip they need to be
removed we need to assess and evaluate
the massive amount of damage to the
infrastructure and to the life of our
people in the Gaza Strip and to see how
we can mobilize resources in order to
take uh to be a ble to implement the
Monumental task of the government of Dr
Muhammad Mustafa which he announced you
know in his speech as to the plan of the
new government of the State of Palestine
as it relate to the Gaza Strip can I ask
you about that moment that extraordinary
moment we had at the United Nations a
few days ago when the UN General
Assembly voted to support the
Palestinian bids to become a full un
member um which would effectively
recognize ultimately uh a Palestinian
State Israel reacted with Fury its
Ambassador said the UN Charter had just
been shredded uh and that Winston
Churchill would be turning in his grave
um what did you think of that moment and
what was its significance do you
think Winston churcher would be so upset
from the arrogance of uh an individual
representing a government that is
committing genocide against the
Palestinian people in insulting the
charter the charter of the United
Nations was created by Humanity after
the horrors of World War II and it is
the obligation of all member states of
the United Nations to honor it and to
respect it and not to shred it as he did
and the insult to everyone in the
chamber including the government of the
UK when he addressed all of us as being
the enemy of the Jewish people or
against the Jewish people such Behavior
should not be tolerated and those who
utter these words are in essence are
telling us that they do not belong to to
secure a seat in the general assembly
all these issues will come in time if
that behavior to continue the United
Nations and the general assembly was
responsible for the creation of the
state of Israel itself and they should
be grateful for that behavior not to
come and insult everyone and to shred to
Pieces the charter of the UN this is a
Despicable behavior and Those who commit
such Behavior should be held accountable
you you just alleged that Israel is
committing genocide Israel has denied
that of emphatically it says that claim
is morally repugnant its lawyer at the
international court of justice says
there is a tragic War but no genocide
and that claim is completely divorced
from the facts that's what Israel
says well Israel says many things that
it is divorced from the facts and it is
totally isolated as we see it in the
security Council and in the general
assembly and as to you know that the uh
the uh subject of genocide uh the icj is
deliberating on these issues and it was
not accident for the icj to order six
provisional measures to be put in place
and that is mandatory in accordance with
all those who belong to the convention
in uh in uh stopping you know genocide
and against genocide and Israel did not
Implement uh these provisional measures
and you know now as we speak the icj is
listening to South Africa and to Israel
with regard you know to uh uh revisit
the issue of genocide and I believe that
the icj will put in place a new set of
provisional measures and Israel has to
abide by them and the new measures would
be related to among other things to uh
you know to stop Israel from storming
Rafa and committing you know genocide
against the Palestinian civilian
population in that City",20240517

pressure is growing on Israel to let
more Aid into Gaza Washington is urging
Israel to do more to provide sustained
humanitarian access officials say
they're deeply concerned about reports
of imminent famine they've called for
the Raffa Crossing to be reopened as
soon as possible Egypt stopped allowing
in supplies after Israel seized control
of the Gaza side the two countries have
blamed each other for its continued
closure speaking at a news conference
the White House Press Secretary Karen G
Pierre said more needed to be done so
this level of Aid remains insufficient
and we want to continue to press uh
Israel to increase the level of
assistant moving into
Gaza we understand what I just laid out
is not sufficient we want to get more in
We are continuing to have those
conversation with Israel and we have
seen some progress we need to get more
in the US concern over the amount of Aid
getting into The Enclave has been echoed
by the UN their aid Chief War that
famine is now an immediate threat and
that un staff were struggling to help
people displaced by the Israeli
offensive in Rafa the facts on the
ground tell us we don't need to be
scientists to see the the consequence of
of the removal of food and you know also
for famine particularly the removal of
medical care and nutritional care which
is the the precursor to you know famine
kills through disease um as well as
hunger the Israeli Prime Minister has
doubled down on the importance of a
military campaign in Rafa Benjamin
Netanyahu was shown flying over the Gaza
Strip with Military Officers his
comments come after a very public spat
with his defense minister yoav Gallant
over the future of Gaza he was speaking
during a visit to soldiers at a military
base the battle for Rafa is critical
it's not just the rest of their
battalions it's also their oxygen pipes
for escape and resupply this battle of
which you are an integral part is a
battle that decides many things in this
campaign I repeat we are in a critical
battle now your action helps to end it
we can speak now to our correspondent
Dan Johnson who's in Jerusalem and we
say the pressure is mounting John Dan
just tell us what um the US has been
saying yeah the US is calling for the
land borders into Gaza to be reopened to
ease access for Aid particularly for
food and for fuel there is some positive
news in that the uh emergency temporary
floating dock that has been constructed
by the US military will soon be ready to
accept Aid via the sea and there are
already deliveries sailing from Cyprus
towards Gaza but the message is that
that shouldn't be relied upon solely to
deliver Aid to Gaza now that the most
important and effective routs are the
land Crossings to all allow trucks
through to deliver food and to bring
fuel so that that food can be
effectively appropriately distributed
throughout Gaza to the Palestinian
refugees who need it and the warning
from the UN is that 2.4 million refugees
are now on the brink of impending famine
if more food doesn't get through and
can't be distributed uh effectively so
that is the call for Israel to reopen
particularly the Rafa Crossing but that
of course has been difficult because of
the intensification of Israeli military
operations in that area over the last
week or more now and what about today
then we've got Israel making its case at
the icj responding to these accusations
from South Africa what can we expect
today yes this is a further stage in
South Africa's submissions to the
international court of justice uh
calling effectively for a halt to the
Israeli military operations uh in Rafa
the earlier case that started at the
beginning of the year accused Israel of
genocide and that wider case is still
going on but South Africa's been able to
bring an emergency motion uh calling for
the uh the operation the military
conduct around Rafa to be suspended
because of the impact that that is
having on Palestinian refugees hundreds
of thousands who've been uprooted in the
last week or 10 days by the military
operation there and these were people in
the main who had already been forced
from their homes earlier in this
conflict people who'd moved to Rafa in
in seek of shelter and safety and they
are people who are now on the move again
and are wondering where is safe where
they will be able to find shelter and
food because of the desperate situation
and the lack of safe options Israel will
make its submissions in defense of its
case to the icj later this morning okay
well thanks very much for now that's Dan
Johnson reporting to us live from

right across what's going on at the icj

Africa is asking the un's highest court
to instruct Israel to stop its offensive
in Rafa these are live pictures from the
international court of justice the
hearing is the latest intervention by
the South African government in its
legal case against Israel it says as
well as direct military attacks Israel
is starving Palestinians in Gaza by
obstructing access to deliveries of food
Fuel and medicines Israel has insisted
it is acting in accordance with with
international law it has dismissed the
South African case as a baseless blood
Lial South Africa's legal team have been
outlining their case and have accused
Israel of breaching the Court's previous
orders with impunity Israel is
escalating its attacks on Palestinians
in Gaza and in so doing is willfully
breaching The Binding orders of this
court Israel similarly breaches The
Binding resolutions of the United
Nations security Council
erroneously believing from the lack of
counter
measures by the International Community
that it is exempt from having to respect
international law we've heard assurances
that Israel was doing everything in its
power to avoid civilian deaths as it
exercised its claimed right of
self-defense we've heard
boasts that Israel's Army is the most
moral Army in history
and we've heard denials that there is
famine in Gaza for
months people particularly in the west
have appeared unwilling to accept that
the accusations are true how could
people who look like us and sound like
us possibly engage in anything like
genocide we'll listen into more of those
proceedings in just a moment first let's
get the latest from our correspondent
Anna hollan who is at the ha and
following all the developments there for
us Anna welcome to you just remind us
first of all why South Africa is
bringing this
case any country that's a member of the
genocide convention has a responsibility
to ensure there are no violations of
that con uh convention that's one but uh
secondly South Africa sees parallels
between aparte South Africa and the
situation that Palestinians in Gaza are
facing right now we're an hour into this
hearing
uh and as you heard there South Africa's
legal team have been laying out their
arguments they're basically asking for
the judges here at the un's highest
court the world Court as it's often
referred to to issue three emergency
measures you can't hear any protesters
this time round although it's the fourth
time uh South Africa has made this
request to the court for an order for
Israel to cease hostilities uh and to
immediately withdraw um but that's
because this hearing was held so uh so
quickly uh which is an indication of how
seriously the judges here are taking
this so as well as uh asking the court
to order Israel to immediately withdraw
from Rafa um the South African legal
team have said that uh un investigators
humanitarian Aid organizations and
journalists must be allowed in to ensure
the provision of food water medical
supplies but also uh so that if there
are any violations of the genocide
convention taking place that evidence
can be gathered for any future trials
they've also asked the judges to order
that Israel report back to the court
within uh a week on how it's
implementing any measures I just want to
give you some of the detail though that
we've heard in court um from the lawyers
for South Africa so uh lawyer vau Jones
said uh vau low said Israel's actions in
Rafa are part of the end game this is
the last step in the destruction of Gaza
uh they also talked about aparte and
also made a link between what's
happening now in Rafa and what happened
in serin in so far as Rafa is being seen
as the last safe zone for Palestinians
in Gaza and South Africa says if Rafa
isn't protected it will make it very
difficult if not impossible to rebuild
Gaza and preserve Palestinian life in
Gaza now and in the future Israel of
course we should say will have a chance
to defend itself in court tomorrow H it
will also have two hours um Israel's
legal team is in in court uh you can
probably hear the rumble of engines
outside uh the the peace Palace now
waiting to take people away this is a
hugely contentious case it's probably
the most sensitive case the icj has ever
dealt with which is why it's generating
so much attention and South Africa has
said there is no other option um this is
is the Last Hope and that's why they are
applying to judges here at the icj to
issue these uh emergency measures to
protect the Palestinian life in in Gaza
okay Anna thank you well let's listen in
now to those proceedings a lawyer for
South Africa is making further arguments
story of every Palestinian who is
suffering at the hands of Israel's
Relentless genocidal
campaign indeed this court has held in
Bosnian
genocide that
quote it is
sufficient to examine those facts that
would illuminate the question of intent
or illustrate the claim by the applicant
of a pattern of Acts committed against
members of the group such as to lead to
an inference from such pattern of the
existence of a specific
intent end
quote in these submissions I show show
that Israel's genocidal acts against
Palestinians in Rafa form part of a
continuing escalating pattern of conduct
across
Gaza that provides persuasive and
consistent evidence of Israel's
genocidal
conduct in light of these new facts
South Africa seeks an order from the
court the only order
that will clearly protect what is left
of Palestinian life in Gaza it seeks an
explicit order that Israel cease its
militaries military
activities not only in Rafa but
throughout
Gaza turning then to the genocidal
acts in my remaining time before you I
will highlight the following features of
the genocidal campaign by
Israel
first Israel has continued to kill
Palestinians in Gaza including women and
children at an alarming
rate second as a result of Israel's
Onslaught Palestinians in Gaza are
facing what the under Secretary General
of the UN has described as the worst
humanitarian crisis he had seen for more
than 50
years
third Israel's systematic targeting and
bombardment of hospitals and medical
facilities and its throttling of
humanitarian Aid has pushed gaza's
medical system to
collapse fourth Israel's direct
attack and Siege of gaza's biggest
hospitals has led to the uncovering of
mass Graves evidencing Israeli massacres
of Palestinians seeking
shelter and medical
treatment
finally most recently Israel has
intensified its attacks in the north
while pressing on with its rougher
offensive leaving displaced Palestinians
nowhere safe to go
I will take these in
turn the first feature of the genocidal
conduct
killing since South Africa appeared
before the court on 11 January
2024 at least
11,500 Palestinians have been directly
killed by
Israel the majority of these casualties
are of women and children in an enclave
where nearly 50% of the population are
children this Onslaught has occurred
despite the binding orders issued by
this court and The Binding Security
Council
resolution on 25 March
2024 demanding an immediate ceasefire
for the month of Ramadan
in fact as UNICEF pointed out a double
digigit number of children were killed
within hours of that
resolution two mothers and four children
are killed every
hour unra head Philipe lazarini
says there are no words left that can do
any justice to the people people of
Gaza the numbers of dead and injured
defy
comprehension at least 35,000
Palestinians killed and 79,000 injured
with 10,000 more reportedly missing or
under the
rubble up to 1.7 million
displaced most multiple
times and More than 70% of all housing
stock in Gaza and more than 80% in parts
of Northern Region damaged or
destroyed that's where we are going to
leave proceedings at the international
court of justice just a reminder that
Israel will have its turn to respond
tomorrow if you'd like to continue
watching that coverage just head to our
websites you'll find our live page on
the case and there you can watch the

says five of its soldiers were killed
when they were mistakenly fired on by
one of its tanks in Northern Gaza two
shells were fired at paratroopers in
jabalia these images show the aftermath
of an Israeli strike in jabalia Israeli
ground forces re-entered the area
earlier this month with more his our
correspondent Dan Johnson in
Jerusalem we know that five soldiers
from the IDF lost their lives yesterday
in the north of Gaza this is in jabalia
an area that the Israeli military has
had to return to having previously
declared it cleared of Hamas Fighters
earlier in this conflict around January
they completed military operations in
that area but have had to go back there
in the last few days and that's raised a
question over the sustainability of
Israel's military strategy here whether
they are actually able to sustainably
clear out Hamas for good and that is
something that is now playing out at the
top of Israeli government we have the
defense minister yav Galant challenging
the prime minister to set out a clear
plan for how Gaza will be governed once
the military operation is over and if I
show you the front pages of some of the
Israeli press this morning you've got
yav Galant and prime minister Netanyahu
there the headline says this is no way
to run a war and on this paper you've
got a headline saying that a military
government in Gaza would mean only blood
and sacrifices without purpose you've
got the Jerusalem Post there saying
Galant slam Netanyahu indecisiveness on
Gaza and the defense minister said he'd
been asking for these assurances
repeatedly since October but the Prime
Minister had not been able to lay out
any clear plan of how the Palestinian
people in Gaza would be governed after
the military operation concludes there
are questions about who will represent
them how will they rebuild their
infrastructure what will the role of the
Israelis other nations and international
organizations be prime minister
netanyahu's response to that challenge
yesterday was just to say say that his
priority right now is to eradicate Hamas
and that he would not consider any sort
of Deal or power sharing arrangement
with the Palestinian Authority who he
considered to be supportive of terrorism
so that question remains open in the
meantime there is this division at the
top of Israeli politics which has now
led to some in the government calling
for the defense minister yab Galant to
be sacked from his role yeah
interestingly there another member of
the war cabinet Benny Gant in support of
what Mr glamp
said yes there has been support he's
been defended by Benny gance others
calling for him to go saying that the
defense minister failed on October the
7th that he' continued to fail and that
he should now be removed from his
position so the focus now is on how
Benjamin Netanyahu responds to that will
he keep Mr Galant in his position he
tried to sack him a year ago before the
October the 7th attacks and there were
Mass Street protests that erupted then
that meant uh Mr Galant was able to stay
in his role there's a suggestion here
that his position in calling for a clear
plan is puts him in closer alignment
with what the Americans want to see and
everyone seems to accept that once the
military operation is over Benjamin
netanyahu's future doesn't look like it
can continue at the top of Israeli
politics so perhaps this is Mr Gant
positioning himself with the Americans
as a future Prime Minister not just to
conclude the war but then to lay out a
future for Gaza Dan Johnson reporting

Israel to avoid a major military
operation in Rafa we still believe it is
would be a mistake to launch a major
military operation Into the Heart of

civilians at risk without a clear
strategic gain the president was clear
that he would not supply certain
offensive weapons for such an operation
were it to occur it is not yet occurred

a better way to ensure the defeat of
Hamas everywhere in Gaza including in
Rafa well let's go live to Jerusalem and
our correspondent Dan Johnson Dan um
we've had news that a un Aid worker has
been killed what more do we know about
that yes we know a un vehicle was hit
yesterday uh containing at least two un
Aid workers one of them killed one of
them injured we don't know a huge amount
about who they are or what the
circumstances of this incident was
whether that was an air strike or if
that vehicle was engaged by Ground
Forces there is video that shows a
marked un vehicle that's had its Windows
shot out now whether that's the the
vehicle that we're talking about we're
still waiting for confirmation the
incident's been condemned by the uh
Secretary General Antonio gutterz who
sent his condolences to the families of
those involved and highlighted the risks
that un and other Aid work workers are
facing in Gaza more than 190 un Aid
workers have been killed now since uh
October he's called for a full
investigation and Israel Defense Forces
are conducting that review of exactly
what happened in this incident they say
the early indications are that this
vehicle was in an area of active combat
and that its position its route hadn't
been notified to the IDF so that is
perhaps how this incident occurred but
we'll have to wait for more information
but one Aid worker killed another one
injured yesterday there have been
disruption to aid supplies coming into
Gaza as well with some Israeli
protesters yesterday blockading trucks
that were heading from Jordan through
the West Bank trying to take aid
supplies into Gaza that's been an issue
they want to highlight the ongoing
plight of the hostages who are still
being held by Hamas in Gaza and of
course the fighting continues we know
that there's been an operation around
raford but also Israel targeting jamalia
in the north what do we know about that
operation yeah we've seen an
intensification of the military buildup
around Rafa over the last week in
particular but then yesterday we saw
tanks moving back into areas in Northern
Gaza areas that had been declared
cleared and free of Hamas terrorists
just earlier uh this year so the fact
that the Israel Defense Forces are going
back in there raises a question about
whether Hamas has been able to rebuild
its strength repopulate battalions in
that area and now how the IDF is is
going to deal with that and what further
destruction that will cause what further
upheaval that will mean for Palestinians
uh who've gone back into that area
believing that it was safe believing
that military operations had uh
concluded there and this brings into
question whether Israel's strategy to
drive out Hamas is actually sustainable
in the long run huge questions a huge
risk to the civilian population of Gaza
more than 20% of gaza's population is
now estimated to have been uh uprooted
and moved again just within the last
week that is hundreds of thousands of
people who were already without homes
and are now without a safe place to
shelter enormous issues uh to be
considered on the day that Israel is
marking 76 years of Independence 76
years since the creation of the modern
Jewish State yes and on that I assume
there have been subdued commemorations
this
year yes the Prime Minister said this
was not a normal Independence Day
because the country is engaged in
Conflict there are still hostages being
held by Hamas families calling for their
safe return there are uh IDF soldiers
who are still involved in combat even
today so the normal events are not being
marked in the same way there is a somber
mood to this Independence Day and the

Powell died of wound sustained in an

was asked about the claim on Sunday with
Laura cburg like everyone else I watched
the video on
Twitter X last night put out by Hamas of
nadav answering a question as to who he
was and I watched that video and you
just think what you know
callous people they are to do that to
play with the family's emotions in that
way I I've met nf's family his sister
and I know the Heartbreak they've been
going through for over 200 days and when
you see what Hamas are prepared to do
you just realize uh the the the Terrible
Dreadful inhuman people frankly that we
are dealing
with the UK foreign secretary well our
diplomatic correspondant Paul Adams is
in
Jerusalem these were claims that emerged
yesterday when Hamas as it has done
repeatedly throughout this crisis
released a video uh in which they said
that nadav Powell who's 51 uh was killed
in an Israeli air strike now we have
absolutely no way of verifying that we
don't know when the video that they
released yesterday was shot uh we need
to be extremely careful about any
assertions that Hamas is making about
the circumstances uh surrounding uh his
death or indeed whether indeed nadav
poell is dead but that is what Hamas
said we know that his brother was killed
on October the 7th they were both uh
attacked uh on October the 7th their
mother was also abducted but she was
released uh later in the first of the uh
uh ceasefire hostage
negotiations uh the foreign office as
you say is looking into this but this is
this kind of goes to the heart of one of
the issues that still divides uh Israel
and Hamas during these tortuous
negotiations aimed at getting a
ceasefire organized which is how many
Israeli hostages and dual National
hostages are there how many are still
alive how many are dead
uh over the months tragically the number
of uh dead hostages has risen while the
expectations for the number of live
hostages has uh diminished somewhat um
and this is uh a very live issue because
the Israelis want much more clarity
about what they can expect from Hamas in
terms of the release of hostages alive
and dead in return for a ceasefire deal
Paul will await uh any more comments
from or any comments from the UK foreign
office as it investigates those Hamas
claims about the British Israeli hostage
just in terms of the evacuations itself
uh of course Flyers are being dropped
where are Palestinians being told to
move
to they're consistently being told to go
uh West Northwest to the almasi area
which is an area along the coast an area
that the Israelis identified right at
the beginning of this C campaign as uh a
safe secure humanitarian Zone uh and
some of them are going further north uh
to some of the middle uh areas of the
Gaza Strip either way they are going to
places that are profoundly unsuitable uh
for human habitation uh there are no
Provisions for them when they get there
no one is setting up tent encampments
for them there is no water no sanitation
getting food and other Aid to them is
increasingly difficult uh we now
estimate that or at least following the
Israeli announcement last night that
300,000 people have uh heeded Israeli
warnings to leave that I would say
something close to a quarter of the
population that have been craned into
Rafa in recent months are now on the
move and that is just adding to the
enormous pressure uh on those areas
almasi and the middle part part of the
Gaza Strip uh with parts of Rafa now
becoming something of a ghost town so
many people went down from the northern
part and then from Han Yunis to Rafa uh
over the months huge tent cities sprang
up along the Rafa border with Egypt some
of those 10 encampments are now uh
emptying and emptying fast as people who
have moved three four five times already
uh feel that they're going to have to
move again soon and they're not waiting
for the Israeli military to arrive
they're packing up and they're leaving
because they've seen it all
before so that was Paul Adams and I want
to pick up with some of the points that
he made with our guest Isabella tiira
who's a humanitarian media specialist at
action Aid UK and I know Isabella your
organization is supporting people in
Rafa just talk us through what people
who have been leaving uh Rafa have been
telling your people on the ground there
well thank you for having me um yeah I
mean right now in Rafa there is just
absolute fear and confusion and panic on
the ground um hundreds of thousands of
people have already um fled these are
people who've had to flee carrying their
belongings under a scorching hot sun not
knowing where they can go that is safe
that they can um you know start a new
life for themselves um remember most of
these people have had to flee multiple
times we're talking five six seven times
already um our teams on the ground have
spoken to some people who have arrived
in Dera Bala which is one of the um
so-called safe zones um they've
described absolutely horrendous Journeys
um traveling by bus while you know
bombardments um took place all around
them um they've talked about arriving in
darala and you know
having more scenes of chaos um greeting
them basically with none of the kind of
Essentials that they need one man told
us that he was trying to um build a tent
for him and himself and his disabled
mother and he was you know unable to
Source the materials he needed because
there were they were so limited in
supplying the prices had gone up so much
so I mean really the situation is just
utterly utterly dire right now um and
there's just so much
uncertainty so these areas that you
described one de alala of course Al
maasi Han yunice they're being described
as humanitarian zones but in your
opinion they don't account for that abs
absolutely not I mean these are places
that were already you know before these
latest evacuations began were already
completely overcrowded Al Moi which is a
tiny strip of land which is mostly
sandunes um was already home to about
400,000 people um there just isn't the
infrastructure to accommodate all these
new arrivals there's no one to meet them
there's no one
to there's there's nothing basically to
give them you know it's absolutely dire
um yeah Isabella in terms of action a in
terms of your organization how does it
operate under these circumstances on the
ground where there is so much
need I mean as always we're doing
everything we can but there is just such
difficult circumstances and things are
changing day to day I mean we've had
some of our colleagues and partners
already had to flee Rafa so even in the
last few days the situation has changed
so quickly but I mean right now the the
situation with um getting and
distributing Aid is just incredibly
incredibly difficult ult I mean in Rafa
right now Rafa remember is the main area
through which um Aid arrives two of the
main Aid Crossings are located in Rafa
um one of these the Rafa Rafa Crossing
is um still closed um the other uh has
kamam Shalom has opened uh but Aid is
not able to be um delivered through that
Crossing because of the kind of
intensity of the fighting and because
it's just so dangerous right now um so
the humanity humanitarian situation in
Raa which was already you know
incredibly on a knife edge is just
deteriorating um by the minute really I
mean the Health Care system has all but
collapsed one of the main hospitals in
Rafa had to evacuate um earlier this
week that leaves just two smaller um
hospitals and a few other medical
facilities which are you know warning
that they are running out of fuel um you
know due due to the sustained lack of
Aid people in rraa are you know they're
starving they're hungry they don't have
enough um water um 10% of children under
the age of two are acutely malnourished
I mean it really is an incredibly dire
situation and there's you know Aid
organizations like ours are doing
everything they can but it's it's it's
incredibly incredibly difficult Isabella
to thank you very much for just uh
outlining the conditions of the are your
team operating there across Gaza from
action a UK thank you very much well
there is much more on this story story

Palestinians have left the city of Rafa
since Monday when Israel told them to
move to a nearby District of Gaza the
Israelis have declared a narrow Coastal
strip at alasi to be a safe humanitarian
Zone but the UN says it has no running
water or proper sanitation Israel is
planning an assault on Hamas fighters in
Rafa and has ordered tens of thousands
more residents from Eastern districts of
the city to leave evacuation orders have
also been issued for thousands of people
in parts of Northern Gaza last night a
long awaited US Government report
criticized Israel's use of American
supplied weapons in the Gaza War saying
it's reasonable to assess they have been
used in breach of international
humanitarian law in some instances this
reports from our Middle East
correspondent your land
now now a ghost Town parts of Rafa that
were crammed full of people just days
ago are rapidly emptying out
Palestinians fleeing in their thousands
as Israel signals it's now set to push
in further from the East issuing new
evacuation
orders there's no choice we have to go
to the coast like everyone else Ahmed
says Israeli air strikes and artillery
shelling have caused panic and
Palestinian casualties
Israel says it's taking action against
Hamas in one of its last strongholds
here attacking a launch site for Rockets
fired at an Israeli
city but with Israel's capture of one
main border crossing and another blocked
off by fighting this is the fifth day
with no Aid getting into Southern Gaza
there are severe shortages of food clean
water and fuel deepening the
humanitarian crisis so far Israel's
military is describing its offensive in
Rafa as limited but the world is
watching to see if this turns into the
full scale Invasion that the country's
allies have warned against and as
Israeli tanks and troops await orders
near the Gaza border there's been
another strong statement from Washington
it says that with some of its strikes on
Gaza such as this attack on a
residential building late last year
reportedly killing over 100 people many
of them children in Israel may have used
American supplied weapons in breach of
international law Israel has
consistently denied any
violations and yet the new report May
yet have an impact on plans back here in
Rafa where there's already a growing
sense of emergency yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem and your land yoland joins me
live now from Jerusalem your land what
more can you tell us are there any fresh
updates as evening approaches in
Gaza well we've had the Israeli military
talking about how its forces have been
involved they say in face-to-face combat
in the areas around Rafa saying too that
there were four Rockets fired towards
the Kem Shalom Crossing in the
Southeastern corner of the Gaza Strip uh
where AID has been unable to get through
um for the past few days and we've had
the Israeli military too saying that
across the whole of the Gaza Strip and
the past day it has carried out dozens
of strikes um these have not just been
in Rafa but also in the center of the
Gaza Strip where funeral has been taking
place for some 25 people who were killed
in an air strike overnight Palestinian
Health officials saying that at least 37
people were killed in the latest uh air
strikes um we know too that the Israeli
military has been issuing evacuation
orders for tens of thousands of people
in other parts of the Gaza Strip in the
north uh particularly in the area of
jabalia and that's significant because
this is an area that Israeli forces
previously withdrew from now this could
be a sign that Palestinian armed groups
are moving back and that they're
planning to return there they're
planning to return there yes what more
could we expect from the Israeli
military because obviously we saw
earlier in the week when it issued some
orders for people in eastern Gaza it
then sent ground troops into those areas
um what can we expect to
happen I mean I mean the US assessment a
couple of days ago was that what was
happening in Rafa remained um a limited
um more precise operation not the
fullscale ground Invasion which there's
been uh so much concern about even we
can see though at the moment it's still
causing this new humanitarian crisis in
the south of the Gaza Strip what is
happening at the moment um but really
you know all eyes are are on the borders
to see if there are going to be more
forces uh Crossing in if this is going
to be a complete ground invasion of Rafa
um you know previously we've had Israeli
leaders saying that this is something
that needs to happen in order for Israel
to be able to declare a full Victory um
over Hamas in this war and to try to
bring home Israeli
hostages and uh and your land of course
all eyes are on the alasi area where now
nearly 300,000 people I believe to have
moved to what kind of a humanitarian
situation is there of course since the
War Began there have been serious
concerns about the provision of basic
services on that part of the Gaza
[Music]
Strip yes the Israeli military calls
this a safe Zone says it's recently uh
been expanded but you know un agencies
say really it's anything but uh people
there have not been protected from the
fighting and because you know
humanitarian supplies are so restricted
anyway um they have not got uh in that
location these Sandy Junes uh really
close to the the beach um o of the Gaza
Strip um proper uh sanitation proper
Water Supplies still the same severe
shortages that we're now seeing across
Southern Gaza it remains an extremely
desperate
situation thank you very much that's
your land now there in Jerusalem for us",20240511
pgPUesOIgm0,BREAKING: Israel may have used US-supplied weapons in breach of international law in Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\BREAKING Israel may have used US-supplied weapons in breach of international law in Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"now we're just going to bring you some
news that's been uh developing while
we've been on air tonight the US
government has said that Israel may have
used us supplied weapons in breach of
international humanitarian law in some
instances during the war in Gaza these
findings are in a review ordered by the
White House let's find out more from our
correspondent Tom bitman in Washington
uh what more do we know
Tom Jane this has been a long awaited
report report by uh the state department
here after as you say President Biden
ordered a review of in fact seven
countries and the way in which they were
using us supplied weapons now that had
come of course under growing pressure on
the president particularly from Human
Rights organizations and from parts of
his Democratic base to investigate and
verify whether or not Us weapons were
being us used in breach of international
humanitarian law in Gaza now such was
the work that has gone into this the
state here missed its own deadline on
this by 3 days but we've had the report
in the last 10 minutes and the key line
is this it says it is reasonable to
assess that weapons supplied by the
United States have been used by Israeli
Security Forces since October the 7th in
instances inconsistent with
International humanitarian law now that
that is clearly a rebuke of Israel but
it stops short of saying that that
should then lead to any uh further
withholding of us weapons because it
says it takes its assurances about
dealing with and investigating these
incidents as credible so a very
important line there uh I think it
signifies the way in which President
Biden has been caught in a bind between
parts of his base who want more weapons
withheld from Israel and those who say
that he is already not showing enough
support to his key Ally in the region",20240510

shadow over the Eurovision song contest
which is being held in Sweden this year
Israel's reached the final with a song
performed by Eden Golan she received
claps cheers and some booze when she
took to the stage in Malmo early a
thousands of people protested in the
city against Israel's involvement the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu wished her success saying that
she'd already succeeded against what he
described as an ugly wave of
anti-semitism
well I've been speaking to our
correspondent Sarah reinford about the
security in Malmo there are a lot of
police here and and certainly we've seen
Mounted Police we've seen drones in the
Sky last night there's the occasional
helicopter over overhead as well and a
lot of police on the ground but speaking
to uh police officers here the mood is
pretty relaxed in actual fact you know
there are a lot of them they're
definitely being vigilant uh we know
that the terror threat in Sweden as a
whole is pretty high at the moment but
in terms of policing the protest the
authorities are trying uh to keep this
as calm and as peaceful as possible uh
they have Community uh police officer
they call them the dialogue police here
they are right along the route of any of
the protests and the mood has been
peaceful although the mood of the
protesters themselves is passionate too
they are angry that Israel has been
allowed to take part in EUR Vision this
year at a time when the Israeli military
uh is bombing Gaza at a time of
humanitarian crisis and the slogans and
the Chance are pretty furi curious so
the mood is strong uh the crowds are
growing there were probably uh 10,000 or
so protesters there according to police
yesterday although some quotes and
estimates are a bit higher than that uh
but as I say it has been peaceful it has
been contained all of this is organized
and planned in advance with the
authorities we haven't seen any
spontaneous uh protests of any uh
particular size so I wouldn't say it was
tense here but I would say that there
are plenty of people who want to make
their views heard uh and that view that
uh Eden Golan is Israel should not be at
Eurovision particularly talking about
what they call hypocrisy because of
course Russia has been banned from
Eurovision uh because of the fullscale
invasion of Ukraine and lots of people
at the protest will mention that uh when
they tell you why they've come out to
protest I should just mention as well uh
perhaps Sweden's most famous political
activist was also in the crowd of
protesters yesterday I had a quick chat
to her Greta tumberg uh she told me it
was her moral obligation to speak out uh
she was joining the protest she said uh
because she considers it considered it
inexcusable for Israel to be taking part
in your vision uh whilst the bombing of
Gaza continues and away from of course
the uh headlines around the war just
tell us what we can expect when it comes
to the contest in other
areas well an actual fact the Israeli
performer Eden Golan has been uh
becoming far more popular with the the
audiences uh she's uh climbed up the the
list of favorites uh so so she's pretty
high up now there's also an actor from
Croatia by a band called Baby lasagna uh
who talk something about cows and
something about cats it's pretty
mystifying act uh there is the usual
kind of dizzying array of crazy costumes
Crazy lyrics it is your vision as usual
at the party venue itself at the arena
but as I say here in town it's all about
the protest there are more protests
planned of course now that Israel has
made it to the big Final on Saturday

Israel's reaction to President Biden's
warning on the supply of Us weapons to
its Ally Mr Biden has said America will
continue to give Israel the weapons it
needs to defend itself but he added
Israel won't keep Washington's support
if it carries out military operations in
heavily populated areas Israel's un
Envoy has called Mr Biden's remarks
disappointing more on that in a moment
but first here's more of what President
Biden said
civilians have been killed in Gaza as a
consequence of those bombs and other
ways in which they go after population
centers and I made it clear that if they
go into Rafa they haven't gone into Rafa
yet if they go into Rafa I'm not
supplying the weapons that have been
used historically to deal with Rafa to
deal with the cities to deal with that
problem we're going to continue to make
sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron
Dome and their ability to respond to
attacks like came out of the uh the
Middle East recently well for more on
that on North America correspondent will
Vernon sent this update from
Washington President Biden said America
would continue to give Israel the
weapons it needs to defend itself but he
said the US wouldn't Supply heavy
weapons bombs artillery shells that
could be used in a major assault on the
city of Rafa and Mr Biden said it is
these us supplied weapons that have
already killed killed civilians in Gaza
and human rights groups say uh these
Munitions are responsible for the utter
Devastation in Gaza uh now earlier we
heard from us officials who confirmed
that one shipment of heavy bombs was
delayed last week and the other
shipments were under review and that was
a hugely uh significant announcement a
historic step not for 40 years has the
US held up any arms uh deliveries to
Israel for this kind of reason the
Israeli government said uh that it was
very disappointed uh now the US of
course is Israel's biggest supplier of
military equipment its most important
Ally uh and Mr Biden has already come
under criticism from republicans in
Congress for example who say he is
abandoning a key us Ally but I think Mr
Biden is hoping that um by making this
move there have been uh many months of
expressions of deep concern from
president Biden from uh other officials
too about the conduct of the war in Gaza
about the plans for Rafa those warnings
have been more or less ignored by the
Israelis who said they're going to go
into Rafa regardless so I think Mr Biden
is hoping that this will send a clear
message sufficiently clear to the
Israelis that they must change
course will Vernon there well let's
speak to our Middle East correspondent
yoland Nell who is in Jerusalem for us
yoland uh good to have you now you and I
regularly talk about this growing Rift
between the US and Israel it's become uh
much more public now hasn't it what's
the latest we've
heard well this is being covered
extensively in the Israeli media as you
would expect there haven't been many
comments yet from Israeli officials
although we did have Israel's ambassador
to the UN gillad erdan speaking to
public radio he said that these comments
by President Biden were extremely
disappointing and they would give hope
uh to Israel's enemies um we've also had
the opposition leader yel AED coming out
and and really criticizing what he says
is Israel's um government's management
of the country uh and the the
relationship uh with the US it's a
source of of great concern among many
Israelis um that the relationship is
becoming um so strained um of course
Washington is is the closest Ally of
Israel it provides a diplomatic shield
for it as well as this huge amounts of
military assistance so it's not exactly
clear exact about how this is going to
affect things happening on the ground in
Rafa I mean from what we know there has
been uh more heavy shelling the Israeli
military continuing to carry out what it
says a targeted uh raids against Hamas
uh but people living in Rafa not just
the areas that have been given
evacuation orders tell us that it is is
terrifying that uh Panic has set in
among people and they really just don't
know where to go for their own safety
and your land uh what has Israel said
Benjamin Netanyahu said about why Israel
would move forward with such a large
scale offensive despite opposition from
its own
allies well the reason that Israel
really wants to go into Rafa with a full
uh scale invasion is because it says
there are four Hamas battalions
remaining there it's really the last
stronghold of Hamas in Gaza in um
Israel's eyes and it doesn't believe
that it can achieve the victory that it
has said is only achievable by
dismantling um Hamas in Gaza unless it
goes into this Southernmost city now of
course the problem with that which we're
starting to see already is that you have
so many displaced people uh in the city
that a fullscale Invasion there indeed
any kind of uh increased military action
really does involve huge amounts of
human suffering um we're getting reports
of people in the day of civilians having
been killed in the air strikes that have
been going on but uh even bigger than
that is the fact you now have this sort
of downward spiral in the humanitarian
situation because Aid is blocked from
going in through uh the Raffa Crossing
which Israel took control of early on
Tuesday that's not been um open to
humanitarian uh groups since and also
although Israel said um yesterday that
it was opening the Kem Shalom Crossing
after 4 days of closure it said caused
by Hamas rocket fire which killed four
Israeli soldiers nearby um and there's
so much fighting going on in that area
and Palestinian workers um fled with the
the start of the Israeli military
operation that that really means that um
no Aid is able to get in there in effect
either and your land as this Rift
becomes public there are also domestic
pressures on each of these leaders in
the US and Israel what pressures is
Benjamin Netanyahu facing domestically
right
now I mean he has uh two pressures
really I mean you have on the one hand
the hostage families who have so much
public support in Israel they're
carrying out near daily demonstrations
they say Rafa can wait bring the
hostages home they can't wait um and
then you have those far-right members of
um the coalition government that Mr
Netanyahu heads who have been saying
specifically that Rafa must be
prioritized a full invasion there
that's the only route to bring Israel
the victory that they want and they have
threatened if Israel signs up to a
reckless deal in their eyes with the
ceasefire talk still going on in Cairo
uh that they would walk away from his
government yolan thank you for that
update now as yourand was saying the
humanitarian situation on the ground is
already dire and it is getting worse a
an investigation by BBC verifi has found
over half of gaza's water and sanitation
facilities have been damaged or
destroyed since the start of the war
here's Caroline
Hy water in Gaza is in dangerously short
supply posing serious health risks to
the population BBC verify has analyzed
more than 600 water and sanitation
facilities here the dots represent a
mixture of water wells tanks
desalination and sewage treatment plants
the red dots are all those that have
been destroyed or damaged that's more
than 300 facilities AC cross the Gaza
Strip now Gaza used to have six
functioning wastewater treatment plants
which are crucial to preventing the
buildup of sewage and the spread of
disease this was one of them here it was
before October the 7th and now after
three others are also damaged or
destroyed and we've been told the
remaining two are out of action largely
because of a lack of fuel now to
compound the problem officials in Gaza
say they're struggling to repair damaged
infrastructure after an attack on a key
Warehouse where Fuel and spare parts
were stored this shows the warehouse
before and after it was struck at the
end of January the IDF said it was
targeting Hamas Fighters nearby it's
accused the group of storing weapons and
ammunition inside civilian structures
including in and near water
facilities all of this has had a very
direct human Consequence the World
Health Organization says that the
average person needs 15 lers of water
each each day for drinking washing and
cooking but most people in Gaza are
getting just a fraction of that and that
scarcity of water and untreated sewage
are causing dehydration and disease so
we are seeing death coming from uh the
outbreaks of disease um in the highly
vulnerable in the small children in the
elderly and in the pregnant women
hepatitis and pregnant women is is very
very dangerous this is killing
people people in Gaza have told us that
they're queuing for hours to access
drinking water others are drinking Dirty
Water Aid agencies want to truck in more
water but say they can't because of
limited access to fuel and this isn't
just an acute problem now exacerbated by
the current Israeli operation in Rafa

decades to rebuild you can see our full

says it will deepen its attacks on Rafa
until Hamas is eliminated or the first
of the remaining hostages are released
the defense minister said Israel was

their return but insisted that Hamas
only responded to force Israel has sent

will be the last chance for hostage

on Monday night in defiance of

Secretary General Antonio GES has warned
that a full-scale assault on Rafa would
cause a humanitarian nightmare qatar's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called
for international intervention to
prevent the city from being
invaded live now to Jerusalem and our
correspondent yolan Nell is there hi
yolan just bring us up to date with the
latest well when it comes to this uh us
shipment that's been paed that's really
getting a lot of attention in the
Israeli media this morning uh this is a
senior us Administration official who's
been speaking to journalists on
condition of anonymity really because
this is such a sensitive subject and
it's understood that this shipment that
was stop last week included uh some of
the 2,000 bombs really big bombs uh the
US has been sending over to Israel it's
the first time that we've heard that a
shipment has been stopped like this
certainly uh since the start of the War
uh 7 months ago the US has publicly been
restating its Ironclad support of Israel
but we know there have been these uh
constant worries from the Biden
Administration that Israel could go for
a fullscale assault of Rafa against its
um advice um because the US has really
been pushing for much more sort of
limited options to go after Hamas in
gaza's Southernmost city and the concern
would have been really that the the size
of some of these bombs could have had a
devastating effect in a place that is
just so crowded with displaced
people issue of Aid what is the latest
with Crossings and getting
in so we've had uh in the past day or so
humanitarian agencies the UN coming out
uh really expressing concerns about what
could happen as a result of Israel's uh
military offensive in Rafa which it says
is limited but it has resulted in the
Rafa Crossing uh between Gaza and Egypt
uh being completely closed for supplies
coming in there and this after the Kem
Shalom Crossing was closed on Sunday
because of what Israel said was Hamas
rocket Fire coming from Rafa which
killed at least for Israeli soldiers and
wounded others who were close to that
Crossing and now the White House had
said that President Biden had
specifically asked for that Crossing uh
to be reopened it's a main artery for
Aid that goes into Gaza still and we're
hearing that that is now a reopening for
the security checks that Israel demands
are carried out um before the the
lorries uh could pass into Gaza uh
carrying their desperately needed Aid
and your land just last where are we on
the ceasefire
talks we've not had any update on the
ceasefire talks but we know that in
Cairo you now have alongside the
Egyptian and Kat mediators and the US
team that's there as well Hamas and
Israel um with their delegations for
these indirect talks now Israel has
really sent a lower level uh negotiating
team with quite a limited mandate
basically it says to see if uh it can
get anything out of these talks we were
told that there were some specific areas
of difference um after Hamas came out
saying it accepted this uh three-stage
plan for ceasefire and hostage release I
mean some of the differences seem quite
easy to overcome uh there things like um
specifying that um the first group of
Israeli hostages some 33 of them that
are released should all be those who are
still alive we know that there are also
some dead bodies more than 30 um that
are held in Gaza um on top of that
things like wanting um Israeli women
soldiers to be returned home more
quickly than this plan laid out but the
really fundamental difference remains
there about you know the plan for an end
to the war because ultimately in the
document that has been seen uh by
journalists that's been leaked out to
the media it talks about um a return to
sustainable calm a permanent um halt
cessation of military and hostile acts
and that is really problematic for
Israel it went into this war saying that
it wanted to dismantle Hamas in Gaza
that it wanted to stop it having any
military capabilities and stop it coming
back to Power and in the background here
you have this problem that there has
been no real post-war vision for Gaza um
that has been agreed uh for something
that is viable as an alternative to
Hamas being inow there um you know other
Palestinian bodies coming in and at the
moment that really looks like the very
very difficult part um of the ceasefire
negotiations for the mediators to try to
overcome yolan thank you for that",20240508

Israel will send negotiators to talks
but won't stop fighting
yet we examine every proposal very
seriously and we review every
possibility on the issue of negotiations
and the return of the hostages to their

central task at the same time we carry
on with our operations in the Gaza Strip

the daily
reality hany ashtar an orphan grieved by
his relative
re his family was killed during the war
she says even he was
killed so many here are grieving and
exhausted late tonight Israel attacked
Eastern Rafa where they told people to
leave celebration had turned to
fear and the hope that tomorrow might
bring peace fergal Keen BBC News
Jerusalem let's show you the scene live
in Rafa right now where we can smoke uh
rise into the air there this comes after
the Israeli Defense Forces said it does
have operational control of the Garen
side of the ra acrossing following the
announcement that the IDF was targeted
targeting having targeted strikes
against Hamas in eastern Rafa well in
the past few hours the military have
said that their forces were scanning the
area after launching this ground and air
operation in parts of Eastern Rafa on
Monday this is as we know a diplomatic
efforts are continuing to try and
achieve a new truce well let's speak to
Lise wridge from unra who joins me now
from Rafa uh Louise welcome to you tell
us what the situation is there right now
where you
are yeah things are very tense here in
Rafa um the last 24 hours have been a
complete roller coaster of emotion even
the last few days there was so much hope
for uh ceasefire anybody you speak to
here the last week the last few months
every every day all they want to know is
when there is a ceasefire coming and
it's what everybody has been hoping for
so to wake up yesterday morning to the
devastating news that leaflets had been
dropped and an evacuation order was in
place it really Spread spread a lot of
fear across the community um I'm
currently in Western Rafa but across
Eastern Rafa people started to move but
even outside my window I was able to see
people starting to take down their
makeshift shelters start to pack up and
start to leave Rafa so there's a lot of
fear spreading throughout the day you
could see more and more people starting
to to move starting to leave um and then
last night you know out of seemingly
nowhere you know for myself the first I
heard of it was screaming and cheering
out of the window um I was completely
overcome with with emotion everyone
around you know you could see women and
children hugging each other crying
families coming together just this
outpour of relief that people have held
for so long at the hope of a potential
ceasefire uh and then today this morning
very subdued very quiet as the day has
gone on I've seen again more and more
Vehicles move out of the Rafa area as
people are packing up their things and
leaving so there is a sense of fear and
Chaos now obviously this is a a minute
by minute hour by hour situation
developing um but clearly people are
hearing the situation at the Raffa
border crossing and now deciding to to
leave once again and and tell us what
the aid situation is like because more
Aid had been getting in in the past few
weeks hadn't it what's this Aid
situation there
now so there is now no Aid entering the
Gaza Strip the Raffa Crossing is the
biggest and the only entry that unra the
the largest humanitarian agency here in
Gaza has been using and now there is no
Aid able to get in and in addition to
that there is also no fuel so fuel is
really what the agencies need to run
this massive humanitarian operation
across the Gaza Strip fuel is what's
needed to to run the trucks to get the
aid to the people who need it fuel is
needed in the generators to run the
hospitals and and health clinics that
are remaining and not damaged and
destroyed so without this Fuel and
without this aid supplies the aid
operation here is is simply going to
ground to a Hal what is the aid
operation like at the
moment um we continue to do everything
we can our colleagues are providing
Services unra runs Health Centers across
the Gaza Strip um even in North Gaza we
have some very heroic colleagues who
have maintained running these Health
Services throughout the war so we do our
best to provide these these services and
provide what Aid we have but it's very
concerning to know that this border
crossing is is closed and that there is
no foreseeable Aid entering anytime soon
okay thank you very much for telling us
about the situation where you are Louise
wridge from unra who is in Rafa thank
you
well let's get more on this with our
correspondent in Jerusalem yolan now
yand welcome to you what are the
authorities there saying about why
they've closed the crossing or taking
control of this Crossing uh between
Egypt and Rafa and about the IDF
operation in
Rafa so the Israeli Army has put out
footage that shows these Israeli tanks
rolling into this key crossing the Rafa
Crossing between uh Gaza and Egypt it
says it's taken operational control
there um and it's dealing it says with
Hamas uh terrorists infrastructure to
use its language in that area it says
it's killed 20 Hamas terrorists um
overnight and that it has also found
three uh tunnel shafts um and it's
linking operations around uh this part
of Rafa to the rocket fire that it says
uh came from this area Fried by Hamas um
on Sunday which killed four Israeli
soldiers close to the Kem Shalom
Crossing leading to the closure of that
important Crossing in the south of the
Gaza Strip as well um now at the moment
when we're taking briefings from the
Israeli military they're stressing that
this is a very precise it's a limited uh
operation they're not putting a time
frame on it um they said too that they
are working to reopen the Kem Shalom
Crossing um as security allows and tell
us more about this potential ceasefire
deal which Hamas said it supports Israel
says it goes a long way from meeting its
demands we understand that unofficial
talks are still going to take place
today in Cairo what more do we know
about
that well at the moment this ceasefire
deal is really hanging in the balance
because of the different positions we
had you know that declaration from Hamas
was quite dramatic saying it agreed to
what the mediators have proposed uh
Israel coming out quickly um and uh
denying that this was The Proposal that
it had signed up to saying that there
were um differences from its core
demands but we also have had confusingly
some officials coming out and saying No
this is actually very similar um to the
proposal that was put forward by Israel
itself at the end of last month um it
does seem really that the fundamental
difficulty for Israel is signing up to
any kind of a phase deal of a ceasefire
and hostage release that will ultimately
lead to an end to hostilities an end to
this war before in the eyes of the uh
Israeli government it has achieved its
War aim of dismantling Hamas in Gaza it
said that is necessary to have a victory
in this war",20240507

Jerusalem let's get the very latest now
from Frank Garden who's live in
Jerusalem and Gary odonahue who's in New
York Frank first to you um as we speak
Israel still hasn't signed on to this
deal no they haven't but they have at
least agreed to to do what they didn't
do at the weekend which is to send a
delegation of mediators experts in their
view to try and trash out a deal they've
said that the terms that Hamas have
agreed to are very far from what is that
meets their needs but they're not ruling
it out so I think there is a degree of
optimism here but at the same time as I
mentioned they are continuing their push
their military push against the wishes
of the Americans in Rafa and that is
controversial because all the aid
agencies are saying this could be a
catastrophic result for the civilians
there and essentially I think if if you
had to sum up the Israeli position it
would be keep talking but keep fighting
all right Frank thank you uh to you Gary
at the White House um Joe Biden his team
they're very anxious um over Israel's
planned attack on Rafa they don't want
it to go ahead but Israel it's clear
tonight is still planning to push
on yeah the administration here
believing we're at a really critical
stage uh in this whole process they are
saying that they're looking at the the
details of the deal that Hamas have said
they'll accept uh talking to their
Partners in the region uh and also of
course the CIA director Bill Burns is
shuttling between Qatar and KIRO trying
to work out what to do next now they're
saying that they're going to look at
that in great detail one thing they're
being very clear on is the question of
Rafa they say they've seen no credible
plan uh of how to protect
humanitarian uh needs in Rafa if there
were any kind of uh incursion there
they've been opposed to that all along
and I think one thing today from the
National Security Council spokesman
Clive John Kirby summed it out he said I
don't think there has been a more
sensitive stage than right now",20240506

said they have agreed to a ceasefire
proposal put forward by Egypt and Qatar
the new spark celebration in Gaza but it
may be premature the Israelis are saying
tonight the deal is not acceptable
because they had agreed with the
Americans as far back as February a deal
that has now been softened what we know
about this proposal is that it sets out
a three-stage process each lasting 42
days the first would lead to a release
of 33 hostages in return for Palestinian
prisoners and a partial isra Israeli
withdrawal the second would lead to the
release of all other living hostages
there were thought to be about 128 still
alive and the third phase would see a
return of the bodies the Israeli defense
minister said this morning that the
decision to expand the assault on Rafa
had been taken because Hamas had
rejected their ceasefire terms so this
has come as a surprise to the Israeli
government let's go then live to
Jerusalem our security correspondent
Frank Gardner is there bring us up to
speed if you would Frank on the action
there in
Jerusalem Christian things are moving
incredibly fast here almost every minute
there is a new update and the latest I
should tell you is that a senior
Palestinian official unnamed uh has told
our correspondent one of my colleagues
that one of the things under
consideration and this is quite
extraordinary is that Hamas is even
considering a long-term cation of
hostilities in other words giving up the
arms struggle now they haven't committed
to that yet and it would they would need
to see this deal go through and for the
truce to work so there's an awful lot
that could go wrong before then but um
these are quite momentous times here so
although I've been urging people to kind
of temper things you know there's an
awful lot that could go wrong there are
hardliners in the Israeli cabinet who
don't want any kind of a deal with Hamas
who simply want to see a hard Israeli
military push into Rafa that eliminates
Hamas once and for all in their eyes
there are others including down the road
from here protesters who are lying down
in the street demanding a deal a
ceasefire deal to get the hostages home
now the latest version of this deal as
we understand it is that it's going to
come in two phases and the first phase
um would see after 11 days a partial
withdrawal of Israeli forces um there
would be release of the remaining female
Israeli soldiers military people who are
in captivity and I should just correct
something that was in your queue earlier
it's not unfortunately 128 still alive
in Gaza it's of 128 it's believed around
34 are probably dead so we're talking
about 90 plus hostages still thought to
be alive in Gaza somewhere held by Hamas
and or its associates so so for each one
of those it's complicated process this
so bear with me for each one of those
female Israeli soldiers who were
released um there would be 50 uh
Palestinian prisoners released women
from Israeli jails including some with
life sentences um and this is really
about confidence building it's a
stepbystep process um and the ultimate
aim is to have a sustained period of
calm and no hostilities now that's a
heck of a big ass because um there will
be enormous suspicion here in Israel
that Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad
or any other group isn't going to stick
to this that there's going to be Rockets
lobbed across the border and then Israel
will say right the whole thing is off so
there's an awful lot that could go wrong
but the prize is there now out in the
distance at the top of the hill people
have just got to March up that hill to
get to it just quickly Frank is there
anything in the terms that have been
agreed and as you say some of the detail
is is quite difficult to get our heads
around at this this point but is there
anything you've heard there that the
Israelis weren't
expecting yes I mean one of the uh
things I should add is that um what's
being talked about from the Palestinian
side is an end to the blockade in Gaza
now that could be something that if that
means uh demanding free passage for
Palestinians to go in and out of Gaza to
Israel and that's that's not clear if it
necessarily does entail that but if it's
that there's no way I can see a
Netanyahu government agreeing to that
because they have kettled everybody into
Gaza Strip they say for security reasons
in the past to stop suicide bombers who
have come through that border and blown
themselves up at bus stations in Tel
Aviv but the people of Gaza live in
intolerable condition
you know it's it's the it's been called
the O biggest open air prison in the
world and it's an unsustainable
situation in the long term Frank Gardner
in Jerusalem thank you very much indeed
for that well after the news broke and
shortly after the Israelis had rejected
the agreement the US Department of State
spokesperson Matthew Miller was asked
what happens next here's what he had to
say so I can confirm that Hamas has
issued a response we are reviewing that
response Now And discussing it with our
partners in the region as you know
director Burns is in the region working
on this in real time uh we will be
discussing this uh response with our our
partners uh over the coming hours we
continue to believe that a hostage deal
is in the best interest of the Israeli
people it's in the best interest of the
Palestinian people it would bring an
immediate ceasefire it would allow uh
increased movement of humanitarian
assistance and so we're going to
continue to work to try to reach one",20240506

leaders have said they'll agree to a
ceasefire proposal put forward by Egypt
and kataar in the seven-month-old war
with Israel it's understood the terms
could include the release of 33 hostages
held since the October the 7th attacks
last year there has been no immediate
response so far from Israel but if there
is an agreement it would be the first
pause in the fighting since a week-long
truce last November well Jeremy Bowen is
here with me in the studio um this is a
turnup for the books literally in the
last hour and the mood music getting
into that was not good no it was very
Bleak because the Israelis of course
gave those warnings this morning to
people in Rafa to move the offensive was
about to happen or rather a smaller
scale version of it so I've been talking
to people close to the talks normally
reliable diplomatic sources um and what
I've been told is
that they've agreed to release 33
Israeli hostages a 40-day ceasefire
there would be freedom of movement for
people in Gaza to return to the north uh
which has not been allowed up to now and
then there'd be a second phase which is
known as restoring sustainable calm now
my information is that that was language
proposed by the Americans back in
February rejected by the Israelis but um
accepted by them reportedly I'm told by
these sources on the 28th of April that
they agreed to it um and that American
language is basically a creative way of
talking about a a long-term cease fire
because Israel didn't want to use that
sort of language so you know my source
said everyone's read was that Netanyahu
was hoping Hamas wouldn't take it we'll
have to see what he does now the ball is
in his court Hamas has called their
Bluff uh the Israelis themselves uh
there have been some reports on news
agencies saying that that this is a
bruised by himass they they're looking
into it maybe it's not quite what they
agreed to but clearly things are
happening the head of the CIA has been
talking all day to the Kateri prime
minister in Doha their Capital Biden
will speak to Netanyahu later and the
King of Jordan is at the white house
right now and he of course has been a
big critic of the war indeed okay Jeremy
thank you our International edit to
there let's go straight to Jerusalem and
Frank Gardner is standing by um any word
yet from the Israelis on this
development
Frank no uh not so far an unnamed
official has indicated that these
softened terms as they put it are not
going to be acceptable to the Israeli
government so the mood music here in
Israel is not particularly optimistic I
have to say the Israeli media have said
that the terms have altered in some way
um whatever Hamas has agreed to even if
it is still the same deal that was on
the table has still got to be agreed to
by the Israeli government and signed off
now there is mounting pressure on prime
minister Netanyahu here in Israel by the
families of the hostages saying do a
deal because your military operation in
Gaza isn't getting our loved ones out
and those voices are getting louder and
louder I drive every night past these
protesters who are desperate to get
their hostages out there's still 90 plus
hostages thought to still be alive in
Gaza and they are of course the big
bargaining chip for Hamas they're not
going to give that up unless they can be
assured that this war is going to end

hour very important breaking news
because an official Hamas Source has
told the BBC that it does accept a
proposal for a ceasefire deal in Gaza
now Israel has yet to comment on that
we'll bring you more details on it as
soon as we get
them meanwhile Palestinian civilians
have started leaving parts of Eastern
Rafa in Gaza after Israel told a 100,000
people there to leave the area officials
in Gaza say Israeli air strikes have
targeted parts of Rafa just hours after
that evacuation order was issued
pictures we've received show Thick Smoke
Rising as displaced Palestinians try to
flee Eastern Rafa now those Palestinian
civilians closest to the Israeli border
are being urged to move to what the
Israeli military the IDF calls expanded
humanitarian zones in the almasi and
cunis area
is let's just go back to those live
pictures of people in Gaza in the center
of Gaza actually getting that news that
there looks like Hamas well Hamas have
confirmed that they have accepted the
ceasefire proposals as we say no
confirmation yet of that from Israel so
let's go straight to our security
correspondent Frank Gardner who's in
Jerusalem for us um well Frank Hamas uh
saying that they have accepted these
ceasefire proposals we don't know what
Israel thinks about this yet but what
would that mean
potentially two crucial things here Ben
one are those proposals the same ones
that Israel essentially agreed to the
ones that were on the table during the
weekend at the Ciro talks which were a
40-day pause in the fighting a return of
Palestinians to Northern Gaza to their
homes and an exchange of roughly 33 is
ready hostages out of captivity in Gaza
in return for an undisclosed number of
Palestinians out of Israeli jails those
were broadly the terms that we think
were on the table do we know if this
deal that has been accepted by Hamas is
the same one is it the same terms we
don't know yet second thing is is Israel
going to sign up on this is it going to
sign up to it because if the terms are
different then it's quite possibly going
to get rejected by the Israeli side and
those wonderful celebrations you saw
there in Rafa and Gaza Strip could be
premature of course the Israeli Prime
Minister benjin Netanyahu is under huge
pressure isn't he to get the remaining
hostages out and many people would say
that a ceasefire deal is the best way to
get those hostages
out well that's exactly right I mean the
only time we've seen large numbers of
hostages released out of Gaza have been
with a negotiated deal by Qatar and
Egypt with the support of the United
States and that appears to be what's
going on now because the message and
we're basing all of this on a genuine
one single but genuine posting on uh on
social media by Hamas saying that their
political leader is hania has telephoned
the Kat prime minister Sheikh abdan
Muhammad abdan Alani uh and abas camel
the head of Egyptian intelligence to say
that Hamas accepts the Ceasar proposal
so we don't yet know what the Israeli
reaction is the Israeli media has been
pretty cautious about it saying that if
it's if the terms are different then
it's not going to be acceptable to the
Israeli cabinet and let's just remind
ourselves what the sticking point was at
the weekend why those peace talks those
ceasefire talks collapsed or stalled and
that is that Hamas insisted on an
undertaking by Israel that this would be
a full and final ceasefire in other
words it would be an end to the fighting
and Israel would withdraw Israel said
we're not going to commit to that
because it would leave hamas's
battalions intact and allow them to
regroup and attack us again what
mediators have been saying both during
the weekend and subsequently to Hamas is
look take the 40-day deal you know if
you don't take that nothing's going to
happen the idea is to build on the
40-day deal to make another 40-day Troop
and another one beyond that and
eventually it becomes um a permanent
ceasefire but if you don't make a start
then nothing is going to
happen and just give us an idea of who
exactly is mediating in these various
ceasefire negotiations that we've been
having it's very much Egyptian Le I mean
the cutteries are involved cutter is of
course the home in doar its capital to
the political leadership of Hamas
something that is pretty controversial
because it's a weird situation you've
got Qatar that is home to the largest US
military base in the Middle East at
alade it's also home to what is a the
political wing of a prescribed terrorist
organization prescribed by the US and
many other countries um but it's the
Egyptians that have been driving this
one and it's Egyptian intelligence
remember that Egypt borders Gaza they've
got a vested interest in seeing calm
restored um the last thing they want is
to see the violence spill over their
borders um into the northern Sinai which
has already suffered a lot of violence
from um Isis that's been attacking
Egyptian Army positions uh they there's
no love lost between the Egyptian
government which is very secular and
Hamas which is a religious movement a
political religious movement but the
Egyptians have been driving this they
want very much to see this deal succeed
Ed and that's why hamas's message
mentioned abas camel the head of
Egyptian intelligence who is been who
has been instrumental in trying to get
this deal over the line and Frank just
looking at the timing of this I mean
this this uh acceptance by Hamas of the
ceasefire deal it comes on the same day
that we've had heightened reports that
there could be an imminent Israeli
military offensive ground assault on
Rafa we've had those evacuation orders
dropped by flyers on Palestinian
civilians telling them to get out of
Eastern Rafa ahead of of uh what could
be an imminent Israeli assault do you
think that could be connected to what
Hamas now have agree
to well certainly I think hardliners um
and others in the military here in in
the Israeli establishment will be saying
you see military Pressure Works the
threat of military action has made them
capitulate I'm not sure that's how Hamas
would see it um because after all
yesterday they fired a load of rockets
at the Kim Shalom Crossing Point killing
four Israeli soldiers Israel has been
conducting air strikes in Rafa certainly
the prospect of a major military
operation in Rafa has appalled
International Aid agencies and the US
for that matter so President Biden only
a couple of hours ago held a 30-minute
phone call with prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu the readout of that that was
released to the media was unbelievably
short and uninformative uh most of it
was about Holocaust Remembrance Day one
line in it referring to Rafa saying the
president made clear his views on Rafa
well we know what those views are and it
frankly don't do it the US does not
believe that Israel can undertake a
military operation in a place with 1.4
million people 2third of whom are
already displaced from northern Gaza
without severe harm to those
civilians uh Frank you were saying at
the start that of course we have to wait
and hear and wait and see what Israel's
reaction to this is and we have just
received a report while you've been
talking to us from the Reuters news
agency um quoting an Israeli official
unnamed Israeli official saying that
Hamas have approved uh a quote softened
Egyptian proposal that is not repeat not
acceptable to Israel so the initial and
that is a that's just on the Reuters
news agency but they're quoting an
Israeli official saying that this deal
that Hamas have agreed to is not
acceptable to Israel because it's it's
based on a softened Egyptian
proposal yeah I I that doesn't surprise
me and that's very depressing because um
you know I kind of feared as much
because certainly when the talks
collapsed at the weekend there was still
considerable dist between the Hamas
position and the Israeli
position the Israeli Prime Minister
Netanyahu has been absolutely adamant
that Israel will not commit now or at
any time to an end to hostilities why
because they think that this is
unfinished business and there are four
battalions of Hamas still alive and
intact and they want to finish them off
at the same time they want the hostages
out now those two aims I think are
incompatible with each other the best
way to get hostage is out of captivity
in Gaza is through a deal um but there
are people in the security cabinet and
the war cabinet here in Israel um well
certainly there are hardliners in this
country and in the government who don't
want to see a deal instead they want to
see a hard military push into Rafa that
in some way finishes off Hamas I'm not
sure that that is achievable and it's
certainly not going to get a lot of
hostages out
alive yeah and and just one additional
line from Reuters Frank that I will just
put to you but it just amplifies that
earlier report I was uh reading out from
the Reuters news agency that Israeli
official who's already said that these
proposals are not acceptable to Israel
says the proposal includes quote far
reaching conclusions that Israel does
not agree to that so that does look like
initially at least confirmation that
Israel isn't going to go along with
these uh proposals even if Hamas is
yeah I mean it's almost certainly
concerning the end State because Hamas
is saying look you know it's unrealistic
to give up their key bargaining chip the
hostages um only to find themselves
attacked the very next day now I mean
you know Hamas is a prescribed terrorist
organization they've committed absolute
atrocities in southern uh Israel on
October the 7th but they've been quite
canny militarily and um they are in
quite a strong bargaining position
because they still hold somewhere
upwards of 90 hostages who are thought
to be alive the pressure on prime
minister Netanyahu here is mounting to
get those hostages out every night I
drive past protesters um who are waving
banners saying bring them home do more
make it a priority the protesters and
they numbered tens of thousands a couple
of nights ago in t
they don't believe that the Israeli
government is doing enough to get them
out they don't think it's a priority for
for this government they think this
government's priority is to get tough on
Hamas and fight it and beat it and crush
it into the ground and that the hostages
are a second PRI secondary
priority Frank very good to have you
with us for that instant analysis that's
Frank Gardner our security correspondent
live with the very latest from Jerusalem
on that uh Hass acceptance of ceasefire
proposals but as we've just been hearing
according to the Reuters news agency um
Israel does not accept those proposals
and isn't likely to and Frank Gardner
there just giving us his analysis well",20240506

Israel's military has said it's begun
ordering Palestinian civilians to leave
parts of Eastern Rafa ahead of a planned
operation in the southern Gaza City in
this video by the Israeli Defense Forces
they're urging those in eastern Rafa
close to the border with Israel to move
to what they call a humanitarian Zone in
the al- mawasi and KH Yunis areas the
IDF have said this is a limited
operation and should affect about
100,000 people Israel's Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu continues to insist
that a military operation in Rafa is
necessary to seek out remaining Hamas
Fighters despite widespread humanitarian
concern for those Sheltering there
western and Arab leaders have repeatedly
warned against such a wide ground
operation because of the prospect of
high numbers of Civilian casualties
meanwhile officials from Israel and its
closest Ally the US have been holding
meetings to discuss alternative more
focused plans it's not yet clear if the
new evacuation orders are part of those
well let's speak to James zelder who's a
spokesperson for the United Nations
Children's Fund also known as UNICEF
thanks very much indeed for for being
with us so tell us what you think the
impact will be of this
evacuation Lauren absolutely devastating
you have families in Rafa their coping
capacity has been smashed this is six
months of enduring this war moving many
times probably having lost a home
already they are children are
malnourished they've already been living
in conditions with you know one one
shower for three and a half thousand
people they're being told to move quote
unquote to a humanitarian Zone that's a
unilaterally declared humanitarian Zone
that's not a humanitarian Zone where
humanitarians have been able to provide
the services they need to so I've been
talking to colleagues and friends in
Rafa this morning and they they're
terrified I was speaking Lauren to a
young woman she's like I know this has
been coming I just don't know what to
pack they'll go to an area in the middle
Zone Lauren called der Bal where there
is literally raw seage in the streets or
maybe to alasi which is a beach same
story applies nowhere is safe but as
unbearable as this is it's happening and
and it's going to be horrific and is it
your understanding that there are only
specific areas that people have been
allowed to move to or can they can they
choose no there are specific areas
without a doubt partly they will have to
choose based on those people who have
the means to leave a lot of people have
injured children with them hospitals as
I've seen hospitals cannot cope with the
number of injuries there's a lot of
children who have had amputations who
are back living in tents those families
will find it hard to move but
geographically logistically no you still
can't a lot of families will not be able
to move to the north if they'd hoped to
car unus is impossible that's another
city bordering raer that is Rubble not a
little bit but Street after Street of
rubble so they'll be pushed into this
area called masasi Lauren which is a
Beach area it's sand it has next to no
sanitation or hygiene it's getting hot
right now in Gaza it's raining today but
it's getting hot so they'll be intense
side by side five or six times is the
population density of New York City but
all on the ground not a highrise to be
seen with no hospital care the last
remaining Hospital of size is in Rafa
European hospital so named because it
was donated by the people of Europe uh
it's got 20,000 people hiding there and
thousands more uh in care they will have
to move somewhere without the medical
care that they need tell us you said
that um the Israeli Army had set up
these areas without assistance from the
humanitarian community what can you now
do in terms of providing help if people
are moving is is there anything you can
do yeah it's it's a great question the
whole Aid operation has been so fragile
because of denials and restrictions and
insecurity and bombardments let's not
forget our our colleagues from the world
Central Kitchen who were killed a week
later a UNICEF vehicle come came under
Fire now of course that Crossing in Rafa
that is the lifeline of Aid if we are
going to get close to meeting the the
needs of people that Crossing will now
be closed for I don't know for how long
so no we have to be clear you can't
unilaterally declare a safe Zone firstly
because the other side won't be
considering it as that and secondly
because the United Nations needs time to
actually try and support a million or
two people I said this in November
UNICEF and the UN has said this Lauren
from the very start in November and
December this safe Zone narrative is
very dangerous because a safe Zone
legally must also provide water food
sanitation and protection these zones
don't have that for people and quite
frequently as the people in raffle will
tell you safe zones also get bombed

much indeed for taking the time to talk
to us",20240506
Nb-39UN3vjA,Al Jazeera office in Israel raided and channel taken off air in country | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Al Jazeera office in Israel raided and channel taken off air in country  BBC News.jpg,"okay let's get more now on uh the
Israeli government decision to close
down the uh Al jazer uh TV channel uh in
Israel this has been happening
throughout the day and Sebastian user is
our Middle East Analyst at the BBC World
Service and we've had some some news in
um just in the last half an hour or so
Sebastian from Frank Gardner our
security correspondent in Jerusalem who
says that Israeli police have already
raided the offices of the Qatar based
Channel um and that was just within
hours wasn't it of of that decision
right to to shut it down it it seems
very very Swift it is it's Swift but it
has been building for some time and this
is something that the Israeli government
now this far right government has very
much pushed for and especially in the
context of the Gaza War event since
October the 7th the hamus attacks on
Israel then in which Al jazer which
Israel has accused for a very long time
of being anti-israeli it's acted against
its journalists uh journalists have been
killed I mean most famously two years
ago Shireen Abu Akay the star
correspondent of Al jazer for the Arab
Service uh that they run uh in the
occupied territories was killed aljer
accused Israel 100% of having carried it
out since then Israel has uh has said
that it it you know the the chances are
that it was uh an accidental uh killing
so this this showdown between these
between aleser and Israel goes back a
long way but really this has become much
stronger during the Gaza war and aler
has been really the only International
medor Outlet which has been able to keep
its reporters on the ground there
they've been reporting essentially 24
hours a day on its Arab language Channel
and its English language Channel and
again that's something which the Israeli
government uh is very much against and
believes is essentially acting as a
mouthpiece for Hamas and they've said
that explicitly they've even accused Al
jazer staff of of collaborating with
Hamas so this announcement today which
was made by the Prime Minister Netanyahu
was followed very swiftly by the
communications Minister saying he'd
signed it and as we as as we've seen
actually the communications Minister
posted video of the raid within a couple
of hours of this happening uh so the
powers that Israel has over Al jazer to
confiscate its uh broadcasting equipment
to close its offices and to block access
to it on satellite and its websites now
what we're hearing from Israel is that
that has happened that it's no longer uh
obtainable by satellite or cable in
Israel but there's other ways of doing
it and again as as as Frank was saying
you can get it on Facebook now very
difficult in this day and age obviously
to completely close down access to uh to
a network like aleser I wonder in your
anal Anis what do you think this means
in terms of people's views of netan who
we have seen more protests haven't we in
recent months but uh for the for the
people in Israel in particular what what
do you think their perception will be of
this and probably I'm look I'm thinking
more in terms of free speech yes no I
understand that I mean I think in terms
of the uh critics of netan who date back
before October the 7th who basically
went on the streets and hundreds of
thousands every Saturday to protest
against what they saw as a move by his
government to close down the ability for
the Judiciary to take uh positions
against what the government wanted to do
they would say this is another attack on
Free Speech I think many Israelis though
would see it as this is a time of War Al
jazer I think many people uh if if they
do watch it would see it as some kind of
propaganda they would see it as taking
too strongly a prop Palestinian anti
Israeli position so I don't think it'll
change particularly the way that
Israelis see netan if they already see
him as someone who's opposed to free
speech who's opposed to democracy in
Israel then they will see this as
another sign of it but for many others
it will be mixed up with this feeling
which is you know this this is a time of
War just as you have many Israelis who
are very much against the way that the
war has been fought by the Israeli
government and Israeli military and and
and and the casualties on the paltin
side they're not necessarily against the
fact of a war in the first place because
of what happened October the 7th okay

with Israel citing the worsening
humanitarian situation in the
Palestinian territory anchor said all
imports and exports would be suspended
until the Israeli government allowed an
uninterrupted and sufficient flow of Aid
the trade between the two countries was
worth almost $7 billion last year
Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz
accused turkey's president Reep typ
erdogan of behaving like a dictator
adding that turkey would lose well Gaza
the United Nations claims Aid lores have
been regularly blocked on a road leading
to a key Israeli checkpoint it says
these delays are hindering humanitarian
efforts although Israel says it is doing
everything necessary to facilitate Aid
well BBC verifies Jake Horton has been
looking at the evidence people in
Northern Gaza facing imminent famine and
humanitarian groups say more food is
urgently needed the majority of Aid
comes over land on Lor
it's collected from Southern Gaza and
taken North how quickly these lorries
able to travel through Gaza is crucial
Israel says it's doing everything
necessary to make that process as smooth
as possible but the UN says big qes at
Key Israeli checkpoint inside Gaza are
repeatedly hindering its efforts the
checkpoint is here on Salah Aline Road a
key route for Aid South to North we've
been investigating reports of blockages
here over the past
month exclusive satellite images
obtained by booy verify show a
bottleneck of lorries just north of that
checkpoint in this photo you can on from
the 15th of April you can see dozens of
lores we've counted more than 70 in a
kilometer long queue the UN says the
blockage built up over three days and
almost half of the fleet used to deliver
Aid was stuck at its
peak the UN has previously sent us these
images from on the ground you can see a
line of empty lorries pulled up on the
side of the road we've located these to
the same stretch of road on Salah Aline
similar blockages have happened before
according to the UN and we found
satellite images that confirm this like
this incident in early April where you
can see dozens of trucks waiting north
of the checkpoint we asked the Israeli
authorities about these reported delays
but we haven't heard
back is Israel has previously accused
the UN of being too slow to distribute
Aid in this tweet posted on the 11th of
April by Kat the Israeli that oversees
humanitarian efforts they said there was
sufficient aid for 600 lorries waiting
to be picked up and that the bottlenecks
aren't on the Israeli side a week later
in another
tweet Kat said the Aida built up further
urging the UN to do its job the UN says
their work in Gaza is often restricted
by Israeli rules Israel now says it's a
reopen the main Aid Crossing into the
north but as people there Edge closer to
famine the UN says better coop operation
is needed from all sides to distribute
supplies properly within
Gaza yeah Jake Horton there with me now
is say shahata from BBC Arabic s all of
this underlines the need for a truce so
how are those talks
going there is no talks right now uh the
latest is Mr Han Hanya the chief of the
political Bureau of Hamas talk with the
Qatari prime minister yesterday and talk
with the head of intelligence of Egypt
Abbas camel and they talk about sending
a new delegation uh from Hamas to
negotiate about a truce they was suppos
Hamas to respond to a proposal from
Israel on Monday but they didn't on
Wednesday they didn't so it looks there
is a problem because Hamas and Israel
they have a big gap between them Hamas
condition the withdrawal of the Israeli
force from Gaza they want to Perman ceas
Perman ceas fire but Israel is saying
you know after the release of some
hostages return of some prisoners uh
will be uh kind of a truth for 40 days
where there will be no hostilities or no
like fighting and they call in the next
second stage of like sustainable period
of calm instead of using permanent
ceasefire so is a gap between them in
addition to that you know Mr Netanyahu
insisting on launching a ground
offensive uh in Rafa so and this even in
spite of the warning from United States
from the Palestinian from other United
Nations organization because would be
the catastrophic effect on the civilians
where there's more than one one million
people live in far in in Rafa most of
them are displaced from the north and
other plac in Gaza you think all of this
would put pressure on both sides to to
reach an agreement is it just that their
their demands are too far apart because
even America is is is putting a lot of
pressure on on both sides Americans they
trying to put they saying you know Mr
blinkin and Mr Biden saying the now
Hamas turn to accept what is Mr blinkin
said a strong proposal from Israel but
in Hamas opening is not because their
condition is not are not compromised
according to them so they insist on the
withdrawal and the return of the
displaced people from the South to the
north and this will affecting you know
like the situation inside Gaza so the
picture you're painting is the sides are
very far apart at the moment um the
longer this goes on it's bad news for
both sides and our BBC colleagues are
reporting alarm in Israel Over possible
legal action over Gaza this interesting
report on the BBC website saying that
the international criminal court is
potentially planning to seek arrest
warrants for military and political
leaders on suspicions of war crimes
including prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu he could be among those it's
not a good news for Israel because there
is some isolation for Israel
International era there is like
demonstration in America there's
demonstration other places there is a
case by South Africa against israelian I
the international uh court of justice
and now seeking arrest warranties
against Mr Netanyahu and other top
leaders from uh the Army and the
politician is not a good news and even
Mr Netanyahu and this shows like his
concerned about that he said like he
accused the IC of attempting to paralyze
the ability of Israel to defend itself
so he accusing them but the IC looking
at that after Mr Kim Khan the chief
prosecutor of the IC looking into the
cas he visited Israel didn't he and the
occupied West Bank last December and
this this is coming off the back of that
yeah he visit and he condemned the
violence against civilian on both sides
not only on the Hamas you know G side
but also what the Hamas done in Israel
so he condemned both sides and he
promised to to investigate that and part
of that is the maybe plan of arrest
warranties against Mr potentially I
should Netanyahu has called the prospect
of senior Israeli figures joining The
Wanted list as an outrage of historic
proportions accusing the ICC of
attempting to paralyze Israel's ability
to defend itself Sayed as always thank
you very much",20240503

demonstrators they have the right to
freedom of speech but not to cause chaos
he was speaking in the last hour in a TV
address uh after police in Los Angeles
cleared a protest camp at the University
of California Joe Biden said the rule of
law had to be respected by those who
oppose the war in
Gaza well these were the scenes
overnight during the police operation
hundreds of officers in riot gear
descended on the camp there were loud
bangs and Thick Smoke as police fired
flares and stun grenades dozens of
students have been detained
demonstrations against the war in Gaza
are continuing at dozens of universities
right across the United States the
president warned there was no place for
violence racism or hate speech in the
country including on student
campuses in fact peaceful progr protest
is in the best tradition of how
Americans respond to consequential
issues but but neither are we a lawless
country we are a civil society and Order
must Prevail throughout our history
we've often faced moments like this
because we are a big diverse
freethinking and freedom loving nation
in moments like this there are always
those who rush into to score political
points but this isn't a moment for
politics it's a moment for clarity so
let me be clear peaceful protest in
America violent protest is not protected
peaceful protest is it's against the law
when violence occurs destroying property
is not a peaceful protest it's against
the law vandalism trespassing breaking
Windows shutting down campuses forcing
the cancellation of classes and
graduations none of this is a peaceful
protest threatening people intimidating
people instilling fearing people is not
peaceful protest it's against the law
the senent is essential to democracy but
descent must never lead to disorder or
to denying the rights of others so
students can finish the semester and
their college education that was Joe
Biden speaking from the White House as
say in the last hour talk to our
correspondent nomia ikbal in a moment or
two but let's speak first to Dolores
Quintana a reporter at the Santa Monica
mirror who was covering the UCLA protest
welcome Dolores to the program give me
an idea first of all I know you were
there overnight what it was
like hi um yes I have to say that um
last night and I yes I was there all
night until they started clearing the
camp and then I had to leave because
they were telling people that they would
be arrested um it was a lot calmer than
it was the previous night the previous
night was very frightening I'll be very
honest even as a reporter
none of us are
safe now I spoke to a democratic
strategist a little earlier on the
program who talked about anarchists at
many of these protests you were there
just give me your assessment of those
people in the encampment there at
UCLA well the people at the encampment
and who are students they actually are
uh very nice uh they're very smart
they're very organized
um would I call them wild anarchists not
at all as a matter of fact um they were
they had had a media check-in at their
Camp from the very first day so they
recognized the importance of you know
being able to talk to the media in a a
rational and uh engaging way
um you know um I think there may be a
thought that somehow the violence that
happened last night was the fault of the
pro of the protesters who were students
and it absolutely was not we were
listening to Joe Biden only a short time
ago he concluded that news conference
saying there'd be no change in his
administration's policy do you think
there is any chance of a change in the
universities policy these protesters
have been demanding that the
universities divest from links with
Israel is there do you get any sense
there's any movement in the universities
on that key
demand I think that because of the
violence that happened that they're
going they're going to have to do an
investigation because the UC police
stood by and did nothing uh when
reporters were being assaulted when the
students of the school were being
assaulted by people who clearly did not
go to to UCLA um I think it might be a
slow process but I also think that these
students aren't going to give up and
even though the the encampment has been
taken down I wouldn't count them out
well that's exactly my final question I
was going to ask you for your sense of
whether this the is this the end of the
protests or just a pause do you get the
sense that those protesters will be back
and are those police likely to stay in
largish numbers on site on campus
well I think maybe in the coming days uh
right now UCLA's campus is actually shut
down for Thursday and Friday they are
they're only doing remote classes and
they've told students to stay away from
Roy
quad um I believe 132 students were
arrested according to ABC
News which is a fraction of the people
who are actually in the encampment in my
belief uh the the population was kind of
liquid
um but I don't think that's even half of
the people who are actually there so
um I think that you this may be a summer
of protest in the United States um to
try and get colleges to divest from in
particular Black Rock which is a private
Equity company yes that the students
believe um you know basically are
contributing their money is contributing
to the war in Palestine and Gaza Dolores
qu I have to leave it there sorry to cut
across you but uh thank you so much for
giving us that assessment there of those
events overnight at UCLA and perhaps
what we like to see in the coming weeks
let's turn to our correspondent Nom
ikbal our North America correspondent
she's in New York of course we saw those
protest at Colombia University about 36
hours ago and nomia you were listening
to the president what was your
assessment of what we heard from Joe
Biden well I think there was some
pressure on President Biden to speak out
the last time we'd heard from him was
April the 22nd about the campus protests
and many had felt that his comments were
were pretty vague but he's trying to
strike a balance he said that uh people
students had the right to peaceful
protest but uh uh it was about the
unlawfulness uh the unlawful nature of
some of the protests just looking you
know obviously made some notes about
what he said he said that people have
the right to protest but not caused
chaos his point is dissent not disorder
and um we understand a senior White
House official had said that the
president wanted to speak out this
morning given what's happened uh and
given the number of violent incidents
over the past 48 Hours you know we've
seen uh all those TS been cleared from
UCLA we've seen those signs of VI those
scenes of violence on the the West Coast
there's been more than a thousand
arrests as well so far um but you know
for the president it is complicated
because there are dueling domestic and
uh foreign policies here um which have
sort of merged into one now and he said
at the end of the the conference at the
end of the speech that he wasn't going
to change his policy in the Middle East
that's something also he's trying to
balance as well uh but I think um it it
he he there was pressure on him to say
something thing I'm not sure that he
will have pleased um both sides in what
he said briefly namia our previous guest
spoke about uh she anticipates a summer
of protests uh that is potentially
problematic for a president in the
months leading up to a presidential
election yes I think at best President
Biden is hoping this Fizzles away and
that people forget and when I do ask
students uh does this affect your vote
they don't want to be drawn into that um
I think at worst it continues so
President Biden is's already pretty much
heckled at a lot of events he goes to by
Pro Palestinian supporters um but yes it
is we're about 6 months away from the
election we'll have to see just how much
this factors into uh young people's
voting remember he he needs them on side
he wants to build a coalition of young
voters to help him secure an election
victory in November norel live for us

you but",20240502

to them we've been able to collect CCTV
footage and mobile phone footage witness
testimony and information about the
movements of the military that day and
this has allowed us to create a timeline
of those
shootings in the afternoon a convoy of
at least six Israeli armored vehicles
were returning from a nearby raid we've
tracked their routs across Janine which
took them past the street where basil
and Adam
were the two boys and around seven
friends were out on the
street CCTV footage from a Shop shows
basil in the foreground here holding
something in his right hand and making a
movement with it with his left hand
towards it you can then see him shot hot
and falling
backwards more bullets hit the ground
nearby
him video from another angle shows
8-year-old Adam slightly further down
that same street from basil he's shot in
the back of his head as he's trying to
run
away he also falls this time forwards
and is then dragged behind a
car we were also able to obtain another
crucial video of this incident which is
a nearby boy who was filming on his
phone at the time he was able to capture
one of the Israeli military vehicles
driving by when this footage is slowed
down and enhanced it shows the driver's
door opening can see that right
here the driver has a direct view of
those boys they're around 24 M away from
basil and 36 M away from
Adam we know that at least 11 shots were
fired from the direction of the armored
vehicle Because We examined the bullet
strikes at the
scene we've also got a hold of copies of
basil and Adams medical reports and they
show us that two bullets struck Basil's
chest and another one hit Adam in the
back of his head now the exact rules
around when soldiers can and can't use
lethal force in the West Bank are secret
but some of the rules that apply
elsewhere are
public guidelines of the Israeli Defense
Forces state that the use of lethal
Force must be a last resort and that it
must be proportionate in relation to the
danger suggesting that basil and Adam
would have needed to pose a serious
threat to
soldiers according to all the video
evidence that we've examined 8-year-old
Adam was not armed when he was shot in
the back of his head the Israeli Army
has said that the suspects had been
attempting to hurl explosives towards
their forces which put them in immediate
danger they also shared this annotated
picture with us that they say shows an
explosive device lying on the ground
close to where basil was shot the object
looks consistent with a type of very
small pipe bomb that is used in the West
Bank but we can't fully verify the image
itself we've shown our findings to
international human rights experts Dr
lorrence Hill corthorn the co-director
of the center for international law told
us that the soldiers were in armored
vehicles even if they were a threat they
should have driven away and planned an
arrest rather than defaulting to
apparently indiscriminate lethal Force
which is a violation of international
law Ben Su the UN special rorer on human
rights and counterterrorism has told us
that while there may be questions about
the use of lethal force in Basil's case
the killing of Adam in his view appears
to be a war crime",20240502
Rb-3hTd_bYo,University protests: New York police arrest around 300 in campus raids | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\University protests New York police arrest around 300 in campus raids  BBC News.jpg,"a very good evening the confrontations
between Pro Palestinian protesters and
the police are continuing on campuses
across the United States 12 protesters
were arrested this afternoon at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison as
police cleared an encampment there
tensions are also high in Los Angeles
where overnight counter protesters
attack Pro Palestinian demonstrators on
the campus footage from the scene
changed people using sticks and poles to
attack a makeshift barricade that had
been put up around the encampment police
did eventually respond to what the
University's Vice Chancellor described
as horrific acts of violence let him go
let him go there were scuffles too in
New York where police arrested dozens of
pro Palestinian demonstrators who were
HED up in a building at Colombia
University and they removed a protest
encampment a total of 300 people were
detained at Colombia and City College
elsewhere in the city the speaker of the
US House of representativ Mike Johnson
said the authorities needed to be called
in what are University officials waiting
on what do they need to see before they
stand up to these terrorist sympathizers
and that is exactly what they are what's
worse though is that Colombia's choice
to ignore the safety of their Jewish
students and appease anti-semites has
inspired even more hatefield protests to
pop up across the country and what we're
seeing right now is people wave
Hezbollah fles flags and and Hamas Flags
their homemade signs supporting what
happened on October 7th it's
outrageous the president of Colombia
University Manu shafik who's been under
immense political pressure in recent
days has appealed for a period of calm
we regret the protesters have chosen to
escalate the situation through their
actions said a statement we made the
decision early in the morning that this
was a law enforcement matter the NYPD
were best positioned to determine and
execute an appropriate response but this
is not confined solely to New York
protest that began organically some
weeks ago has now spread to 20 different
states and over 30 universities there
were dozens of arrests at the University
of Texas this week protests from coast
to coast Riot police on the grounds of
ivy league universities Yale Harvard
Berkeley the George Washington
University in DC it is spreading into a
national movement with protest
reappearing in places
where they have previously been cleared
so let's go first then to our
correspondent Emma vardy who sent this
from the UCLA it's been a political
mindfield for universities over the last
few weeks of course trying to strike
that right balance between upholding uh
Free Speech protecting students on
campus who just want to go about their
day and and then dealing with the claims
of anti-Semitism from some Jewish
students as well and all of those
tensions really boiled over here last
night it seems that what happened
happened at around 11:00 last night here
the pal prop Palestinian demonstration
the encampment here there was a surge of
counter protesters that led to Violent
clashes between these groups of of rival
protesters there were wooden barricades
that were then picked up and used as As
Weapons there was fireworks thrown uh
over the crowd and and there had been a
relatively small number of police on
site at that moment so the university
called in at the Los Angeles Police
Department the LAPD and of of course
they then suddenly rushed to try to
break up this violence but by then it it
had really escalated and it took police
a number of hours to separate those
protesters what there is now behind me
is that encampment as I say from the pro
Palestinian demonstration which remains
there outside the central the main
library of UCLA but it's now uh the
Rival demonstration by pro-israel
supporters is separated by some iron
railing so everything feels a lot calmer
now but it's a very strange atmosphere
for a university C campus and many
students and lots of teachers arrived
here to get today some of them had
driven quite quite distances they told
me and then pretty frustrated to find
that all classes were cancelled and at
UCLA there was particular frustration uh
because many students today would have
been taking midterm exams and had got
here especially for that some they told
me stayed up all night revising the
night before just to to come in and find
nothing happening here today well let's
cross from West Coast to East Coast Nom
ikbal is at Columbia University for us
this evening that statement from the
Columbia president man ship shaik it's
rather interesting because what we've
seen is that where police have been
taking down encampments protests have
sprung up again and now she is appearing
appealing for that period of calm noria
it remains to be seen whether she'll get
it well at the moment Christian it is
pretty calm and peaceful I mean as as
calm as New York City can be I guess uh
it's still noisy of course but it's
nothing compared to obviously what it
was last night where New York police
seem to carry out this coordinated raid
on encampments in different parts of the
city there are several universities here
uh Colombia is almost like the the main
Hub it's the the
focal point for these Nationwide
protests other encampments have been
inspired by uh by the pro Palestinian
supporters here but president shafik has
been under huge pressure from right-wing
politicians who say that she's not doing
enough to crack down on these protests
and then also from many of the the
student protesters themselves who are
really angry at what they say has been a
heavy-handed approach uh the police did
go in on April the 18th if you remember
uh and then there was a fear by some
students that it could happen again uh
there was this deadline that was set on
Monday for 2 p.m. for them to clear out
uh it kind of passed without incident
but then we saw the raids happen last
night uh but president shafik is is
saying look I'm I'm not against your
cuse I'm against uh your actions and I
think what really it came down to was
there's a there's a distinction between
protesting and disruption and when we
saw that building being taken over that
uh was the point where the police felt
uh sorry the president felt that the
police had to come in when you say it
there's a distinction between protesting
and
disruption is that how Republicans it
because I listened to the Senators this
afternoon and they didn't seem to be
making that distinction I mean people
are entitled under their first amendment
rights to go out and protest about a war
they have concerns about and yet they
they were talking about little Gaza and
supporters of Hamas they were all being
characterized as
one which the pro Palestinian supporters
say is just not reflective of their
movements I mean I've spent time in the
encampment speaking to them there are
lots of Jewish supporters among them and
some of the students have have made this
sort of point to me about how uh really
conservative politicians Republicans
particularly have been for years going
on about uh free speech on campus free
speech on campus and uh cracking down
and Council culture but they say it's
simply because they don't like this
particular speech that actually if you
look at uh you know the concept of free
speech in America that they are allowed
to protest they are allowed to
peacefully Pro protest so you know a lot
of them very angry but you know as many
of them say they're not surprised at the
the the right-wing politicians view on
this I think what many of them are
frustrated by is uh they feel that the
president uh sort of caved into that
president shafik was in front of
Congress a couple of weeks ago and she
was questioned by Republicans over what
is she doing to crack down on
anti-Semitism uh but uh look um students
uh they say these protests aren't going
to end and it's worth mentioning that
this was going on before October the 7th
there is a long history of uh people
here who've been protesting against the
Israeli government and Israeli policies
uh but for now the protests have abated
it remains to be seen whether they pop
up again just looking at these pictures
of
UCLA I mean are these people that are
attacking the encampment are they
students or are they professional
agitators and people who are putting the
universities there as a focal point I
mean are these people from Los from
wider Los Angeles that are getting
involved in
this well this is one of the points that
certainly here the New York uh city
mayor Eric Adams has made he says that
there are these outside agitators to
quote what he said that have come in and
caused this trouble um but a lot of the
students here don't really buy it they
say that they want to see evidence of of
of that um uh because they feel that the
whole movement has been tarred by these
accusations the police just haven't
given us any information on who these
individuals could be uh so at UCLA there
is also speculation and reports that
again it's Outsiders that have come in
uh maybe from different groups to try
and cause trouble for each side and that
uh extreme extremists I guess on both
sides are not representative of how
students on both sides feel but as I say
we've just not been given any details
yet on who exactly the police thinks
that these outside agitators are and
where is Joe Biden on this what what is
the president saying about the protest
it's a difficult one for him because of
course the the youth vote is is very
important within his
Coalition well President Biden's been
across this the whole time and he has
said that students have the right to
free speech but he's also been very
critical of the pro Palestinian protest
saying that uh uh he completely condemns
anti-Semitism as I say the the movement
has denied that and again today uh the
the White House spokeswoman released a a
statement saying that people are allowed
to to protest free speech is allowed
it's when you start destructing start
obstructing but you're right it's a
difficult spot for him it's very
unpredictable challenge because at best
I think he will probably hope it's a
distraction especially as we head
towards the election but at worst this
could really gain momentum I mean he's
pretty much heckled at lots of events he
turns up to the State of the Union
Address in March uh his moate had to be
rerooted from the capital to the white
from the White House of the capital is a
pretty short route because of pro
Palestinian demonstrators who had staged
a sit in on the road so um and I do ask
a lot of the students is this going to
affect your vote come November many of
them are not committed to that they say
that they don't want to think too far
ahead to the election that right now
what they're concentrating on is trying
to to ra a voice for people suffering in
Gaza namia thanks for your time this
evening",20240501
1PkO4tUcUOk,Israel-Gaza war: UN chief calls Israel's airstrikes in Rafah an ‘unbearable escalation’ | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel-Gaza war UN chief calls Israel's airstrikes in Rafah an ‘unbearable escalation’  BBC News.jpg,"the UN Secretary General Antonio gues
has just said that an Israeli offensive
on Rafa would be an unbearable
escalation he was responding to Benjamin
netanyahu's comments that Israel will
carry out an operation in Rafa
regardless of whether a ceasefire deal
is reached with Hamas the Israeli Prime
Minister was speaking at a meeting with
the families of hostages where he
reiterated that Israel would eliminate
Hamas and Achieve total Victory take a
listen we will inter refer because we
have no other Jo we will destroy the
Hamas battalions there we will complete
all the objectives of the war including
the repatriation of all our
abductees well the Israeli Prime
Minister there saying Israel would enter
Rafa regardless of a deal and despite
its main Ally the US repeatedly saying
it doesn't support an allout offensive
there well Rafa is a city in southern
Gaza where more than a million
Palestinians are Sheltering after being
ordered to evacuate there on the grounds
that it was a safe Zone this is what
it's like in Rafa now many residential
buildings reduced to Rubble large camps
for displaced Palestinians like that one
have sprung up around Rafer and
thousands of children live there you can
see plumes of smoke from an Israeli air
strike close by well the UN Secretary
General Antonio gues urged Israel
against invading Rafa recent weeks have
seen air strikes on the Rafa
area a military assault on Rafa would be
an unbearable escalation
killing thousands more civilians and
forcing hundreds of thousands to
flee while a retired Israeli Army kernel
told us why she believes Israel's
assault on Gaza will go ahead regardless
of a ceasefire deal the only place that
Kamas still has full military capability
like what they did on October 7th is
under Rafa it's not in Rafa it's under
Rafa in that Subterranean Arena so I do
think it would be postponed I don't
think it would ever be
cancel so what does Miss netanyahu's
latest pledge mean for the ceasefire
deal currently on the table well Israel
says it will wait until Wednesday for a
response from Hamas a reminder the deal
put forward includes a 40-day truce in
return for the release of some hostages
it would also allow for displaced
families to return to Northern Gaza it's
also reported to involve new wording on
restoring calm to Gaza designed to
satisfy hamas's demand for a permanent
SE fire well Naf Alani is the former
Qatari director of Defense intelligence
operations remember Qatar is a crucial
player in the talks here's his
assessment on the likelihood of the deal
going through Hamas and other factions
in Gaza have said that they don't may
not have a clear number of all the
hostages where they're located there is
the possibility in fact we know that
there have been uh hostages that have
been killed uh through either bombings
or or internally in in Gaza depending on
on the story it's quite unclear uh so
getting back all the hostages is the
unclear bit about this now moving
forward this is structured differently
now will the Israelis stick to the plan
and not attack Rafa before that that is
the big question because if that
continues to happen it's very um
unrealistic to expect that Hamas would
agree to AAS fire well the top us
diplomats Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin has just arrived in Tel Aviv
these are the latest pictures of that
arrival he'll be discussing the
ceasefire negotiations he arrived there
from Jordan and here's what he had to
say before boarding that flight our
Focus right now is on getting a
ceasefire and hostages home that is the
most urgent thing and it's also um I
think what is achievable because the
Israelis have put a strong proposal on
the table they've demonstrated that
they're willing to compromise and now
it's on
Hamas Let's cross live now and speak to
our security correspondent Frank Gardner
who is in Jerusalem and Frank how hard
is Mr blinken's job going to be now
given the rhetoric from Mr Netanyahu
today about the inevitability of a Rafa
offensive well he hasn't put a time
scale on that offensive I'm sure that um
the US state department won't find that
particularly helpful um they've also
reiterated their View that they have not
yet seen what they say is a credible
Israeli plan that would address their
humanitarian concerns about the plight
of the Palestinians in Rafa the US does
not want to see a US operation in Rafa
um yet the mood music that's coming out
of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
today is very robust all about total
victory of pursuing the last remaining
Hamas battalions to some extent he's
throwing a boat to the hardliners in his
own cabinet um people who said that if
there is a ceasefire deal that um lets
Hamas off uh without a ruar offensive
they will walk so you know Benjamin
netanyahu's got a lot of juggling to do
he's trying to please all people at the
same time the Americans the negotiators
and the right- Wingers in his own um
party as well as the families of the
hostage uh the hostages who are not
impressed so far by the failure of the
Israeli government to get those hostages
out the last time we saw a mass release
of hostages was in November how was it
done was it done by military pressure no
it was done by a mediated deal by the
cutteries and the hostage families
believe that that's the only or at least
the best way to get their loved ones out
that doesn't seem to be the view ofe of
prime minister Netanyahu who seems
determined to press on with this
operation it's risky stuffff because you
know if you're going to be fighting to
get the hostages out there's a high
chance that those who are Left Alive
could be caught up in the crossfire
Frank thank you we've been talking over
the past few days about those protests
springing up in campuses across the
United States well Pro Palestinian
students are demanding their
universities divest from Israel over its
war in Gaza today we've received these
dramatic pictures from The Chapel Hill
Campus of the UN University of North
Carolina many protesters were detained
after the university sent them a demand
to vacate their encampment well this is
the campus at Colombia's University the
unrest there shows no signs of abating
it's here that the protest camps and
demonstrations first began before
spreading elsewhere well Susan Bowski is
the professor of writing at Colombia
University School of Arts she's also a
Jewish faculty member I asked her
whether she ever felt the pro tests were
unsafe or
anti-semitic So I myself who have been
on campus for many of the last days um
have not personally experienced anything
anti-semitic um I do not feel in any way
unsafe on campus and I know that a large
number of other Jewish faculty members
feel that way I've also heard reports of
anti-Semitic incidents and I know that
some Jewish faculty members don't feel
safe on campus but I myself most
certainly do I have seen many words
being thrown around that are strongly
against Israelis Israeli policies and
Israel's um you know Slaughter of
civilians in Gaza over these last months
and certainly there's a great deal of
anti-israeli government speech happening
on campus I have not felt speech that
individually targeted me as a member or
specifically Jews as Jews
well that was a professor from Colombia
Let's cross live now and speak to the
BBC's nomia ikbal who is at Columbia
University New York and Tom bitman who's
at the University of Texas in Austin uh
nomia to you first of all if I may uh
we've been reading that there have been
threats of exclusion expulsion in fact
of students who are involved in the
encampment what more do we know about
these
threats that's right the protest
escalated as we saw last night when some
Pro Palestinian demonstrators uh took
over Hamilton Hall and we saw some
scenes of uh people smashing through
windows and and what have you and so
that sparked the university to release a
new statement I'm just going to quote
you exactly what they said they said we
regret that protesters have chosen to
escalate their situ the situation
through their actions our top priority
is restoring safety and order on our
campus and so those people that were
involved in that we don't know exactly
who they were the university is saying
they face expulsion on top of that
you've got students who are being
suspended now uh yesterday the
university issued this 2 p.m. local
deadline for them to clear out the
encampment that didn't happen in terms
of uh the students doing that they stood
St strong they said they wouldn't they
wouldn't move uh what I can tell you
also is that one of the lead negotiators
that was talking to the university sort
of like a conduit between uh students uh
the protesters and University leadership
has been suspended I spoke to him just
uh moment ago and he said he doesn't
know on what basis he was suspended
because he had an agreement with the
university as a negotiator that he could
go back and forth he said he never
entered the encampment after 2 p.m. he's
a Palestinian uh student uh who has come
from Syria he said that he just doesn't
know now what where where his future is
uh if this hearing does go ahead he's
due to have a hearing at some point
along with many other students he could
permanently be kicked out of the us but
he did also say to me that he doesn't
think the protests are over the ends
just by the means and that's to quote
him Mahmud KH he said to me it doesn't
compare to what people in Gaza are going
through right now so despite what the
the University is doing and it's
becoming very robust and taking action
against students for many of them uh
this hasn't that this hasn't quelled
what they're doing it hasn't uh put
their protest to an end we're still
seeing outside the the gates here uh at
Columbia University there are still some
protests going on outside but security
has tightened up here okay n yet thanks
uh let's cross live now to the
University of Texas at Austin and speak
to Tom bitman and Tom we heard their
Nomo talking about uh those those
threats of arrests of uh uh of uh
disciplinary action not putting students
off at Colombia what's the feeling in
the University of Texas and
Austin well so far here today all very
calm all very quiet we've seen in the
last 20 minutes or so a group of uh well
we're about two dozen or so protesters
but I think even more Gathering now
um as you can see there but it was
yesterday that um the EXP the tensions
really exploded here um when once again
for the second time in a week uh the
situation was that the state police the
troopers were called in armed with
batons with uh mace um pepper spray uh
and they were um they came here after
the University Administration called in
those forces they say that the
protesters who at that point hadn't
encampment here had refused to heed uh
the university rules that the encampment
should be removed and so there was some
pretty violent scenes as some of the
protesters were dragged out um by the uh
Texas Troopers and uh I was just
chatting to a couple of protested hereo
said uh that uh pepper spray was used
against them a bit further up as a van a
police van was moving taking some of
those arrested away one of the protested
telling me that he was maed himself and
two others uh he said quite badly hurt
when that pepper spray was used this had
all really escalated significantly last
week because here in tin it's one of the
places where the protests really gain
momentum in solidarity with what was
happening in Colombia when the police
earlier this month first went into
Colombia to remove the encampments uh
and as far as the the protesters were
concerned in an extremely heavy-handed
way we then saw the protest spread uh
significantly and build momentum in many
other parts of the US one of those was
here and it was really the encampments
that the University Administration was
saying um was unacceptable uh the
university for its part saying that it
had given repeated warnings to the
protesters to move it says they hadn't
and accuses them of escalating the
situation it talked about for example
baseball siiz rocks being strategically
placed on the lawn here I was just
chatting to one of the protesters he
said that um there was you know there
are stones on the lawn here and people
have been using them as they do to weigh
down their papers in the wind so they're
saying that was complete nonsense from
the University Administration but
clearly more potential here for things
to escalate again we saw some more uh
police just watching on over the
protests and more protesters likely to
gather now Tom bitman in Austin and
nomia ikbal Columbia University thank
you both for joining us today well let's
just take you briefly now to show you
these live pictures coming into us from
North Carolina the campus at uh at the
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
you can see a group of protesters
gathered around a Palestinian flag being
flown on a m we know that police on this
campus have detained multiple protesters
already during demonstrations today in
fact the university has said that uh
roughly 30 people were detained earlier
on this morning local time when they
clash with campus police they were
refusing to leave the area so there we
have a bit of more of a flavor of these
Pro protests happening in another
University campus that is in uh the
University campus of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill",20240430
HIahgNL-Cs4,Gaza: Israel PM says Rafah attack will go ahead ‘with or without’ truce deal  | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza Israel PM says Rafah attack will go ahead ‘with or without’ truce deal   BBC News.jpg,"Hamas leaders are considering a new
Middle East ceasefire proposal from
Israel the deal includes a 40-day truce
in return for the release of some
hostages it would also allow for
displaced families to return to Northern
Gaza it's reported to involve new
wording on restoring calm to Gaza that's
designed to satisfy hamas's demand for a
permanent ceasefire a source close to
the talks told the BBC the new proposal
from Israel is significantly different
from previous offers the US Secretary of
State Anthony blink called this deal
extraordinarily generous that view
echoed by the UK's foreign secretary
Lord
Cameron all the pressure in the world
and all the eyes of the world should be
on them today saying take that deal it
will bring about this stop in the
fighting that we all want to see so
badly according to Israel 133 hostages
are still being held by Hamas and Gaza
at least 30 of them are presumed dead
mediators from Egypt Qatar and the US
have been attempting for weeks to broker
a deal to bring another pause in the
fighting now One Source has told the BBC
they are cautiously optimistic about the
prospects of this deal being accepted in
a development though Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that
Israel will carry out an offensive
against Hamas and Rafa regardless of
whether or not is fire deal has been
reached well as those negotiations take
place fighting continues in Gaza we've
seen smoke rising over the center of the
strip earlier today as airr hit the
territory the health Ministry said there
had been a further 47 deaths in the last
day it says more than
34,500 people have died since the
conflict began almost 7 months ago
following the Hamas attack on Israel on
October the 7th our Middle East
correspondent yanell is in Jerusalem
this Hamas delegation that was in Cairo
meeting Egyptian and katri mediators uh
left late yesterday and we understand
that they're now in consultations uh
with the top Hamas leadership um Arab
media suggesting that they will get back
to the mediators um by the end of
tomorrow with their response to the
latest deal that's on the table now uh
feeding into all of that we do have
these new comments by uh the Israeli
Prime Minister on the one hand he's
reiterating what he's said now for many
weeks that uh Israel is still determined
to go into Rafa in the very south of the
Gaza Strip to eliminate Mass battalions
there uh that they'll do that with or
without a new hostage deal but obviously
the timing here is of the essence this
is a very sensitive moment um and there
are fears that you know anything could
Scupper um a new deal at this point are
you we're just seeing pictures there of
Benjamin Netanyahu the war cabinet
continues to meet of course how much
domestic disagreement is there and
disagreement within the cabinet about
what should happen with
Rafa I mean within the overall cabinet
of of the coalition government led by Mr
net yahu you do have some really deep
divisions now and um those on the far
right have really been saying that
Israel needs to prioritize going into
Rafa um in order to win this war um one
uh farri right Minister bezel smrd said
the government had no right to exist uh
if it didn't prioritize that and then in
response we had Benny Gans who's a
member of the war cabin is more of a
Centrist um coming back uh saying that
the government had no right to exist if
it blocked a hostage deal uh so you can
see there is that Dynamic going on the
latest comments by Mr Netanyahu do
appear to put him more on the side of
his far-right ministers but he's also
going to be under a lot more
International pressure in the coming
hours as we're expecting the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinken uh to
come to meet Israeli leaders uh the US
and others have really been uh pushing
for a new deal at this point that would
bring home um Israeli hostages and in
exchange um have a sort of six day uh
six week ceasefire uh in the Gaza Strip
um and we've had you know various uh
Western leaders coming out saying that
this is something that that is positive
um Arab ministers supporting that as
well Yan we've already heard from Mr
blinkin who said that the US has not yet
seen a plan that gives us confidence
that civilians can be effectively
protected in Rafa how would you judge
the US influence on Benjamin Netanyahu
at the moment and their
leverage well the US position is very
much that uh really because of the
number of people in Rafa down along the
Egyptian border that have been displaced
by the fighting something like 1.4
million people crammed into a very small
area that means that no uh ground
offensive can really take place um
effectively there it's going to be
impossible to move that many people
um in a way that you know Israel can go
in with the force that it wants to to go
after what it says of four Hamas
battalions that are still based in that
City it's the one part of the Gaza Strip
where there has not been a full ground
offensive up to now um but it's really
not clear just how much uh leverage the
US has over Israel of course we know
that on the international Stage IT
consistently uh Shields Israel uh that
it is a major donor has just recently
approved approved billions more dollars
in military aid for Israel um but you
know Israel has consistently made clear
that when it comes to issues of its own
security um it will very much take
advice uh from the Americans we know
that there have meetings been taken
place um to try to discuss alternatives
to a full ground Invasion o of Rafa with
Israeli and US officials but in the end
Israel says it makes its own decisions

campaign in Gaza and look at the
protests against it that are sweeping
across college campuses in the US
Nationwide rallies during which there
have been hundreds of arrests are
showing no sign of stopping at uccla a
pro Palestinian encampment has grown in
size in recent days as has a group of
pro-israeli counter protesters on Sunday
there were skirmishes between the pro
Palestinian and pro-israel groups after
a barrier separating the two sides was
breached let's hear from a protester
there we heard about the counter protest
showing up uh they're trying to show up
saying that um this this part is just
full of hatred um so we're just here to
counter them uh we want to show support
to the US protesters who have been here
um in their cabins
uh well the White House has insisted
demonstrations must remain peaceful
here's the National Security Council
spokesman John Kirby speaking to ABC we
certainly respect the right of peaceful
protest uh people should have the the
ability to to air their their views and
to share their perspectives publicly but
it has to be peaceful uh we'll leave it
to local authorities to determine um how
these protests are managed but we want
them to be peaceful protests and
obviously we don't want to see anybody
hurt uh in the process of peacefully
protesting uh but again the president
understands
that well the students are calling for
their universities to boycott company
ianes and individuals with ties to
Israel major protest camps and
demonstrations were first seen at
Colombia University in New York since
then though they've spread across the
United States take a look at this it
shows the universities with the biggest
protests the University of Southern
California has canceled its graduation
ceremony on what it says as safety
grounds in Austin Texas the governor
ordered state troopers to arrest
demonstrators there have also been
hundreds of arrests at universities in
Texas Atlanta California and Virginia
these pictures you're seeing here are
from Virginia
Tech well our North America
correspondent nomia ikbal is currently
in Columbia University in New York for
us and nomia Columbia University
administrators have ordered students
participating in the campus encampment
there to disband or face disciplinary
action have they disbanded it looks like
judging from what's Happening behind you
that they
haven't they haven't uh yes the
encampment is behind me and students Got
a notification around about midday to
say that there was this call for them to
disband by 2: p.m that came from the
president of the University president
shafik who's under Fire uh by students
uh because of the way Riot police went
in last week uh she's also Under Fire
from right-wing politicians who say
she's not doing enough to stop these uh
protests on campus which they have
claimed anti-semitic something that the
pro Palestinian protesters have
completely denied but what's happening
at the moment is that you've got uh
students and they're not part of the
encampment they are other students who
have joined in support of the students
inside the encampment and they're sort
of circling around if we can just have a
look that they some of them are walking
around um and they've been chanting the
demands uh which is Boycott divest and
sanction uh sort of outlining what it is
the students want essentially the
students want uh Columbia University and
this is the same demands that students
are making at other protests around the
country they want their institutions to
effectively cut economic and academic
ties with Israeli
institutions and I've been speaking to
students all weekend and they say all
those demands have to be met but the
president of this University today said
that the negotiations have uh failed uh
which means those demands aren't being
met and they and the University
president the administ ators want the
students to essentially clear out they
have said they're going nowhere and just
as we were coming in we saw the police
asking up barricades we saw one police
officer with zip ties I did ask them
what is the plan do they plan to go in
and arrest students again of course they
they said no comment uh so right now the
situation is you know students have have
been very kind of the ones I've been
speaking to not just here but NYU as
well a campus that's a university that's
30 minutes away they are feeling tense
but also they are adamant that they're
not going anywhere until their demands
are met but the university wants them
out particularly by May the 15th here

vpifvhSqS5I,US ‘hopeful’ Hamas will accept new Israel ceasefire offer | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US ‘hopeful’ Hamas will accept new Israel ceasefire offer  BBC News.jpg,"the US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin has said he's hopeful that Hamas
will accept what he has described as an
extraordinarily generous Gaza ceasefire
offer from Israel we've been hearing in
the last few minutes the proposed
ceasefire would be for 40 days Mr
blinkin who's attending talks with his
Regional counterparts in Saudi Arabia
was speaking as a delegation from Hamas
attended parallel ceasefire negotiations
in Cairo after weeks of impass Hamas is
reported to have no major issues with a
revised plan approved by Israel it's
said to include new wording on a
cessation of hostilities Mr blinkin
reaffirmed us opposition to a planned
Israeli offensive on Rafa City meanwhile
saying he seen no plan that protects
civilians there 20 people died in the
latest Israeli air strikes
overnight in this moment the only thing
standing between the people of Gaza and
a ceasefire is
Hamas they have to decide decide and
they have to decide quickly uh so we're
we're looking to that um and I'm hopeful
that they will make the right decision
and we can have a fundamental change in
the in the
dynamic the UK's foreign secretary
meanwhile has given more detail on the
ceasefire deal on the table it does seem
to me there is now you know let's be
frank a pretty generous offer of uh you
know sustained 40 day ceasefire the
release of potentially thousands of
Palestinian prisoners in in return for
the release of these hostages who've now
been in captivity for over 200 days um
so I hope Hamas do take this deal and
frankly all the pressure in the world
and all the eyes of the world should be
on them today saying take that deal it
will bring about this stop in the
fighting that we all want to see so
badly and let's go live now to Jerusalem
and our security correspondent Frank
Gardner Frank hello to you it certainly
is a critical moment uh with a real
sense of momentum it
seems there really is I mean although
it's right at the end of pek here of
Passover there is a feeling that there
could be a real breakthrough here
because both sides Hamas and Israel have
they've made concessions there's no
question about it so Hamas had
originally insisted on an end to the war
and Israel is not agreeing to that but
it is agreeing
to withdraw its um some of its forces
and to allow the passage of the return
of um Palestinians who were currently
are basically kettled right into the
south in Rafa to their homes in the
north of Gaza and that's been a really
key demand um they also dropped their
insistence that it has to be at least 40
hostages the figure that's being talked
around is a bit lower than that around
33 so there is some give here because
there is enormous pressure on both sides
from the CES from the Egyptians from the
Americans from the French to get this
deal through and remember that behind
the scenes here the cabin at the war
cabinet in this country Israel is
divided you've got those who don't want
to see any deal at all to us they want
to see the Egypt they want to see the
Israeli military go in hard smash their
way into Rafa
and eliminate the last remaining few
battalions of Hamas the people that
carried out the atrocities of October
the 7th but the US has made it very
clear they are opposed to any operation
in in Rafa as it stands at the moment
because they don't think that Israel is
capable of protecting all those
civilians that are that are currently
Sheltering them so we've been hearing
about this phrase uh sustainable calm uh
Frank and I wonder does potentially a
40-day ceasefire represent that or
something
more well look what everybody's hoping
for is to be able to bring an end to
this thing alog together what nobody
outside this country wants is to see
this truth end and for the whole thing
to begin all over again um now there are
people um certainly in the Israeli
military and intelligence and security
establishment who you say look we've got
unfinished business in Gaza Yahya sinoa
the architect of the October the 7th
attacks and others um are still at large
probably in the tunnels underneath Rafa
if we don't go into Rafa then it's
unfinished business and it'll just pop
up like a hydra's head and we'll face
the same threats all over again but the
sheer humanitarian the depth and pro the
extent of the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza being pushed to the brink of famine
has really galvanized the International
Community to try and end the hostilities
or at least bring it bring a temporary
pause to them uh and some respite and
there are there is great progress on the
humanitarian front much more Aid is
getting into Gaza this great big pontoon
is being built in central Gaza that's
going to reach out in like a kind of
finger out into the Eastern
Mediterranean Sea for offloading tons of
aid more Crossing points are opening
more trucks are getting in so but that's
not of course that's just a Band-Aid
it's that's just a sticking plaster for
the the greater problems which are PAL
the Palestinians still don't have a
state and there is no sign from this
Israeli government that it wants to ever
depart or to give them a a a kind of
roote map to that's end State okay Frank
thank you very much Frank Gardner there
are sec security correspondent in
Jerusalem and let's get some more
analysis on this story now this
developing story because joining us is
Mark kimt former US Deputy assistant
secretary of defense for the Middle East
and a former Brigadier General thank you
very much for your time today and what's
your reading of this intensive
diplomatic activity first of
all well I think there is some progress
being made uh otherwise secretary
blinkin would not be uh appearing at
these conferences he's putting his
person reputation on the line that
somehow he has brokered a deal between
Israel and uh Egypt and Qatar so I think
we're just going to have to see as your
previous correspondent said there seems
to be some enthusiasm but if it's only
40 or less hostages I think we've still
got a long way to go before a true and
Lasting ceasefire will be in place yeah
and can whatever is being talked about
stop uh an offensive on Rafa we heard
secretary blinken say that you know he's
seen no evidence yet of solid plans to
protect civilians there in
Rafa well again I don't think it will
stop the War I think it will delay the
attack the assault into Rafa as you
remember some time ago prime minister
Netanyahu said before he conducted an
operation into Rafa there would be
sufficient uh housing food water
medicine for the refugees would come out
of Rafa but as secretary blinkin said
there's no evidence that that has been
completed yet so a long way from the
sort of irreversible Pathway to a
two-state solution that the Jordanian
prime minister has been talking
about I think there's an irreversi don't
think we even have a path to the end of
this war much less a two-state
solution okay so um what's next then uh
some sort of temporary cessation not the
sustainable calm that's been mentioned
no I think that's I think you're exactly
right I think this will be a pause this
will not be a secession uh it's clear
the Prime Minister
netanyahu's um objectives to not change
the destruction of Hamas the destruction
of the infrastructure and the return of
the hostages uh this may be a milestone
uh but there are a lot of Milestones
that need to be accomplished the return
of the hostages the defeat of Hamas and
unless prime minister Netanyahu steps
down those will remain his War aims and
just fin and briefly you think the idea
of senior Hamas figures and those
responsible for October the 7th leaving
Gaza do you think that's
likely uh horizontally certainly not
vertically uh thank you very much for
your uh thoughts today Mark kimet former
US Deputy assistant secretary of defense
for the Middle
East thank you",20240429

buak and we start the program in the
Middle East where Israel's foreign
minister has said a planned ground
assault on the southern Gaza City of
refa could be suspended if a deal
emerges to free the hostages still being
held by Hamas Israel cats said that
their freedom was a top priority hostage
release also forms a key part of
international mediation efforts to bring
about a ceasefire in the Gaza War Hamas
has posted a new video which shows two
of the hostages captured during its
October attack Keith seagull and omry
Miran both identify themselves in the
video whilst it's not dated there is a
reference to the recent Passover holiday
it's the second such video that Hamas
considered a terror group by the UK and
US governments has published in the past
few days our correspondent Anna Foster
sent us this update from T Aviv rry
Moran's father was actually already on
the list of confirmed speakers for this
event tonight when he got up on the
stage he talked about the moment he said
he was sitting having coffee with
someone and talking about his grandchild
when the man that he was talking to held
his phone and said look here's a phot a
video they've released a video of omry
now what was also interesting as the
crowd were gathered here tonight is they
showed that video in full it's not
something that that normally happens
because of course when you see the
people in it the two men in this case
looking very malnourished obviously
speaking under Jess sending messages to
their families and and urging the
Israeli government to come to some sort
of arrangement some sort of deal to try
and achieve their release now of course
that deal and those talks have been
going on for weeks and weeks now the
last time we saw a significant hostage
release was at the end of last year at
at one point we were told the talks had
really very much broken down the two
sides weren't really in communic at all
but the Egyptian delegations visit this
week and the further um efforts of the
US and the US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin we're sort of led to believe the
briefings are that perhaps they're
moving slightly closer in terms of
trying to achieve a deal but certainly
those powerful messages that we heard on
the stage tonight from the hostage
families they were talking directly to
Israel's leaders directly to the
politicians and they were saying you
need to do a deal while they're still
alive while we know that our loved ones
are still alive you need to do what they
can to ensure their release now and that
was Anna Foster there the US Secretary
of State Anthony blinkin is set to
travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday as
negotiations between Israel and Hamas
remain in limbo this will be his seventh
trip to the Middle East since the War
Began it's part of President Biden's
efforts to encourage a ceasefire and
prevent the conflict from spreading
he'll also call for the release of those
hostages from the October the 7th attack
back Muhammad Taha is from the BBC
Arabic service and he spoke to me
earlier for more on those fragile
hostage
negotiations both parties are putting
massive amount of pressures on the each
party to accept the the hostage deal
with without massive amount of
conditions so the Israel is putting
pressure they are uh intensifying the
military operation they are threatening
of starting the operation in Rafa
overnight we saw 30 people died in
shelling in Middle Gaza and in RAF 10 of
them are children Israel believes that
only military pressure on Hamas would
make them accept the hostage hostage
deal on the other side we saw Hamas
releasing these uh host hostage videos
that urging uh the Israeli government to
accept the uh that that deal and I heard
a clip of Hamas official saying that
Israel want them voluntarily to hand
back the hostages voluntarily to accept
Israel continuing occupying Gaza
voluntarily accepting not having a
permanent ceasefire and the the Hamas
would say why would on Earth we accept
all of this without a perspective of
ending this war so what is Mr blinkin
likely to achieve I mean he's got a big
job as he heads out tomorrow indeed Mr
blinkin in the in his tours as you said
this is the tour number seven is trying
to put this conflict in a wider context
so he is trying to convince the Arab
countries that you know the United
States is committed to the two-state
solution is committed to the the
longterm solution to the Palestinian
cause he's trying to convince Saudi
Arabia to return back to the path of
normalization the relationship with
Israel he's trying to get the wider
perspective and even Hamas announced
last last week that they are willing to
discuss being disarmed if the two State
solution uh um um path would be would be
viable so he is trying to do that Israel
is is only trying to achieve the the two
main aims of this war destroying Hamas
releasing the hostages and the United
States trying to find a longer deal a
long u um term deal for the Palestinian
cause that would give the uh Americans

ZH7x6VSz3KE,UK forces may be deployed to help deliver Gaza aid | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\UK forces may be deployed to help deliver Gaza aid  BBC News.jpg,"turn to the Middle East and there have
been developments in ceasefire
negotiations between Israel and Hamas
with both sides continuing to review
proposals Egyptian mediators have
arrived in Israel and local media
reporting there's been notable progress
in finding common ground in Gaza itself
the Hamas run Health Ministry says at
least 50 people have been killed in
Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours
this was the scene in Rafa on Friday
night the BBC has learned that British
troops could be deployed on the ground
in Gaza to help deliver Aid via a new
sea route Aid would be delivered from
Cyprus on large ships before being
transferred into trucks and smaller
landing craft the floating Causeway
would be several hundred met long and
anchored firmly into the sand the United
States has decided not to put American
boots on the ground a diplomatic
correspondent James landel is following
the developments from Jerusalem
well this week Katherine the American
defense um Department gave a long
briefing to uh official media in America
about how this new Maritime Aid Corridor
would work but there was a big hole in
the plans and that's because the United
States has made it very clear they are
not going to put us boots on the ground
in cyp in in in Gaza they are not going
to drive those Aid trucks off the
landing craft onto the the floating
pontoon or Causeway when it's
established and onto the beach into a
secure Zone on the beach uh in Gaza so
someone's going to have to do that the
Americans said an unnamed third party
would do it they said it would be a
significant partner of the United States
a nation not some private military
company and my understanding is that one
option being considered by the British
government is that British troops would
drive those trucks now I should be very
clear no decision has been made the
issue has not yet reach the prime
minister's uh desk the mod is not
commenting nor is the Israeli Army but
the British have been very closely
involved in this operation's planning
from the very beginning both in American
headquarters in Florida and also in
Cyprus a British ship is going to be
used as a dormatory for hundreds of
American Service men and women involved
uh and even the the British hydrographic
office has been giving detailed
information to the planners about the
the nature of gaza's Shoreline so it is
a possibility it is an option the
British forces will drive those trucks
onto the the beach in Gaza In Harm's Way
but it is just an option no decision has
been taken and James looking at the
situation in Gaza we're hearing of
notable progress in terms of mediation
talks between Israel and Hamas do we
have any detail on how those talks are
proceeding well I'm always cautious
about being hopeful and disappointed and
progress and stalled in these kind of
negotiations CU they're just long and
difficult what we do know is that the
talking is continuing
uh Egyptian officials were here in
Jerusalem yesterday we know that Hamas
uh overnight has said that they have
received the latest Israeli proposal we
know that there's a big conference
taking place in Saudi Arabia this
weekend under the egis of the world
economic forum and there's a possibility
of some parties talking to each other in
the sidelines of that of that conference
I think the idea is that there is going
to be another attempt to see if a deal
is possible for a ceasefire for some
hostages to be released for some
Palestinian prisoners to be
released before any military operation
begins in Rafa in the south of Gaza
against Hamas Fighters that Israel says
are HED up there in tunnels so it's
another attempt to try and make some
progress we'll see whether it does
because thus far it's been very very
difficult for both sides to try to
bridge the divide the BBC's James landel
in Jerusalem will let's speak to Chris
Parry a former British Royal Navy
officer thank you for joining us on BBC
News how would an operation like this
work well uh what we have to imagine is
that the coast L Gaza doesn't have any
port facilities and so if anybody can
remember what D-Day was like we had mury
Hubers and we had peers and pontoons
that were leading from deep water into
the shallow Zone and also the shore and
what this is called by the Americans is
called Joint Logistics
over the shore
jlots and it's it's essentially a
floating Pier that enables you to put
heavy trucks and also other loads ashore
from uh ships that can only go into deep
water and there'll be real questions
about the safety of any troops that
could that would take part in an
operation like this how would their
safety be
guaranteed well during the construction
of this pontoon Pier U people are going
to stay in raw Fleet auxiliary Bay which
is a 15,000 ton auxiliary ship that
works for the Royal Navy um I think
we've heard already that a third party
is going to be driving these trucks I
sincerely hope it isn't British troops
we know that there's endemic criminality
in Gaza itself which dominates all Aid
and supplies that are going in and I
suspect the interface would best be
served by uh an Arab country rather than
uh any British troops going ashore so I
suspect we're going to be limited to
doing what is offshore and the truck
driving and all the other things are
best placed amongst those who are
understand the local culture and can
deal with it and as we've seen obviously
during the course of the war um in Gaza
there is the possibility of mistakes as
happened with the aid workers with the
world Central Kitchen do you think that
would be a factor in the government's
decision in this and what are the
consequences if there is a mistake and
British troops are
injured well as I said I don't think
British troops will be involved um so I
think there'll be but if they're on the
ground in Gaza there's a potential for
anything to happen they won't be and
that's my point I think they'll be
offshore uh on the installation and
that'll be clearly demarcated um so the
Israelis know that I don't think the
Israelis or anybody else is going to be
deliberately attacking uh the Pontoon or
the aid suppliers offshore unless they
intend to do so and I think there'll be
instant retribution uh on anybody who
tries to do that uh",20240427

despite growing calls against it Israel
says it hopes to launch an assault on

groups and Western allies have warned
Israel not to carry out a fullscale
attack more than a million displaced
people are taking shelter in Rafa as
part of its Invasion Israel is planning
to evacuate civilians out of the city
well satellite images shown show two new
tent encampments in southern Gaza one at
a site to the west of carun and another
site near Rafa by comparing this
satellite image from the 7th of April
with this image from the 23rd of April
we can see the tents were put up this
month meanwhile Hamas have released a
video appearing to show an Israeli
American hostage HH Goldberg Poland in
captivity the short undated video
showing the man in his early 20s missing
his lower arm he was shown saying he had
sustained serious inj injuries during
the October the 7th attack there's been
anger in Jerusalem with some Gathering
near prime minister netanyahu's official
residents demonstrators have been
calling on the Israeli government to do
more to secure an agreement to release
the hostages there were also clashes
between police and protesters and the
police also had to escort farri Israeli

protesters while H Goldberg Poland's

their son leading for negotiating

Rachel and this is John and we are the
parents of hirs Goldberg Poland an
American Israeli civilian who was
kidnapped into Gaza 2011 days
ago seeing a video of HS today is
overwhelming we're relieved to see him
alive but we are also concerned about
his health and wellbeing as well as that
of all of the other hostages and all of
those suffering in this region and we're
here today with a plea to all of the
leaders of the parties who have been
negotiating to date that includes Qatar
Egypt the United States Hamas and Israel
be brave lean in seize this moment and
get a deal done to reunite all of us
with our loved ones and to end the
suffering in this region and H if you
can hear this we heard your voice today
for the first time in 201 days and if
you can hear us I am telling you we are
telling you we love you stay strong
survive our diplomatic correspondent
James landelle spoke to me earlier he
explained more about those plans for a
military assault on Rafa T cities are
being built uh to try and have a place
where civilians can go during this
military operation where there are
reports of senior Israeli officials
meeting with their their uh Egyptian
counterparts uh in Cairo because clearly
there is a huge risk for uh Egypt that
this conflict this operation spills over
uh into Egypt we know that a couple of
uh battalions of Israeli Army reservice
have been
mobilized but that said uh the Israeli
government has still yet to decide how
and when it's going to carry out this
operation that's one thing they're
discussing today we also know that um
Israel's allies have not yet given any
support for this uh particularly the
United States Jake Sullivan the US
National Security advisor said last
night that look the US and Israel are
still talking about this and they he
said there are different ways of dealing
with the threat of Hamas in southern uh
Gaza so the Americans have yet to give
any kind of green light and I think the
key thing to understand is that this is
going to be a process uh it's going to
take some time to move hundreds of
thousands of people out of Rafa into to
some you know tent sort of you know
humanitarian Islands to use the Israeli
language you know that's not going to
happen quickly uh and any military
operation that's not going to happen
quickly so I think what we're expecting
is some more of a process rather than a
one-off event yeah and James what
reaction has there been to the release
of the video of the hostage HS Goldberg
pollen well as you said um almost
instant uh demonstrations here in
Jerusalem once again people taking to
the streets to say look this is just a
reminder to the uh Israeli government
that they need to focus more in their
view on the hostage situation and not
just on the the the taking the fight to
Hamas now that many people here are
interpreting was precisely why this
hostage video was released was once
again for Hamas to try and put some
pressure back on the Israeli government
not just because that's what they want
to do but also maybe to say to the
Israelis look
these these hostages are still alive if
you want to do a deal let's talk let's
see if we can get something agreed thus
far it's proved impossible but the aim
is to put pressure back on also a hint
that maybe Kata was saying to Hamas look
you need to to show another Proof of
Life video just to get the ball rolling
again well talking of the ball rolling
again what is happening are there any
sense of any talks resuming when it
comes to a ceasefire hostage
deal no not at the moment
uh it just seems that both sides are too
far apart on all the substantive issues
how long should there be a secession a
pause in the fighting who amongst the is
Palestinian prisoners should be released
and when which hostages should be
released and when and which or and in
what order all of those issues they've
yet to reach any kind of agreement on uh
and at the moment with the focus in
recent days having been on the clash
between Iran and Israel and now the
focus returning to Rafa the expectation
is that those talks on any kind of
ceasefire or a hostage release are going
to be put on hold unless something can
change",20240425

will begin sending new military
assistance to Ukraine within hours after
he signed a long-awaited bill passed by
Congress speaking at a press conference
at the White House Mr Biden said that
the aid worth $61 billion would make
America and the world safer he said
Ukraine had the will and skill to win
the war against Russia the package also
includes billions of dollars in aid for
Israel and Taiwan as well as $1 billion
in humanitarian assistance to Gaza
it's a good day for America it's a good
day for Europe and it's a good day for
world peace for real this is
consequential I just signed in the law
the National Security package that was
passed by the House of Representatives
this weekend and by the Senate yesterday
it's going to make America safer it's
going to make the world safer and it
continues America's leadership in the
world and everyone knows it gives vital
support to America's partners and they
so they can defend themselves against
threats to their sovereign
and to the lives and freedom of their
citizens and it's an investment in our
own security because when our allies are
stronger and I want to make this perent
again and again when our allies are
stronger we are stronger I'm grateful
all grateful all those in Congress
Democrats Republicans Independents who
voted for this
bill well our North America
correspondent will grant joins us now
from Washington it's been a long time
coming this uh Ukraine has been waiting
for it for a long time in particular um
just to talk us through through how how
this is going to work he's saying that
some of the aid will be arriving in
Ukraine within
days yeah it has been a long time coming
and Mr Biden acknowledged that he said
it' been a difficult path to his desk
and that it should have got there sooner
um but obviously he was also uh very
thankful to the members of Congress and
the Senate who made it possible um I
think the fact is that um this has been
a torturous process to get to this point
um but the aid is sort of there and Good
To Go part of it is anyway the military
aid will start rolling out almost
immediately particularly in terms of
armored vehicles Munitions uh and so on
that the Pentagon has essentially
waiting to one side but obviously run
out of funds uh that were allocated by
Congress to do so so we will start
seeing that roll out in the coming hours
um and of course President Biden as you
heard In that clip there his core
message is that this is good for the
United States of course that is part of
the sale that he's making to the
American people because this has been
such a divisive issue all the way
through but uh it it it was also pointed
out that a lot of the Munitions that
will be built and will be sent to
Ukraine will be made in the United
States um so that it will benefit the
economy here too we should just mention
the the other aspects of the bill he
talked about the vital support uh for
Israel and he talked about that Ironclad
commitment to helping Israel defend
itself against Iran and and those its
supports and also he he talked about
this 1 billion in Aid going to Gaza and
called on Israel um to make sure that
Palestinians uh get that uh he was very
clear about that wasn't he about that
need to be for it to be
facilitated he was now of course his
critics will say that you know that the
waiting is clearly in favor of what he
called that Ironclad commitment this is
about the 26 billion dollar of uh Aid to
Israel uh and much less about for
example the aid going to Gaza or other
humanit Ian support around the world he
mentioned Haiti as well for example um
but he does make that commitment to to
Israel clear mentioning of course the
Drone attacks earlier this month and
missile attacks from Iran and putting it
into that context so I think that much
was again underlined um but you're right
I think the humanitarian assistance is
important for him particularly to the
left wing of his party to make sure that
that billion dollars was made clear uh
and the urging of Israel to make make it
possible for that a to to to get into
Gaza um that was noteworthy too in his
speech so yeah um touching on all of the
difficulties uh within this bill the
some of the hardest issues on his desk
at the moment I would say okay thank you
very much will grant for us there in

correspondent Peter Bose has more on
what's been
approved this was a long time incoming
held up for months in large part by
Republicans in the house some of whom
would rather see more money spent here
in the United States on immigration and
on the issues affecting the southern
border of the US with Mexico but there
does seem to have been a change of heart
amongst some Republicans notably the
speaker of of the house which allowed it
to pass through that stage that part of
Congress at the weekend now rubber
stamped you could say or at least passed
in the Upper House the Senate as well
just remains for it to be signed into
law by President Biden we expect to see
that happening in the next few hours and
the president already issuing a
statement indicating that that military
aid that president zelinski in Ukraine
has said that is so desperately needed
that military aid will be on the way
we're told by the end of this week air
defense Weaponry in particular that is
so desperately needed that's part of the
$61 billion package for Ukraine then
there's 26 billion for Israel also
humanitarian aid for the people of G
and about 8 billion for Taiwan to Stave
off potential advances by China and some
of the issues in the indopacific
reason one of the measures in this bill
perhaps most controversial for some
Americans at least is the potential ban
on Tik Tock and this is part of the
security measure that is part of this
very large bill with essentially an
ultimatum to B Dan which is the company
the Chinese company that that owns Tik
Tok that they should divver divest and
sell the platform to an American owner
or face a ban in this country now
nothing is really going to happen
quickly it's quite likely that b dance
will take this to the courts claim that
this move is unconstitutional and uh
also suggests that the concerns of
Americans are misplaced or the concerns
of Washington are misplaced and that is
that the the Chinese government could
invoke security measures to in some way
get hold of the personal data of
Americans that is part of that app B Dan
likely to say that they've already taken
measures to ensure that that doesn't
happen Israel said the US Senate
approval of $13 billion in military aid
sent a strong message to its enemies
well let's get to more on this with our
Middle East correspondent Yan Nell so
tell us more about the reaction that
Israel has had to this usaid being
passed
well Israel's reaction is basically um
of of great thanks to the US its closest
Ally we've had that coming from uh the
Israeli foreign minister this is a top
story that this Aid package has been
passed in uh most of the Israeli media
this morning and if you break it down um
you can see that uh really you have
here5 billion dollar that goes for
replenishing and expanding Israel's air
defense systems that have been used so
much recently uh including in uh
shielding Israel from that attack um by
Iran um 3 and A2 billion for purchasing
Advanced Weapons Systems from the US a
billion for enhancing weapons production
and then on top of that 4 and a half
billion almost in other supplies and
services and then you have this other
amount um some 9 billion which is going
to humanitarian Aid in Conflict zones
around the world and that does include
money that will go uh for Gaza where
we've had the US expressing concerns
that it Still Remains close to famine
particularly in the north and you land
in the mean time we've also had reports
of some of the heaviest shelling of Gaza
in in
whis that's correct and this is
something that's reported up and down um
the Gaza Strip um in the north also um
some notable Israeli air strikes this
after the Israeli military issued fresh
evacuation orders to people living in
parts of BET in the north now this is
significant because this is an area that
Israel had long ago said that it had
cleared and it sort of adds to the sense
uh that Hamas in particular is able to
regroup is coming back and it gives us
an idea of where things could go in
terms of Israel's overall military um
offensive in Gaza um that it will
continue to have um you know Hamas
coming back as a threat in areas where
it it thinks um its troops have been
able to withdraw we've had rocket fire
Fire coming from the north of the Gaza
Strip um in in a meaningful way really
for the first time in many weeks in just
the past few days and the Israeli
military says it's hit rocket launch
sites with air strikes we've seen
hundreds of Palestinians already
responding to recorded messages and text
messages they've been sent telling them
that this is now being declared a
dangerous combat zone where they're
living they've been heading down towards
uh Gaza City uh in particular and I
think this comes of course to 200 days
into the war we had a message from a
rare message from the head of the Hamas
military Wing Abu abeda um talking about
how the Israeli military he said was
stuck in the Sands of Gaza um and at the
same time a lot of frustration being
expressed uh on that 200 day um marker
by families of Israeli hostages um still

the October the 7th attacks by Hamas

of a war raging on in Gaza for him to
hand his resignation letter in and he is

happening in Khan Yunis in the South um

of that city um which is seen as a Hamas
stronghold earlier this month local
people had been going back trying to

Jerusalem meanwhile Health and emergency

nearly 200 bodies buried in the
courtyard of a Hospital alas Han nunis
had been at the center of an Israeli
military operation until 2 weeks ago the
World Health Organization has previously
said bodies were buried within hospitals
under Israeli Siege but Palestinians
have accused Israeli forces of killing
some of the victims the Israeli military
said it was checking the reports Israel
accuses Hamas of using medical
facilities as command centers well for
more on this story let's speak to our
Middle East correspondent yoland now y
land first of all what can you tell us
about these reports that the US could
put sanctions on one Israeli Battalion
called netsa
Yehuda yeah so this has not been
officially announced by the us yet but
just the reports alone have got alarm
bells ringing for Israeli leaders and
we've had them coming out saying that
this is not fair in a time of War uh the
Israeli military insisting that this
particular unit a combat unit that's
historically mostly operated in the
occupied West Bank acts in accordance
with international law and you have the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu saying that he would act with
all his strength um to try to stop this
from happening um but really what is
involved as far as we understand is that
um the US would prevent this particular
unit um if plans go ahead um from
receiving from benefiting from US
military assistance which of course
amounts to billions of dollars uh given
every year here to Israel now there is
existing us legislation um that stops uh
foreign military uh units which are
found to have committed human rights
violations from receiving uh US military
aid and there's been a review that's
been carried out and that the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has
been looking at the results in the past
few days to see how military units in
Israel comply now this particular uh
unit that we know of um it's come up a
lot in the news in the past it's a unit
that is made up mostly of ultra Orthodox
Jewish men and it was originally
designed to bring more religious men
into uh into the army because many of
them are um don't have to because of uh
of there have been exemptions that have
been in the past for um for religious
men serving in the Israeli military so
it is tended as I said to OCC to work in
the occupied West Bank uh one of the big
cases that um was really highlighted a
couple of years ago was when it was
involved in setting up um a military
checkpoint not far from ramala there was
a Palestinian American man close to 80
who was detained he was bound and gagged
and found dead um by people from his
village later um and there was a big
investigation into what exactly had
happened here with the US really pushing
for that because of his uh US
citizenship um in the end the Israeli
military did not find grounds for a
criminal investigation um there were
some officers who were reprimanded um
but there's continued to be pressure
around that case that has has come up um
on in uh in Washington and your land
just briefly looking at the situation in
Gaza and those reports of bodies being
found around the NASA Hospital what is
the reaction to those
developments so I mean really what's
happened in the past few weeks since
Israeli forces pulled out of Khan unun
this big city in the south of the Gaza
Strip um people have been going back
trying to find about 2,000 people who
are thought to be missing mostly under
the rubble um and they have been
searching particularly in the grounds of
the nasal Hospital the main hospital
there um we have heard of about 50 or so
bodies being found in the past day or so
in an open grave there and there have
been some delays in in Excavating the
grounds because of the lack of heavy
machinery and this adds to um further
numbers that have been found there uh
previously um there are now close to 200
bodies that have been found of course
identification is is proving very
difficult and we're hearing from local
people that there were elderly and also
uh children among those who were found
dead as well as uh many young men the
Israeli military said that it acted in a
precise and limited operation when it
went into the Nur hospital um said that
it was acting against Palestinian
government that were using the site um
there were people based there that the
the patients the doctors the display
these people were being used as a human
shield there were efforts to evacuate
people from that site at the time um
we're not clear if these are people if
they're bodies that were covered from
the hospital itself and then buried in
this grave or if they also come from the
surrounding area thank you military as
you said it's it's looking into these
reports thank thank you very much your

other world leaders have called for
restraint in the Middle East after
what's believed to have been an Israeli
attack on Iran overnight us officials
say Israel was responsible for a missile
strike the Israeli government hasn't
officially commented Iran says the
attack didn't cause any damage and
indicated there would be no
retaliation there were reports of
explosions in Syria Iraq and most
significantly in Iran in the province of
isv Han in the middle of the country the
area is home to an airbase and several
nuclear sites as well as a missile
Factory us officials called it an
Israeli missile strike Iranian media
said three small drones were involved in
a moment we'll hear from our North
America editor Sarah Smith in Washington
and our chief International
correspondent Lisa set first though
let's hear from Lucy Williamson in
Jerusalem well there reports tonight
that Israel's defense minister has been
having conversations with his us
counterpart there's obviously been a lot
of pressure from Israel's allies to
contain this crisis and the sense here
tonight is that both Israel and Iran may
be looking for a way to avoid escalating
it but this is the middle east's most
dangerous conflict and this crisis has
changed calculations on both
sides a message not of War but of
warning that Israel could also strike
its enemy at home if it
wanted after threatening a harsh and
massive response to the smallest
incursion Iran has downplayed the
morning
strike it president didn't mention it
once in his speech
today and this is the situation in
esphahan
shown on Iranian TV the message nothing
to see here other than that nothing has
happened everything is back to
normal Israel was divided over how to
respond to Iran's barrage last weekend
the Judgment of one farri right cabinet
minister this morning lame and in
Jerusalem's main market today many
others were disappointed when a bully
comes to you we're going to respond to
the bully with restraint the bully is
just going to come back harder and
harder and harder but if you want to
take down bully got it take down with
Force I expected more to be quite honest
I think more would have been even
Justified considering they sent 300
arets to kill so many people I think
that we're losing we're losing the war
with Hamas we're losing the war with kah
we're losing the war with Iran we lose
again it's a Pity we have so much
strength but we're afraid to use
it last weekend Iran fired more than 300
drones and missiles towards Israel
punishment it said for the assassination
of a senior commander in Syria earlier
this month all but a handful was shot
down before hitting Israeli
soil this missile fuel tank pulled by
Israel's Army from the Dead Sea Israel's
allies urged it to take the win and
avoid escalating the conflict we're
committed to Israel's security we're
also committed to de-escalating uh to
trying to bring
uh this tension to a to a close this
strike and Iran's muted response to it
suggest both sides a keen to step back
from this conflict but their direct
confrontation last weekend has left them
in a new more dangerous position the
immediate risk may be cooling but from
where they stand now it's a shorter
route to
war is one analyst says there's a lesson
for the future in Iran deciding to act
even when it knew Israel would respond
they considered it and they took it into
account and they decided to do it so
they there is a change in the way that
they are thinking and therefore I have
to take into account that in the future
they will be doing the same things and
this is the big question because Israel
is not going to stop a attacking any
arms that are coming across Iraq the
Iraqi Syrian
border Iran today avoided blaming Israel
directly even as crowds called for its
destruction after Friday prayers but
Israel is already fighting iran-backed
groups across the region even if this
crisis is subsiding the Sparks that
triggered it will not Lucy Williamson
BBC News
Jerusalem well our North America editor
is Sarah Smith uh Sarah President Biden
of course had urged restraint what's
being said in Washington
tonight well interestingly President
Biden and those around him are very
deliberately saying almost nothing about
this today except to confirm that the US
wasn't involved in any military
operations and that's because amid the
relief there is here that the Israeli
response was relatively small scale they
don't want to Fan the Flames of anything
by statements or commentary that's
coming out of here but you're right
President Biden had urged Israel to take
the wind I.E the massive failure of
Iran's attack on their last weekend and
not to retaliate um and that and and of
course as we saw Israel didn't do that
there's growing frustration here it has
to be said about Israel's tactics not
just this attack on Iran but also uh
what's been happening in gaza's causing
mounting concern but the limited success
that America has had in trying to limit
Israel's operations there I mean the US
does remain Israel's biggest backer by
far militarily diplomatically and even
financially uh this this weekend the
Congress is going to vote on over 26
billion dollars of Aid that to be sent
to Israel but it doesn't seem to buy
them as much influence as the White
House would ideally like all right Sarah
thank you and let's get the thoughts of
our chief International correspondent
Lee tet who is here with me and we heard
Iran indicated there would be no
retaliation for this do we take that at
face value for now this round seems to
be over both sides believe they have
sent a very clear signal to their Arch
Enemy that if they strike there'll be a
heavy price to pay in other words they
believe they have reestablished
deterrence for Iran this limited strike
which Israel hasn't officially
acknowledged gave them vital political
space that they could say nothing
happened that they don't have to invoke
that rule that new rule that when Israel
strikes Iran will hit back immediately
and hard for Israel this lied strike
seems as we've been hearing to be a
warning Salvo that Israel can and will
strike the Beating Heart of Iran the
central province of Isfahan which is
home to a nuclear facility a major air
base an industrial Heartland which
produces the drones and missiles which
Iran sent into Israel by the hundreds
last Sunday so behind Iran's dismissal
even mockery of what happened this
morning there's still much for Iran to
worry about and as we've been hearing
the grief this the roots of this
confrontation aren't over the griev has
cause a war Iran's networks a network of
proxies armed militias across the region
and of course what has been a decades
long hostility between these Regional
Rivals so tonight there is a palpable
sense of relief in the region in
capitals including London no one wants
an all at War but tonight no one can say
for certain and what will happen next",20240419

blasts have also been reported in the

but Iranian media say all restrictions
have now been lifted the international
atomic energy agency has confirmed that
there is no damage to Iran's nuclear

general of the agency said on social

restraint from everybody and reiterates
that nuclear facilities should never be
a Target in military conflicts Iran's
semi-official tasnim news agency which
is close to the Islamic revolution guard

saying is if is for hands nuclear site
is completely safe a man near the
Isfahan nuclear Technology Center is
seen in a video that we will show you
very shortly and in this video that's

endorse the
action the US has restricted travel for
its Embassy staff in Israel out of an
abundance of
caution the US Embassy issued this
statement the security environment
remains complex and can change quickly
depending on the political situ
situation and recent events well for
more on this I'm now joined by Majid AFA
senior reporter with BBC Persian thank
you for joining us just bring us up to
date on the information we're getting
from Iran but also other countries who
are watching developments on the ground
um what we're getting from Iranian media
is quite limited because at the moment
there there there seems to be an effort
from by the Iranian media to downplay
the incident we were as you said we had
reports of explosions loud explosions in
the city of esfahan we now know that the
the explosions were heard from a an area
called kja Varan which is east of the
city of eswan where one of the main air
bases uh missile defense systems of Iran
is located very close to the
international airport in Sahan um and
there were also reports of explosions in
the city of tabis in the north west of
the country where another uh air defense
system is based and now at the moment we
are hearing from the governor of uh
aaban uh East aaban Province that uh
they they they there were a number of
drones there and they tried to down them
there so um we are now getting conf
information that explosions were had
also near another Air Base in the city
of um tab um as as you said the the
nuclear facilities seem to be safe um
but but the the situation is quite
changing every every minute as we
getting reports there are um video
footage there there's footage on social
media showing um fire inside a and and
an air base in in Isfahan but we cannot
confirm it at the moment my colleagues
at BBC pan are trying to to to validate
that to see if this is today or not but
all we're getting is the air defense
system was activated in the city of
esphahan and now in the city of tabis to
down a number of drones just tell us
about the reaction from Iranian
officials because so far the assessment
is that they're trying to downplay what
has happened we've heard from uh some
officials saying that no damage has been
done and it was just a few drones that
were in Disguise over Isfahan exactly um
the the question is uh Iranian side when
they attacked Israel on on Saturday
night and over the weekend they they
have they had tried to say this was a
successful attack and that's what you
see in the Iranian media landscape that
that's what they did if they managed to
downplay what happened today then the
seems to be this seems to be an effort
to somehow convince their Hardline
supporters inside the country that um
nothing has happened there's no need for
a response because the Iranian side has
always been saying that if there is an
air sight they they will reply to that
there there will be a Counterattack now
the main question here is what is this
an attack from outside the country or
are are these drones just U took off
from from inside the country the Iranian
side is definitely trying to restore
deterrence as the Israelis are trying to
do and if they manage to downplay this
incident maybe they can restore that
maybe they can achieve the goal of
restoring uh deterant inside the country
what do you think Iran would want to
achieve because obviously there calls
for an end to the tit forat strikes that
we've seen um over the past few weeks
what would be let's call it a win a way
to get out of this situation for Iran
it's already um at least from what we
see from the Iranian official statements
a win for Iran even if they don't reply
to this Jerusalem Post minutes ago
published a a a report citing an Israeli
official that there was an air strike
and this was a message to the Iranian
side that if they want they can they can
strike inside Iran Iranian officials if
they manag to to say that there was no
damage nothing has happened no harm has
been done maybe they can they can see
this as as a win at the same time
getting the message and and stop this
tit fortat um attacks as you said the
Iranian side obviously does not want to
to to to escalate this because they know
that if if it comes to a military direct
military conflict they're not in in any
way um comparable to what uh Israel
Israelis are capable of doing Iranian
air defense system is also quite weak
and um and and also um we know that is
really air air um like fighter jets and
stuff they can do damage to the Iranian
side and there is precedence of um like
Israeli um clandestine operations inside
Iran thank you very much Majid for that
update and Analysis that's Majid AFA
from the BBC Persian service we joining
me now on the line is Adnan tabat Iran
analyst and CEO of capro Kao a think
tank focusing on Iran and the Middle
East in Germany thank you for joining us
on the program first of all what's your
assessment of the reports that we've
been getting over the past few
hours in my in my view what we are
currently seeing is as your colleague
has um very well elaborated on um that
the Iranian side is trying to portray
this as something really um minimal as
something that basically lays to rest
the whole the whole tit fortat situation
and that this was basically nothing um
and we will obviously have to wait uh
for more accurate information to come
out about what exactly happened but at
this stage I think it's important to
just acknowledge the fact that um there
seems to be no will to escalate this
further there appears to be no will to
escalate this further there would be
also considerations within um Iran
hardliners within the government there
who want perhaps tougher action against
Israel do you think if Iran was to not
carry out another strike and was to say
well the strike wasn't that bad that
would be enough to please the
hardliners I believe so I think that the
the overall appetite to to launch
another attack um in spite of what was
said publicly I think the TI has not
been um that big um so it's actually I
believe right now also to the benefit of
officials in Iran to be able to downplay
what happened or to really just say that
what happened is not significant enough
for us to to retaliate at this stage
what's your assessment of how we got
here because both sides have been clear
that they do not want a wider war in the
region they do not want to escalate
tensions but we found oursel in these
positions well we've seen these you know
large strikes or strikes um over the
past few
weeks yeah indeed I think the the the
dangerous situation here is the constant
pushing of of red lines um they Iran has
always acted in a way that was plausibly
deniable it went through its aligned
groups in the region um but that red
line was obviously crossed on on Sunday
um the Israelis by attacking an Iranian
Consular building in Damascus and
killing irgc um commanders was another
form of Crossing red lines so that that
is the dangerous situation we're seeing
but when these red lines are pushed we
may also be able to move within a range
of of actions which means that there
will no no further escalation be on the
horizon one word that has been spoken
often has been deterrence so both
countries wanting to deter the other
from attacking them the one to feel
secure in what perhaps can be you know
quite a dangerous neighborhood how would
International Partners go about making
Israel and Iran feel secure that they
won't be
attacked and you're pointing to a very
very relevant issue here and that is um
the the the face saving deterrence game
that is necessary on on both sides and I
really believe third parties have a role
to play here and what I miss
particularly from European countries is
to really effectively call for restraint
and try to give both sides a sense of
you have in restored your deterrence um
we can see that you can do each other
serious harm um and now please for the
sake of of peace and no further
escalation call for restraint on both
sides we I haven't seen that in a way
that that I would have hoped from
particularly European countries and
let's see whether today's event or last
night's event uh changed that
thank you very much that's Adnan tabai
CEO of
carpo we can now speak to our Middle
East correspondent yoland n and yoland
were getting reaction International
reaction to this attack these explosions
in Iran country still trying to figure
out what happened what are we hearing
from Israeli
officials so the Israeli military has
not had any comment on whether this was
an Israeli offensive in side Iran um but
the Israeli media is clearly presenting
it as such and you've also got the US
media quoting unnamed Israeli and US
officials saying that this was um an
Israeli strike on Iran that took place
now the information that's kind of
coming out is mainly from Iran where of
course there is not a a free press you
have had um overnight uh these reports
first from the the semi-official fast
news agency where it talked about three
explosions being heard in Isfahan right
in the center of the country um close to
a key airport close to an important uh
military base um then the the state TV
was saying in Iran that um these were
Ground explosions that took place there
had been air defense systems that have
been activated um in response to drones
which you can apparently see in some
footage uh that is circulating on social
media and uh really trying very much on
on the Iranian side to downplay what
happened here we're not hearing anything
about uh significant damage at all um
that said in Israel this morning I mean
of course this has been a very tense
week as everyone waited to see um how
the country would respond um it was
really made clear that the country felt
it had to respond to that unprecedented
attack by Iran last weekend with more
than 300 attack drones and missiles
being launched at the country um this is
a country is about to have uh the Jewish
Passover holiday many schools have
broken up people have been preparing to
travel there's been this kind of
continuing state of uncertainty and it's
telling this morning uh that the Israeli
military has not uh updated its advice
it said there's no change in
instructions to the Israeli public um
about the state of alert that the
country is now on uh suggesting it is
not bracing itself for retaliation from
Iran the Reuters news agency
interestingly quoting an unnamed uh
senior Iranian official who they say
says that no retaliation is planned um
and presenting this as more of a case of
infiltration rather than an attack on
Iran and yoland we're just seeing
reports um from the from Iranian media
this is on the BBC live page and an
Iranian official is quoted as saying
Iran has no plan for immediate action
soorry this was a comment to the Reuters
news agency so falling in line with
comments that we we've been seeing that
Iran also has no appetite to escalate
the tensions there in the Middle East um
just talk us through what's likely to
happen over the next few days obviously
at the moment the focus is on what's
happening between Iran and um Israel but
also eyes are focused on what's
happening in
Gaza indeed and I think there's uh so
much happening uh diplomatically behind
the scenes at the moment to try to calm
things down
we have seen this morning also these uh
reports um of uh an attack by Israel in
Syria according to the UK based Syrian
Observatory for human rights on on a
Syrian Army base we've also had rocket
Sirens um going off warning of a
potential incoming fire in the North of
Israel where there has been this
increase in recent days in uh cross B
fire uh between Israeli forces and hez
balah the powerful uh iran-backed
Lebanese group um so really a lot of
fears that um Iran's proxies could also
uh get involved in retaliation and
attacks even if we don't have that
coming from Iran
directly thank you very much uh that's
the BBC's your land now there with
analysis and reaction from Jerusalem
well G7 foreign ministers are meeting in
Italy these are live pictures from that
meeting in Capri they've been reacting
to the news we can actually go live live
now to our correspondent Jess Parker
who's in Capri for us so we've been
getting reaction from ministers there
just talk us through what they've been
saying yeah good morning to you in the
last hour or so hearing from some of
those foreign ministers who as you say
are here in Capri for the G7 foreign
ministers meeting they had discussed the
situation in the Middle East yesterday
and then moved on to other issues
including the war in Ukraine but it now
seems as though the Middle East very
much back on the agenda just to bring
you some of that reaction first of all
Italy's foreign minister Antonio Tani
who's chairing proceedings here he has
said on the social media platform X I
have just spoken with our ambassador to
Iran I'm following developments
following the nighttime explosions in
Isfahan we will talk about it with the
foreign ministers at the G7 session in
Capri uh this morning he goes on to say
there are no critical issues uh for
Italians living in Iran and then
Canada's foreign minister Melanie Jolie
says she's been briefed by global
Affairs Canada officials about the
overnight explosions again monitoring
the situation closely and reiterating
that the situation will be addressed uh
at the session of the G7 foreign
ministers uh this morning so that's the
reaction that we have so far we are
expecting to hear from other foreign
ministers later on today as this G7 uh
foreign ministers meeting is due to wrap
up so we should expect reactions here on
the Italian island of Capri throughout
the day and over the past uh couple of
days Jess we've seen some countries
there meeting in uh Capri putting
sanctions further sanctions on Iran
following its uh strike on Israel do we
expect any other announcements um during
this
meeting I haven't had any indications
that we'll get further announcements of
that kind so what happened uh following
Saturday
attacked by Iran which of course was in
itself a response to a strike on an
Iranian Embassy in or Consulate in Syria
um following that there were some very
uh Advanced broadcast messages that
there would be further sanctions and
yesterday we heard from the US and the
UK who said they'd come up with a
coordinated package to sanction
individuals and Industry bodies linked
to Iran's missile and drone program the
European Union as well well during a
summit in Brussels said they would be
looking uh at further restrictive
measures going forward against Iran as
well this just adds to sanctions that
are already applied to tan so the UK for
example said that it had sanctioned 13
individuals and entities adding to 400
existing sanctions already in place but
I think they were trying to do a couple
of things send a message to Iran in
response to what had happened on
Saturday also as part of this effort to
try and deescalate tensions in the
region we've heard this message from
Western leaders to Israel to try and
show restraint or even not retaliate at
all and I think it was part of that
effort to sell uh to Israel this message
of take the win as President Biden uh
put it following the events of the last
week of course we're still getting a
very emerging picture this morning in
terms of what is actually uh happened in
Iran but uh it will very much be up for
discussion here H at the closing session
of G7 foreign ministers today and Jess
briefly just talk us through some of the
other issues that have been discussed
there in
Capri yeah I mean the other main item on
the agenda has been the war in Ukraine
so Demitri CBA Ukraine's foreign
minister has been here on the island of
Capri again asking for further
assistance particularly air defense
systems missiles Yen stoltenberg the
Secretary General of the NATO military
Alliance is here as well um we were at a
press conference with him yesterday and
he was saying there is an urgent
critical need for more air defense uh
systems to go to Ukraine as soon as
possible really at the moment it's not
quite clear where those air defense
systems might come from Germany recently
uh pledged an additional battery uh to
Ukraine Yen stoltenberg said
conversations were ongoing but with
partner countries about whether there
could be a further assistance uh there
is some hope uh because the US Aid
package that has been so long stalled in
Congress worth $60 billion uh for
Ukraine uh Congress is moving towards a
vote on that so that caused a little bit
of optimism here but actually overall
officials that I've been speaking to say
the mood on this issue has been quite
downbeat",20240419
oeO-osUXe5A,Iran sanctions: US and UK extend measures against Tehran | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Iran sanctions US and UK extend measures against Tehran  BBC News.jpg,"the United States and Britain have
imposed new sanctions on Iran and its
weapons manufacturers to punish tan for
its missile and drone attacks on Israel
last weekend at a meeting of G7 foreign
ministers in Italy Lord Cameron said he
hoped the international response would
persuade Israeli officials not to
retaliate too strongly and see off a
wider War White House officials said the
sanctions were aimed at disrupting
Iran's ability to produce the unmanned
aerial vehicles that its military used
to attack Israel by cutting off Global
Financial transactions with those
companies involved in building them at
the UN Iran's foreign minister Hussein
Amir had this to
say in case of any use of force by the
Israeli regime and violating our
sovereignty the Islamic Republic of Iran
will not hesitate to assert its inherent
rights to give a decisive and proper
response to it to make the regime regret
its actions
but in New York the UN Secretary General
Antonio Gutierrez was decidedly downbeat
about the situation in the Middle East
warning that the region is on a
precipice in a speech to the UN Security
Council Mr Gutierrez urged all countries
to exercise maximum restraint saying one
miscalculation could lead to full-scale
regional conflict it is I time to end
the bloody cycle of
retaliation it is I time to stop
top the International Community must
work together to prevent any actions
that could push the entire Middle East
over the edge with a devastating impact
on
civilians let me be clear the risks are
spiraling on many
fronts in Italy Ukraine was also on the
agenda here's the UK foreign secretary
Lord David Cameron on the support that
KF needs Ukraine couldn't be clearer
they need more ammunition we are helping
to fill that Gap uh they need more air
defenses that Gap needs to be filled no
country has done more than Britain in
terms of helping the Ukrainian Armed
Forces helping the Ukrainian people and
the Ukrainian government and we look
forward to hearing what foreign minister
CA has to say today about the further
steps that we need to take well let's
get reaction then in Italy for us
tonight at the G7 Jessica Parker and
also our diplomatic correspondent who's
in Jerusalem James landel James if I
could just start with you does the
Israeli War cabinet share the view of
the Secretary General that things are as
precarious as he believes they
are oh I think they are aware of the
consequences um of any further
miscalculation uh if Israel's response
to Iran's attack at the weekend does
trigger an escalatory process uh yeah
know I think they are incredibly aware
of that but at the same time they are
determined to respond and I think what
they would want to do is respond and
then leave it at that you hear that from
spokespeople saying you know we need to
act we need to do something they're
aware of the consequences whether they
are as aware as concerned as some of
their allies uh have been uh signaling
in recent days I think remains to be
seen we simply don't know yet precisely
what the Israelis are going to do they
they say they are going to act we don't
know how yet we don't know when uh there
is some speculation it's no more than
that that it's possible they might delay
any action until after the Passover
holiday but again that could be just
people here in Jerusalem um wishing uh
for the best a little bit of what's
called optimism bias yeah Jess the the
sanctions announced today were heavily
trailed um ahead of the meeting will
they molfy the Israelis is there any
faith in a sanctions regime like this
because they're obviously not the first
sanctions imposed on
Iran no I mean I think think the UK
figures are 13 entities and individuals
being sanctioned uh as you said linked
to Iran's missile and drone program to
add to the already existing 400
sanctions that are in place but look I
think certainly the hope is from the
likes of Lord Cameron um the British
foreign secretary that this will be
something they can sell again to the
Israelis this idea of a win uh an act of
solidarity sending a message to Iran but
it's interesting um Lord Cameron
alongside the German foreign minister
analena bbok arrived here to Capri
pretty late yesterday because they' come
both of them from Israel where they'd
been meeting with Israeli leaders as
they were obviously calling on Israel to
show restraint um in response to the
Iranian attack that message has
continued here although it has to be
said discussions have now moved on uh to
the war in Ukraine but I think it was
interesting to note that after those
conversations that anela bbok and David
Cameron had in Israel Benjamin Netanyahu
was very clear that Israel would be
making its own choices the other
discussion in Capri Jess was Ukraine uh
they're returning to this idea of using
the Frozen Russian assets or the the
interest acrude from those assets to
fund the war effort how far have they
got with that because I know it is part
of one of the bills that discuss in the
US House of Representatives this
weekend yeah it seems to be a pretty
complicated idea and one as you say
that's been kicking around for a really
long time and there's been hesitancy
before because of legal complexities as
talking to officials here tonight they
say they tell me the US is pushing this
idea as you say using uh Frozen Russian
assets the bulk of which are held in
Europe um to use the interest to then
get a loan in order to channel money to
Ukraine in terms of whether this is
going to happen obviously we don't know
the indications I've had is that it
certainly won't get over the line at
this G7 foreign ministers um meeting if
anything if they can get there it would
be something they tried to finalize at
the leaders G7 Summit uh later in the
Summer James one of the the more
alarming uh pieces of rhetoric we heard
today from the Iranian side was that
they're reviewing their nuclear strategy
um they seem to be implying rather
overtly that it they might try and seek
a nuclear weapon if if Israel were to
attack them I mean when you look at at
how that might play out if you stretch
forward and look at the implications of
that we could soon be into a a new arms
race yeah look the Iranians are in full
deterrence mode at the moment doing
everything they possibly can to minimize
uh whatever Israeli response is coming
and one of we've just heard it from that
clip from um Mr Abdul Alan the the
Iranian foreign minister speaking at the
UN you've also had this um irgc
revolutionary Guard general talking
about this nuclear thing now at the
moment uh Iran says that its nuclear
program is purely civilian there are
many countries in the west that do not
believe them and have been trying to
restrict that program for many many
years because they fear that actually
Iran is is trying to develop weapons
grade uh n nuclear fuel that could be
used uh to make a nuclear weapon so for
Iran to say to become overt about its
nuclear ambition you know would be a
substantial step change it's part of the
attempt to try and persuade the Israelis
to minimize their escalation it could
have the opposite effect it could
encourage the Israelis to Target those
nuclear facilities uh that they have
done before and and could well do again
so again every Iranians Trying to
minimize Israel's response but Israel's
still being pulled they want to respond
pressure from the Iranians pressure from
their allies you know they're in quite a
bind at the moment they haven't finally
made up their decisions yet just briefly
James just a quick word on the qataris
who've been talking today saying they
they're going to consider whether to
continue in the role as mediators why
are they concerned about what's been
going
on look there are some American
politicians who've been critical of the
Qatar is saying they're not putting
enough pressure on Hamas to agree a deal
that they're you know they're hosting
the Hamas leadership in Qatar alongside
a big American base what's happened is
the Qatar is a pushing back saying look
enough of that you know if you guys push
us any further we could you know draw
stumps and leave this negotiation nobody
really wants that so I think this is an
act of the qataris pushing back against
those American critics James landelle

you for your contributions tonight",20240418
Nm-1WArxD5I,United Nations to launch $2.8bn aid appeal for Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\United Nations to launch $2.8bn aid appeal for Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"the UK foreign secretary Lord Cameron
has arrived in Jerusalem for talks with
Israel's leaders about their response to
Iran's drone and missile attack over the
weekend he's also expected to discuss
the continuing humanitarian crisis in
Gaza the United Nations is launching a
2.8 billion appeal to provide Aid to the
Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip
and occupied West Bank with 90% of the
money going towards Gaza meanwhile as
Israel continues to meet to decide how
and when might respond to Iran's missile
and drone attack the US and EU look to
impose new sanctions on Iran the White
House has said they will Target Iran's
missile and drone program and EU foreign
policy Chief Joseph barell said the
block was working on a sanctions plan
after a number of EU Nations requested a
tough response let's get the latest with
our diplomatic correspondent James
landel who's in Jerusalem James welcome
to you what can we expect from David
Cameron's visit there
well I expect him to continue the
message uh of restraint that Western
leaders have been uh calling for uh ever
since Iran attacked this country with
missiles and drones over the weekend uh
the Prime Minister uh had a call with
the uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu last night in which he said
escalation was in no one's interests it
would only deepen the insecurity of the
region it was time for calm heads to
Prevail as well as that message though I
think the Prime Minister the foreign
secretary will also be talking to the
Israeli is about what more they can do
to get Aid in to Gaza that's something
that has been I think the focus has
moved away from that because of the
attention on Iran and I think also the
foreign secretary is going to try and
return some of the pressure back onto
those talks to try and get a ceasefire
in Gaza saying look you know it's up to
um you know Hamas uh to accept a deal so
I think those are the areas that he's
likely to discuss when he meets Israeli
leaders and also um those Palestinian
leaders in the occupied West Bank James
what more do we know about possible
sanctions the US and EU are discussing
over
Iran well the Americans said yesterday
that they are going to introduce new
sanctions on Iran specifically over
attacking the supply chains that allow
Iran to build drones and build their
missiles the EU also talking about that
there's a meeting of G7 foreign
ministers in Italy later on today that
um David Cameron Lord Cameron will also
be at they're also going to be talking
um about
as well so I think there's an attempt to
try and keep this Coalition of support
for Israel that has grown as a result of
Iran's uh attack at the weekend and try
to operationalize it if you like and say
look let's what we see what we can do to
put more pressure both diplomatically
and also economically on Iran as a
result but remember sanctions take a
long time to have any practical impact
so in the short term it's purely about
political positioning and putting more
pressure on Tran okay James thank
you well let's speak now to ammen saal
Professor of Middle Eastern studies at
the Australian National University
Welcome to you thanks very much for
being with us let's start with Iran
several days on now from their attack on
Israel what what's the view do you think
in Iran from the upper echelons and
those who were behind this decision to
attack Israel directly do you think they
view this as a a
success well from their perspective it
has been success because they basically
wanted to uh reestablish deterrence and
at the same time send a very strong
signal to uh Israel uh that Iran is not
a paper tiger and it is prepared to
protect its Assets in the region uh
because Iranian attack was very much in
retaliation uh to
Israel's bombing of the Iranian
Consulate in Damascus um but at the same
time Iran has made it clear that it's
not uh there to uh open a big war with
the Israel H and uh it uh retaliation uh
was very measured and it did not really
cause a lot of damage to Israel and it
only targeted military bases uh but of
course uh Israel was not able to uh deal
with the Iranian missiles and drones on
its own in fact many of
those projectiles were shot down by the
Americans and the British and of course
also to some extent jordanians um so it
also the Iranian attack in a way showed
Israel's vulnerability in other words
Israel is no longer an invincible power
and therefore the only Power in the
region and Iranians have really made a
stand yeah you say it was very measured
it crossed a red line by directly
attacking Israel for the first time ever
uh and you say also reestablish
deterrence but we don't know what the
Israeli response is going to be and
there are those calling for a direct
strike on Iran's nuclear facilities
aren't they so it could still escalate
and is that a a risk that the Iranian
regime is is willing to
take well absolutely but now uh it
depends what Israel is going to do and
if Israel wants to uh attack Iranian
military and nuclear facilities and oil
resources uh then obviously that is
going to result in a much uh bigger uh
escalation of this conflict the Iranian
side has made it clear that they will be
uh responding to any Israeli attack in
uh much harsher way than they have uh in
the past and so therefore the scene is
really set for the widening of this
conflict unless Israel is restrained and
of course this is what the United States
and also some of its allies including
Britain are trying to uh do to
basically you know ask Israel uh not to
retaliate or at least not to retaliate
in a way which could result in the
expansion of the conflict doesn't this
leave Iran increasingly isolated and
under pressure at home we saw Jordan
take part in shooting down some of those
drones didn't we we haven't seen any of
those Regional allies come out out in
support or Regional countries come out
in support of Iran and the people of
Iran are under pressure economically as
well they've been of course increasing
protest against the regime over the past
year 18 months so isn't actually the
regime under more
pressure well the regime is under
pressure and uh but I don't think the
regime really expected that the Arab
countries or for that matter Jordon
really coming out in support of Iranian
actions uh I think the the regime is
fully aware that it does not have the
love of everybody in the region but it
does have the support of Russia and has
the support of
China Iran has got very close strategic
ties with these two powers and at the
same time it has got plenty of assets
and region that it can use against
Israel and against the international
supporters of Israel if they decide to
get involved in Israeli LED war with
Iran I'm in cycle thank
you the United Nations has voiced
concerns about escalating violence in
the occupied West Bank it comes after a
wave of attacks sparked by the killing
of an Israeli teenager the UN has
accused Israel's security forces of
active participation in attacks on
Palestinians by Jewish settlers the vast
majority of the International Community
considers the settlements illegal under
international law although Israel
disputes this here Hugo take CAU on CCTV
a man setting fire to a car as Israeli
settlers storm a Palestinian Village in
the occupied West Bank Israeli soldiers
watch outside and appear to do
nothing across the West Bank on the
weekend Israeli settlers went on a
rampage this was the village of M near
ramala on Saturday settlers set houses
and cars on fire killing one man Jihad
Abu alyah he was 25 and planning to get
married in
June Jihad was trying to prevent the
settlers from breaking the house door of
Sam house where dozens of the Town
residents arrived in the home to prevent
them from burning the
house it wasn't the first time settlers
attacked us but we weren't expecting a
huge number of them the violence was
sparked by The Disappearance of this
Israeli boy 14-year-old bamin aim he
went missing on on Friday and a day
later was found dead the Israeli Army
says he was murdered the attacks show
how tensions in the West Bank are
escalating since the Hamas attacks on
the 7th of October more than 460
Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been
killed if nothing changes there will be
even more violence for this campaign and
monitoring settlement activity the
situation is
unprecedented I think that H the level
of the violence is the highest that I
remember they feel also a lot of support
from the government and probably from
the public Le their public that their
violence is kind of
necessary against the evil which are the
Palestinians it's not only settler
violence that's on the rise raids by the
Israeli Army have intensified killing
many
Palestinians the Israeli Army says it's
investigating the aren incident caught
on CCTV
but across the West Bank many
Palestinians are living in fear they
wonder when the next attack will come

East where Israel appears to be trying
to gather international support
following the Iranian air strikes but
has not so far at least carried out any
direct military action in response
instead Israel is calling for more
sanctions on Iran which itself has
warned Israel against attempting any
retaliation following those drone and
missile attacks which Iran says were a
response to an Israeli attack on its
diplomatic mission in Syria Chief
International correspondent Lee duet has
been sending us updates from
Jerusalem Israel says it is now
launching a diplomatic offensive the
Israeli foreign minister has written he
says to 32 countries around the world
urging them to impose even more
sanctions against the Islamic Republic
of Iran the foreign minister Israel Katz
posted this on X formerly Twitter saying
Israel that Iran has to be stopped now
for it is too late and that is the
message that's also being sounded by
Leading senior military officials here
in Israel including the chief of staff
leftenant General hery halvi he said
that Israel would have to respond he
made the comments by visiting the Neva
team Airbase in southern Israel where
some of Iran's missiles did actually hit
in the early hours of Sunday morning
although Israel says there was limited
damage Israel says only a handful of
missiles actually got through of the 350
suicide drones and Cru and ballistic
missiles which were fired by Iran Iran
says its retaliatory strike was in
response to Israel's attack on its
diplomatic compound in the Syrian
Capital Damascus on April the 1st Iran's
foreign minister Amir abdan has
reiterated that message in a telephone
conversation with the un Secretary
General Antonio gues saying that Iran
acted in legitimate self-defense Iran
too is calling for restraint saying it
doesn't want this to escalate into a
wider War we're going to look at the
Peril in this moment but just to remind
you that this tension takes place in the
midst of the ongoing Israel Gaza War
it's the
193rd day of war and today there are
reports fighting in the Gaza Strip and
most particularly in bet hanon in the
Northeast there are also reports that
more Aid is now getting into Gaza from
the north we're getting reports on the
ground and that is what Israel is saying
that news is being greeted with relief
for many many weeks now a agencies have
been warning that more than half of the
population of Gaza is facing acute
hunger
well let's now cross to the Qatari
Capital Doha to join Miranda kamrava who
is the director of the Iranian studies
unit at the Arab Center for research and
policy studies welcome to BBC
news thank you leas good to be
here of course you are following every
uh Twist and Turn of this escalating
crisis between Israel and Iran how would
you describe this particular
moment well the Israelis crossed the red
line by attacking Iran's diplomatic
compound in Damascus and then the
Iranians crossed uh another red line uh
by attacking Israeli soil and so we're
at a very uh precarious in fact
dangerous moment where we're likely to
see an Israeli retaliatory strike for
Iran's retaliatory strike and so the
Vicious Cycle is likely to continue
unfortunately this moment seems to
underline the the dangerous differences
in perception Iran is saying this was a
very limited a very calibrated a strike
it caused limited casual limited damage
for Israel of course it was a reckless
strike which breached its security and
must there must be a retaliation and
that is what is going to fuel this
conflict is it
not absolutely and in fact uh I think uh
we do see that the Iranians did hold
back they had to somehow retaliate for
the attack on their uh Embassy compound
and so as far as they're concerned
deterrence has been reestablished and
now they're saying that if Israel
attacks Iran again or Iranian interests
or Personnel uh there will be more of
this kind kind of retaliatory strike of
course netanyahu's political predicament
inside Israel don't allow for restraint
and we've seen Netanyahu have a penchant
for overreaction he's also under
pressure from the right flank of his own
cabinet and so unfortunately as you
mentioned we're at a precarious and very
dangerous
moment indeed and the speculation now
seems to be that even though there are
disagreements within the War cabinet and
we are hearing that the cabinet may meet
again today some of the former U
military generals saying we should we
should we should retaliate now others
saying let's build our International and
our regional Coalition first because
they are emphasizing that this Coalition
the support Israel is receiving at this
moment that matters
too absolutely and uh also crucial is
the support that the United States will
give to is Israel both
diplomatically and uh militarily and
we've uh heard very loud and clear
messages coming out of Washington that
is that the United States would not
assist Israel on an attack uh uh on
Iranian soil and so I think that's also
given some pause to Israeli military
commanders do they really want to go it
alone uh knowing that Iran has this
so-called axis of resistance
that it can activate when it feels very
threatened Marin comad thank you very
much it's always good to hear your
perspective no doubt we'll hear from you
again as this crisis continues to unfold
and as I mentioned uh during that uh
discussion that we are hearing reports
that the war cabinet will meet again
today this will be its third meeting
since uh that unprecedented attack in
the early hours of Sunday morning what
is absolutely clear is that uh Israel
has decided it will respond but will it
retaliate by attacking Iran directly
that would also be unprecedented after
Decades of a shadow war and covert
operations will it attack some of U
Iran's proxies and Lebanon Iraq Syria uh
or even indeed in Yemen or will they
wait and build a coalition these these
are questions which matter and they
matter to the Future stability at this
region in the midst of what is already a
very very volatile time as our world

d-vzAqSX9QU,Israel war cabinet meets to discuss Iran attack response | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel war cabinet meets to discuss Iran attack response  BBC News.jpg,"Israel's war cabinet has met for a
second time in less than 24 hours to
discuss how to respond to Iran's
unprecedented drone and missile attack
the government has not made public
whether a decision had been reached
during the late night meeting but
reiterated that there will be a response
meanwhile the White House has described
Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend
as a spectacular and embarrassing
failure nearly all of the more than 300
missiles and drones were shot down
earlier s shahata from BBC Arabic
explained what we've learned about
Israel's next moves this is no decision
was announced yet but uh the agreement
within the cabinet is about a response
uh the uh military Chief of Staff Mr
hery halvi said the Iranian attack will
be met with a response but the
discussing the uh the scale and timing
of the response because this will affect
if will be escalation or
how the Iranian respond because Iranian
said what Israeli done to strike the
Iranian Consulate in Damascus was a
strategic mistake and what we what we
the Iranian done was like a self-defense
so in this case that's it but Israeli
think it's damaging its reputation as
Superior power in the uh in the Middle
East so to be attacked on its soil by
all of that even the damage was minimal
inside the Israel it looks like a damage
for its reputation as a super superpower
so there is pressure on the cabinet and
on the Mr Netanyahu to make a response
however there is pressure also from
United States and other like United
Kingdom and Mr Cameron the uh foreign
secretary the British foreign Ministry
uh secretary said should be Israel
should be smart it was a failure so they
Tred to minimize the effect of the
Iranian strike because the damage was
minimal so they are the Israeli between
uh two pressures one from inside and
from outside respond or not and this
like situation will be escalating if
there is a response according to America
and other allies to Israel that was BBC
Arabic s shahata well let's speak to our
Middle East correspondent who is in
Jerusalem your land at Nell your land
it's good to have you now what more are
we hearing from Israeli
officials I mean we're not hearing
anything much on the record uh but a
very clear message has being being sent
in general that they will um retaliate
for the unprecedented Iranian attack in
the early hours of Sunday morning um we
had the Israeli military's Chief of
Staff uh going to the ne Team Air Base
it was one of the the few sites um that
was actually hit by ballistic missiles
um in that attack um it suffered minor
damage um and he was addressing the Air
Force pilots there and saying to them
that uh really that attack the use of so
many um missiles and drones uh could not
go um unmet and he was also
complimenting them on their capabilities
and their preparations um should their
uh Services be required as part of that
retaliation um of course there are other
means at Israel's disposable they could
uh go for something sort of more in
terms of asymmetric Warfare uh the likes
of uh the stuck net computer worm that
we saw in the past that was used to
effectively uh disable key parts of
Iran's uh nuclear program uh this has
been a shadow War that's gone on for so
many years between Israel and Iran uh
but now what's happened in recent days
has really uh pushed things into the
open it's of course causing so much
concern uh for world leaders uh they are
trying to uh persuade Israel to exercise
restraint um and the real dilemma of
Israel's war cabinet is how to send a
powerful message to Iran uh but at the
same time uh not escalate things in the
region in an extremely dangerous way now
Iran has been uh claiming that it gave
advanced warning about this attack uh
but as far as Israel is concerned how
much of a a blow is this how how serious
an attack or line do they feel has been
crossed I mean certainly they say that
um Iran has broken all red lines this
was the first time that Iran had
launched a direct attack on Israel from
its own territory um but at the same
time uh there is a real effort um by
world leaders and of course uh here in
Israel to to to Really look at this as
having been a success because the attack
was thwarted
99% of the missiles and drones that were
launched were uh brought down and there
was an alliance of Israel and the us the
UK even Jordan in the region um and and
others including uh the French that
really helped here and that showed you
know Israeli leaders have been pointing
out that there is uh a strategic
Alliance there can be Regional
cooperation uh to counter the threat
from Iran Iran has been putting out
signals we saw it again overnight when
the Iranian foreign minister and the
Chinese foreign minister spoke that Iran
itself does not want an escalation it
considers now that it has retaliated for
its first of April um the the 1 of April
attack that it suffered in Damascus when
there was an air strike that killed
seven members of the Revolutionary
guards at the Iranian consulate building
uh in Syria um and the Iranians have
been trying to say that what happened
was their limited response uh for that
deadly attack right really pains how
volatile the situation is in the Middle
East right now yoland Nell thank you so

launching a direct attack
Iran's attack came with careful
signaling its government warned Israel's
allies of the strikes and said they were
punishment for an assassination in Syria
and that Iran now considered the matter
closed our advice to all the supporters
of the Zionist regime is to appreciate
Iran's responsible and measured action
and dissuade the Zionist regime from
committing more wicked acts which would
bring incalculable
consequences but Israel has said it will
exact a price from Iran its prime
minister under pressure from allies to
deescalate the situation has been
discussing with his War cabinet exactly
what that price should
Beal one former Diplomat with experience
of Iran says military action is only one
option our military options are far more
varied than the Iranians um and frankly
the Iranian uh barrage was a a
demonstration of weakness not of
strength there's clearly uh a strong
need for Israel to uh however it decides
to respond and the respond can response
can come in many different ways not just
military Israel is already fighting
iranian-backed groups in Gaza to the
South and Lebanon to the north a far
less powerful opponent delivered a major
blow on the 7th of October Israel's
challenge now is how to restore a fear
of conflict in its biggest enemy without
triggering a war Lucy Williamson BBC
News
Jerusalem our International editor
Jeremy Bowen is here so as we heard
Jeremy Israel continuing to insist it
will retaliate even while the US is
saying Iran has embarrassed itself well
I think they're trying to get the
message over to the Israelis that look
yes your right to be concerned you have
been attacked
but this is under control look Iran's
embarrassed itself it's not that simple
though for the Israelis uh I think they
feel the need very strongly to send a
signal a really determined signal that
they uh are not deterred in any sense by
Iran there's something very deep in
Israel's DNA that it has to push back
it's not a question of turning the other
cheek it's an eye for an eye at least uh
that is something which is really part
of
their ethos but the gamble is always how
is the other side going to respond
because as you've heard the Iranians are
also saying hang on this was
self-defense we were just doing it to
make a point also to restore to Terence
and I think what they were also trying
to do was uh to avoid making causing a
large numbers of Civilian casualties
which would have escalated matters so
Israel is having those same similar
kinds of discussions about the way that
they need to go the Iranian Army Chief
has said today in the last few hours he
said something like our attack on Israel
was limited if Israel retaliates there
will be a far greater response you know
from netanyahu's point of view for many
years he has seen Iran as Israel's
number one enemy bana I remember him
saying to me in the BBC office in
Jerusalem about about 2006 when armad
was President he said look armad had is
Hitler and it's
1938 you know it wasn't an exclusive he
was saying it a lot at the time to
people but that's very much his view now
don't forget there's also the war in
Gaza going on that's something which is
still urgent it's still there's still
the famine there is still military
action going on there in the middle part
of the Gaza Strip but as far as Israel's
uh Western allies are concerned it is
less of a priority these last few days
than Iran Iran seems a lot more urgent
doesn't mean to say that they've
forgotten about what's going on there
but instead of talking about differences
potential war crimes famines they're
talking about Unity coalitions facing
Iran together",20240415
ESjBr9JAgRc,Israel allies urge 'restraint' instead of reaction after Iran drone attack | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel allies urge 'restraint' instead of reaction after Iran drone attack  BBC News.jpg,"let's now talk about what is happening
in the Middle East where the Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
reconvened his War cabinet following a
missile and drone attack on Israel by
Iran over the weekend Iran has sought to
justify its attack saying Western
countries should appreciate its
restraint Israel's allies including the
US and the UK urging restraint rather
than retaliation our chief International
correspondent Le duet has the
latest welcome to Jerusalem well the big
question across this region last week
was what will Iran do next and now this
week the same question is being asked
about Israel it's War cabinet met last
night for three hours to deliberate
about uh Israel's response after that
unprecedented attack by Iran in the
early hours of Sunday morning
350 suicide drones cruise missiles and
ballistic missiles and now again today
the war cabinet has convened
No statement yet about what they will do
but reports coming out of the
deliberations so far indicate that there
is a consensus emerging that Israel will
have to retaliate not now but at a time
and in a manner of their own choosing
this kind of tension is reverberating in
capitals around the world including in
New York last night where the UN
Secretary General Antonio gues led a
special meeting of the UN Security
Council warning that the region was on
the edge of an abyss it's one of the few
places where Israeli and Iranian top
diplomats can see each other face to
face Israel underlined that Iran in his
words had crossed all red lines Iran
said its attack was a move of legitimate
self-defense and today Iranian officials
are saying that they acted with
restraint that's not how Israel sees it
or its allies let's just take a look at
all the latest developments with this
report from our Middle East
correspondent yolan
Nell Israel's air defenses called to
action in the early hours on Sunday
fighter jets battled waves of Iranian
drones and missiles fired at Israeli
targets it marked the first time Iran
has attacked Israel directly from its
own soil explosions could be heard
widely including in Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv
Israel says that 99% of more than 300
drones and missiles launched by Iran
were intercepted some of those that got
through hid here in the sensitive never
Team Air Force Base in southern Israel
nearby 7-year-old am Huna was seriously
injured when a missile fragment struck
her
house the children were frightened and
wanted to run away from home and that's
when the Missile hit our house
the Israeli War cabinet met yesterday to
plan its next move one of its members
Benny Gans said Israel would exact a
price from Iran when the time is right
and last night the UN Security Council
met in an emergency meeting following
the attacks Israel called for sanctions
on Iran and reiterated its right to a
response this attack crossed every red
line and Israel reserves the legal right
to retaliate
we are not a frog in boiling water we
are a nation of
lions following such a massive and
direct attack on Israel the entire world
let alone Israel cannot settle for in
action we will defend our
future Iran's ambassador to the UN told
the meeting that its actions which were
in retaliation for a deadly air strike
on its Consulate in Syria were Justified
these countries especially the United
states have shielded Israeli from any
responsibility for the Gaza
Massacre while they have denied Iran
inherent right to self-defense against
the Israeli armed attack on our
diplomatic premises amid Rising tensions
the attacks have received widespread
International
condemnation the scale and nature of
Iran's heinous assault the first direct
attack from Iran on Israeli soil
poses grave risks to the security and
stability of citizens across the Middle
East now world leaders are pressing for
deescalation in a bid for calm in the
region the Middle East is on the
brink the people of the region are
confronting a real danger of a
devastating fullscale
conflict now is the time to diffuse and
deescalate
all eyes are on Israel and how it
responds yolan Nell BBC News
Jerusalem so an a moment of
unprecedented military action a war of
words and intensifying diplomacy even
world powers who normally disagree on
most issues are now sending the same
message the Kremlin in Moscow saying it
was extremely concerned about the
possibility for escalation the French
President Emanuel Macon saying that
everything had to be done to avoid an
conflagration in the Middle East and
this morning Britain's foreign secretary
Lord Cameron has been sending a message
to Israel to see uh its taking down of
Iran's wave of projectiles as a victory
and not to
retaliate I think it's important to be
respectful on these occasions a country
has had a massive attack uh from a
dangerous and malign actor in the region
they will be considering they are
considering the Israeli cabinet has been
uh meeting already to consider that our
advice is don't retaliate you know take
the win recognize Iran has suffered a
double defeat defeat as all the almost
all their weapons were shot down and
defeat because the world can now see
their true nature that the right thing
to do is to Pivot now and look at Hamas
and say they must release the hostages
so we wouldn't be supporting retaliatory
action but we're respectful of other
countries
Lord Cameron well last night the UN
Security Council two members the United
States and the UK condemned Iran's
strike and in the midst of this
criticism Iran has spoken out again
today a foreign Ministry spokesperson
defended Iran's action saying it would
acted in
Restraint instead of making accusations
the Western cont should appreciate the
Islamic Republic of Iran's rest Str and
responsible actions towards the
stability and safety in the
region Western countries should blame
themselves and answer to public opinion
for the measures they have taken against
the seven months of war crimes
committed the view from Iran well for a
very long time Iran prided itself on
what it called strategic patience in
other words not responding immediately
whenever it was provoked or threatened
but in ton now senior military and
political officials are using a new
phrase they call it a new equation to
get some insight into Iran's thinking
we're joined by Muhammad Ali Shabani
he's the editor of amaj media welcome to
BBC News
Muhammad thank you for having
me this sounds like a very dangerous
moment with Iran saying that from now on
there is this new equation that when it
is hit it will hit back immediately is
that how you understand
it those are the precise words of the U
chief commander of the irgc indeed he
stated that not only Iranian Personnel
but any Iranian assets and interests
that may be hit will receive a direct
response from Iran and I think this is a
a reaction more than an action and what
I mean by that is that the April 1
bombing of the Iranian Consulate in
Syria which initiated the uh Iranian
attack that we saw on Israel was a kind
of change in the rules of the game so to
speak the previously diplomatic premises
were off limits and Israel appears to
have wanted to change that what we're
seeing now from Iran side is to say okay
we're going to change the rules of the
game so will we so this is a very
dangerous period because both sides are
trying to lay out new rules of the
game both sides aside from this tit
fortat want to establish a powerful
deterrence in other words to make it
clear to their enemy that they there
will be a cost if they do strike now
there are some observers who say Iran
strengthened its determins by showing
its willingness to send this wave of
missiles and drones but others say it
has weakened it because almost none of
them reached their target how would you
see
it I think there's always two different
ways of looking at what happened uh to
me the operation was carefully
choreographed it was telegraphed in
advance days in advance to Iran's
neighbors to the United States Iran also
made the launches of for instance drones
from its own territory which meant that
Israel had many hours of of forewarning
I think that in a real life uh direct
confrontation which Iran has warned that
he will engage it unless if Israel
continues to take action against Iran
things will be very different there will
be no advanced warning there will be no
choreographing drones probably will not
only be launched from Iran and most
importantly of all Iran's Reg allies
will also participate and in such a
scenario I think very easily a group
such as Hezbollah and Lebanon can
overwhelm Israeli air defenses so I
think what this episode told us all is
that uh the countries which shot down
many of the missiles I think did both
Iran and Israel the faith they've acted
to provide both sides with a faith-
saving way out they allowed Iran to say
that we can claim victory we took action
that was unprecedented can also allow
Israel to say that we also achieved
Victory by shooting down most
I hope that makes
sense and how does Iran see its position
in the region now of course it has its
allies and proxies the so-called axis of
resistance but beyond that it has been
on the telephone repeatedly to foreign
ministers in Saudi Arabia to the United
Arab Emirates how does it see its
positioning
now I mean one major shift is that only
a few years ago countries such as the
ones you mentioned Saudi Arabia and the
UAE would have
welcome a confrontation between Iran
Israel or Iran and the United States um
things are very different now because
partly these countries have initiated
normalization processes with Iran Iran
is very eager to continue that process
so I think there's a mutual desire in
the region among Iran and its Arab
neighbors to lower tensions and here I
think they're joined by the US they're
joined by Europe so I think the the
owners right now is on Israel and this
next steps
mad Ali Shabani of amaj media thank you
very much uh for joining us here on BBC
News with your Reflections and insights
into the thinking in Iran after this
unprecedented attack Iran says it did
inflict considerable damage it said its
missiles did hit the nativo airbase in
southern Israel Israel admits that yes
indeed they did take a direct hit but
say the damage was minimal so the again
as always Lucy in in war it's the facts
on the ground but it's also the
perception of what what happened on the
ground which tends to drive these
conflicts Le is that there in Jerusalem",20240415

systems had been activated and again the
Israeli authorities saying that 99% of
the missiles and drones that were fired
by uh Iran were intercepted this was an
unprecedented attack for the first time
ever Iran uh launched an attack a direct
attack on Israeli territory so this is a
very dangerous moment here uh but I
think there have been some efforts
already to try to deescalate tensions

of the crisis in the Middle East Iran
has started a direct attack on Israel by
launching dozens of drones to attack
targets there they're expected to reach
Israel in the next couple of hours
Israel says its armed forces are on full
alert with combat planes in the air Iran
has said it wants revenge for a
suspected Israeli attack almost two
weeks ago on its Consulate in Damascus
when the US President Joe Biden has cut
short his weekend to turn to the White
House for briefings on the crisis well
in a moment we'll get the very latest
from Washington and our correspondent
there will Vernon first though let's go
straight to James landel who's live for
us in Jerusalem tonight and James this
is an attack that Israel has been
expecting for several days
now yeah that's right Ben ever since
that attack on the Iranian Consulate in
Syria there's been growing speculation
that Iran will have to respond in some
way there's been talk about different
types of attack but it now appears that
attack is underway military spokesman
here in Israel say that uh drones have
now been launched from Iran they are
directed towards Israel there have been
reports from Iraq of drone many drones
been seen in the sky the Israeli
spokesman said that those drones will
take some hours before they reach uh
their target here and he says that uh
he's confident that Israel's air
defenses will shoot them down uh early
today just before this attack was
formally confirmed the Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu gave an address to
the nation saying that his country would
overcome all its
enemies Israeli citizens in recent years
and even more so in recent weeks Israel
has been preparing for the possibility
of a direct attack from
Iran our defense systems are deployed we
are prepared for any scenario both in
defense and attack the state of Israel
is strong the IDF is strong and the
public is
strong now as you heard there the
Israelis at the moment are just talking
about drones but the Iranian
revolutionary guards have put out a
statement saying that they are attacking
with drones and missiles too and in a
statement the uh supreme leader in Iran
Ali aai said and I quote the malicious
Zionist regime that's his name for
Israel will be punished for what he
called an attack on Iranian soil in
other words the attack on the Iranian
Consulate in Syria now the question
tonight is how effective this attack
will be and what response Israel may
make uh as a result of that a spokesman
said this evening this is a severe and
dangerous escalation Ben all right James
thank you very much indeed that's James
landel live in Jerusalem let's go to
will Vernon in Washington and will the
United States states of course is
Israel's closest Ally President Joe
Biden has promised Ironclad support in
his words for Israel uh with this attack
tonight that's right Ben President Biden
is back in the white house he earlier
cut short a weekend away in Delaware to
come back to Washington and attend uh
that urgent uh National Security Council
meeting and we've had a statement from
National Security uh Council saying Iran
has begun an Airborne attack against
Israel President Biden is being regular
updated on the situation by his National
Security team who are in constant
communication with Israeli officials and
it goes on to say that this attack is
likely to unfold over a number of hours
and unnamed us officials have been
speaking to us media uh saying that they
expect uh this drone attack to be
synchronized with missiles that could be
uh launched later on uh but as you said
President Biden and other us officials
have repeatedly said over the pre over
the last few days uh that American
support for Israeli security is Ironclad
and we know that US forces uh in the
region are on alert and are ready uh to
assist uh the Israelis uh with
protecting their territory uh but uh us
intelligence officials here reportedly
uh believe that the Iranians are
targeting multiple sites uh inside
Israel but importantly not US forces uh
in the region uh directly that would of
course uh be a dangerous escalation

have been allowed in to help there Dr
Victoria Rose is one of them she's a
consultant plastic surgeon at G and St
Thomas's Hospital in London but has just
spent the last two weeks in Gaza where
much of her work was on children under
the age of 60
she filmed there for us to show us what
life is like young men so here we are
we've made it across the
shab the day been pretty um long
actually we left um Cairo this morning
with the UN Convoy I was last here in
2020 and um it's completely different
it's like a different
entity inside they've tried to keep the
sort of working area very clean the
floors are very clean there's somebody
sweeping all the time but once you get
into the corridors it's full of people
in tents and they've made sort of
makeshift tents out of sheets and
carpets um and it's it's not clean and
outside it's it's you know it's just
Mayhem it's like a massive Village it
stinks it's Ro sewage it's unacceptable
for people to live like this sleeping by
the
bedside so uh we were operating till
last night at midnight we finished our
last case but the um general surgeons
have been going all night you can hear
the drones
[Music]
again this is my first case he is a a
young boy who's been hit by a car got a
scalp
laceration and de gloving he was Tak to
theater last week and the Scout was
closed but unfortunately now time skin
has died so we are going to take it back
to
theater and see if we can sort out his
Scout we've had a bit of delayed start
because there's been um quite a lot of
bombing this evening um so we've uh
we've got quite a lot more work coming
to us tomorrow and I'm I'm kind of in
that situation now where I just I just
want to cease fire so that we can catch
up so this is the field Hospital there's
four wards that were all built during Co
it's Tuesday the
um 2nd of April and the the drones are
back so I'm uh walking back to theater
on my own which which is um something
that the boys don't really like me can
do like me doing and I don't know
whether you can see I have like a a
group of children
constantly following me and saying
hello hello yeah and then they will ask
me for money or they'll ask me for
chocolate no money money I have no
money this just walking through the
hospital
again got three days of operating
left and I'm already panicking about the
fact that we're not going to get through
everybody that we need to get through
before I go um it is it is I know now
it's going to be very difficult to leave
and I'm not looking forward to
it but I've now I'm now out of out of

for our weekly segment AI
[Music]
decoded welcome to Aid decoded that time
of the week when we look in depth at
some of the more eye-catching stories in
the world of artificial intelligence so
we're going to start with futurism which
reports that uh the humans behind the
accounts of virtual influences or AI
generated characters that masquerade is
the real thing on social media media are
now pasting fake faces onto the bodies
of Real Models meanwhile Business
Insider asks whether AI will put an end
to gen Z's obsession with becoming an
influencer after Major Brands begin to
show interest in using AI models instead
of humans Mashable says a misc captioned
video falsely claiming to be an Iranian
missile strike on Tel Aviv was promoted
as legitimate by social media platform X
fake headline quote Iran strikes Tel
Aviv with heavy missiles was apparently
generated by X's own official AI
chatbot The Verge looks at Ai and
copyright in the US a new bill could
force uh tech companies to disclose any
copyrighted materials they use to train
their AI models the bill from
representative uh Adam shift would
require anyone making a training data
set for AI to to submit reports on its
contents to the copyrights
register there's been a pet hate of
teachers everywhere but not in Texas
where they plan to replace thousands of
human exam markers with artificial
intelligence it's believed the AI graded
tests could save $20 million a year
that's from Tech
spot and finally popular science uh
future AI developer Google deepmind who
are now able to train tiny off-the-shelf
robots to play soccer uh we'll show you
a bit of that
later with me is priia Lani who's CEO of
century Tech and artificial intelligence
education technology company that
develops AI powered learning tools
thanks very much for coming on the
program good to see you great to see you
okay we're going to start now with this
AI influences so artificial influence we
we can take a look at um a little bit of
what we are talking about so those AI
influen
are deep faking fake faces onto real
women's bodies without permission and
the the subheading there is it's a real
problem is that is that how you see it
yeah absolutely so the first story is
about these people that are taking the
real bodies of women mostly and then
they're putting on a deep fake face
right and then they're posting that and
earning money actually from it most of
the time on competitive of only fans
which is a platform where essentially
creators can put on their own content
now in the context of only fans um more
creators on only fans are women rather
than men um 85% of the top 10% of
earners are women and an average Creator
Le just to give you a bit of context
right earns about $180 a month so this
is a business for some of these creators
where they're you know using their own
images their own bodies and creating
that content and so essentially their
content and their videos are being
ripped off right because then you
superimpose an AI face and post it
elsewhere and you make money off that
content so firstly you're violating
personal rights yes but the second thing
you're doing is obviously infringing on
the the woman the creators intellectual
property um and 300 people I think 300
odd odd creators have surpassed a
million dollars annually earning money
from from doing this so they have a very
good right to be very very upset about
this so it is a real problem and just
just so you you get it personally this
took me six 60 seconds to do actually if
we can put it up on on the screen so I
created one of you but
actually so because there are so many
tools that allow us to do this so This
literally took me less than a minute
actually I've done the reverse here I've
got your face but I've actually changed
your body yeah right you look great
casual
Lewis but but and so that's a bit of
fern but can we have a look at it in
this context so I just created this
before I got here so I didn't have time
to send it to the producers but if you
look at my iPad leis so I took a video
of you okay on BC just
lift Okay so we've got you on the BBC
presenting okay um a story about Tik Tok
so hopefully the viewers can see that I
apologize this is really last minute
yeah and then uh through magic hour AI
I've mashed your face with Christians
Christian phrases oh my that is a
terrifying thought in every way
right but you see how this is you in
your day job right so I've got your body
I've got your I've got the BBC
thankfully it stopped it stopped right
so you and Christian together that's
what you guys would look like um but
what's interesting about that I think
your your floor manager is laughing no
one can hear that right now um the
reason that's really important to show
is that that is you in your day job and
so creators are obviously creating this
content you know which we we've shown um
viewers and they're earning money from
it so not only is it a personal affront
but it's also a professional affront
well and how do you you just knock
knocked that up pretty quickly and
pretty disturbing that's in the cab on
the way here and and so how do you how
do you begin to try and stop that how if
it's so easy how do you how can you try
and stop well and I think some of the
some of the stories that we're going to
come on to will help with this but
obviously the input here is a an
infringement right it's an infringement
of Ip rights so there are laws um to
protect uh copyright and we're going to
talk about that in a minute in a future
story but what's really important is
when we're talking about this sort of
generative AI okay separate it into two
areas separate it into the input this is
really important for the rest of how
regulation and law develops in this area
separate AI into the training data what
was the input what data was used to
train the artificial intelligence models
yes and then the output what came out of
the other side right now actually in the
cases in the story The reason why it's
just so blatant is because the output is
also substantially similar right to the
input okay so how do you do that well
there are laws to protect in these areas
is but what I find and find really
really difficult is the fact that law is
sometimes so expensive and difficult to
access for some people so it's not
actually as as Fair as saying well you
know you've got recourse okay let's look
at this is very very linked as you were
talking Business Insider Jen's fading
dream human influences are being
replaced by artificial intelligence and
maybe that's a good thing yeah well so
so apparently a lot of gen Zed and I got
anywhere from half of genz to a quarter
of gened that's a lot of gen Zed want to
be influencers that's the future career
aspiration of of of these young people
about 25% of marketers work with
influencers and and again it's a job for
them right so when it comes to
influencers they earn a lot of money um
they they create content they partner
with brands for example and Brands find
this really great because the return on
investment from an influencer promoting
your content is higher on average than
if you just advertise your content so a
brand would earn an average of about
just over $5 in Media value for every $1
spent on an influencer so it's a huge
Market but the reason why this article
is basically saying your hopes and
dreams no longer going to be alive right
genz said is because people are using AI
influencers these are completely
fictitious which is what we're seeing
right now so this woman here is not a
real woman that's AI on top no that's AI
absolutely that's yeah exactly so
they're using AI to actually you know
and and why right because it's cheaper
right so if I can do that in a few
minutes right if you're doing it where
you're not substantially copying this is
a different story right this is not
about copying on on real pp's bodies but
if you can create truly original con
original output content I should say
otherwise every Tech is going to have a
goat me saying hang on what was the
input okay but you can do that cheaper
Brands can do that cheaper you don't
have to pay people money you could run
many characters on platforms yourself
you don't have to deal with any egos
that would be pretty cool right the
video to me the presenter ego absolutely
talking and and and so therefore this is
a potential solution to that issue but I
tell you what could happen right which
is really interesting if you end up with
AIS right out there influencing and
partnering with Brands right the the
most the area that most uses influences
is lifestyle and second is beauty right
the point is is that you trust
influencers that's why they work are you
going to trust an AI putting cream on
their face saying my visible in my 40s
lines have disappeared so actually that
authenticity of the human I think will
become even more valuable in the future
so therefore therefore still Del a
potential career path right we're going
to move on to Mashable we're going to
whip through a couple of these stories
now Elon musk's X pushed a fake headline
about Iran attacking
Israel uh talk us through this because
this is potential real world warning
signal yeah and this is what actually
people have been talking about for so
long so the fact that we're just seeing
it play out is actually really really
sad um for for the people that have been
in this space for years talking about
this so essentially all that happened
was that um there was content onx right
that was fake news right the fact that
it stated that Iran was responsible for
these strikes actually that's the
footage was from Ukraine I think uh
launching strikes against Russians in
Crimea um but anyway it was it was fake
news and then grock which is uh Elon
musk's big investment in generative AI
um that operates on the X platform took
essentially this content saw it as a
trending topic made up this is an AI
right made up its own headline made up
its own contextualized story all fake
news and then actually posted that to X
users and and the problem with this
obviously is it's dangerous and it
reminds you of that 1938 a and Wells
story where War of the Worlds right
where he was on the radio and he was
actually talking about martians and
Aliens descending on Earth people tuned
in a bit late and there was mass
hysteria apparently people left their
homes so how you can have an influence
by posting fake news is real this is
really dangerous and disinformation in
fake news has to be tackled and we need
to hurry up right in terms of Regulation
and I mean you know ex ex is already in
trouble with the EU at the moment and I
think it's only a matter of time really
you know for for other states to take
action as well okay we're going to have
a look at legislation attempts anyway
The Verge a new Bill wants to reveal
what's really inside AI training data so
what's the attempt here yeah okay so
this is very much linked to all of this
right so the input data so what's
happened here is Adam Schiff who is um I
believe a you're going to correct me a
Democrat sen Senator have I got that
right but he's proposed a bill to the
House of Representatives where
essentially any generative AI platforms
would have to list if the bill was
passed so post Bill not not the current
platforms with their current training
data just to be clear um any copyright
sources copyrighted sources that they've
used to train their data models which
actually gives you that transparency of
what's been used right the EU already
have this
um in their in their drafts uh for the
EU um AI act so so essentially it would
it would it would put you on this Level
Playing Field with the EU and the UK is
saying that people in the UK saying we
should hurry up as well and so it gives
you that transparency of what has been
the input content so when there are
cases there are plenty of lawsuits at
the moment for example John Grisham and
a bunch of authors the New York Times
has taken open AI to court it would give
content creators and copyright holders
the ability to to essentially check if
their content has been used and if
copyright has been infringed I see but
it's not law yet so we keep an eye on it
see how it see how it develops it's
moving quickly okay uh we're going to
stay in the US Texas is replacing
thousands of human exam scorers with AI
this is from Tech spot uh how is this
going to work this is really interesting
right so it does cost millions and
millions of pounds in the UK dollars in
the US all over the world to Mark exam
scripts so they've changed the exam in
Texas so that it has more long form
answers so less multiple choice exact
short answer and they're going to be
using trained AI models to Mark students
answers now before you look really
skeptical okay what I would say is if
you look at gcses in the UK in England
for example if you look at the GCSE
papers and long form answers for example
in a history essay right actually it's
pretty proven that marking can be a bit
skew whiffing cases because you have the
human marking and it can be sometimes
quite subjective even if you have a
rubric and a mark scheme and we've
actually developed this sort of
Technology at Cent as well when it comes
to literacy what you do is you train
your own proprietary models you don't
just plug it into a GPT why because when
a third party upgrades its own models
actually you don't know what changes
have been made and then you can see a
prompt that you enter today could
actually give you a completely different
answer next time and then you use the
exam scripts you look at the you
essentially constantly have this human
evaluation which is what Texas will do
they've trained it on 3,000 transcripts
they'll mark Mark and save lots of money
and apparently need to use 2,000 people
rather than 6,000 people this year but
it actually is an ongoing investment
because every time an exam takes place
you take lots of scripts you look at the
scripts where there was a low
probability of those scripts being
marked properly you retrain your models
and it's an ongoing process very quickly
that seems to make sense and I can't
imagine marking script after script if
you're a human teacher or exam is the
most fun so that's po I bet some of them
find it really fun
actually I'm Jud
it's an we have 30 seconds left do you
want to watch some cute little robots
playing football of course you do let's
take a look at
that right just in 20 seconds priia
what's going on so essentially Deep Mind
have built these mini robots playing
football they use what's called Deep
reinforcements learning it's a really
really powerful technique in artificial
intelligence where you look at all the
permutations of how a football uh play
might take place you reward the system
or you punish it if it doesn't for
example score a goal and then they're
basically through Brute Force training
it with tons and tons of data using deep
learning as well so the technique is
super interesting and here you go will
will one of those be lifesized and play
for Man United and help my team I don't
know hopefully oh he's falling over
again it is adorable when they fall over
right priia amazing thank you so much
we're are out of time thank you thanks

Cg3YMWcjLI4,US President Joe Biden vows 'ironclad' support for Israel amid Iran attack fears | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US President Joe Biden vows 'ironclad' support for Israel amid Iran attack fears  BBC News.jpg,"hello I'm Nikki schill welcome to the
program we start this hour with the
latest developments in the Middle East
President Biden has promised Israel
Ironclad United States support amid
fears that Iran could launch reprisals
for an attack that killed senior
Iranians Us Media are reporting that an
American General visit Israel on
Thursday to discuss Washington's fears
President Biden warned at Iran is
threatening to launch a significant
attack after Israel struck the Iranian
Consulate in Syria 10 days ago Mr Biden
was speaking hours after the Iranian
supreme leader again said Israel would
be punished for the strike on its
consulate meanwhile the Hamas political
leader ishmail hania says there'll be no
change in the group's demands for a
permanent ceas fight in Gaza despite the
killing of three of his sons in an
Israeli air strike Israeli media is
reporting that the Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu had not been briefed
in advance of the attack this video is
believed to show Ismael hania receiving
the news in Qatar where he lives in
Exile Israel has confirmed the strike
describing the Suns as Hamas military
operatives he's been actively involved
in negotiations to broker a ceasefire
with Israel demanding a permanent end to
the fighting and the return of displaced
Palestinians to their homes we'll assess
the implications of the killing of his
sons in a moment first his President
Biden on the threat posed by Iran in the
region we also want to address the
Iranian threat to launch a sign they're
threatening to launch a significant
attack on Israel as I told prime
minister
Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's
security against these threats from Iran
and his proxies is Ironclad let me say
it again Ironclad we're going to do all
we can to protect Israel's security
let's go live to our Middle East
correspondent Hugo Bea who is in
Jerusalem we heard President Biden there
Hugo there are real fears now over what
Iran might do and the possibility of the
conflict spreading wider in the
region yeah and it's very interesting
that over the last few days American
officials have been saying that they
believe this possible Iranian uh
response to that attack in Damascus is a
matter of when and not if and uh
obviously you know we don't know what
the Iranians are planning to do they
have this network of factions across the
region the socalled axes of resistance
which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon the
houthis in Yemen uh factions in Iraq and
Syria and all those players have already
been involved in this conflict Hezbollah
for example has been attacking Israel
from Lebanon almost every day but I
think the fear here is that Iran may be
planning to launch an attack by itself
uh you know from its own territory and
that could be involving um missiles and
drones and uh Israeli officials have
been saying that uh they are going to
retaliate to any kind of attack coming
from uh Iran uh Israeli Authority said
they would give a significant response
and uh I think you know in another sign
of these concerns uh today the axio
website is reporting that the senior US
military commander in charge of the
Middle East is going to come to Israel
to have conversations with the Israeli
defense minister and also with u
military officials and I think what
President Biden was trying to say is
that despite uh the differences uh you
know between the Americans and the
Israelis over the you know the Israeli
conduct in the war in Gaza and we've
seen in the last few days you know the
level of frustration from America uh
with Israel with the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu President
Biden is saying that these two countries
remain very strong allies and that any
kind of Iranian attack on Israel would
trigger uh an American reaction if we
move now to that attack that killed the
three sons of hamas's political lead
what more do we know about the attack
itself yeah so is ha is saying that this
was a political assassination and that
uh you know his reaction was that you
know Israel would be delusional to think
that this would change uh you know the
position of Hamas in these ceasefire
negotiations I think you know the key
context here to this attack is that uh
this happened as you know uh we're
waiting to to hear from Hamas whether
they're going to accept you know the
ceasefire proposal that was put forward
after those mediat negotiations in Cairo
and uh at the heart of this proposal is
a six we ceasefire uh in the conflict in
Gaza uh and uh you know this would see
Hamas uh releasing you know 40 hostages
were being held in Gaza in return for
900 Palestinians were now being held in
Israeli jails but many obstacles remain
because it seems that Hamas has told
negotiators that it doesn't have you
know 40 hostages who fit the criteria
that has been you know set up in this
proposal you know female soldiers
elderly people people who are sick uh
and it seems that there's some
differences as well uh related to the
identity of the prisoners who are going
to be released so we're still waiting to
hear from Hamas but I think you know
Hamas has been sticking with its you
know demand that any kind of ceasefire
in Gaza should be permanent because you
know senior Hamas official said that
they believe that any kind of temporary
ceas fire would mean that once the
hostages are out the Israelis May return
to Gaza to finish the job and tried to
destroy Hamas so they want a permanent
ceasefire they want the end o of the war
but we're still waiting to see uh you
know how they're going to respond to
this latest proposal Hugo PGA at Middle
East correspondent live in Jerusalem
thank you",20240411
8SepfTHRJ3U,7 members of Hamas leader’s family killed in Israeli airstrike - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\7 members of Hamas leader’s family killed in Israeli airstrike - BBC News.jpg,"three sons and four grandchildren of the
political leader of Hamas have been
killed in an Israeli air strike on their
car in Gaza ishmail hania who lives in
Exile in Kata has been actively involved
in negotiations to broker a ceasefire
with Israel in return for some of the
more than 100 hostages still being held
by Hamas he now says the killing of
members of his family will not change
demands for a permanent end to the
fighting and the return of displaced
Palestinians to their homes
Israel has confirmed the strike
describing the brothers as Hamas
military operatives Jeremy Bowen has the
very latest from
Jerusalem three missiles hid the car in
the shatty refugee camp in Gaza City is
hania's three sons and three
grandchildren were killed along with
their driver Witnesses told local
journalists that they were visiting
bereaved families the Israelis said they
attacked to stop the men committing an
act of Terror
the Dead Man's father is the senior
Hamas political leader deeply involved
in ceasefire
talks isil hania was in Kat when he was
told his sons were dead their blood he
said was no more precious than that of
any Palestinian and Hamas would not
change its position on a
ceasefire killing members of Isel
hania's family might strengthen
suspicions that Israel's prime minister
does not want a ceasefire deal with
Hamas and will buy Time by sabotaging
the
talks for Muslims this day is supposed
to be joyful it is ID Al F the
celebration at the end of Ramadan even
in Gaza this is Rafa where life was
always hard Eid was a
respite this year graveyard visits
instead of presents sweet treats and new
clothes for the
children ummed is at her son Ham's grave
one of more than 33,000 pales Ians
killed by
Israel I'm asking God to take revenge on
Israel and America may they suffer too
oh God have their children killed and
their wives widowed they destroyed our
house we live on the street Gaza is
drowning in destruction darkness and
Damnation benuron University about 25 mi
from Gaza looks tranquil but more than
100 St students and staff from here were
killed or taken hostage on the 7th of
October 6 and a half thousand students
were mobilized among them three young
men just back from Gaza after months in
combat tell me what the impact of the
7th of October was on you I think
everybody here is related somehow to
what happened everybody feel everybody
knows someone that was kidnapped that
was killed it's it's all all around the
country I mean you saw Palestinian
civilian inside Gaza and they've been
going through hell what was going
through your mind I think many of them
aren't innocent and I think it will be
really hard to find those that are
Innocent but it doesn't mean I think
everyone should uh get hurt and what's
the future going to be with the
Palestinians next door I think that if
You' have asked me this question on
October 6th then I would say definitely
yes I would uh just do a Palestinian
State let them live over the there we'll
live over here and we'll all coexist and
everything will be nice but after
October 7th it seems clear to me that
that they don't want it as much as I
wanted it of course I prefer to be here
in the university to study to go and
drink my coffee instead of go going
fighting a war like it's not fun going
to to fight in a war but sometimes it's
necessary and in this situation it's
necessary I mean it's it's a two-way
street sort of what you like your
question I mean it like it feels kind of
Israel's responsibility to not
radicalize gazans but where is gaza's
responsibility to towards us you know I
mean this if we ever want to coexist if
we want a two-state solution we need
responsibility on both sides we need
accountability at the North End of Gaza
the fences that did not stop Hamas have
been repaired last week after
International anger about the
humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza Israel
promised to open this Crossing Aras to
allow Aid directly into the north which
faces famine it is still shut prime
minister Netanyahu is under a lot of
pressure at the moment from the
Americans who want to cease fire and for
him to open the gates of Gaza to
unlimited amounts of humanitarian aid
from the hostage families who want to
deal with Hamas to get their people back
and from the ultra nationalists in his
own Coalition who've said that if that
offensive intera doesn't go ahead then
they will bring down his
government North Gaza gripped by hunger
and disease is on the other side of the
wall when The Siege was imposed the
Israeli defense minister said they were
fighting Human animals 6 months on
Israel's allies say it's 1200 dead on
the 7th of October did not give it
license to kill and destroy so
much
prospects for those ceasefire talks are
not looking good at the moment not just
because of the attack on isia's family
it's also because the two sides are way
apart Hamas has their position
essentially saying in return for the
hostages Israel has to eventually fully
pull out of Gaza Israel meanwhile wants
to do that military operation in Rafa
which the Americans are against now a
couple of days ago I was wondering
whether it's clearly not the end of the
war but maybe the beginning of the end
game I don't think that is the case I
think now that it's clear that there's a
lot more to go in in Gaza but more than
that in the wider Middle East war
between Israel and Iran and its friends
that could escalate too Israel tonight
is on high alert because of warnings
relayed as well by the Americans of an
Iranian strike of some sort on Israel
and that would be in retaliation for the
assassination that Israel uh mounted in
Damascus last week of a senior Iranian
General and other senior officers at
their diplomatic compound in the Syrian
Capital so I'm afraid to say again that
the war in Gaza no chance of it ending
soon I'd say and The Wider war in the
Middle East the sad and sorry uh steady
escalation perhaps to something worse

in the biggest Coalition Aid airdrop in
a single day into Gaza the scale of the
delivery was time to Mark the end of
Ramadan 14 aircraft delivered 10 tons of
food and essential Aid in an operation
led by the Jordanian Air Force the UK
was among the participating Nations
Britain's foreign secretary David
Cameron said thousands of people in
desperate need would benefit Israel's
been under International pressure to
allow more Aid trucks access by land and
work is continuing on a maritime air
Corridor our diplomatic correspondent
James landel joined the Royal Air Force
flight delivering Aid to
Gaza at an Airbase in Jordan piles of
humanitarian Aid stacked into individual
pallets adorned with their own parachute
all of it Bound for
Gaza on the tarmac 14 military aircraft
getting ready for the largest Coalition
airdrop since began last month a special
delivery to Mark the end of
Ramadan inside pilots and Crews from
nine Nations being briefed on the
Operation Safety a key concern in the
small airspace over
Gaza outside the RAF plane is loaded
each pallet containing flour rice sugar
beans baby food oil and water the basics
for a meal this the raf's sixth airdrop
so far it is not that much but I tell
you what it's the effort that counts as
in every little helps um I'm quite proud
and privileged to be involved in this s
of mission but is it enough will it meet
the needs of the people in Gaza the
aircraft's carrying 12 of these pallets
now each of them are about a ton so that
means this entire
payload is worth about one truck
crossing a border on the
ground the air Crews here insist that
cumulatively the air drops are beginning
to have an impact this is a sustained
effort um we've been here for 3 weeks
now and we're we're continually
delivering um with the aid um the people
of Gaza are very grateful for the
efforts that we're going to and we'll
keep delivering and keep delivering
until we can't give them
anymore in the air we fly the short
distance to Gaza then we're over the
Drop Zone the pilots are satisfied no
one's below and the back ramp
lowers these air drops are expensive and
inadequate a symbol of the failure to
get Aiden by other means but we're told
they're better than nothing and they are
making a
difference 12 boxes out all On Target on
the Northern Shore these air drops can
be dangerous people have been crushed in
the Stampede to get to the pallets but
there's little that can be done from the
air so today the Skies over Gaza were
filled with parachutes Israel said more
Aid trucks are getting through but how
many is not clear this aid from the air
will not fill the Gap but the air Crews
involved hope believe it is making a
difference to so many facing famine on

and in the latest development the
biggest Coalition airdrop of Aid since
the War Began is taking place to Mark
the end of Ramadan speaking in the past
hour the British foreign secretary Lord
Cameron said thousands of people in
desperate need would benefit meanwhile
Hamas says Israel's threat to attack the
city of Rafa in southern Gaza raises
questions about the purpose of any
further talks on a ceasefire in exchange
for the release of Israeli hostages uh
let's get the latest now from our chief
International correspondent Lee duet uh
lease bring us right up to
date yes the long Muslim month of
fasting has ended this evening at dusk
and Begins the very special time of the
Islamic Eid Festival the most important
days of the Islamic calendar A Time
usually of me seeing family and friends
of eating together praying together but
sadly in the midst of the Gaza war is
particularly in Gaza where most of the
population is now living with acute
hunger there's not much to celebrate and
so to lift Spirits as we've been
reporting the biggest airdrop since the
start of the Gaza War has been carried
out 14 air drops nine Nations the whole
operation led by Jordan and perhaps to
try to lift the spirits of children this
a drop includes sweets and toys one of
the countries taking part is Britain and
the Royal Air Force and our diplomatic
correspondent James landale is on an RAF
plane this is the biggest Aid drop yet
nine Nations 14 aircraft and is been
organized to Mark the end of Ramadan and
that means that some of the aid that's
been delivered today it's not just food
and water it's also toys it's also
clothes now here in this RAF aircraft
we've got 12 of these
containers and they they contain food
water we're talking things like rice
flour sugar uh baby powders tea bags
cooking oil everything that's needed
just to survive now each of these
containers there about a ton plus or
minus and there are 12 of them here in
the hold now it might look a lot here
but actually that's less than one truck
Crossing The Bard
by land so this is clearly not enough
now people say no it's it it will make
an impact it's better than nothing and
cumulatively because these air drops
have been going on for about a month
now that means it's beginning to tell
one of the officials said that around
1,400 tons of Aid has been delivered by
air so far and they're saying that's
beginning to have an impact but the
bottom line is it's not enough it's a
very expensive way of delivering Aid uh
it's inadequate it's a symbol of the
failure to get Aid in by other
means but as everybody on this aircraft
will tell you it's probably better than
nothing",20240409
yQIMSv9Luw4,Lord Cameron meets Antony Blinken after 'private' talks with Donald Trump | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Lord Cameron meets Antony Blinken after 'private' talks with Donald Trump  BBC News.jpg,"right we're going to look now at UK US
diplomacy because foreign secretary
David Cameron is the latest European
leader to make the trip to Washington
just a few hours ago he met US Secretary
of State Anthony blinkin here talks
focused on well the two major conflicts
bringing stability to the Middle East
and the war in Ukraine now Republican
lawmakers have been holding up a
proposed 60 billion dollar military aid
package for Ukraine for months
Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson
has n let the Ukraine Aid issue be
debated in the House of Representatives
as yet now Lord Cameron said it wasn't
for foreign politicians to tell uh
lawmakers In Another Country what to do
but he urged Congress to see the funding
released I think it is absolutely
interests of US security uh that Putin
fails in his illegal Invasion I think
it's good for us jobs uh that we
continue to back uh Ukraine with the
weapons that they need and I think in
terms of how the United States the
United Kingdom as allies are seen around
the world um there will be people in
Teran in pongyang in Beijing looking at
how we stand by our allies how we help
them how we stop this uh illegal and
unprovoked aggression and working out
whether we are committed whether we're
prepared to see it through and Mr
blinkin said they' also talked about
ways to prevent the transfer of weapons
to Russia particularly from China and
North Korea this is an ongoing challenge
uh and we see um weapons U we also see
Technologies to support the defense
industrial base in uh Russia coming from
North Korea from Iran from China this is
an area of particular concern for not
only the United States and the United
Kingdom but many of our allies and
partners throughout Europe let's speak
now to our state department
correspondent Tom baitman hi Tom so what
should we take away from that pressure
conference well the most significant bit
of news was an answer to M that Lord
Cameron gave to a question I asked him
in the Press briefing there which was
about the growing pressure on the UK
government to Halt armed sales to Israel
around the issue of whether or not
Israel had been deemed by the UK to be
in breach of international humanitarian
law in Gaza now um Lord Cameron had said
on the 8th of March that he would
receive legal advice within days about
that issue but here we are a month later
and there had still been no announcement
so I asked him that question what um did
the UK government deem um Israel to have
done when it came to International
humanitarian law and he confirmed in his
answer that the UK would continue to
supply weapons to Israel and therefore
that a review had taken place and my
understanding is these are fairly broad
not just legal reviews but also
policy-based
reviews and under that uh the UK would
continue to um uh sell uh what is around
a 35 million pound a year uh trade in
weapons to the Israelis but he also said
that they continue to have concerns
about the issue and they would continue
to review it um so that was there too
but that was a significant uh moment in
that news briefing there okay Tom thank
you very much for that going to take a
look now at the issue of ukra ukine we
can speak to a global Affairs analyst
and Senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council Michael bosu who's in Odessa in
Ukraine thank you very much for coming
on the program my pleasure good to be
with you so let's talk about this issue
of politicians going from one country to
another saying well we can't tell you
what to do but you really ought to do
this basically Lord Cameron today in
Washington urging well expressing his
support for Ukraine and urging the us to
do the same how do you find that balance
that diplomatic
balance well it was very entertaining I
think Lord Cameron was being very tight
lipped about his trip to Florida but I
am quite sure I would bet money on it
that he told Mr Trump exactly what's
going to happen if that 60 billion
dollar in Aid which is being blocked by
his mother Republicans will not reach
Ukraine and I noticed that both um
ministers made the point that a lot of
this money that is your mark for Ukraine
is not going to be loaded on to pallets
and you know airlifted to Ukraine it's
actually going to stay in the United
States and create jobs that's a message
that the American public needs to hear
but um the other quick thing that came
out is I noticed uh Lord Cameron was
almost ahead of his count us counterpart
Mr blink in terms of his conviction in
terms of his passion in terms of the
arguments made for Aid to Ukraine it's
almost as if the Americans were a bit
hedgy about it but Lord Cameron really
his message really came through that if
this war is not stopped if this Aid is
not delivered Putin will go further and
it will become a lot more cost C for
everybody and the potential hesitancy
yes there's diplomatic politics at play
there's Party politics at play is it
simple geography as well country is far
away seen as a far away problem oh yeah
absolutely uh the message I got out of
today more clearly than ever is that it
it is now the United Kingdom and Europe
that are going to take the lead on the
so-called ukra file in terms of helping
Ukraine for example booler their
domestic production of ammunition but um
the other thing that came through is I
think Lord Cameron rightly tiptoed
through everything because it is a very
complicated Diplomat sorry political
scene in the United States right now
where the man who has basic control over
this vote speaker Johnson I think he
does support Ukraine I think he does
have the votes to make that bill pass I
think he knows that uh the US public
support this but he's prioritizing his
own political future over everything
else that he wants to remain important
in that Trump wing of the Republican
party and what's going to happen there
if he continues along this path I think
people will see him as a man who could
not summon the DI the political courage
to do the right thing and hence this war
will continue to go on for a lot longer
than it has to and what do you think the
implications would be for Ukraine if
Trump won the presidency well absolutely
horrible he views himself as the master
of the art of the deal he will try to
bring it to resolution in 24 hours uh
leaked reports from closed door
conversations he's had indicate what
most of us believe is that he'll give
into territorial concessions Crimea will
remain in Russian hands uh the donbas
other areas that Russia has seized
including that crucial land bridge
between the Russian Mainland and um and
the western part of Ukraine and uh he'll
probably um give the signals to Mr Putin
that he can go even further I mean
there's a lot of nervousness I have to
tell you right here in Odessa we've had
alarms air rate alarms uh most of the
day and night and missiles coming this
way it's it's not going the right way
whatsoever well I just want to just very
briefly just expand on exactly that
because I wanted to highlight that that
is exactly where you are and ask a bit
about what life is like and how it is
going right now a couple of things I
mean I'm very close to to the port and
these strikes tend to uh Target
electrical infrastructure if there's no
power there's no Port uh at working and
there's no grain going to World Markets
uh the other thing on the other side of
the country in khu it's really hell on
Earth um being bombed relentlessly it
does look like the Russians are on an L
campaign to turn it into a a piece of
rubble of gry Zone and possibly even
encircle it uh so very very bad news
coming out of hard tonight as well

time thank you",20240409
7RuBOb5Hhuk,Israel’s PM says date for offensive in Gaza's Rafah has been set | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel’s PM says date for offensive in Gaza's Rafah has been set  BBC News.jpg,"to the Middle East now an Israel's
defense minister has said it is an
opportune moment to reach a deal on the
release of hostages held by Hamas talks
are being held in Cairo with Qatar
mediating one of its spokesmen has
expressed cautious optimism meanwhile
Palestinians who've returned to the city
of K Yunis in Gaza have spoken of the
devastation they found after months of
intense fighting Israel says its troops
have pulled back from the area in
southern Gaza to prepare for the next
stage of the conflict more than 300 Aid
trucks have entered Gaza
that's the highest number in a day since
the start of the war our midle
correspondent Lucy Williamson reports
from
Jerusalem for months Han Yunis was a
city of targets its apartment blocks and
hospitals seen by Israel as hiding
places for
Hamas residents returned today searching
for their City Homes inside the concrete
mountains as Israel continued talks with
Hamas on a ceasefire deal
the destruction is huge kanun has been
destroyed it all needs to be rebuilt now
it's not suitable for animal to live in
let alone human
being I wasn't expecting this
destruction our biggest request is that
they withdraw from our land it's better
for us to have tents on the of our home
rather than being
displaced Hamas launched Rockets from KH
yunes the Army said even as its troops
withdrew it hit back with air
strikes Israel's prime minister has
promised total victory in this war but
Hamas is still fighting and the
withdrawal leaves just a skeleton
Israeli presence across the middle of
the
Strip This is being presented as a
temporary tactical withdrawal and that
buys Benjamin Netanyahu more time under
American pressure to agree a fire deal
and pressure from his own cabinet to
keep the war going he's framing this as
a pause not an end in the fighting
keeping both foreign and domestic allies
on
track we are working constantly to
attain our objectives first and foremost
the release of all of our hostages and
the achieving of total victory over
Hamas this Victory requires entering
Rafa and eliminating the terrorist
battalions there this will happen there
is a
date returning residents to their homes
could smooth the path to a ceasefire
deal but it could also help those in
Israel who want to continue the war
Israel is facing tough us demands to
move refugees out of Rafa before any
ground offensive
there a day after the Israeli withdrawal
it's clear how much the face of Han
yunes has changed much less the face of
the war
Lucy Williamson BBC News
Jerusalem well I spoke to my colleague
Hugo bisha in Jerusalem a little earlier
about the prospects of a successful
ceasefire hostage deal yeah it's very
interesting Samantha because yesterday
the qataris who have been you know
mediating these negotiations and even
the Israeli foreign minister they said
there was cautious optimism that uh a
deal was possible but now Hamas is
saying that there is nothing new in this
proposal that the offer on the table
doesn't meet their demands and
essentially they have three main demands
they want a permanent ceasefire in other
words the end of the war they want all
Israeli troops out of Gaza and they also
want displaced residents to be allowed
to return to Northern Gaza now in the
past the Israelis have rejected those
demands as unacceptable they say that
this would only give Hamas the
opportunity to regroup but there is a
lot of pressure for deal to be reached
especially from the Americans so the
head of the CIA is in Cairo for those
talks and there is a lot of pressure at
home as well on the Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal
especially from the families of the
hostages 133 hostages who remain in
captivity in Gaza essentially they say
that time is running out to save those
hostages they say that the uh Israeli
strategy of trying to put military
pressure on Hamas to negotiate hasn't
really worked but at the same time the
prime minister is also under pressure
from uh some of his Hardline allies who
are against the idea of making
concessions they say we need to finish
the job we need to destroy Hamas so I
think it really shows how difficult
these negotiations are and we still
don't know whether uh major obstacles in
those talks have been resolved yeah and
meanwhile here you go more Aid is
getting in the largest amount since the
war started 6 months ago how is that
operation going is it getting to the
people who desperately needed and do we
know if that will
continue yeah so the Israeli said that
yesterday more than 400 trucks were
allowed to enter Gaza they say that this
was uh the largest number of uh trucks
with uh aid supplies uh that entered
Gaza since the beginning of the war and
obviously this only happen after a lot
of pressure again especially from the
Americans following that deadly attack
on the aid Convoy so the Israelis were
under a lot of pressure to uh allow more
uh humanitarian assistance into Gaza we
know that there have been warnings of
famine especially in Northern Gaza and
now the Israeli saying that they have uh
you know allowed more trucks into the
territory so this is part of the plan
part of the measures that have been
announced by the Israeli military by the
Israeli authorities to improve uh you
know the level of humanitarian
assistance uh for the popul a of Gaza
and obviously you know we're talking
about those ceasefire negotiations that
are happening in Cairo uh the Hope here
is that a deal uh is going to result in
at least you know in a pausing
hostilities that would of course allow
more humanitarian Aid to reach those
Palestinians uh who are you know in
desperate need in parts of Gaza",20240409

appears Israel is moving to a new phase
of its military operation residents from
the southern Garen city of kanun have
started to return home after the Israel
Defense Forces say they have withdrawn
all of its maneuvering Ground Forces
leaving just one Brigade Israeli defense
minister yoah Galan says troops have
been pulled out to prepare for future
missions including into gaza's southern
city of Rafa much of the conun area is
now in Ruins after months of bomb bment
and heavy fighting between Israeli
troops and fighters from Palestinian
groups Sunday marked 6 months since
Hamas designated a terrorist
organization by the US UK and others
attacked Israel killing around 1200
people and taking more than 250 others
hostages Israel's prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to crush and
Destroy Hamas so that it no longer posed
any threat launching a mission to bring
all hostages home in the war that has
followed gaza's Hamas run Health min
hisory says at least 33,000 people have
been killed Israel says many thousands
of those are armed militants on Sunday
tens of thousands of protesters in
Israel took to the streets calling for
the Israeli government to strike a deal
to bring home hostages and for Mr
Netanyahu to resign well let's speak now
to our International editor Jeremy Bowen
who is in Jerusalem Jeremy good to see
you prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
under huge pressure at home and
internationally what's your assessment
of where this conflict could go next
what his next move could
be well those troops are pulling back
from hanun or they've gone and there
have been pictures of course we can't
get into Gaza ourselves but the because
Israelis and the Egyptians won't let us
but there are pictures circulating uh
from uh Gaza of people walking in the
morning sun back to through the ruins
towards hunis um you know there are
different theories about why the
Israelis are doing this they are saying
themselves that they're going to sort
themselves out requip re re-equip
retrain and get ready for an assault on
Rafa there are other speculations in the
Israeli media this morning that actually
it's more with an eye to the uh
negotiations going on for a hostage deal
and a ceasefire in Cairo which the
Americans are very deeply involved and
that this is um the Hamas is calling for
a pull pull out of Gaza so perhaps
there's a theory that if they pull back
from Kan Unice that might be sort of
attractive as a as a halfway house it's
not clear and to be honest over the
months when there have been these
negotiations between the different sides
uh regarding a hostage prisoner swap
regarding a ceasefire I think I think
we've learned it's foolish to speculate
in advance about which way they will go
because lots of leaks come out of it but
it does appear that the Americans are
Keen to try to get a deal done as you
said Jeremy people are starting to
return to the area of K Yunis what do
you think this so-called next phase will
mean when it comes to getting Aid into
Gaza well under massive pressure from
the Americans after that team from the
world Central kitchens were killed by
the
Israelis uh which incidentally that
organization is one of the few of the
relief organizations there which
actually was considered to have a pretty
good relationship with the is iselis but
after that Joe Biden put massive
pressure on Israel's prime minister
Netanyahu to open up more Crossings
which Netanyahu had always said would be
impossible well he opened them or
they're in the process of being opened
uh and also promised to allow some Aid
through the container Port of Ash DOD
but it's still very early days and it's
not clear whether trucks are moving
through the areas Crossing into the
North and to be honest it will take a
massive influx of Aid not just food aid
but Medical Aid and the people to
administer it to Stave off what by
Common consent and by hard data is an
imminent famine in Northern Gaza which
might already have arrived Jeremy what
about the future of prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu as those
demonstrations continue to grow around
Israel and anger continues to grow about
the lack of the return return of those
hostages yeah those demonstrations the
things to to know about those
demonstrations are it's not like they're
not demonstrating for an end to the war
what they're demonstrating is against
the government saying why on Earth have
you not managed after 6 months to do
some kind of a deal to get those
hostages back because there is a deal to
be done if Israel is prepared to nasty
language but it's what what it is pay
the price in terms of of uh releasing
Palestinian prisoners and exceeding to
some of the other demands that Hamas has
made uh you know you talk to people in
those demos and they say look make the
deal get the hostages back then do what
you want in Gaza but that pro- hostage
movement if you like has come together
with the pre-existing anti- Netanyahu
movement and they were demonstrating
very much in the months before uh Hamas
attacked at the beginning of October
last year and for a while they put
everything on hold National Unity
rallying around the flag and all that
kind of thing but now it is absolutely
not seen as
unpatriotic uh to demonstrate in the
streets because they want Netanyahu out
but he has a parliamentary majority and
as long as he can hold on to that
parliamentary majority it's a couple of
years before the next election okay

marking six months of War on Sunday our
chief International correspondent Le
duet is monitoring events for us she
reports now from Southern Israel today a
memorial service is being held here
there's been a press conference where
members loved ones of those who lost
their lives here are expressing not just
pain but anger asking why the Israeli
Security Forces weren't here on this day
to protect them saying that they still
feel
abandoned one of the people who did
survive to tell the story was a
photographer shy kind Klein whitesman
binstein who has now returned to the
United States but as the Rockets started
being fired by Hamas he took at his
camera and started filming this is some
of what he
and Chine veinstein joined us earlier
from the US city of
Denver I was at my first music festival
I wasn't expecting it to end with us
driving by gunmen and over
corpses when what was the moment when
you realized it was no longer a music
festival after the Rockets began at 6:30
and they didn't stop I started to get
worried that it wasn't just rockets and
they went on for a while you know the
Rockets began at 6:30 and we actually
physically got to our car at about 7:51
in the morning so it's over an hour
later and the rockets hadn't stopped and
at that point I was growing increasingly
more anxious and concerned about the
situation um behind me as I'm speaking
to you I'm at the site of the festival
there's now a sea of Israeli flags of
photographs um those who who died here
on that day they may include some of
your friends would you like to tell us
about the people who were with you on
that day who didn't
Escape so I was with a group of eight of
us total myself my cousin morai is now
fiance Tamara and several mutual friends
of ours Yael Ellie Barack Doras and
almog and I'm very grateful to say that
they all escaped but some of the people
I made friends with at the festival
including dor autan who was my age at
the time 26 and Ron schaer were
murdered and you returned to the United
States and I understand that since then
you have been trying to keep the memory
of what happened on that day
alive yes correct um Israel is still my
permanent residence although now I've
been away from the country the exact the
same amount of time as I've lived there
I moved there last April I've only been
there till October I've now been away
since then um and I've been going to
University campuses across the country
I've been to 157 different cities since
November Canada the US East Coast West
Coast all of the above uh sharing my
photos my videos my story and just
letting people know what happened to us
and letting people know that even though
this horrible tragic thing that occurred
to cause us Terror isn't going to keep
us
down and how do people react to you in
the stories you
tell I've had a mostly positive response
I've had a few instances where I've had
protesters but most of the time uh very
warm reception audiences from 5 to 500
people I've even had people who are prop
Palestinian comes to me speak I've had
Palestinian students come see me speak
I've had black Israelites come see me
speak people who don't know anything
about what's going on who just want to
hear more and many people are
sympathetic and interested in in hearing
what I have to say and having a very
reasonable
discussion and that was shy kle
Feinstein who was here during those
horrific events of October the 7th that
day shook Israel to the core and shocked
many around the world Israel's
staunchest allies including the United
States and Britain
immediately rushed in to show very
public and Powerful backing to Israel as
it launched retaliatory strikes intended
said the Israeli Army to destroy Hamas
but 6 months on as the death toll in
Gaza continues to climb and the UN says
the territory is on the brink of famine
there are loud calls including from
Israel's staunchest friends for an
immediate ceasefire for much more to be
done to get desperately needed Aid into
Gaza
in the past few days for the first time
Israel has opened the AZ Crossing in
Northern Israel into Gaza it has opened
the ashad port and it also says it will
accelerate the capacity through Jordan
will that be enough we're joined by
Cindy McCain who is the executive
director of the world food program
welcome to BBC
news thank
you thank you could you please first
describe to us
how bad is the situation in Gaza when it
comes to hunger as the UN said and as
what I have said also famine is eminent
in the north and and this is something
that if we wait much longer we're going
to go over the edge and not be able to
recover from it uh that's why it is so
important that we be able to get food at
scale in we at WP are uh grateful that
there's consideration to open the areas
eras uh border point and ashdod Port
we're hoping to see that happen very
soon uh all of those things and more can
along with the air drops along with
everything else that's going on will
help us get food in at scale but it
can't stop uh it can no longer be a
dribble of seven or eight trucks a day
or seven or eight trucks a week it has
to be multitudes of trucks and
quickly there have been calls right up
to the top of the United Nations so that
while welcoming these new moves saying
that all of the crossings should be open
and if not that it will still be
difficult to get the amounts of Aid in
that are needed is that also your
view that is absolutely our view uh we
would like every gate open we need to
get food in and get it in at scale as I
we can no longer uh wait to be
considered or wait to see if our drivers
are cleared or wait to see if they're
you know if if there's if the port if
the checkpoints actually going to be
open we need to get in now children are
dying as we speak they are dying of
hunger that's why it is so important
that we do what we do best and that is
take large amounts of food in and feed
those who are desperately
hungry as you know those who are
delivering the aid also feel at risk in
the wake of the killing of seven Aid
workers with World Central Kitchen some
agents genes suspended their operations
is it do you feel it is still safe for
your uh wfp staff to operate and are
they still doing
so well this is dangerous work no no
matter how you look at it but we at WP
are not going to to Halt or suspend any
of our operations we continue to do the
best we can to get Aid in uh again the
these new openings and these new uh
ports Etc we do get them to scale and
get them get them operational will be of
great help but we should have done it a
while ago uh this is something that that
uh that has has allowed uh the northern
part of Gaza to Simply die and so for
those of us at the UN that that work
with work on humanitarian principles and
and believe in delivering food and Aid
uh in a principled fashion uh we feel
very strongly about how how how much
needs go in and why we should be in
there and once again Aid workers should
be safe it was unconscionable that that
wck was hit it's it's a terrible
situation and but but let me say there's
been more Aid workers than just those
that have been killed and we're sorry
for all of them but we have to keep
going we have to you remember that in
the early months of this war you
criticize what you described as the
insane bureaucracy the the number of
security controls that Israel has
imposed that effect hold up the delivery
of Aid has that improved has the process
become
smoother the process has become smoother
yes it's still not 100% but let me say
it is much better than what it was a lot
of the confusion because we only had one
opening at that time and it was Rafa so
it wasn't just wfp trying to get in it
was hundreds of other agencies trying to
get Aid in and there was no real
controls on it now I can say that with
regards to un Aid agencies we go through
Kum Shalom we try to make it up the
fence road again that's why we need
other openings further north so we can
get our trucks in up through there and
get directly to to Northern
Gaza CD McCain one of the world's
biggest uh Aid agencies struggling to
deliver Aid to people who desperately
need it in Gaza welcoming those new
steps by Israel but like so many saying
much more needs to be done well that's
how it looks now on this day which marks
the six month Mark at the Israel Gaza
War we'll continue our special coverage
here in across the region but now I'll
hand you back to
London that was LE just said well our
International editor Jeremy Bowen has
also been covering the war since the
very start and has returned to one of
the kutes in Israel that was hardest hit
by the Hamas
six months after the attacks it's a bit
like going back into a time machine
because all the damage is still here and
the reason for that is that in this
kibutz near
Oz one in four of the population of more
than 400 people was either killed or
taken into Gaza which is a about a mile
away the Border as
hostages looking round at the damage
here and hearing the stories too of what
happened Hamas came in about 6:30 in the
morning and they were here till early
afternoon undisturbed going from house
to house until the Army
arrived the war's still going on that's
outgoing fire from an Israeli B near
here into
Gaza this is now one of the the typical
houses in this
kibutz abandoned burnt out 6 months on
it still smells of burning on the sofa
over there there's some neatly folded
laundry perhaps done the evening before
October the
7th going around this place you can
understand why Israelis believe very
strongly
that they're fighting a just war in Gaza
of course their allies feel the same
their quarrel is with the methods that
Israel has been using that have cost so
many innocent Palestinian lives and as
for the family who lived here in this
house they're
dead there's also a long read by our
International editor Jeremy boen on the
BBC News website and app so we do
encourage you to read that as well",20240407
swMxFlbD4ec,Israel military fires senior officers after aid workers killed in Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel military fires senior officers after aid workers killed in Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"some breaking news uh to bring you now
we have just had this statement from the
IDF uh about the investigation into the
killing of seven Aid workers uh in Gaza
in an Israeli air strike um the the uh
uh statement says that the
investigation's findings indicate that
the incident should not have occurred
those who approved the strike uh this
statement says were convinced that they
were targeting armed Hamas operatives
and not the employees of wck which is uh
World Central Kitchen the aid agency
they go on to say that the strike on the
aid Vehicles is a grave mistake stemming
from a serious failure due to a mistaken
identification errors in decision making
and an attack contrary to the standard
operating procedures they go on to say
that uh after being presented with and
considering the investigation's findings
the uh IDF chief of general staff
decided that the following command
measures will be taken um the Brigade
fire support Commander an officer with
the rank of major will be dismissed from
his position the Brigade Chief of Staff
an officer with the rank of Colonel in
reserve will be dismissed from his
position Additionally the Brigade
commander and the 162nd Division
Commander will be formally reprimanded
the IDF Chief of Staff decided to
formally reprimand the commander of the
Southern Comm command for his overall
responsibility uh for the incident uh
they go on to say that the IDF uh
emphasizes its commitment to fighting
against Hamas terrorist organization
while upholding the values of the IDF
the laws of war and avoiding harming
civilians uh the final sentence says the
IDF will learn the lessons of the
incident and will incorporate them into
the idf's ongoing operations um let's go
to our Middle East bureau chief Joe
floto Joe uh we have just had this
statement in as I was saying but um from
first reading this is extremely
significant particularly the um the the
Lessons Learned uh that line really
stands out to me the IDF will learn the
lessons of this incident what do you
make of
it well look the the IDF took a group of
journalists last night uh very late last
night to the ministry of Defense to give
them uh a briefing uh which was embargo
which was we weren't allowed to publish
until uh now uh to explain the context
in which this happened and and it's fair
to say that that uh that the soldiers at
that briefing were mortified uh they uh
recruited a a retired Major General to
have a look at the
facts uh and what comes across is uh as
you've pointed out already a series of
catastrophic errors I think one of the
biggest ones was that they failed to to
disseminate properly throughout the area
of operation that there was an aid
Convoy process happening that evening
there already been one Convoy that had
run earlier in the evening and uh they
had failed to notify everyone uh who was
F fighting in that area that this was
continuing so in that context they say
their soldiers were on the lookout for
Hamas gunman and had seen some of them
uh approach the aid Convoy earlier in
the uh in in the evening uh they showed
us some video of a gunman climbing on
one of the aid trucks a big lorry uh and
shooting in the air not clear what they
were shooting at whether it was a
warning shot they then described how
after depositing that truck full of Aid
that had been delivered to the coast uh
a number of vehicles separated in
different directions one vehicle headed
north uh and that was positively
identified and they showed us video of
gunman exiting that vehicle
in the meantime three vehicles belonging
to World Central Kitchen uh were driving
back down to the southern end of the
strip and at that point we're told that
their drone team identified a person
entering one of those Vehicles carrying
a gun turns out that was a mistake
turned out it was a
bag and the rdf pointed out that one of
the catastrophic mistakes was for that
team to seek authorization to
Fire based on what turned out to be very
flimsy evidence they weren't sure and
they shouldn't have asked for
authorization to fire the other shocking
thing I think was the detail last night
of how the individuals inside those
Vehicles survived the initial strike so
uh in the space of 6 minutes the Israeli
military uh fired three missiles at each
car but they're in sequence so they hit
one car where they suspected there was a
garment it wasn't they'd made a
catastrophic mistake two people are seen
leaving that vehicle apparently we
haven't been shown that footage entering
a second vehicle that was part of the
Convoy 2 minutes later that vehicle is
Struck from the air and there are
survivors from that second air strike
who enter the Third vehicle in that
Convoy and try to make their their way
away from the scene two minutes later
they are struck again by a missile and
at that point well we know the result
seven people ended up losing their lives
and we've heard from the families of
those victims we heard from them the the
the family of uh Jacob Flickinger
earlier
they there there has been speculation
that they were targeted directly but
that in this statement they are
absolutely conflicting that and they was
they are saying that this this is this
is a
mistake so one one of the things that is
clear from from the brief amount of
video that that we were shown last night
is that at night with the cameras that
they have on their drones uh the large
Colorful World Central Kitchen stickers
are not visible at least on the video
that we were shown uh and the Israeli
military wanted to stress that at no
point did their soldiers believe that
this was an aid Convoy they thought that
they were
gunmen however there are very simple
remedies uh to uh to be able to identify
vehicles uh at night from drones uh all
military vehicles have got special
reflective tape that could have been
used but most importantly there was no
way to contact the team on the ground so
the Israeli military said that once they
spotted a gunman earlier in the evening
they made an attempt to contact World
Central Kitchen contacted their
coordination Center which I understand
is in
Washington uh they were unable to reach
their people on the ground now we're
told by a agencies that this is frequent
event the phone system is obviously uh
deeply deeply dysfunctional uh satellite
phones don't work very well uh and we
are told by the aid agencies that the
IDF themselves prohibit the use of
radios so it was impossible to contact
them but the bigger context is that this
was an aid operation that was
effectively sponsored by the IDF these
shipments from Cyprus directly to
Northern Gaza had been something carried
out under the aaces of the IDF they were
providing security that evening and not
to have told everyone involved uh in
operations in that evening that there
were civilians in the
area uh appears to be one of the most
serious failings uh in this whole Affair
which is why the the the the commander
of Southern command so that's one of the
most senior jobs uh in the IDF has been
formally repr reprimanded by the chief
of staff in the statement they also say
we express our deep sorry for the loss
and send our condolences to the families
and the wck organization they say we
consider the vital humanitarian activity
of international Aid organizations to be
of utmost importance will continue to
work to coordinate and assist their
activities while ensuring their safety
and safeguarding their lives I mean we
know that those um that it looks like
those Crossings will will at some point
uh be opened but do you think this this
could could therefore have an impact on
those Aid organizations because you know
if they if they know that this could
happen that this is a mistake will they
put their staff at potential
risk so let the M Ministry of Defense
here say they're already taking steps to
improve the coordination uh of uh Aid
and to make it safer you've just pointed
out that there as a result of this
incident and uh what we understand was
was quite a difficult conversation with
the American president the Israeli Prime
Minister has announced the opening of
further Aid Crossings and and critically
the use of ashod Port which is just 45
minute driveway from northern Gaza to
deliver Aid uh into uh the war zone now
there are going to be questions about
Safety and Security I think there are
also questions about the level of
evidence the threshold above which the
IDF considers it appropriate to use
lethal Force when they only suspect that
someone might be a gunman so plenty of
people will look at this incident and
conclude that this scrutiny has happened
only because six international passport
holders were ultimately killed but lots
of people will W will wonder whether
that
laxity uh that speed uh possibly you
would justify as
recklessness uh in applying lethal Force
when it's not clear that a gunman was uh
in the vehicle
uh has something that's been applied in
the last 6 months countless times
possibly there is a great deal of
suspicion that the use of force is
applied recklessly and this will do
nothing to assuage people's suspicion of
that we also have a map um Joe I should
point out that the the map you're about
to see has been given us by uh the IDF
um and that Joe kind of takes us through
what happen can you just reiterate what
they are saying happened in this
situation yeah so let's it's it's a
complex story but let's go through it uh
so in the top right of that picture
you'll see the the improvised Jetty that
has been built over the last few weeks
to take uh Aid to Northern Gaza and it
it is uh there that a a ship with about
300 tons worth of food Aid has come from
Cypress and docked in Northern Gaza rdf
were providing security for that that
area and they were unloading that ship
that evening so a previous Convoy had
already departed earlier in the evening
without any event at all uh at about
10:00 that night they offload a further
100 tons onto a truck onto a big lorry
uh and that heads down the coast to a
point on that map I don't know if it's
still up called The wck Welcome Center
that's where they're met by the escort
of these Aid workers who consquently
lose their lives and that's where the
IDF say that a gunman boards the aid
Lorry and fires shots in the air we
don't know if that was locally agreed
security or whether it was a genuine
attempt by Hamas to hijack an aid Convoy
we don't know at this stage the people
who do are now dead but that truck with
its escort goes down the coast then
turns left Inland to a warehouse and is
deposited in that warehouse and at at
that point the Convoy splits one car
goes north which the IDF say and they've
shown us video contain four gunmen and
then three cars which we now know
contain seven members of the world
Central Kitchen staff uh heads back to
the coastal road which is the road that
takes them away from where the fighting
is uh in central Gaza and they're
heading home and it's at that point when
they leave that warehouse that we're
told that the Drone
crew uh
appears to see a gunman enter one of
those
vehicles with no evidence of that and
that we weren't shown any video of that
point in the decision making but it's
clear that they mistook a bag for a gun
and on the basis of mistaking a bag for
a gun they sought authorization for a
missile to be struck at that first
vehicle",20240405

contained Vital Information to help

first time since the start of the Israel
Gaza War Israel will temporarily reopen
The erat's Crossing in Northern Gaza
ashdod Port will also be opened for
humanitarian deliveries and more Aid
trucks from Jordan will be allowed to
cross Israel to Gaza the call between Mr
Biden and Mr Netanyahu was their first
since an Israeli air strike killed seven
International Aid workers from the
charity group World Central Kitchen
sparking International outrage the White
House is urging Israel to allow a
dramatic increase of Aid into Gaza
within hours or days sha Dilly
reports in the heart of the White House
a phone call with Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a clear
message from the US president that his
patience is running
low Joe Biden told his cart that Israel
must do more immediately to protect
civilians and Aid workers in Gaza if he
wants American Support to
continue it's no secret that tensions
between the two leaders have been
bubbling for some time but the US is
Israel's most powerful Ally in his
hardest criticism yet Joe Biden called
the growing humanitarian crisis
unacceptable and said he expects Mr
Netanyahu to take steps towards an
immediate ceasefire
the president made it clear that our
policies with respect to Gaza uh will be
dependent upon our assessment of how
well the Israelis uh make changes and
Implement changes uh to to make the
situation in Gaza better for the
Palestinian people and how much time are
you giving them to make these changes to
implement these concrete we we would
hope to see some announcements of
changes here in coming hours and days a
clear message and one is is has been
quick to hear within hours Israel said
it had approved more humanitarian routs
to increase Aid to Gaza the erors gate
in Northern Gaza will be temporarily
opened for the first time since the
start of the war more aid from Jordan
will enter through the caram Shalom

call since seven Aid workers were killed
in an Israeli air strike on Monday among
the dead three British citizens working
to distribute food Israel said their
deaths were a tragic mistake for the
families of the dead it's a claim they
don't accept they were in deconflict

let's get more on events in the Middle
East and speak to our correspondent in
Jerusalem Yan now is standing by for as
highand good to see you uh let's start
with that phone call between President
Biden and prime minister Netanyahu the
first since uh the death of the seven
International Aid workers on Monday tell
us more about what happened in that
call well this was a stark warning
really from uh President Biden uh to uh
Israel its close Ally uh that really it
was prepared to to make changes uh in
its policies towards Israel if Israel
didn't change its conduct of the war and
didn't do more to protect uh civilians
in Gaza and also Aid workers and I think
often in the past we have seen
relatively little change um after these
kinds of uh problems have have bubbled
up between uh the US and Israel it's
very telling that this time what we've
seen within hours is a meeting of
Israel's security cabinet and what we're
told our immediate steps being announced
to increase the amount of Aid going into
Gaza and they are actually things that
have been asked for repeatedly by Aid
agencies by International diplomats so
Israel has said that it's going now to
open up uh the eras Crossing in the very
north of the Gaza Strip This has for
years been um the main uh crossing point
for people to go in and out of Gaza
controlled by Israel it's the location
where we've of course been in and out in
the past as journalists when we were
allowed to access Gaza it's also going
to mean that the ashdod port which is
only about U 20 mi along the coast from
the north of the Gaza Strip that is
going to be uh used to process uh more
shipments up to now it's had very
limited use uh for Aid going into Gaza
and it's something that could really
make a big difference particularly in
conjunction with using uh the areas
Crossing to get into the north of Gaza
where we've been told by the un uh that
famine is looming largest and there'll
also be steps Tak I'm told to uh have
much more going along the Jordanian land
Corridor which links up with the Kem
Shalom Crossing in the south of the Gaza
Strip and Yan do we know how soon any of
this could
happen well they have been talking about
this happening imminently we haven't got
precise timings we haven't got details
yet of the quantities of Aid that will
be involved or or what kind of details
there might be uh when it comes to
Israeli Security checks that will be
demanded um but the US has said it
welcomes the announcement uh by Israel
but it will be watching really to assess

Court justices have joined more than 600
legal experts in calling for the
government to end weapons sales to
Israel one of those former justices is
Lord suion talking to the BBC he
explained why he decided to sign the
letter I was sent a copy of it I thought
that it was a persuasive and moderately
expressed letter which makes some very
important points that the UK government
seems to be losing sight of the most
important point is that article one of
the genocide convention uh requires
States um uh to uh do what they can to
prevent genocide now it hasn't yet been
determined whether what the Israelis are
doing is genocide the icj international
court of justice is considering that
issue but they have already ruled that
there is a plausible case that that is
what is going on uh in Gaza and it seems
to me that if you um have a duty as we
do uh an international law to prevent
genocide uh and there is a plausible
case that that is what is happening you
should do what you can uh to abstract it
well let's speak to our political
correspondent Hannah Miller who's at
Westminster Hannah what has the response
from the ukai Prime Minister and from
the main opposition party leader been at
the moment we've not had any direct
response to that letter from 600
prominent lawyers and academics but
there is clearly a kind of growing
weight of voices behind this call for
the UK to suspend um sales and there's a
handful of conservative MPS now saying
that the deaths of UK Aid workers must
be a line in the sand that's a quote
from Paul Bristo the peterb MP as I say
one of just a handful but adding to that
there's also the former foreign office
Minister sir Alan Duncan
who has said that it can no longer be
justified that we send arms over to
Israel and he previously had
responsibility for looking at who gets
export licenses and where arms can go I
would say though that there are
conservative MPS who believe that the UK
must stand by Israel including the
former Home Secretary sella braan who
visited Israel this week and also Lord
Frost the former brexit negotiator he
said Israel must not just be allowed it
must be enabled to win this war that's
because it's in our national interest to
do so he said so in that sense it's
there's not a kind of United uniform
view within the conservative party but
there is added weight behind those calls
for the UK to suspend armed sales
Labour's position is to ask for the
government to publish its legal advice
on the issue they say that if if that
legal advice shows that Israel hasn't
been meeting its International
obligations then armed sales should be
suspended that is a more nuanced view
than has been taken by the liberal
Democrats and the SNP who have been
calling for some time now for arm sales
to be suspended Hannah thank you that's
our political correspondent Hannah
Miller at Westminster for us well let's
speak now to John devil a former
Brigadier with the British Army and
former director of Defense diplomacy at
the ministry of Defense thank you so
much for for joining is now we heard
there that the deaths of the UK Aid
workers represented for some A Line in
the Sand what was the specific turning
point for you where you believed that it
was no longer okay for the UK to supply
weapons to
Israel well Lu me thanks for having me
on so going back in time I for the best
part of two years was the senior British
officer working in the Palestinian
territories and from that perspective I
got to know the Israeli Defense Forces
very well I was around at the time of
massive incursion by the IDF into Gaza
operation castled so I've seen this
closeup in the past and for me the
Turning Point actually was a long time
ago and the calls about which uh people
have been hearing on your program for
the last 5 10 minutes uh have come late
in the day because it was completely
clear to me looking at the scale of the
casualties on the civilian side that
from a military point of view as a
former military operational planner and
somebody who knows the IDF uh adequate
care in my view was not being taken by
the IDF as of a long time ago in this
campaign in order to minimize civilian
casualties John you were among
signatories saying that the UK should
stop sending arms to Israel uh before
today and last week as well a
cross-party group of MPS said the UK
should stop sending arms to Israel and
now we've heard hundreds of legal
experts saying the same thing but which
authority ultimately makes a judgment on
this and can enforce
it well the um of course there are a
number of reasons which we've been
hearing um in the last 10 minutes as to
why we should be stopping arms uh
exports at the end of the day it's the
British government decision but it's
it's obliged by our government is
obliged both by our own laws and by
International laws not to provide export
licenses if there is a plausible risk
that those weapons will be used in
violation of of international
humanitarian law otherwise known as law
of arm
conflict as far as I understand it Lord
Cameron about a month ago now said that
the lawyers in the foreign office were
going to look at whether or not IHL was
potentially being breached and we still
have to uh learn about the results there
was a leak uh not long ago suggesting
that they had already apped that IHL was
in danger of being breached and the
point being therefore that uh that our
government potentially is out of order
legally we have form in this regard
going back to I think 2017 the British
government found itself in court and
lost lost the case and was was ordered
by the judge to cease weapons exports to
Saudi Arabia because the Royal Saudi Air
Force was using British Munitions and
aircraft uh to bomb over Yemen without
taking du consideration about civilian
culties so we've been there before and I
can I can foresee looks me that we'll be
here again pretty soon if we don't stop
exporting weapons and John just briefly
finally what would the consequences be
then for the UK if that were found to be
the case well I would say a lot of
embarrassment
I would say that uh as I say that we
will have to will be ordered by by a
judge potentially to stop exporting if
we don't preempt that by stopping doing
that before then are soonest I think
also what I would like to see from
military point of view which we
certainly would do ourselves not only
the better coordination that your
respondents have been talking about but
also accountability so in our system we
would uh expect the soldiers and their
chain of command in terms of officers to
be held to account and that's not only
if uh not only for sins of commission
I.E for instance the possibility that
direct targeting took place uh on
purpose in order to um hit the
humanitarian Convoy yesterday but also
sin of omission I lack of adequate care
so I would like to see proper
accountability as well and that's
certainly what we would do I set out a
model process on paper for our
government which went to number 10 and
also chief of Defense staff on our side
after the uh the Saudi example I gave
you earlier uh setting out exactly what
we are El would do in the British
military in order to uh ensure that we
minimize civilian culties and those are
the sorts of things that our own
government should be ensuring that in
this case the Israelis uh carry out and
indeed any other country to whom we
might export weapons in order to avoid
being in beats of law Brigadier John

with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

overnight Aid operations in the strip
for at least 48 hours to evaluate
Security in the wake of the attack on
Monday the head of the charity that the
victims had worked for has accused
Israel of deliberately targeting his
staff Israel's economy Minister near
barcat says it's nonsense to suggest
that the IDF deliberately targeted Aid
workers describing the incident as a
tragic mistake sea Dilly
reports John Chapman James Henderson and
James Kirby the three British men among
seven Aid workers killed by Israeli air
strikes earlier this week they were
working for an aid charity their
humanitarian mission to distribute food
but what I know is that we were targeted
deliberately nonstop until everybody was
dead in this
Convoy humanitarians and
civilians should never be paying the
consequences of War this is a basic
principle of humanity at the at the time
this looks like it's not a war against
terrorism anymore seems this is a war
against humanity itself
Israel says it will investigate but it
insists the aid workers died as a result
of a tragic mistake there's no way in
the world that Israel would Target
people that come to give people Aid
that's nonsense I'm sorry give us a bit
of uh of respect that we we care about
those people and it's the same people
that helped Israel we will never Target
people like this targeted or otherwise
their deaths are among thousands in
International concern is growing even
among Israel's closest allies it doesn't
really matter how they made the mistake
at the end of the day you have seven
dead Aid workers who are there trying to
deliver humanitarian assistance in non-
diplomatic speak America is losing
patience other allies including the UK
are also applying pressure on Israel
responding to concerns about a growing
humanitarian crisis of course the extra
Aid won't work unless there is proper
deconfliction unless Aid can be taken
around Gaza and we avoid the Dreadful
incidents like we see we've seen in the
last couple of days that is vital and
Britain will be watching very closely to
make sure that that
happens and 600 prominent lawyers
including three retired Supreme Court
judges say they're watching how the UK
government reacts in a strongly worded
letter to ministers they say the UK
risks breaking international law if they
don't stop providing weapons to
Israel the UK prime minister Rishi sunak
said an independent investigation should
take place into the death of Aid workers
but he stopped short of agreeing to
cross-party calls to suspend UK weapons
exports to Israel sea Dilly BBC

yolan Nell brought us this update from

military saying that it's conducting
this thorough and transparent
investigation um it's also viewing
proceedings and saying that it's looking
at setting up a joint situation room

more of the US leverage against Israel

dissatisfaction over the conduct of the

US military assistance that is given we
had overnight comments that were made um
by uh the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd

counterpart yoav Galant we're told that
he was demanding concrete steps um to
improve the coordination with different
foreign aid groups said that this was
all going to complicate efforts um to to
flood uh Gaza with agid which was the
commitment that they had had uh from the
Israelis and also um made a connection
here between Americans concerns about uh
the idea of a ground offensive by Israel
a fullscale ground offensive in Rafa in
the very south of the Gaza Strip because
uh the the US concerns about that have
really been on humanitarian grounds
because of the numbers of displaced
people there interestingly we also heard
some comments from an Israeli diplomatic
correspondent about Rishi Sak's
conversation uh with the Israeli Prime
Minister um particularly related to the
the deaths of the three um Britain who
were killed in this Israeli air strike
in Gaza and he was saying the
correspondent said that if there was no

from the news of of losing these
colleagues in terms of operations world
kitchen plays such a pivotal role in
providing food to the people of Gaza
they' already provided millions of meals
over the last few months so them taking
this very understandable pause will
certainly have an impact on the people

desperately need well let's speak to our

you
what more do we know around the
circumstances of the strike at this
point I mean the Israeli military says
it's still investigating but we've had
the chief of staff coming out saying
that this uh was a mistake that followed
a misidentification at night um he said
during a war in very complex conditions
uh the Israeli Prime Minister previously
said this does happen in war time um but
you have at the same time some Israeli
media reports looking more deeply into
what went wrong here and one in haret
this morning is quoting um unnamed Army
sources as basically saying that this is
also a result of poor discipline as a
result of soldiers and officers who are
not um following rules and orders
properly in the field and your land what
has been the reaction so far from allies
especially ones who've had Nationals
killed in the
strike
I mean there's been a huge International
criticism of both how Israel is um
conducting this war but also uh really
this has put a spotlight on the
situation for Aid workers and the very
very difficult conditions and dangerous
conditions that they have been working
under and I think there is now going to
be um a kind of real effort to try to
get Israel to put new mechanisms in
place uh that will make it safer for Aid
workers um to get back to work properly
uh in Gaza and to be able to do what
they have to do uh to to distribute much
needed Aid across the Gaza Strip all

to our guest on this and that is Leo
cans who is an aid worker uh the head of

Doctors Without Borders uh let me ask
you first of all for your reaction to
what has
happened we are horrified but what
happened first of all I want to to
present the condolences for the family
of the victim on behalf of msf um but we
are completely horrified of what happens
uh the situation in Gaza is a nightmare
if we take a bit of a step step back and
look at what is happening in the last
months you have hospitals being targeted
and literally bombed you have civilian
who are being bombed indiscriminately
and we can see the indiscriminate nature
of the bombing because it's full of
Hospital are full of children and women
uh you have humanitarian head that is
blocked we cannot bring humanitarian
head to the north of Gaza and now the
test event if you have seven
humanitarian head workers being
deliberately killed targeted by a
missile while on a convoy to try to
bring food to starving people uh in the
north of Gaza there is no war for what
is happening now no what's what is
happening we've heard now from the world
Central Kitchen that they're going to uh
be for now uh not working within that
region what kind of an impact is that
going to have on those people who so
desperately need the
food this is the whole problem of what
is happening now in Gaza humanitarian
actors are not allowed to work properly
and you know this incident this tragic
incident is not isolated us as msf we
had five people who has been killed in
msf Convoy or in msf premises so it's
not the first time that this tragic uh
incident is happening and we are all the
human actor are at the limits of the of
the working capacity and people are
being stared in the north of Gaza
because Israeli government refus food to
get inside Gaza and now you have the
same government that is targeting the
NGO that is one of the few actors that
is trying to to give food to the to the
to the north so it's it's a it's you
know all the elements of what happening
in the last months are clearly pointing
out to Serious war crimes so at some
point something has to be done um we we
we cannot work like this humanitarian
workers should always be protected this
is international law and this is a basic
of humanity and it seems that humanity
is being buried right now in Gaza and
and for several months already Leo thank
you very much for joining
us well the Israeli newspaper haret has
run with a story that it says are from
uh defense sources from the IDF which
say that the Drone which bombed those
World Central Kitchen Aid workers was
actually targeting uh an armed Hamas
member who wasn't there a little earlier
I spoke to haret journalist Gideon Levy
who told us more about the haret story
he told us what we published obviously
and I'm not sure they said he was armed
they called him a terrorist but I'm even
not sure he was armed and you know the
definition of terrorist is a very
flexible and elastic one and I don't
know who he was but nothing obviously
Justified this thing especially after
they did it three times and they even
moved those Aid workers after they were
attacked the first time they moved to
another car in order to save their lives
but nothing is good enough for the
Israeli Army and they shot them
dead um what I'm struggling to
understand is that you can very clearly
see the world Central Kitchen logos on
these cars and from what the defense
sources uh are telling heret
newspaper as you mentioned yourself they
attacked the cars with a drone and then
people exited the cars and they were
attacked
again look it's not an exceptional case
I understand that we are all very Stone
because they are
Internationals but those cases happened
so many times in this
war that's Gideon Levy there talking to
me from the Israeli newspaper haret",20240402

live there's been International
condemnation after the death of seven
Aid workers in Gaza the charity World
Central Kitchen says their Convoy was
bombed in an Israeli air strike just
after they unloaded food from a
warehouse they are now suspending their
operations in Gaza the Israeli military
says it's conducting a review Into the

Australia Britain Poland are US Canadian

world leaders and foreign ministers are
pressing Israel to clarify the
circumstances surrounding their deaths
our correspondent in Jerusalem yolan
Nell begins our coverage this
hour there were no survivors cars in the
aid Convoy were hit directly even with
the world's Central Kitchen logos
clearly displayed and the US charity
says prior coordination with the Israeli
military displaced gazin staying intense
nearby heard the blast and ran to try
and
help this is our situation anyone who
distributes Aid or brings it to Gaza is
exposed to shelling and death whether
it's an international organization or
not distressed colleagues of the seven
Aid workers killed have been absorbing
the shocking news since the War Began
the NGO has provided more than 40
million meals in Gaza Australian Lami
francom who appeared in a recent World
Central Kitchen video has been confirmed
as one of the Dead there are reportedly
British citizens too the Prime Minister
Rishi sunak says he's shocked and
saddened they're doing fantastic work
bringing alleviation to the suffering
that many are experiencing in Gaza they
should be praised and commended for what
they're doing they need to be allowed to
do that work unhindered and it's
incumbent on Israel to make sure that
they can do that and we're asking Israel
to investigate what happened urgently
because clearly there are questions that
need to be answered World Central
Kitchen has been sending food to Gaza
from Cyprus along a new sea route the
aid workers had just unloaded 100 tons
from the latest shipment when they came
under attack Israel's military says it's
investigating we are committed to
examining our operations thoroughly and
transparently I just spoke to wck
founder Chef Jose andos and expressed
the deepest condolences of of Israel

entire world Central Kitchen

workers locals and foreigners are being
sent home for burial World Central
Kitchen says it's heartbroken and
grieving and these deaths will be felt
more widely too the Charities now paused
its operations in the war torn territory
where famine looming it says it will
soon make decisions about the future of
its work yolan now BBC News
[Music]
Jerusalem straight to breaking news an
update on that main story World Central
Kitchen have confirmed in the last few
minutes to the BBC that three of their
staff killed in that Israeli air strike
in Gaza were British we said in our
introduction that a variety of uh
foreign Nationals we knew there were uh
British workers but we did not know the
numbers and that coming in the last few
minutes that it is three of the seven
are British so that is just come from
World Central Kitchen confirming to the
BBC that three of the seven staff killed
were British so we will have more on
that element of that story in a moment
or two but in terms of the questions
being raised well we've heard world
leaders we've heard a variety of foreign
ministers asking serious questions of
Israel well Israel's primee Minister has
released this video message just a short
time ago let's hear Let unfortunately in
the last day there was a tragic incident
of an unintended strike of our forces on
innocent people in the Gaza Strip this
happens in war we are checking this
thoroughly we are in touch with the
governments and we will do everything
for this not to happen
again well that was Benjamin Netanyahu
let's talk to unicef's spokesperson
James Elder James welcome here to the
program a really tough day this your
reaction to this news of the deaths of
seven Aid
workers well it's just such a senseless
loss Matthew it's a reac an immense
tragedy for their families who would
have no doubt been worried for them
every single day uh that they're away
hearing news and happy to get the old
message back and no doubt happy to hear
the work that they were doing the
incredible work that they were doing the
th those people the Frontline some of
the Frontline actions for for for people
who were coming particularly down from
the north of Gaza Strip who had cut off
Matthew and had not seen food or or or
or sometimes anything like psychological
help and that's what these colleagues at
World kitchen were doing it was immense
work and they would have been sharing
that with families it's a senseless loss
just in the same way it underscores
there are senseless losses that families
are enduring on the Gaza Strip every
single day we heard there that you know
Inn lives beautiful innocent lives there
are beautiful innocent lives tens of
thousands of them have been killed since
this war started James we spoke to you
only last week on the program you were
there in Gaza you're now out but I
gather you met with this team only in
the last couple of days something like
this for all Aid workers must be
shocking must be
winding they're such an impressive team
Matthew they were where I met them um
one of their spaces at World Central
Kitchen which is just near the final
checkpoint on the coast there um they
have psychological support for people
because people who are coming out of the
north have suffered all types of
humiliation and Relentless bombardment a
lot of people in in residential housing
around Shea hospital f for two weeks had
seen unspeakable things and they come
out and they get food and and yeah so
there was something about these
colleagues Palestinian I hadn't met my
Australian counterpart um and they just
they they knew the dangers they wanted
to be there but I'm sorry when I say
they knew the dangers they knew this is
a difficult place to work it's a place
where you've got bad sanitation I just
left a friend who's got severe hepatitis
um because of what she's caught but you
don't expect this when you get approvals
to move and you're in an armored vehicle
you have to trust the occupying power
you have to trust Israel therefore that
you are allowed to move you're only
moving in that Convoy as we've all done
many times and an armored vehicle is
good if there's a stray bullet or
something a missile through the roof
with your exact
coordinates I mean and here and here we
are here we are James just for those
people watching around the world who
don't know how Aid agencies operate on
the ground the cars we're seeing images
of those vehicles on our screens at the
moment they were very clearly marked the
a agencies do let Israelis know what
they're planning their routs used the
car used is that absolutely common
practice
very much so it's essential you can't
move particularly where they are Derry
berer in the middle area in the north
you cannot move without that approval
you seek an approval might take a day it
might take three days but you seek an
approval two days before minimum you get
that approval the exact coordinance you
will move you will move to a designated
spot you might then wait it's called a
waiting era you might then wait again
for another call to go to get an all
clear then you will move again it is
laborious it is painstaking
it's an active military zone but then
once you start to move as these young
people were you know again in the in the
essential delivery of of food to people
facing famine then you do so in the hope
that despite all the horrors you've seen
that day at hospitals and so on and and
and injuries to Children you do so with
a fair knowledge that you will not get a
missile attack and yet here we are I
mean there are as I say there are
thousands of families who assume they'd
be safe in their homes a final thought
then because
World Central Kitchen have now suspended
their operations they had been at the
Forefront of that operation of bringing
in Aid via the sea that new route so
here is the question is this a
coincidence is it the fog of war or is
it something more
Sinister honestly Matthew I don't know I
can't speak to to the intent here of
course we've heard many many apologies
around this the the facts still remain
that we've certainly seen
um Mal intent in restrictions of Aid
that's why we have imminent famine
that's why we seen a catastrophic
decline that's why we see 13,000
children reportedly killed these numbers
don't don't occur when their all due all
due care is given to uh children
civilians or in this case those people
who traveled across the world to try and
help others James Elder thanks once
again thanks for joining us here live on",20240402

program we start in the Middle East the
aid organization World Central Kitchen
that's based in the US says it's
immediately suspending its operations in
Gaza after an air strike killed seven of
its workers the organization says those
killed are from Australia Poland the
United Kingdom a dual citizen of the US
and Canada as well as a Palestinian in a
statement it said the Convoy was hit as
it was leaving the de B Warehouse after
unloading Aid and that it had
coordinated movements with the IDF it
said quote this is not only an attack
against wck this is an attack on
humanitarian organizations showing up in
the most dire of situations where food
is being used as a weapon of War this is
unforgivable of course Israel denies
that it is using food as a weapon of War
now earlier Australian prime minister
Anthony albanesi has confirmed one
Australian woman zi francom was among
those killed Graeme Satchel has this
report the bodies of Aid workers being
taken to a hospital in central Gaza they
worked for the charity World Central
Kitchen they were traveling in Armored
Cars branded with their charity logo
when they were hit by an Israeli air
strike the charity says seven were
killed from all corners of the world
Britain Poland Australia America Canada
and
Palestine hey this is and we're at the
the smiling face of Australian zie
Franken one of those who lost their
lives she'd been working in Gaza helping
to organize the supply and preparation
of food the Australian government is
demanding answers the truth is that that
this is beyond uh Beyond any reasonable
circumstances someone going about
providing Aid and humanitarian
assistance uh should lose their life
this is a video produced by the charity
it is one of the biggest providers of
food Aid in Gaza and has delivered more
than 42 million meals since last
October in a statement the Israeli
military said it was conducting a review
at the highest level to understand the
circumstances of what it called a tragic
incident but the deaths have been
condemned by the founder of the charity
Jose Andres he said the Israeli
government needs to stop this
indiscriminate killing it needs to stop
restricting humanitarian Aid stop
killing civilians and Aid workers and
stop using food as a
weapon in the Syrian Capital Damascus
the clearup has started after an Israeli
air strike on Iran's consulate two
senior commanders of the Iranian
revolutionary guard were killed in the
attack it is the clearest sign yet that
this conflict is escalating the Iranian
Ambassador in Damascus hinted at
retaliation definitely the Zionist
regime knows better than anyone that
such crimes and violating international
law will have its response in an
appropriate
time the deaths of foreign aid workers
in Gaza will put international pressure
on Israel governments around the world
will want assurances that Charities and
their staff can operate safely Graham
Satchel BBC
News well let's look closer at that
attack in Damascus that strike in
Damascus and speak to Dr Alam senior
lecturer in politics and international
relations on Iran and the Middle East at
the Australian National University uh
thank you for your time now Muhammad
zahi was uh the senior Commander the
main senior Commander there that was uh
that was apparently killed in that
attack could you put that into context
for us how high profile a figure he is
in
Iran well
General zah was involved in in Iran's
activities in in the region since
1980s he's the the top uh revolutionary
guard Commander uh uh responsible for
coordination between Iranian backed
groups militias in Syria and Lebanon um
and of course his Deputy also uh was
killed uh amongst five other
revolutionary guard members uh this is
perhaps the the the the the top
assassination since uh assassination of
General kasm suan in Baghdad in 20 early
2020 uh what what makes this uh incident
even more important is that has happened
in Iranian consulate which is considered
as Iran soil in Damascus uh therefore is
a violation of international law however
it seems also that t Aviv is well
determined to drag Iran into a war and
in doing so they um they they they hope
to achieve the following uh objectives
one is to involve uh United States in
the region uh and to confront Iran
perhaps directly and also to unite the
fragmented political and societal um um
uh Spectrum inside the country the the
division between prime minister
Netanyahu and uh and the and people we
we know that the demonstrations have
been uh ongoing uh and also to to divert
the attention from what's going on in
Gaza well Dr Sal to that point uh and
given the fact that there are all these
fears of an escalation of this war what
options do you think Iran would
consider uh I would say uh Iran knows
very well that Tel Aviv wants to dve
Iran into war uh and they benefit from
this uh act if happens uh therefore for
they won't directly retaliate uh uh and
they if they will do it through their
proxies in in Iraq in in Lebanon or in
Yemen uh the the
direct kind of conflict between Iran and
Israel is it would be catastrophic uh
and therefore Iran knows very well that
U um that this should not happen and and
we know that there are channels that Dr
s apologies uh do you mean then when you
talk about its proxies and also you
mentioned Lebanon there that Hezbollah
could be a vehicle in some way for a
response yes of course Hezbollah is
extension of Iran's security Doctrine in
the region and it's it's actually
designated to to to to defend Iran and
uh rather than any other places
therefore um uh it depends I mean the
National Security Council in Iran uh
last night have made the decision we
don't know what the decision might be
but uh we may know that uh uh that
hisbah would be involved in in such
retaliation uh in one way or another
soon uh the the the question is that
there are channels that that tan and
Washington are are are in touch uh it
seems that United States has been blamed
by tan U and United States also uh have
uh declared that they have not been uh
uh in involved in such attack and and
there there are hopes that United States
and Iran may solve this problem somehow
uh Bey the curtains all right thank you
so much Dr Alam s for that
perspective now you you'll remember the
beginning of this program we started
with the news that the world Central
Kitchen and Aid organization has said
that it's suspending all its operations
immediately in Gaza and that's after
they said an air strike has killed seven
of their aid workers now let's go live
to Jerusalem and our Middle East
correspondent yolan Nell for more uh
yoland what's the latest on
that quite a lot of detail given in the
statement from World Central Kitchen
saying that it's seven Aid workers uh
that have been killed they British
Australian polish us and Canadian
national dual national uh and
Palestinians as well uh killed in an
apparent Israeli air strike in Dar balah
which is in the center of the Gaza Strip
and uh the US charity uh saying that um
these workers and its team were in a
convoy of three cars uh two of them
armored and they had been coordinating
their movements with the Israeli
military they were leaving a warehouse
in that City having just unloaded
something like 100 tons of food a that
had just been brought in by sea of
course this is a charity that's been
very much involved um in opening up the
new Maritime route between Cyprus and
and Gaza and bringing food in that way
um now the CEO of the organization eron
Gore said this is an attack on
humanitarian organizations showing up in
the most dire of situations where food
is being used as a weapon of War this is
unforgivable the Israeli military has
not confirmed this strike it said it's
carrying out an indepth examination of
the highest levels to understand the
circumstances of what it calls a tragic
incident and your land what position
does this put Israel's allies in allies
like the United States the United
Kingdom uh allies who potentially have
Nationals who've been killed in this
strike we've already had the Australian
prime minister coming out um and
demanding that those responsible for
this be held accountable and saying that
um Australia has spoken to the Israeli
government as a result of one of its
citizens um being killed uh this is
really something that will have further
repercussions for other Aid work um
happening in Gaza and it involves so
many countries because of the different
nationalities of the aid workers
involved the it's a US charity we've
also had the National Security Council
um in the US coming out and talking
about this as being a tragic incident
and saying that it too is looking for
answers",20240402
W7NzKL4dWbc,Israel accused of deadly strike on Iranian consulate in Syria | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel accused of deadly strike on Iranian consulate in Syria  BBC News.jpg,"Iranian State media says a suspected
Israeli strike has destroyed an Iranian
Embassy building in the Syrian Capital
Damascus with the senior commander in
the powerful Iranian revolutionary guard
among those killed Israel hasn't
commented on the incident these are the
latest pictures we have of the scene
Iranian State television is reporting
the senior Commander is Resa zahedi who
led the Palestinian division of the
Revolutionary guard K's Force the UK
based War monitor the Syrian Observatory
for human rights says at least eight
people have died but as yet there's no
official confirmation of the figures
Iran's Ambassador and his family are
reportedly unharmed well let's get the
latest from our correspondent in
Jerusalem that's Hugo Bea uh Hugo what
more are you hearing about this
incident yeah Anita so this is a very
significant escalation so again as you
said uh Iranian and Syrian state media
saying that an Israeli uh air strike
targeted the Iranian Consulate in uh the
Syrian Capital Damascus and our uh
report suggest that the senior commander
of the powerful Iranian revolutionary
guards Muhammad Raa sahi was killed so
very significant a high-profile member
of Iran's revolutionary guards
reportedly killed so uh we're hearing
now these accusations we haven't had any
kind of re reaction from uh Israeli
authorities we know that over the last
few years uh Israel has carried out
attacks targeting uh positions and also
members of Iran's revolutionary guards
but uh it's really uh it's very rare for
the Israeli authorities to acknowledge
uh involvement in those assassinations
so uh again very significant uh
development we've seen that these
targeted assassinations have been
happening frequently since the beginning
of the war uh between Israel and Hamas
Hamas obviously is a group uh that is
supported by uh Iran it is part of
Iran's uh so-called axis of resistance
and we are having a reaction from Iran
uh already uh the Iranian authorities
are saying that they're going to give a
decisive response so uh again u a very
significant development it seems to be a
very significant escalation as well with
this attack Hugo thank you very much for
that Hugo Bea there let's talk now to
farz Maad who is a senior fellow at the
middle e Middle East Institute about
this story and um forz Hugo describing
this as an escalation do you see this
particular uh strike as an escalation of
what's been
happening there's no doubt about that
Anita I think some might want to sort of
write this off as part of sort of the
ongoing uh operations that Israel has
been conducting against both Iran and
some of the Iranian proxies operating
out of Syria namely Hezbollah there has
been senior very senior Iranian
commanders killed in the past including
uh one major strike in December however
this is the most senior Iranian
revolutionary C guard Commander to be
killed to dat and I think very
importantly what differentiates this is
that essentially the Iranian Consulate
in Damascus uh which is under
international law Iranian territory has
been flattened so um some major
escalation here on behalf of Israel of
course the Iranians have a preference to
taking the war to Israel via proxies
indirectly using Hamas Hezbollah
Palestinian Islamic Jihad and others the
Israelis here retaliating in a more
direct fashion willing to risk that
escalation yes and of course we're
waiting for absolute confirmation that
uh Muhammad resa zahi is amongst the
dead but that is certainly the report
that we are getting if we look at these
images from the scene uh of the
explosion I'm going to ask our director
to to pull up those images for us um as
far as we know what we're seeing here is
part of the consulate but the buildings
on either side appear relatively
undamaged so it does seem to have been a
very precise
strike yes Israeli Precision uh in going
after these individuals whether they be
in Syria or even in Lebanon has been
quite remarkable but has also been REM
remarkable and and noteworthy is the
fact that the Israelis have
quite powerful uh operational
intelligence they know where these
commanders are they've went after
several senior Hamas and hisbah
commanders in Lebanon targeting them
within meetings Target them in their own
private quarters uh and so that raises
quite a bit of questions and concerns in
terms of operational security for Iran
and for these groups in terms of
Israel's ability to get to them okay
farz thank you very much for your
thoughts on this developing story farz
Maad from the Middle East instit
and let's get more now from our
International editor Jeremy Bowen who is
in Northern Israel Jeremy hello to you
and I'd like you for our viewers to put
what has happened in Damascus into uh
The Wider context of what's going on in
the region especially since uh the war
between Hamas and
Israel well essentially there's been an
increasingly serious war going on uh
over the Israel Lebanon B order between
Israeli forces and hisb which is the
political militia movement dominant one
in Lebanon which is very close to Iran
also very close to the Syrian regime now
if it wasn't for the fact that so much
has been happening in Gaza in the war
since October the 7th I think there have
been a lot more International attention
on what's been happening here and of
course there are connections that's why
it's going on so what we've been hearing
here uh this evening there's quite been
quite a lot of activity going up towards
Lebanon the Border isn't too far from
here and I think what's been going on as
you've been hearing this is an
escalation by Israel uh I think they're
testing the resolve of both Iran and its
clients its allies hisbah particularly
in Iran to see how they will respond
because while they have been engaged
this particularly in a in a in a tit
fortat series of increasingly fear
exchanges with Israel they've always
kept it within what in this part of the
world is sometimes referred to as the
rules of the game hisbah going after
military targets uh but Israel seems to
be pushing it to move to the next level
quite repeatedly and this is a big
upward step so now the big question is
given that the Iranians particularly are
Keen to
keep to restore the deterrence they feel
they've been building up against their
enemies in other words their enemies
feeling that they can't hit Iran its
people or their targets well the
Israelis have said oh yes we can we're
going to do this so now the question is
does Iran respond how does how does it
respond it may not be the way that you'd
expect it may not be you know I wouldn't
expect them to start sending missiles
into Israel far from it might be a Cyber
attack I mean this is all speculation on
my part but the point is is that this
really increasingly dangerous war
between Iran and its allies and proxies
and the Israelis has tonight taken quite
a big step up and what impact Jeremy do
you think that is going to have on the
ground uh with regards to the situation
specifically in
Gaza well I think that Gaza now has its
own Dynamic there that's going on I
don't think that you know you can
actually there have been responses
elsewhere in the region because of
what's been happening in Gaza I don't
think it necessarily works the other way
around uh you know the point is when all
this started 6 months ago now October
the 7th there were fears that the war
would spread well the war has spread and
that has been clear at the very least
since the end of last year and this is
another example of the way that a part
of the world that is fragile and incend
that has now taken another step up you
know I've been doing some reporting
around here today uh up near the the
border with Lebanon in the town of kirit
Shimona the Israeli Town talking to the
mayor and the mayor says Israel should
invade Lebanon because it should invade
the South should take on his BAH and
destroy it because in this area
thousands of Israelis have not been home
since October they've all been evacuated
the towns are empty so you know this is
something which is a continuing crisis
which has every chance of getting worse
Jeremy thank you very much Jeremy Bowen
there for us our Middle East editor",20240401
iy3FwML9-uk,Gazans watch the skies to spot planes dropping US aid | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gazans watch the skies to spot planes dropping US aid  BBC News.jpg,"we start with the war between Israel and
Hamas as International pressure mounts
for Action to address the prospect of
imminent famin among Palestinians in
Gaza we're following a number of
developments the US is said to have
authorized the transfer of billions of
dollars worth of bombs and fighter jets
to Israel in recent days the package
reported by The Washington Post and
Reuters comes despite growing calls for
US military aid to be linked to changes
in how Israel conducts the war it's just
just days after the un's top Court the
international court of justice ordered
Israel to allow the unimpeded flow of
food Aid into Gaza Israel says un
allegations that it's blocking Aid are
wholly unfounded the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed
to send officials to Egypt and Qatar in
the coming days for a new round of talks
on a possible ceasefire in Gaza in the
past 24 hours both the UK and the US
Military have aird dropped Food Supplies
into Gaza our BBC Middle East
correspondent Lucy Williamson was on the
US
plane Aid drops into Gaza are expensive
inefficient and increasingly
controversial these ready prepared meals
from the US Army are being flown more
than a thousand miles from a US Airbase
inq there's plenty of food just a short
drive from gaza's borders but this
American Aid is being flown right across
the Middle
East 80 crates of food on board two c17
transport planes dropped into a
population the UN says is on the brink
of famine it's not perfect we know that
there's upwards of 2 million people who
need food on the ground who are hungry
innocent civilians who didn't ask for
this conflict and we're dropping meals
in the tens of thousands but at least
it's something so does it feel like a
drop in the bucket maybe a little bit
but if you're a family on the ground who
got some of this Aid it can be a
lifesaver
12 people were reported to have drowned
this week trying to retrieve packages
from the sea six others crushed in a
stampede what are you doing to try and
mitigate those risks literally
everything we can so I know you spoke
with the colonel earlier we use a shoot
that falls at a slower rate to give the
gozin more time to see the parachutes
and make sure that they're out of the
way we also have assets overhead that
clear the drop zone so we will not drop
if there's any sort of grouping of
people there after 3 hours in the air
the ramp opens on gaza's devastated
Coastline they just open the Hat ready
to release the aid down into Gaza
there's no organized distribution system
down there very it
goes a drop of Aid in an ocean of hunger
getting Aid in this way is a last resort
but a growing number of countries are
doing it how much do these I catching
flights relieve pressure on gaza's
civilians and how much the pressure on
governments elsewhere Lucy Williamson
BBC News Kata well our correspondent
yourand now is in Jerusalem and she told
me more about the US weapons transfer to
Israel so according to these uh reports
in the Washington Post and voits as well
they're quoting unnamed US state and
defense Department officials and they're
saying that more than
1,800 2,000 pound bombs uh some 500500
pound bombs and 25 F-35 fighter jets
have been uh authorized uh in this
latest uh uh set of uh military uh Aid
assistance coming across uh to Israel
now a lot of this has already um been
initially approved uh by Congress but
the reason this is uh so interesting in
terms of the timing uh just after a
visit by the Israeli defense minister
yev Galant to Washington is that really
in recent days we have seen um tensions
deepening between uh Israel and the US
um and you that really uh reached the
the lowest moment on Monday after you
had the us exstension at the UN Security
Council uh when it came to a resolution
being passed on a ceasefire in the Gaza
War for the first time Israel was very
angered about that and there have been
these calls um from senior Democrats in
the US and from other groups of society
like Arab Americans uh suggesting that
if um military weapon supplies transfers
to Israel were not going to be cut then
they should be limited or they should be
conditioned uh by the Biden
Administration uh that doesn't seem to
have happened yeah I mean it's really
interesting isn't it we've spoken over
the last couple of weeks about the
relations uh being strained and just as
you say there widespread calls for this
um the the two to be linked that um that
that military aid should be linked to
the um humanitarian Aid to Gaza but that
doesn't seem to be the

been saying that it supports Israel's
continued right to defend itself we know
that the Israeli defense minister in the
US had been uh talking to Washington
about um its declared um aim to keep uh
Israel with a what's called a
qualitative military Edge uh in this
region um and also talking about not
just Waging War in Gaza but the prospect

JQVeeBn46bc,Evidence that Israel is using starvation as weapon of war in Gaza says UN  | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Evidence that Israel is using starvation as weapon of war in Gaza says UN   BBC News.jpg,"there is a plausible case that Israel is
using starvation as a weapon of War
that's according to the United Nations
most senior human rights official fulka
Turk he says if proven that would amount
to a war crime humanitarian agencies are
calling for an immediate ceasefire and
large deliveries of Aid in Gaza where a
famine is looming Israel insists it's
letting in all the humanitarian Aid that
is needed from Jerusalem here our
International editor Jeremy bone and his
report contains upsetting images
Gaza is no place to be ill nura Muhammad
had lung and liver problems before the
war now after months of starvation and
without the Right medical care she is
deteriorating fast and I'm my daughter
can't move says her mother she's anemic
always sleeping and there's nothing
nutritious to
eat there is plenty to eat only a few
miles away in the lorries that are
backed up on the egyp eyptian side of
the border and much more that could come
from Israel if the Israelis let it into
Gaza from Geneva vulat Turk the un's
most senior human rights official told
me there is plausible evidence that
Israel is using starvation as a weapon
of war look when it comes to
humanitarian assistance let's be clear
Israel is an occupying power and has an
obligation to provide humanitarian
assistance
and if that humanitarian assistance does
not come in in the scale speed and
predictability that is required yes very
serious questions are raised so let's
get it very clear Israel is to blame
Israel is to blame in significant in a
significant way yes you're aware of
course that Israel says they're not to
blame at all that they give as much Aid
as is possible that if anyone's to blame
it's the UN and it's particular L Hamas
it is absolutely clear what happened on
the 7th and the 8th of October by Hamas
and some of the other armed groups is
unconscionable these are flagrant
violations of international humanitarian
law and international human rights at
the same time the
brutality of the attack by Israel and
the method of warfare it begs the
question of the proportionality of the
response you you're saying questions you
say there's no doubt about Hamas are
there any doubts about Israel you always
have to prove the intent but as I said
Collective punishment the collective
punishment that was declared with the
siege is indeed amounts to a war crime
and it needs to be dealt as
such on social media false claims
circulate that famine in Gaza is a Lie
the Hebrew caption says there's more
shawarma in Gaza than in Israeli Hyer
and Israel's government dismisses the
un's accusations total nonsense total
irresp responsible uh thing to say
Israel is accepting all the aid that the
US and the world is giving to gazan
innocent people which a lot of it goes
to extend the war how many innocent
people are in Gaza in your opinion
that's not I'm not going to quote any
number I I'm basically saying that over
70% of gazans support October 7 Massacre
so they're not innocent people that are
supporting uh Hamas uh they have a
different thought they're an enemy I
thank our friends around the world for
supporting our strategic goal and I'm
I'm I'm telling you but they don't like
the way you're doing it do they that's
tough we're going to finish the war
we'll do everything we can to kill the
Kamas terrorists and to minimize
collateral damage as much as we can the
evidence of gaza's humanitarian
catastrophe is overwhelming and it is
deepening International pressure on
Israel swollen joints wasted Limbs and
dermatitis
are classic symptoms of acute
malnutrition these children reached

_1oU1Y680ro,Gaza: Fighting continues despite UN Security Council resolution calling for ceasefire | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza Fighting continues despite UN Security Council resolution calling for ceasefire  BBC News.jpg,"intense fighting is continuing in Gaza
just hours after the passing of the
first un Security Council resolution
calling for an immediate ceasefire
Witnesses say Israeli war planes have
again bombed the southern city of Rafa
with gun battles raging in other areas
this is the moment the vote was passed
after previous attempts to call for a
ceasefire failed the US is now calling
for an immediate surge in desperate
needed Aid these are the latest pictures
in the past hour of air being a of Aid
being air dropped into Gaza the UN world
food program says famin could set in by
May in two areas of Gaza unless the flow
of Aid is
increased Israel's prime minister has
responded to the UN vote by cancelling
some meetings between Israeli and
American officials meanwhile Hamas
appears to have rejected the latest trth
proposal made via mediators in Qatar
well let's go live to Jerusalem and our
Middle East correspondent yoland n
yoland what more do we know about the
state of fighting in Gaza overnight just
after this UN resolution was
passed I mean it seems that the
resolution passing has had very little
impact on the ground what we've heard
from Palestinian witnesses that even in
Rafa on the Egypt border there have been
Israeli air strikes in that area and
that fighting remains intense um
particularly around the two hospitals
that we've been talking about for the
past few days uh the shiffer hospital in
Gaza City that's where Israeli forces
launched a raid one week ago where they
say they've rounded up 500 members of
Hamas and Islamic Jihad um Palestinian
residents nearby saying they've seen
corpses on the street that there are
still um Close Quarters battles going on
there also in al-amal hospital around Al
AML hospital um in the southern city of
Khan Unice Israeli tanks are rolling
back in there in the past couple of days
and uh the Israeli military has said
that Hamas is using civilian
infrastructure in that area and Y land
what's the feeling there in the region
about what kind of a difference this
resolution could bring to the fighting
there in
Gaza well of course while Israel reacted
very angrily uh to this and it said that
um this could be uh an encouragement for
Hamas that it didn't have to give up the
Israeli hostages that it's still holding
um in exchange uh for a ceasefire and we
had um strong rebukes from the Israeli
Prime Minister when it comes uh to the
American position the exstension when it
came to voting on uh Security Council
resolution
2728 um the the claim was made that
really this um marked a Divergence from
Washington's previous policy um the US
has denied that but on the the
Palestinian side uh this was welcomed
including by Hamas but as we can see
it's not um despite the fact un Security
Council resolutions are seen as having
the force of international law um we
also had a White House official um when
he was talking about the Israeli
reaction saying that he didn't think um
really that this would have an impact on
Israel's ability to tackle Hamas and
that it didn't change things when it
comes to uh the US commitment to Israel
particularly when it comes to matters
like military assistance so seeing the
strong support for this resol resolution
at the UN Security Council how isolated
is Israel on the global stage would you
say now this is something that will
concern Israel greatly it does feel very
much like it's isolated but at the same
time if you um look at surveys of the
Israeli public opinion um there is still
wide support for the war in Gaza um and
for this idea of of dismantling Hamas
there it's seen as being such an
existential threat we've had reminders
that Hamas can still pose a threat in
the past day it's had we've had Rockets
fired um to Ash D Israeli city uh in in
the south of the country for the first
time in weeks there were rocket warning
sirens that continued to go off through
last night um in Israeli communities
close to the Gaza Strip um but yes on an
international stage Israel will be
worried about this and we've had Israeli
officials coming out in the past day so
particularly talking about how they are
trying to get surge of Aid using that un
language trying to flood uh Gaza with
Aid we were told in a briefing yesterday
um as that is part of this resolution
too and of course part of the big
International demand that they're so
worried about the threat of starvation
and famine in Gaza your land thank you
very much that's the BBC's your land now
there in Jerusalem now as well as
calling for a ceasefire the UN is also
warning that northern areas of Gaza
could face famine within weeks Israel
says it's opening new routes to let Aid
through and the Israeli Army Chief in
charge of Aid coordination says there's
no shortage of food I should warn you
that this report from our Middle East
correspondent Lucy Williamson contains
some distressing images from the very
start gaza's border fence divides more
than just land on one side Food Supplies
on the other sick malnourished children
agencies say Israel is blocking Aid
Israel says the only hold up is the
agency's ability to deliver
it a ceasefire could help get Aid in but
Israel has said it won't work with the
un's main relief agency Ana accusing it
of links to Hamas Ona's Chief said the
ban was
outrageous gate 96 a newly opened
Crossing Point takes trucks straight to
Gaza City
where the UN says people are weeks away
from
famine on the night we were there the
Army said 20 trucks were approved to
cross but only seven showed up we took a
lot of measures in order to enlarge the
amount of humanitarian aid but the UN
and other International Organization
have some bottlenecks they have issues
and challence regarding Logistics of
amount of trucks amount of uh truck
drivers
Manpower uh working hours and
Etc on board one of those trucks the
local head of the world food program
with a different explanation on this
particular Convoy we were given a limit
of 15 vetted drivers by the IDF that
were cleared to use this route but only
seven were available to us some had
already gone up to Gaza City the day
before and they simply hadn't been able
to return yet we literally need 50 60 70
80 truck drivers cleared to use these
routes every single
day Israel is Keen to show the world
it's allowing more Aid into Gaza but it
says it's not responsible for the amount
of Aid going in international law says
different it says Israel has a duty not
just to open the gates but to get food
and medicine to the people under its
control do you think children are
starving in Gaza I know that they are
not so when you see those pictures of
children Starving in hospital what do
you
think I say it and I will say it again

Antonio gutes as we turn to the Middle
East now has visited the Rafa border
crossing and has made a renewed call for
an immediate ceasefire in Gaza his call
comes as the Hamas run Health Ministry
in Gaza said 19 people waiting for Aid
were killed by Israeli forces Israel has
denied firing on the crowd Mr gutes said
it is time to silence the guns and his
words and stop the nightmare describing
the ongoing loss of life in Gaza as a
moral outrage and called on Israel to
give Total unfettered Access to
humanitarian Goods throughout the
territory it's time to truly flood Gaza
with life-saving Aid the choice is clear
either surge or
starvation let's choose the side of help
the side of Hope and the right side of
history that was Antonio gutes well
let's speak to our Middle East
correspondent yolan Nell who is in
Jerusalem for us hi yoland thank thanks
for joining now uh what how has the
mounting pressure on Israel uh to give
more Aid to Gaza allow more access to
Aid uh been received by
Israel I mean we have seen changes in
the past few weeks with Israel opening
up a new border crossing in the north of
the Gaza Strip in particular we've seen
the start of this um Marin route um
bringing Aid in by sea and of course the
air drops continuing um over the Gaza
Strip but still um massive Aid shortages
being reported now Israel has hit back
against those comments by Mr gutes the
foreign minister was very critical of
him um calling him um somebody who had
allowed the UN to become in his words an
anti-semitic and anti-israel body you
had Kat part of the Israeli defense
Ministry that really um oversees uh The
Crossings in into the Gaza Strip um
putting out a picture which it said
showed um a lot of Aid that was awaiting
distribution uh by the UN inside uh
inside Gaza so uh the Israeli claim is
it's really the um the speed of
distribution problems with that on the
the UN side and by Aid agencies that is
to blame here um but yes this overall
question has not gone away I mean it was
very powerful uh the UN Secretary
General standing on the Egyptian side of
the raffer crossing next to a long line
of lorries backed up there which have
got you know life saving Aid that is so
desperately needed on the other side in
Gaza and your land meanwhile there are
still calls for ceasefire in various uh
parts of the world what progress have we
seen if any when it comes to the talks
mediated by
Qatar so those indirect talks are
continuing um in Doha you have um
Israeli negotiators there Hamas
negotiators is there and you have the
catties the Egyptians and the us all
involved in the mediation effort uh what
we've heard from an Israeli official is
that the US has put forward what they're
calling a bridging proposal um basically
uh to try to close the gap between the
two sides on on a deal on a formula for
how many um Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails would be released for each
of um some 40 Israeli hostages that it's
proposed would be released by Hamas as
part of a new deal we haven't yet heard
um a response from Hamas on that it's
discouraging that um the top Israeli
negotiators are said to have left Doha
now um awaiting that uh response and we
heard from a Palestinian official who is
very close uh to the talks that uh still
these deep differences remain between
the two sides I mean the overall main
sticking point is that Hamas wants
Israel to completely withdraw its troops
from Gaza it wants any deal basically to
pave the way to a complete end uh to the
war where Israel is Con saying is saying
that this really has to be um a
temporary ceasefire that's being talked
about and that in the end it wants the
water to resume so that it can
completely dismantle Hamas and your land
meanwhile we've been reporting on
protests weekly protests in Tel Aviv uh
what more can you tell us about
those these protests you feel they're
getting more and more desperate there
are a number of people who arrested by
Israeli police um last night accused of
sort of disturbing um public Ord the
families of the hostages really just
want a deal to be done now to bring
their loved ones home and they want a
deal to involve all of the hostages it's
thought um that there are about 130
hostages remaining in the Gaza Strip
already um the Israeli defense officials
have said they think about more than 30
of those have been killed have died in
captivity there's another disturbing
video that's been put out um by Hamas in
the past day um where it says that um a
hostage has died because of starvation
and because of the lack of supplies
getting into Gaza that's all just going
to add to the worry and the public
pressure on the Israel government to
come up with a deal all right yolan
thank you so much for that update",20240324

to avenge Ukrainian attacks on Russian

correspondent Sarah rsford who is in C
for us just tell us more about these
targeted strikes Sarah
well this was a massive attack overnight
by Russia it's the biggest that we've
had here for quite some time a
combination of missiles and drones fired
by Russia they say they were targeting
the energy infrastructure here and
certainly uh there were a number of uh
hits on uh Power facilities power plants
across the country now the missiles and
drones were fired right across Ukraine
north south east and west uh cities
across this country were targeted we
know that hard Ukraine's Second City in
the north of this country has been left
almost completely without power in fact
even the air raay systems there the
centralized ones are not working because
of the power outage and people are being
told that get a notification of further

Power Plant the giant hydroelectric
plant the biggest one in the country
that was also hit We Believe by several
missiles uh we've been told uh by
officials here that there is no danger
that the dam itself will be breached but
obviously this is an extremely uh
worrying attack for Ukraine remember
civilian infrastructure here has been
targeted right throughout this war if
you remember the first winter of this
war it was one of the uh the calling
cars if you like of Russia they hit
power plants time and time again at the

YEQt6bjCfrE,Russia and China block US call for immediate Gaza ceasefire tied to hostage deal at UN | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Russia and China block US call for immediate Gaza ceasefire tied to hostage deal at UN  BBC News.jpg,"now let's start in New York where the UN
Security Council has voted against a US
draft resolution calling for an
immediate ceasefire in Gaza linked to
the release of hostages Russia and China
were amongst three countries that vetoed
the US resolution it was the first time
the US had supported calls for an
immediate ceasefire in the region having
previously used its own veto to block
such demands at the UN well this is how
the US ambassador to the UN responded to
China and Russia's veto
Russian China still could not bring
itself to condemn hamas's terrorist
attacks on October 7th can we just pause
on that for a
moment Russia and China refuses to
condemn Hamas for burning people alive
for gunning down innocent civilians at a
concert for raping women and girls for
taking hundreds of people hostage this
was the deadliest single attack on Jews
since the Holocaust and a permanent
member of this Council can't even
condemn it I'm sorry it's it's really
outrageous and it's below the Dignity of
this
body that was the US Representative
there to the un uh just speaking a short
time ago well we know that uh Mr
Netanyahu has been having talks with
Anthony blinken and uh he has said in a
statement to uh after those talks which
has only recently uh broken up we think
um Mr netan who said said he to we we
talking about going into Rafa he said Mr
said I told him I hope we will do it
with the support of the US but if we
have to we will do it alone we know that
of course the Us and other allies of
Israel have been urging caution on that
particular move well let's speak to Mark
loen who is in Jerusalem for us Mark
just first of all on the US resolution
being vetoed initially what what is the
impact of that if any and we also know
that there is another draft resolution
that's doing the rounds at the
moment well it means that the resolution
of course was not passed at the UN
Security Council G because Russia and
China have veto wielding power now
Russia's un Ambassador said that it was
a false Declaration of a ceasefire false
call for a ceas fire because the text
that was supported by the US linked a
ceasefire to the immediate release of
hostages so in effect was supporting
Israel's negotiating position in these
talks in in in Doha which are still
ongoing ceasefire talks because Israel's
position is that there can only be any
ceasefire if the IM if the hostages
Israeli hostages held by Hamas are
immediately released um now even though
the US basically was sort of in line
with Israel's negotiating position it
was a a harder tone than the US has used
before as you noted in your introduction
uh previously the US had vetoed three
previous calls for an immediate
ceasefire and they've never use those
words immediate cessation of hostility
so you know the US was going further
than they ever had uh but still it was
blocked by Russia China and Algeria
Algeria so it it doesn't it doesn't pass
there is talk there is a second
ceasefire that uh um uh draft that is
going to be circulated we don't know
exactly how hard that will go but all
all through this conflict really um the
UN Security Council has been Paralyzed
by differing positions on the war and on
Israel's position in the war and
Israel's offensive um you know we've
seen the US hardened position growing ex
increasingly exasperated with Israel but
even that it seems has not been enough
to pass the deadlock of the UN Security
Council and Mark in terms of the talks
that happened um on the ground today we
we've seen um the Israeli Prime Minister
M Mr n who's coming out of these talks
and saying um that he still feels that
they will have to go into ruer in order
to defeat Hamas and if they have to do
that without the support of the US they
would still go ahead do we have any more
information as to how those talks
went all we know is that they lasted
about 40 minutes uh that they discussed
Rafer as you say which is in the south
of Gaza where more than a million people
are now Sheltering and where the
Israelis are determined to send in the
military in defiance of international
warnings about the atrocities that that
could ensue um they also talked about
the urgent need to deliver or or BL from
blink's point of view an urgent need to
ramp up humanitarian Aid into Gaza
amidst those dire warnings that we had
earlier in the week about famine and uh
catastrophic food insecurity facing the
vast majority of people in Gaza um the
US has summoned an Israeli delegation to
the to Washington next week to discuss
Rafa the US the US position is that
Israel does not need to go into Rafa in
order to destroy Hamas there are
alternatives namely to cut off
completely the smuggling routs coming
from Egypt across the The Crossing into
Gaza and feeding Hamas but whether
Israel buys that we don't know and at
the same time as Israel is you know
Netanyahu is repeating almost every day
his intention to go into Rafa the
ceasefire talks continuing in Doha with
the head of mosad the Israeli
intelligence agency there in Qatar with
the head of the CIA and Egyptian and
Qatari negotiators so Israel appears to
be kind of keeping its options open
playing to different audiences uh but
clearly if the Israeli military does go
into Rafa which probably could take
quite a few weeks to organize given the
number of people who would need to be
evacuated first that would even that
would exacerbate the already very very
fractur relationship between the US and
Israel and Mark difficult question
potentially for you to answer from where
you are at the moment so forgive me for
asking but but do we have any real
information about whether
representatives of Hamas or you know via
the any other Palestinian groupings are
involved in these talks these seasar
talks in they are they yeah they are in
effect represented by by the qataris uh
because their political uh wing of Hamas
has um has has been living in Qatar
basically the the sort of political
representatives of Hamas have lived in
Qatar so Qatar actually uh plays a
double or an important go between
between the Israelis and the and and
Hamas because even though they don't
have official relations with Israel they
do talk to the Israelis but they also
give um you know residency to to top
Hamas officials now what we understand
is that in order for an agreement on a
ceasefire to be reached they would need
to actually have the green light from
the head of Hamas in Gaza who is Yaya
sinoa and he is Israel's Most Wanted he
is believed to be the Mastermind behind
the seventh of October attx we don't
know where he is uh probably in a tunnel
somewhere possibly surrounded by Israeli
hostages but given the communications
black out there given the fact that he's
trying to evade Israeli Firepower it's
quite difficult of course for that for
for the qataris or indeed the Egyptians
to try to negotiate with him or or not
necessarily negotiate with him but to to
actually get his you know the the the
the words from the horse's mouth if you
like so that is one of the holdups in
the talks um and you know if there is to
be uh a a breakthrough in those in those
talks that would need to come from from
Hamas itself not just from the qataris
and the Egyptians so that is one of the
reasons G why we are not expecting a
breakthrough you know today or tomorrow
it could take days even weeks for this
to to to Really move",20240322

it's taken control of the AL shifer
Hospital in what it called an operation
to thwart terrorist activity the
hospital is in Gaza City in the north of
the strip the Israeli military said
troops came under Fire and that 80
people were detained and others killed
including a senior commander of hamas's
internal security
service well these are images from the
raid you can hear those gunshots can't
you there Witnesses described heavy
exchanges of fire around the site where
thousands of displaced people are
currently Sheltering and Medics are also
still working with patients who are
being treated well gaza's health
Ministry said Israel was committing a
war crime let's hear though from an
Israeli government spokesperson now this
morning the IDF conducted a precise
operation to thwart terrorism in the
shifa hospital area footage shows
terrorists firing from deep within the
shifa
complex our forces engaged the
terrorists tens of Hamas terrorists have
been detained in the shifa
hospital well the spokesperson there was
talking about these images have a look
they were released by the IDF who say
they show troops coming under Fire it's
a short clip that doesn't confirm the
time or sequence of the events Gaza
Health officials have repeatedly denied
the accusation that Hamas Fighters
operate inside or underneath alifa and
other hospitals well these pictures here
show the aftermath of that raid the
Israeli military said there was no
obligation for medical staff or patients
to leave and that the hospital could
continue its important functions but
several medical staff inside the
hospital told the BBC El electricity had
been cut and they'd been instructed by
the Israeli military not to move
prohibiting them from properly treating
their patients well International Medics
who've worked in Gaza say the Medics
need to be protected I do not believe
the idea have provided any credible
evidence since October the 7th and
indeed before then that these hospitals
were being used as uh Hamas command
centers uh I've been in shifa hospital
on many occasions I've spoken to people
who I've known for many years who work
there a and I I do not believe there is
any evidence to suggest
that Let's cross live Let's cross live
now to Rafa and speak to James Elder
spokesperson for the United Nations uh
Children's Fund uh James thanks for
joining us here on BBC News and let me
just ask you first of all for your
reaction to what we've been saying today
about the potential famine that is going
to hit Gaza very hard in the coming
months yeah it's hitting Gaza I mean we
might wait for an official
classification Mariam but the reality is
that won't mean a lot to people on the
ground here we are now seeing children
dying of starvation of malnutrition
normally Maran Mal nutrition is an
underlying cause it's not what kills a
child a child will die from something
like pneumonia to see a child die from
malnutrition because you've heard all
those numbers they're terrifying we've
never seen anything like this before in
Gaza as per that IPC the classification
on famine we've never seen a
classification as severe as this one for
this many people a percentage of people
but Maran when you drill it down to a
child a child who is dying of
malnutrition in a hospital they'll look
for vein they'll look for it in the arm
the body will have constricted highly
traumatic have probably look for a vein
in the head and eventually the child
will die we are seeing this our very
real fear is we're going to see it on a
scale that we've never seen before what
do you think now needs to happen to turn
the tide because Aid agencies are saying
aren't they or at least Antonio gues
said that it's not too late to turn the
tide and the Secretary General is dead
right the frustrating thing is it's not
that complicated it requires more land
routes and there are land routs within
kilometers of where I am uh you know
more land routs to get Aid in you know
it's yes we see air drops we see now
Ships coming in the ship that it came in
will be the equivalent of 12 or 13
trucks today as I came back into Gaza I
passed hundreds and hundreds of trucks
so we need the facilitation of those
trucks by the occupying power who has a
lead legal obligation facilitate them
get them in flood Gaza with the food
that literally is just a matter of
kilometers from me maram and of course a
ceasefire ceasefire would enable people
to breathe again for the trauma they I
mean you probably can't hear the drones
they are Relentless there is a trauma
that is hitting children here just as
hard as the food deprivation so cease
fire and get the trucks that are so
close and yet so far get them across to
the families who so desperately need
them James we've just been breaking some
news in the last half an hour that
Israel is sending a delegation to
Washington to talk about a potential uh
military operation that has been moted
for a while now by Israel into inside
Rafa just give people who are watching
this a sense of what that would mean to
the over a million people who are inside
Rafa right now if there were to be a
military operation there of any
sort that's mindboggling it's it makes
my body shake uh you you see Rafer it's
very hard to walk in Rafa there are
informal settlements and stra and Tents
and anywhere someone can move to because
they were told to move here three or
four times having had their homes bombed
or being evacuated under incursion or an
offensive from a shelter they are in so
it's very hard to move in rappa it is a
city of children 600,000 plus children
twice the density population density of
New York City but no highrises
everyone's on the ground and offensive
in that area I mean it's it's terrifying
it's offensive to imagine so we just
hope that calm heads can Prevail because
that would be utterly devastating for

horrendous devastating for girls and

it's taken control of the AL shifer
Hospital in what it called an operation
to thwart terrorist activity the
hospital is in Gaza City in the north of
the strip the Israeli military said
troops came under Fire and that 80
people were detained and others killed
including a senior commander of hamas's
internal security
service well these are images from the
raid you can hear those gunshots can't
you there Witnesses described heavy
exchanges of fire around the site where
thousands of displaced people are
currently Sheltering and Medics are also
still working with patients who are
being treated well gaza's health
Ministry said Israel was committing a
war crime let's hear though from an
Israeli government spokesperson now this
morning the IDF conducted a precise
operation to thwart terrorism in the
shifa hospital area footage shows
terrorists firing from deep within the
shifa
complex our forces engaged the
terrorists tens of Hamas terrorists have
been detained in the shifa
hospital well the spokesperson there was
talking about these images have a look
they were released by the IDF who say
they show troops coming under Fire it's
a short clip that doesn't confirm the
time or sequence of the events Gaza
Health officials have repeatedly denied
the accusation that Hamas Fighters
operate inside or underneath alifa and
other hospitals well these pictures here
show the aftermath of that raid the
Israeli military said there was no
obligation for medical staff or patients
to leave and that the hospital could
continue its important functions but
several medical staff inside the
hospital told the BBC El electricity had
been cut and they'd been instructed by
the Israeli military not to move
prohibiting them from properly treating
their patients well International Medics
who've worked in Gaza say the Medics
need to be protected I do not believe
the idea have provided any credible
evidence since October the 7th and
indeed before then that these hospitals
were being used as uh Hamas command
centers uh I've been in shifa hospital
on many occasions I've spoken to people
who I've known for many years who work
there a and I I do not believe there is
any evidence to suggest
that Let's cross live Let's cross live
now to Rafa and speak to James Elder
spokesperson for the United Nations uh
Children's Fund uh James thanks for
joining us here on BBC News and let me
just ask you first of all for your
reaction to what we've been saying today
about the potential famine that is going
to hit Gaza very hard in the coming
months yeah it's hitting Gaza I mean we
might wait for an official
classification Mariam but the reality is
that won't mean a lot to people on the
ground here we are now seeing children
dying of starvation of malnutrition
normally Maran Mal nutrition is an
underlying cause it's not what kills a
child a child will die from something
like pneumonia to see a child die from
malnutrition because you've heard all
those numbers they're terrifying we've
never seen anything like this before in
Gaza as per that IPC the classification
on famine we've never seen a
classification as severe as this one for
this many people a percentage of people
but Maran when you drill it down to a
child a child who is dying of
malnutrition in a hospital they'll look
for vein they'll look for it in the arm
the body will have constricted highly
traumatic have probably look for a vein
in the head and eventually the child
will die we are seeing this our very
real fear is we're going to see it on a
scale that we've never seen before what
do you think now needs to happen to turn
the tide because Aid agencies are saying
aren't they or at least Antonio gues
said that it's not too late to turn the
tide and the Secretary General is dead
right the frustrating thing is it's not
that complicated it requires more land
routes and there are land routs within
kilometers of where I am uh you know
more land routs to get Aid in you know
it's yes we see air drops we see now
Ships coming in the ship that it came in
will be the equivalent of 12 or 13
trucks today as I came back into Gaza I
passed hundreds and hundreds of trucks
so we need the facilitation of those
trucks by the occupying power who has a
lead legal obligation facilitate them
get them in flood Gaza with the food
that literally is just a matter of
kilometers from me maram and of course a
ceasefire ceasefire would enable people
to breathe again for the trauma they I
mean you probably can't hear the drones
they are Relentless there is a trauma
that is hitting children here just as
hard as the food deprivation so cease
fire and get the trucks that are so
close and yet so far get them across to
the families who so desperately need
them James we've just been breaking some
news in the last half an hour that
Israel is sending a delegation to
Washington to talk about a potential uh
military operation that has been moted
for a while now by Israel into inside
Rafa just give people who are watching
this a sense of what that would mean to
the over a million people who are inside
Rafa right now if there were to be a
military operation there of any
sort that's mindboggling it's it makes
my body shake uh you you see Rafer it's
very hard to walk in Rafa there are
informal settlements and stra and Tents

Middle East and officials in Gaza have
accused Israeli forces of shooting at a
crowd of Palestinians waiting for Aid in
Gaza City saying that at least 20 people
have been killed the Hamas ran Health
Ministry says more than 150 others were
injured the Israeli military says it did
not open fire meanwhile a jetti has been
built on the Gaza Coastline which is
thought would be used to offload aid
from the Open Arms charity ship
this satellite image was taken on
Tuesday you can see there the Earth
being pwed out over the beach and this
satellite image was taken a few hours
later on the same day you can see the
jetty extending out into the sea with
what appears to be a road leading
towards it when the Open Arms ship does
eventually dock it will start to
distribute a cargo of 200 tons of food
and Medical Aid further shipments are
expected in the coming weeks here you
can see where W houses in Cyprus with
Aid waiting to be loaded well we can
speak now to our correspondent Anna
Foster who's in
Jerusalem morning Katherine I'm in in
East Jerusalem this morning outside
Damascus gate where worshippers are
starting to arrive already for Friday
prayers the first Friday prayers of
Ramadan it's traditionally been a time
of attenion there have been violent
clashes here before what's interesting
this morning is the Israeli security
forces have a very
wide Cordon set up in fact when you look
at the worshippers who are arriving many
of them have come from checkpoints
through the occupied West Bank this
morning um you won't see anybody here
over the age of 10 or under the age of
50 10 to 50 year olds have been excluded
from worshiping here today as uh
attempts are made to try and keep this
peaceful of course it's it's happening
against the backdrop of the war in Gaza
uh you mentioned uh the incident there
that was uh uh last night at the the
Kuwait roundabout in Gaza now the Hamas
run Health Ministry said that 20 people
had been killed and more than 150 had
been injured they said it was people
Sheltering potentially in a a container
waiting for a delivery of Aid uh they
were questioning whether uh an air
strike for example might have uh have
hit the container now Israel very
quickly denied that they said that
reports that this was uh an IDF attack
were false and they said that they would
be carrying out a thorough assessment of
the situation
um of course all of this as we were
saying happens against the backdrop of
uh Ramadan of prayers and of of tension
in this area in particular and I was
speaking to uh to an Imam at the mosque
in Bethlehem Imam Abed al- maid ATA and
he just explained a little more about
why we see these tensions here during
Friday prayers at
Ramadan I was IM in ALA MOS and I was I
was arrested from there several times
and I am prevented from going there so
the walls to view the checkpoints to
view the soldiers to you you need
special permission special be Mission
only from the Israeli security the is
Israeli security doesn't give
anyone now of course there are still
calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to
take place Hamas said last night that it
had put forward uh what it called uh a
vision for an agreement that it have put
to uh to peace talk mediators in at uh
they said that they were still pushing
for things like Palestinians to be able
to return to their homes for a full
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza
uh Israel for its part said that Hamas
was still making what it called
unrealistic demands and that was echoed
by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu when he met families of people
who were still being held hostage last
night and he said that work was
continuing still to try and secure their
release of course one of the reasons
that this humanitarian ceasefire is
being pushed for is that the aid
situation Gaza is so so desperate at the
moment now world leaders humanitarian
groups have made it very clear that more
aid needs to reach Gaza by Road there is
no substitute for that we've seen air
drops and we've also seen um as you were
saying Katherine this this boat with 200
tons of Aid aboard important of course
but nowhere near the scale that aid
needs to be uh received at that's now
visible off the coast of Gaza it's been
sailing from Cypress over the last few
days it'll be the first aid to be
received by sea during this conflict so
we'll continue to watch that as well
over the next few hours here on BBC News
so stay with us back to you Catherine

being denied exit for life-saving
treatment through the Rafa Crossing to
Egypt despite their names appearing on
authorized evacuation lists in parallel
fees charged by an Egyptian company
arranging evacuations from Gaza have
rocketed during the war becoming
unaffordable for most the BBC's larara
El gabali worked with producer haa albad
on this
report
I'm on my way to the border crossing
hopefully I will find my name there and
be able to travel God willing this is
s's third time at the Border in as many
months she was being treated for
leukemia when the conflict began leaving
her and almost 10,000 other cancer
patients in Gaza without
treatment despite her name being on
evacuation lists for the sick and the
injured she was turned away at the
border I read that my name was published
on the RAF coordination groups my name
was on the departure list twice I have
been to the crossing point twice for no
reason I was turned away Sahm's name
appeared on this list for evacuation to
Turkey on November 19th but border
agents on the Palestinian side turned
her away saying the Turkish Envoy wasn't
there to receive her but we found that
that wasn't the case MAA asoi was being
treated for breast cancer and was on the
same evacuation list ASM she was allowed
to leave to Turkey for treatment that
day and was even able to bring her two
daughters with
her after I got through the crossing
onto the Egyptian side I saw the Turkish
Consul waiting for us and I knew I was
going to Turkey we've spoken to two
other cancer patients who say they've
been turned away at the border despite
their names being on evacuation
lists officials in Turkey told the BBC
that they are not involved in approving
the exit of patients from Gaza and that
they are willing to treat as many
patients as they receive only 600 cancer
patients from Gaza have managed to leave
since October
7th Israel vets who is allowed to leave
Gaza the Israeli Ministry of Defense
told us they have no restrictions on the
number of patients allowed to leave for
medical treatment Palestinian border
authorities declined to comment on
Sahm's case but it seems there are other
ways to leave Gaza a lucrative Monopoly
has emerged from the war with one
Egyptian travel agency Hela charging
Palestinians $5,000 per person to exit
Gaza within 1 to 2 weeks this is more
than four times the average annual
salary in Gaza this man says he had to
pay a Hela employee an extra $300 to get
his family on the evacuation list we've
hidden his
identity they weren't letting anyone in
if you wanted to go in you had to pay to
be lay so then you could pay the
$5,000 the fee was $5,000 for an adult
and $25,000 for a child for Palestinian
passport holders he is one of 10 people
who told us they made extra payments of
up to $4,000 to Hela employees to get
their families evacuated but it seems
the best connected in Gaza can leave
without paying at all we found the names
of Palestinian citizens on an evacuation
list meant for Egyptians one of them
told us they were helped to get on the
list by someone with political
connections neither Hela nor the
Egyptian foreign Ministry responded to
our
questions in Gaza time is running out

Schumer has called for new elections in
Israel saying the Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is a major obstacle
to peace and risked making Israel a
pariah Senator Schumer said it was a
grave mistake for Israel to reject a
two-state solution the fourth major
obstacle to peace is Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu who has all too frequently
bowed to the demands of extremists like
minister smotri and Ben gavier and the
settlers in the West Bank now this comes
after the Israeli military said it plans
to move nearly 1 and a half million
displaced Palestinians in Rafa to what
it described as humanitarian islands in
the middle of the Gaza Strip Aid
agencies have insisted that safely
moving such a large number of people in
a war zone would be almost impossible
and an assault on Rafa could prove
disastrous Merlin Tomas from verifi has
been looking at where Israel might try
to move the people from Rafa the Israeli
Army has said it plans to move
Palestinians out of the city of Rafa in
southern Gaza to what it describes as
humanitarian Islands it comes ahead of a
planned military offensive in Rafa and
Rafa is at the southern border with
Egypt over a million displaced
Palestinians are currently Sheltering
there after being forced to leave their
homes because of the Israeli offensive
elsewhere and this is a image from
before in December look at this road and
this area and this is one from late
February and you can see just how many
people are there tents are everywhere
even on roads so where will people go
from Rafa we don't know the Israeli
statement doesn't specify exactly where
but there are already questions of where
in the rest of Gaza has the
infrastructure and buildings still
intact to shelter people coming from
Rafa take a look at this map this is the
Gaza Strip
and this is a map of all of the areas
that have been damaged that's the red
patches that you can see those are areas
that have been damaged or destroyed
since the beginning of the war after all
the people who came to Rafa came because
they were seeing much more intense
bombing in the rest of Gaza uh one of
the most heavily affected areas is carun
it's a city in southern Gaza some 7
kmers North of Rafa this is a satellite
image from December and this is from
February and you can see how some of
those neighborhoods have been completely
flattened there and
again is in central Gaza again this is
from
October and this is from March and you
can see just how extensive that damage
is and getting anywhere in Gaza is a
huge challenge there's only one main
road from the south to the north that's
fully operational right now and that's
being used to transport Aid it's the
coastal Road here this orange one called
alash road so in order to move over a
million people out of Rafa safe routes
will likely have to be created Israeli
military spokesperson Daniel hagari has
said this planned evacuation of
Palestinians to so-called humanitarian
Islands would be carried out in
coordination with International actors
but last night US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin has said he's not seen
any details of an evacuation plan and
any evacuation of over a million people
will take time but the plans for how
exactly that will happen is
unclear that was Merlin Thomas from uh
BBC verify and just uh backing up what
she's saying we just had a statement
from the white house uh saying that they
cannot confirm whether Israel has plans
to relocate people out of Rafa uh let's
speak to Al benari senior fellow at the
Jerusalem Institute for strategy and
security hello to you thank you for
joining us here on BBC News um so plans
although this has been announced this
plan for humanitarian Islands moving
what more than a million people
potentially from uh from Rafa how
logistically uh could that happen in
effectively a war
zone first of all good afternoon and
good evening um I would say it's a huge
logistical
undertaking we are talking about at
least two major areas one would be
pushing the uh the civilians in the Raa
area towards the uh the coast and up
north a bit to the north towards the
southern part of central Gaza which is
still an open area that's one
possibility for major effort the other
is that we've been having
consistent um I would say reporting
about
Egypt creating a humanitarian area just
on the border of Rafa in the Egyptian
area so this would be these would be two
major areas now having said that one
must realize that the very acts of
establishing an infrastructure which
includes tents uh sewage running water
some kind of public facilities for
healthare for government and so on is
something that will take months to carry
out well that's interest that's
interesting that you bring up the the
matter of timing because as you say with
that amount of people and those amount
of logistics that will take
time that's right and and obviously
certainly in the Gaza area the idea of
the one to be there and control all the
U establishment of the infrastructure
now if I may another little comment this
is as you said before there are no
actual plans that have been uh published
or disseminated to the general public
but it does fit what have been we we in
Israel have been told by the IDF
that the whole campaign will take months
to take to complete people are talking
about 2025 perhaps
2026 so this effort it will take a long
while but it does fit with the overall
idea of the IDF campaign in G and what
do you make to the statement by the
White House that we just uh talked about
there with the fact that they are saying
they have no idea of the plans that they
are not aware of these plans um it does
rather seem that there has been in more
pressure from uh the the White House
Administration to try and find out what
is going on what Israel's plans are but
clearly um Israel not sharing them at at
this uh stage I I agree completely with
the idea that uh uh B Benjamin Netanyahu
is completely beholden because of the
structure of his coalition to the
radicals smotri and uh Ben and and
others and so on and and uh knowing BB
at least according to his track record
he's holding all the cards very close to
his heart and in a sense based again on
uh
presidents uh he will perhaps wait for
even greater American pressure being put
on Israel and coming out with certain
plans we've seen this time and again
during this campaign where the US would
say uh more human Arian Aid R netan
prevaricates and finally if you like
capitulates and so on the very fact uh
one must understand that the Israel the
idef is quite a porous institution in
Israel and so we are getting various
media reports about this possibility of
these humanitarian Islands any concrete
plans I don't have any idea myself um
one of one of the objectives clearly of
the IDF or the main objectives is to uh
get rid of any Hamas operatives I just
wonder when you potentially are moving
more than a million people from one area
to another how do you separate how do
you identify those Hamas operatives um
how would they go about doing that
logistically this would be uh this was
this this is one of the things that may
take time so if the IDF creates various
kinds of check points roadblocks and so
on they will have to check each and
every individual now the big there are
two big worries from the point of view
of the IDM with the Hamas operatives in
indeed seeping into these humanitarian
Islands that's one that is uh Hamas
operatives on the other hand the IDF is
very worried that the Hamas May
potentially start to control these uh
humanitarian Islands instead for example
dominating or controlling uh all the
access to uh to food medicine and so on
just just as it is has done and is doing
in Gaza one more point which may
interest uh International audience is
that we're hearing I would say the last
month or so various suggestions about
creating a governmental or a military
government the same kind of government
through which Israel uh occupied and
controlled the West Bank and Gaza before
the withdrawal 2005 and before the Oslo
Accords that is in every one of these
humanitarian islands and perhaps in
other parts of Gaza you would have a
military governor and an apparatus under
him we'll have to leave it there it's
really good to talk to you really
appreciate your time thank you thank you
very much",20240314
VTKV9_25ihM,Israeli military says it will move displaced civilians in Gaza to ‘humanitarian islands’ | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israeli military says it will move displaced civilians in Gaza to ‘humanitarian islands’  BBC News.jpg,"Mana Foster here in Jerusalem now Israel
has said that it plans to move displaced
Palestinians from Rafa at the southern
tip of the Gaza Strip into what it's
calling humanitarian islands in the
central strip ahead of any military
ground offensive that would happen in
rafan this has been reported this
morning by the Associated Press not a
huge amount of detail of what those
humanitarian Islands would look like or
how exactly they would work but rear
Admiral Daniel hagari has quoted as
saying that they would have temporary
housing and they would have aid for
something like 1.4 million Palestinians
who are currently in Rafa at the moment
as I say it's right at the very southern
end of the Gaza Strip it's where more
than half of the population is now
Sheltering and it's a place where Israel
has said that it needs to carry out a
military ground offensive because it
says that in order to achieve its stated
aim of fully removing Hamas from Gaza
the only way to do that is to Target
hamas's remaining surviving leadership
they are believed to be in and among
those civilians who are Sheltering in
Rafa now now of course this remains a an
operation which has questions attached
to it certainly the use of the word
islands is an interesting one because
the central part of the Gaza Strip uh
has been left severely damaged by months
of Israeli ground and air attacks people
who live there have left their homes
they'd be going back to those areas but
of course the buildings that they were
living in many of them are not left
standing and are not habitable anymore
which is why you see down in Rafa at
those thousands and thousands of tents
that people are living in the flow and
supply of Aid is very limited of course
Rafer is the the main route by which Aid
gets into Gaza at the moment by Road and
there's continuing pressure on Israel as
well to try and actually increase the
amount of humanitarian Aid that's going
in now on those humanitarian Islands the
US Secretary of State Anthony blinken
has said that he has yet to see a plan
or details of a plan from Israel about
how they would protect civilians during
a military ground offensive in Rafa but
he also said that it was important to
see a plan to make sure that civilians
were moved out of Harm's Way and we're
also looking today at the progress we've
been following it uh here on BBC News
over the last couple of days the
progress of what would be the inaugural
ship to use this new Maritime Aid
Corridor that was announced by the EU
last week and has been set up between
Cyprus and Gaza now a Spanish uh ship
the Open Arms run by a charity set off
from Cypress on Tuesday it's towing a
barge with around 200 tons worth of
meals that have been provided by World
Central Kitchen uh important to say
though that when it arrives in Gaza
there are a lot of challenges that it
will face now we know that it is
approaching the coast but in terms of an
actual time scale of when it might
arrive and start Distributing that Aid
World Central Kitchen uh before now have
said they've been reluctant to give a an
official timetable and you can see why
why because there isn't a port or or
proper Jetty or dock or anything like
that on the coast of Gaza at the moment
so what world Central Kitchen have been
arranging actually in Gaza is the
building of this temporary Pier to try
and receive the aid from the ship
actually using in some cases uh rubble
from destroyed buildings to try and
build some sort of structure that this
barge could come up to and then they
could unload the aid now that is the
first problem of course the second issue
that they will face is how when you are
surrounded Ed by so many desperate
people around 300,000 or so believe to
still be in the northern part of the
Gaza Strip how you securely and safely
and fairly as well managed to distribute
that Aid among the people who were so
desperate for it and we've seen Aid
convoys swamped by people in the last
few weeks there was that occasion where
more than a hundred people were killed
around an aid Convoy where IDF soldiers
opened fire they said that they felt
threatened by the crowds we saw some
people actually crushed under the wheels
of the trucks that were carrying the aid
so we know that even as that Maritime
Corridor uh starts to build and more
ships start to come in that those issues
will remain and of course the scale of
the need uh is is not diminishing in
fact it's it's getting greater all the
time and that is why the International
Community say that they are continuing
to put pressure diplomatic pressure on
Israel to allow more and greater volumes
of Aid in",20240314

rnU3mMMqNm0,BBC investigation: Israeli troops accused of beating and humiliating Gaza hospital staff | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\BBC investigation Israeli troops accused of beating and humiliating Gaza hospital staff  BBC News.jpg,"there's been a strong International
response to a BBC investigation
highlighting the ill treatment of
Palestinian medical staff by the Israeli
Defense Forces at a hospital in Gaza
last month our reporting includes
evidence of people being detained beaten
and prevented from carrying out vital
medical duties the foreign secretary
Lord Cameron says the report is very
disturbing and he's called for answers
from the Israelis and the US state
department has also seen the
investigation Israel's says it took over
the NASA Hospital in Khan Yunis last
month believing Hamas Fighters were
based there several Israeli hostages
who've been released say they were held
on the premises Israel maintains any
abuse of detainees is strictly
prohibited well Ola garan is live in
Jerusalem with the very latest for us
now
Ola Clive this was a lengthy detailed
forensic investigation by BBC
journalists carried de over several
weeks the details were checked and
crosschecked they spoke to doctors
nurses pharmacists people who were
displaced and living in the hospital
grounds now allegations that emerged
were very specific and those specific
allegations were put to the Israeli army
they did not reply to the allegations in
specifics they did not make any denial
of the specific allegations of
mistreatment but they told the BBC in
general terms that medical staff at
nassa hospital were not ill treated
during their
operation not for the first time in this
war Israeli soldiers have been filmed
standing over stripped and kneeling
detainees but these are medical staff
detained after the Israeli Army overran
the Nasser Hospital in hanun most are
still being
held for weeks the Medics had witnessed
Israel's Advance as it closed in around
the
hospital the fighting in Han yunas was
fierce thousands of people who' sought
refuge in the grounds fled Under
Fire even a hospital wasn't
safe one nurse was shot inside an
operating theater through a window
another person shot at the main entrance
the hospital was under
siege then on February 15th after giving
warnings Israeli tanks rolled
in
inside utter
chaos patients rushed from collapsing
Wards Israel says it found Hamas weapons
and medication which it says supports
accounts from Israeli hostages that they
were held
here in the idf's own footage you can
see hospital patients detained outside
in their beds and wheelchairs with their
hands zip
tied and this was the treatment for
medical staff at least 49 of them forced
to leave their posts and remove their
surgical clothing Israel says it was
searching for concealed weapons and that
among the 200 arrested at Nasser were
terrorists posing as
Medics Dr Amir auli had remained at
Nasser throughout the siege before
Israel's incursion she risked her life
to save others as people were shot
inside the
grounds later she witnessed what
happened to her fellow
doctors it was t for us to see how the
doctors who bravely stayed at the
hospital despite the dangers were
stripped and beaten their hands were
tied behind them and they were left in
the Sun for
hours Dr Ahmed Sabha is one of very few
Medics to have since been
released he shows the positions they
were forced to adopt for hours and says
they were also
tortured his hand was broken by an
Israeli soldier he says and mule dogs
were set on
him they forced us to kneel down with
our eyes
blindfolded there was a pit in the
ground and we thought they would execute
us and bury us there we said our prayers
but they were just intimidating
us the hospital manager who dealt with
the Israelis during the raid says with
so many staff detained patients
died eight doctors and 15 nurses were
left treating 250 patients you can
imagine the level of care we could give
with no water or electricity in the
hospital at that point during this time
13 patients and injured people
died Israel says any abuse of detainees
is against IDF orders and is strictly
prohibited the BBC investigation into
how Israeli troops treated staff and
patients at Nasser hospital was raised
today in the House of Commons and the
House of Lords the foreign secretary now
calling for answers these are very
disturbing pictures and reports that
have come out from this hospital and we
need to get to the bottom of what
exactly happened and we need answers
from the Israelis about that and and
when we have those then it'll be easier
to comment in Washington too questions
are being asked about the BBC
investigation good afternoon everyone
has the US raised it with
Israel uh I um have only seen the report
I don't know if we have raised it but I
would expect that we would it is the
type of cases that we that we often
raise with them uh to seek more
information and to make clear as we
always have that any detainee should be
treated in strict compliance with
International humanitarian law
the Israeli Army says it operated within
Nasser in a precise and focused Manner
and it provided equipment enabling the
hospital to function and treat patients
but with the war continuing and more
than 40 Medics still detained or missing
the hospital has been closed for
weeks and Alla Lord Cameron he says he
wants answers from the Israeli
government what are the chances of him
getting what he's asking
for well we've been trying to get some
answers ourselves tonight C uh after
that call by Lord Cameron we contacted
the foreign Ministry and the prime
minister's office they had nothing to
say the prime minister's office referred
us back to the Army I think we have to
look at how uh Israel has responded in
the last 5 months to its closest Ally
the United States we've had President
Biden as far back as December
criticizing indiscriminate bombing uh at
the weekend he has spoken again about a
lack a disregard uh for the loss of
innocent lives now Israel has not
changed the conduct of the war in
response to those remarks and I think if
it's not listening to the White House
there is less chance that it will listen
to London the foreign office is saying
it wants accountability and transparency
well Amnesty International said today
that ministers are being naive or
disingenuous if they think that the
Israeli Army can credibly investiga
investigate itself and critics would say
look over the last 5 months there have
been 30,000 plus Palestinians killed in
Gaza the vast majority of whom are women
and children many killed in broad
daylight many crushed to death in the
rubble of their own homes and there has
been no transparency or accountability
for any of that so
far okay Ola thank you for that Ola

have begun marking rabadan the Islamic
month of fasting while Fierce battles
continue between Israeli forces at Hamas
fighters in Gaza Let's cross live to
Jerusalem and join my colleague Anna
Foster
Anna Samantha thank you good morning
welcome to uh Damascus gate in the city
walls here in East Jerusalem where
people uh have begun marking the first
day of Ramadan you can see people moving
around this is one of the places that in
East Jerusalem that Palestinians often
come at this time of year but of course
many
because humanitarian ceasefire could be
reached by the beginning of Ramadan but
that hasn't happened even though
channels of communication still remain
open and this is of course the holiest
month in the Islamic calendar it's where
Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset
normally of course breaking that fast
with an ifar meal at the end of the day
but in Gaza it's going to be a very
different Ramadan this time round the
United Nations have warned of potential
Mass starvation there they say that 25%
of the population are at risk of mass
starvation at the moment and they say
the Hamas ran Health Ministry in Gaza
says that 23 people have died so far of
malnutrition and they say that the
majority of those are children now I
just want to show you these pictures
from Al Moi in eastern Gaza and this was
people last night marking uh trying to
Mark at least as best they could the
beginning of uh Ramadan you can see the
little traditional lanterns there
singing their songs and really doing
what they could to mark this holy time
during a time of
War we forc every Ramadan and we put up
decorations five or six days before it
starts we used to be able to get cheese
and dairy and filled our fridges with
food for the sunset ifar and the sunrise
ofo meals with meat but now we can't
even break our fast with a can of peas
or beans since we can't find any in the
first place with thanks to God even with
our empty bellies we will Fast to
satisfy our
Lord we talked about the fighting still
continuing and the fact that that
humanitarian ceasefire has not been
achieved by now and in fact even just in
the last day or two we've seen the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu responding to
comments found invasion of Rafa right at
the southern end of the strip where more
than a million Palestinians are now
Sheltering and Mr Netanyahu said that
that that Invasion would still happen uh
he didn't give a
Time achieve Israel's stated aim his
stated aim of trying to remove Hamas
fully from Gaza there's also an aid ship
that's uh on the way now again we've
talked in the last few days about
attempts to try and get Aid into Gaza by
sea there's a ship in Cyprus which is
due to inaugurate this new Maritime Aid
Corridor between Cyprus and Gaza which
has been established by by the EU the UK
us and others that ship still in ports
in lanica in Cypress at the moment it's
been loaded over the last few days we
were told it was due to set off over the
weekend but seems to have uh met delays
and is still in Port at the moment but
let's talk a little more about those
attempts to get that badly needed Aid to
civilians in Gaza who need it I'm joined
by Dr
Sarah you for joining us here on BBC
News what's your assessment of the way
that is getting into Gaza at the moment
clearly not enough how could and should
it be more
efficient absolutely we are far from
enough eight so eight agencies estimate
that we would need about 600 trucks a
day to cross into Gaza for sufficient
supplies in February it was about 100
trucks a day so very very far from what
is needed for food medical items but
also shelter items tents tarps and so on
so there is very very high need and
we've seen different attempts now to
meet this need we've seen some air drops
first from the Jordanian Air Force but
now also the American Air Force those
look good yes absolutely and they are
obviously helping but they are very very
small volume if you're comparing it to
what is actually needed so bringing in 8
by C sounds great because that vessel
that's currently in Cyprus is carrying
about 200 tons of materials so that
would be very much needed but it is also
then plagued with the same issues of
onward transport a okay you're docking
that ship somewhere but how is the aid
actually going to reach people and that
is a much larger
issue it's interesting what you were
saying there just little things I
noticed you're saying about things that
look good or sound great but don't
necessarily provide the volume of Aid
needed seemingly the best way to do that
is to go back to the way that things
were before the war and to allow Aid in
by road but just remind us why that
isn't
happening definitely bringing in by road
is the most efficient way of doing this
but at the moment we only have two
border crossings that are open both in
the south of Gaza and they are quite
Limited in what is being let through you
need to have permission to bring Goods
across and for some Goods that
permission is being with help from with
the uh by the Israeli authorities and of
course it's then also a question of
getting it across there's lots of checks
on the goods and then also the
distribution within Gaza has been very
difficult because of course the
infrastructure has been being destroyed
the people are not there Communications
are very very difficult internet
availability in Gaza is quite touch and
go it's not there very often and it is
very very dangerous situation as well we
saw that a little while ago with people
being shot who were receiving aid it is
an extremely difficult environment to
try and distribute Aid in Road would be
best and Road will be the onward
transportation for no matter how we get
eight into Gaza but it is extremely
challenging at the moment
[Music]
we've heard uh world leaders pushing
repeatedly for what they call a
humanitarian ceasefire how would that
change the picture on the ground in
terms of actually getting that Aid
in the ability to travel more freely
within Gaza and to be able to access
areas and not be shot at that will of
course be a huge difference and it also
makes difference to people receiving the
aid if they are able to go towards where
convoys are going without fear of being
at the receiving end of air strikes of
bullets so it would make a huge
difference here to have the ceasefire
also to just be able to access different
areas of Gaza it's been very very
difficult to get anything into the north
of Gaza so that's been a real big worry
for eight agencies the south of Gaza is
also very difficult because so many
people are compacted into a very very
small area so it's quite difficult to
reach them and to make sure that it's
not just a strongest people who are
getting aid but everybody who needs it
can receive it so a ceasefire would help
immens ly to get Aid to people who so
desperately need
it Dr Sarah shling thank you for joining
is appreciate your time here on BBC News
it is a a beautiful morning here in East
Jerusalem very peaceful at the moment
different scenes to some of the videos
we uh started to see circulating on
social media last night inside the old
city there and the uh the the channels
that lead towards the alaxa mosque
compound we saw some scuffles between
security forces and and younger

Foster here in Jerusalem let's take a
look at the latest situation around Gaza
you were seeing there just a moment ago
images of a fresh airdrop of Aid which
has been happening over Gaza this
morning we know now that the the US
military along with the Jordanian Air
Force have been carrying out regular
airdrops of Aid with the parachutes and
the pallets uh heading down to the
people below who so desperately need
them but there is another option to take
aid in which is now starting to come
into play as well and that is the option
of taking Aid into Gaza by SE now the US
Army says one of its military support
ships has actually set off from the US
uh it's set off from the port of
Virginia and it's heading to Gaza to
build a temporary Pier there which would
enable ships to unload aid but that is
expected to take at least 2 months
before it's actually in place and there
is again separately this uh cypriate
ship well it's a Spanish ship in Cyprus
which is loaded and waiting for
clearance to actually head towards Gaza
here's the
latest there's little hope to be found
amid the rubble in Gaza another night of
Israeli strikes has taken its toll
images like this travel around the world
across the Atlantic Israel's main allies
seiz them
too the US President Joe Biden said he
still supported Israel's rights to
defend itself but he cautioned the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu about the extent of the
military operations he was sanctioning
he must he must he must pay more
attention to the innocent lives being
lost as the consequence of the actions
taken he's hurting I my view he's
hurting Israel more than helping Israel
by making the rest of the world it's
contrary to what Israel stands for and I
think it's a big
mistake just two weeks ago Mr Biden was
optimistic a ceasefire deal could be in
place by Ramadan but now with just hours
to go there's no sign of an imminent
breakthrough that means other options to
get Aid into Gaza at scale are still
being sought as the fighting
continues military air drops above the
strip deliver some food but not enough
but that still won't meet the growing
and desperate need this mother can't
find anything in Gaza to help her
child I feed my daughter with water just
so she doesn't die water is not
recommended and it's even forbidden for
a baby of her
age in Cyprus an aid ship is ready to
set sail loaded with supplies the
charity behind it say they're confident
they'll be able to unload them when they
arrive off gaza's beaches in the longer
term a US ship that will build a
temporary peer to do the job has set
sail but the Project's completion date
is still 2 months away
and while it's constructed the pressure
on Israel to get more help to suffering
civilians will continue
Ana well let's head straight to lanica
in Cyprus and speak to our correspondent
Quentin Somerville who is there at
Quentin do we have any idea when this
Aid ship might set
sail local media is reporting that it
will leave some point this afternoon
apparently they're waiting for final
security clearances uh from from Israel
which of course supervises pretty much
all of the aid that that makes its way
into Gaza um the there's about 150 to
200 tons of Aid on board and it has
everything from flour and rice to
pre-prepared meals and water um it's
quite a long journey it's 210 nautical
miles normally that Journey from here in
larica to Gaza would take about 15 hours
but because the pulling that big heavy
barge it might take longer and the the
organizations have involved have said a
number of times the most difficult part
of the journey will be the last mile you
just touched on that in your report
because Landing in Gaza will be very
difficult it doesn't have a functioning
uh port and of course in parts of Gaza
all law no or all Civil Society really
has broken down since Israel's
bombardment and ground Invasion so the
and the need from the people in Gaza is
absolutely desperate so there is always
that danger that when this ship appears
on the horizon and gets closer to Shore
that people will start making their way
towards it will enter the water we've
seen some pictures from World Central
Kitchen which is one of the Charities
involved which seems to show a temporary
Pier being built inside Gaza uh there's
heavy lifting equipment large Boulders
and rocks are being moved towards the
foreshore to to make way for the
preparation for when this ship finally
gets underway and starts that
Journey
and Quenton you were saying this is the
the first ship it's got an amount of Aid
on board but when we look at the air
drops the sea Corridor that's due to
open will that actually fill the the
void that's being left by far fewer
Trucks Than would normally pass into gar
are doing so since the War
Began not by a long shot there is a very
quick and effective way of getting Aid
into Gaza and that's by truck and that's
by Road two entry points in southern
Gaza one from Egypt and one from Israel
that system isn't functioning properly
you might even say it's not fit for
purpose uh certainly the British
government and other governments have
been pressurizing Israel for months now
to let more trucks in there it's just
over 100 trucks a day that are getting
in before the war Anna it was over 420
trucks a day the need Clearly Now is
much greater that would be the quickest
easiest mechanism but there's a lot of
resistance and very little movement from
Israel on that front so these very
complicated very intensive efforts are
going on instead Maritime corridors and
air drops and they are they're a
dropping the ocean in terms of gaza's
need because we we we keep hearing the
uh how dire the situation is in Gaza and
it gets worse every single day but it
should come as no surprise to anyone the
UN has been warning for months that that
strangulation of humanitarian Aid by
truck into Gaza would have catastrophic
consequences and we seem to see those
those consequences seem to be coming to
realization now",20240310
kA5CFjEbbuI,Gaza aid ship expected to set sail from Cyprus | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza aid ship expected to set sail from Cyprus  BBC News.jpg,"start with the war in Gaza and a ship
carrying humanitarian Aid is expected to
set sail to the territory from Cyprus
this weekend it's part of a planned
Maritime Aid Corridor it's a joint
operation between the EU us UK and
United Arab Emirates aiming to bring
supplies from Cypress to the coast of
Gaza the UN says a quarter of gaza's
population is on the brink of famine and
children there are starving to death
organizers hope the plan could allow
additional Aid to be brought in in but
they contined to press Israel to allow
more deliveries by Road these are the
latest pictures from lanica in Cyprus as
you can see Aid is being loaded onto a
ship which is due to depart in a couple
of
hours the European Union's ambassador to
the US told the BBC a little more about
the plans for the maritime Corridor
hopefully the p uh the pilot the first
try to to to get Aid already happened
over the weekend but uh it it takes some
time to make sure that uh it's not only
once in a once in a time but it's a
sustainable way to provide aid for the
for the people in in Gaza and Palestine
to make sure that we alleviate ease the
situation in in the region Cyprus for a
long time have been a a part on on the
way uh to uh to to the region so
hopefully this could really help because
five of the EU member states is is on
board and uh and we see it as the
possibility to to increase fre the aid
and to have a possibility to provide it
as soon as possible here's Pentagon
spokesperson Patrick Ryder importantly
there will be no US forces on the ground
in Gaza finally in terms of timing we're
working to set this up as quickly as
possible but we expect that it will take
several weeks to plan and execute once
operational the actual amount of Aid
delivered will depend on many variables
and will likely scale Over time however
we expect that deliveries via jots could
provide more than 2 million meals to the
citizens of Gaza per day for the latest
on the maritime Aid corridors I spoke to
our Middle East correspondent W Davis in
Jerusalem of course there are several
possible routes to get Aid into Gaza
where there is a huge humanitarian
crisis uh children dying from
malnutrition a real risk of famine
according to the UN 300,000 people
particularly in Northern Gaza without
any real adequate food or Aid some
trucks are getting in clearly not enough
so uh the U EU uh the UAE and other
organizations have come up with this
plan for a sort of a maritime Corridor
and this would entail a ship leaving
Cyprus today car towing a barge and on
that barge would be around we understand
200 tons of Aid problem is that when it
gets to Gaza there's no port in Gaza
there's a war going on there's no
obvious way to safely uh remove and then
distribute all of that Aid and it's a
real logistical nightmare we've been
asking questions but haven't really had
any satisfactory answers this is a test
run this weekend if it works and it's a
big if I think then that will become a
regular route for aid from Cyprus
towards Gaza of course we then got the
separate Joe Biden plan to build a
temporary Port facility off the coast of
Gaza uh that would be built by American
Army Engineers but critically no
American boots on the uh military boots
on the ground but that's two months away
at the very least all the while the aid
agencies is saying look the best way to
get Aid into Gaza is through Israel uh
let's try and persuade the Israelis and
I know Lord Cameron the UK foreign
secretary has been talking to the
Israelis about opening up the port of
ashod that is just to the north of Gaza
it's a huge container Port it's only
half an hour 40 minutes away from the
eres Crossing into Gaza and that would
be uh the aid agencies in particular say
a much more practical way of getting
badly needed Aid into Gaza meanwhile
while that's not happen happening while
there's a disagreement between the
Israelis and various agencies and there
is no ceasefire this Maritime Corridor
is the favored method of hopefully
getting Aid into Gaza although it
probably won't be enough and what the
are the Israelis saying about um their
military campaign and the latest from
there it's interesting you know this
ceasefire that everybody had hoped would
be in place this weekend simply hasn't
happened the Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his
priority
uh a couple of days ago at a military
graduation ceremony he said that Israel
will continue its military operation in
southern Gaza not to do that would be to
admit defeat despite the international
pressure Mr Netanyahu acknowledged the
level of pressure he's coming under to
to agree to to a cease fire to allow
more Aid in but I think reading between
the lines for for Mr Netanyahu his
priority is this as he would see it this
unfinished military business in Gaza and
what more of any hopes of ceasefire
talks with Ramadan approaching now just
hours
away yeah that that's a really good
question I think they haven't given up
on that Hamas have left Cairo now but
the Qatari and Egyptian mediators are
ready to to talk to Hamas and the
Israelis indirectly hopefully get them
back around the table and agree to a a
40-day Seas fire that's the this Paris
framework uh if that doesn't happen the
war continues if it happens and there
are significant obstacles to allowing it
to happen but if it happens then of
course one of the big beneficiaries
would be more Aid officially to a to get
into Gaza uh through roads through
Israel which is a much more effective
and efficient way of getting Aid to the
people who need it",20240309

night he confirmed that he has ordered

it would ensure a massive increase in
aid for Palestinians now that Aid is
likely to go through Cyprus so the
details we still don't have in full but
we are expecting some sort of port to be
built into Gaza and that will be fed
into Gaza from Cyprus so that is what we
are looking at at the moment but we've
had confirmation that the UK is going to
be part of that operation that President

confirmed that he had ordered the US
military to build that temporary Pier
off the coast of Gaza he said it would
ensure a massive increase in aid for
Palestinians he warned Israel that
humanitarian assistance should never be
used as a bargaining chip now let's
listen in to Ursula Von line who we are
expecting to speak very shortly in
Cyprus um this is at the moment uh the
cypriate um uh PE uh ministers there who
are just building up to ur veline uh who
is going to speak at this event in
Cyprus um it is all part as you can see
the Cypress Maritime Corridor behind
there so what is happening is it was
announced by Mr Biden that the US was
going to build a temporary Pier off the
coast of Gaza we've then in the last
hour had that tweet from the British
foreign secretary Lord Cameron saying
that the UK is going to be one of those
Partners that's going to build that
Maritime Corridor and now we are seeing
as part of this coordinated effort very
shortly Ursula Von deline is going to
speak in Cyprus but first let's have a
listen to what President Biden said
about building that pier in his State of
the Union Address last night our
protecting and saving innocent lives has
to be a priority as we look to the
Future
the only real solution to the situation
is a two-state solution over
time and I say
this as a lifelong supporter of Israel
my entire career no one has a stronger
record with Israel than I do I challenge
any of you here I'm the only American
president of is Israel in war time but
there is no other path that guarantees
Israel security and democracy there's no
other path that guarantees Palestinian
can live in peace with with peace and
dignity so let us take you back to the
scene live in Cyprus where we are
expecting the EU commission Chief Ursula
Von deline to speak very shortly as you
can see it's all part of this concerted
effort to bring humanitarian Aid in to
Gaza via the sea let us listen into what
the cypriots are saying at the moment
Ursula Madame President you were and I
remember this very well you were a stunt
vocal supporter of the Cyprus Maritime
corridor from the very beginning thank
you for your vision and your leadership
Cyprus is deeply appreciative of the
full support by you personally by the
European commission as well as that of
the United Arab Emirates the United
States and other partners with whom we
have been in intense consultations in
the last weeks and months at the same
time the UN special coordinator and her
important mandate to coordinate increase
and standardize the humanitarian
assistance going into Gaza are also
important elements in making the
corridor a sustained long-term Maritime
Lifeline for the civilians in
Gaza Today We Stand United by a common
Vision to alleviate the humanitarian
tragedy of the civilians in Gaza here at
the Joint rescue coordination Center
which constitutes an integral facility
of the critical infrastructures in the
Amalia plan the other critical facility
in the Amalia capsule is cyclopes the
Center for Land open seas and Port
security established in close
cooperation with the United States here
at the jrcc where we also monitor all
sea traffic going in and out of Cyprus
as we have discuss the number of
migrants from Syria and lebano have been
consistently increasing in recent months
which is deeply concerning for for
Cyprus I look forward to working with
you also on this Ursula and just as we
are doing today to do so in a result
oriented manner
with the president I also discussed this
morning our efforts to resume
negotiations on the Cyprus problem in
line with the relevant un Security
Council resolutions and the European
Union law values and principles a
solution to the Cyprus problem will have
a resounding Regional impact as well we
agree that the European Union can be a
driver for developments on the Cyprus
question and in this regard got we
exchange views on the state of play in
EU turkey relations in which the Cyprus
question is of course a core component
part dear Ula once again it is a great
pleasure to host you and your team to
Cyprus in order to deliver the
implementation of the Amal initiative of
the maritime Corridor for the delivery
of eight in Gaza our journey only just
begins welcome thank you thank you very
much Mr President de Nikas thank you
very much for welcoming me and my team
here to laka and in particular to the
Joint rescue coordination
Center we're here because Palestinians
and in particular those in
Gaza um need all our
help the humanitarian situation in Gaza
is
dire with Innocent Palestinian families
and children desperate for basic
needs and today we are facing a
humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and we
stand by the innocent civilians in
Palestine and this is why Europe is
financing a major humanitarian Aid
effort for
Palestinians in Gaza and in the region
€250 million EUR this year alone but the
key challenge
is to get the aid to the people on the
ground in Gaza and we know the
difficulties faced at the land borders
in GAA be it through the ruer border
crossing or through the Jordan Road
Corridor and that is why today the
Republic of Cyprus the European
commission the United Arab Emirates and
the United States of course supported by
other critical partners announced our
intent to open the maritime Corridor to
deliver much needed additional amounts
of humanitary assistance by
SE together our Nations intent to build
on this model to deliver significant
additional Aid by SE so I am extremely
grateful to you Mr President de Nikos
and to the people of Cyprus for your
leadership in establishing the Amala
initiative it was impressive to see and
to visit the different sites how it um
is evolving supplementing the efforts to
deliver significant additional
Aid we are launching this cypris
Maritime Corridor together Cyprus the
European Union the United Arab Emirates
and the United States and it is your
Relentless work to get this Corridor up
and running despite all all the
challenges and this is truly
inspiring we're now very close to the
opening of the corridor hopefully this
Saturday this Sunday and I'm very glad
to see that an initial pilot operation
will be launched
today thus um it is the partnership that
started it today with the world Central
Kitchen whom I want to thank
wholeheartedly for their viess and so
important
work Mr President inos Cyprus has always
been a bridge between Europe and the
Middle East and thanks to the Amalia
initiative it is proving this historical
role once again
today I welcome the leadership of
President Nikos Christo does by serving
as a mediator for all parties
involved and I would like to commend the
particular effort of the president of
the United Arab Emirates muhamed bin
Zayed to mobilize support to activate
this Corridor by securing the first of
many shipments of goods to the people of
North
Gaza and I call on all the actors who
have a role to play here to help this
cor deliver on its potential one thing
is for sure you can count on us the
maram corridor can make a real diff
difference in the plight of the
Palestinian
people but in parallel our efforts to
provide assistance to Palestinians
through all possible routs of course
will
continue as part of our EU humanitarian
airbridge
operation we have launched 41
flights carrying over
1,800 tons of
a and we will consider consider all
other options including air drops if our
humanitarian Partners on the ground
consider this
effective but our action does not stop
there we must also focus our Attention
our efforts and Outreach on preventing
an ignition of violence across the whole
region I am in regular contact with
President Alisia of Egypt and King
abdalah of
Jordan the situation in the Red Sea is
particularly
concerning with Maritime security
deteriorating day after day and critical
infrastructure damaged due to the
repeated hooti
attacks this is why we have launched the
EU Naval Force operation
aspas and I know that Cyprus has
deployed two naval officers for this
Mission and we really thank you for that
Mr Mr
President with as
speedis Europe is acting to ensure
freedom of navigation in the Red Sea
working alongside with our International
Partners finally a word on the day
after we agree that we must start
preparing today with a viable
perspective and this perspective
continues to lie in the two- State
solution this requires an immediate
humanitarian pause that would lead to a
sustainable
ceasefire it is clear that there can be
no forced displacement of Palestinians
and no blocket of
Gaza but it is equally clear that Gaza
cannot be a safe heaven for terrorists
and that we will keep on calling for the
immediate unconditional release of all
hostages held by
Hamas Europe will continue to help build
momentum for this political
Horizon so thank you again Mr President
de Nikos and I want to thank everyone
working here at the
jrcc you will play an Central role in
the Amala initiative you are already
playing an important and Central role
overall in the region here so something
comes on top of your
responsibility you embody Europe solidar
ity at its best and I know that the
people of Cyprus themselves know what
suffering and loss can feel like and
therefore we in the European Union Stand
By You Mr President in your efforts to
resume the peace talks for the solution
of the Cypress question here too you can
count on us many thanks
thanks thank
you so that is the EU commission
president and the President of Cyprus in
lanica at the launch of what is a
humanitarian Aid corridor from Cyprus
into Gaza now the EU commission Chief
Ursula Vine at the launch of that sea
Corridor said that they hoped it would
be open this Sunday she said that
Palestinians need all our help uh the
humanitarian situ ation is dire and that
people are desperate for basic needs she
said they were facing a humanitarian
catastrophe and she said the key aim was
to get Aid in and she outlined the
difficulties that we know that has been
happening by Road and that is why they
have turned to Cyprus the UK the UAE and
the US and others to bring humanitarian
Aid in by sea she said it would see
significant amounts of Aid being brought
in as I said she said that they hope to
open that this Sunday although a pilot
operation will start today as you heard
she thanked the President of Cyprus and
also the president of the United Arab
Emirates for helping to get this
Maritime Corridor up and running she
called on everyone to help deliver it
saying that it can make a real
difference for Palestinians at the end
she also again called for that
humanitarian pause in the fighting and
eventually a ceasefire she also again re
itated the call for all the hostages
being held to be released the President
of Cyprus who you saw there said that
they were United in the common vision of
bringing Aid into Gaza he added that our
journey was only just beginning let's go
straight to yolan Nell who is our Middle
East correspondent in Jerusalem so
yoland it is all coming together we had
President Biden talking about this port
we then had Lord Cameron the British
foreign secretary saying the UK would be
involved and and now we've got the full
details from the EU commission president
and the President of
Cyprus that's right and actually it's a
couple of months ago that we really
started hearing a lot more from Cyprus
about this proposed uh SE rout to bring
in aids to Gaza and Britain has shown a
lot of interest in that uh Lord Cameron
in particular uh prior to this
announcement by the US what's really new
now is the time frame that's being
brought on this um new kind of emphasis
on the project as a way of hurry in Aid
uh into Gaza and it comes after Lord
Cameron that the foreign secretary had
said that really Israel's allies were
losing patience there have been calls
now for for some weeks for an increase
in the flow of Aid we've got the UN
warning of mass starvation in Gaza so
this looks like a plan now that could be
in place potentially for the start of
the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan and as the are the Israelis as
far as we know going to cooperate with
this ins Cyprus and what role will they
have in checking all of that
Aid well the idea as we understand it is
that there would be a screening process
that could take place uh in Cyprus um
with Israel overseeing that and actually
um we already had a couple of months ago
um one of the Israeli ministers in
Cyprus looking at a test of a screening
process there uh but then we didn't hear
too much more about it so the idea seems
to be that this is coordin ated with the
Israelis um and then the aid is brought
in once it's been screened U into Gaza
there isn't a deep sea port in Gaza so
what we're looking at here is the
construction of some kind of temporary
Pier now it's not been made clear and
the logistics of that or how Aid will be
stored in Gaza how it will be
distributed afterwards um it seems
perhaps private contractors uh the UN
might be involved uh but a lot more
details still to come on this um but
what is clear is there's a lot of
coordination a lot of enthusiasm uh for
this de deal it looks like some kind of
concrete step uh for all these different
players in the region in Europe in the
US uh something they've been looking for
to try to have a positive announcement
really especially after we've had in in
past days um the failure of truce talks
uh in Cairo through Egyptian mediators
with a Hamas delegation to achieve some
kind of breakthrough to have a Tru steel
which would allow um in Ramadan as had
been hoped a big surge Aid going into
Gaza uh in exchange for Israeli hostages
coming out and also Palestinian
prisoners being freed from Israeli jails
those talks will still continue but this
is another initiative that can be taken
in parallel yolan Nel in Jerusalem thank
you very much I know you'll go off to
try and get more details of how this
Corridor will work",20240308

guarantees Israel security and democracy
there's no other path that guarantees
Palestinian can live in peace with PO
with peace and dignity well let's speak
to our Middle East correspondent yolan
Nell who is in Jerusalem so we heard
that warning to Israel that Aid should
never be used as a bargaining chip how
has that message gone down in
Israel well we haven't had an official
response but certainly it's been picked
up as you'd expect by the Israeli media
and that along with a promise by Mr
Biden that Israeli hostages Who Remain
uh in the Gaza Strip will be released
that he is dedicating his efforts to
working on that and we know that were of
course um some Israeli hostage uh
families and former Israeli hostages uh
in the chamber where Mr Biden uh was
speaking now a lot of focus here is on
that plan for a new uh temporary uh port
for Gaza a temporary Causeway that would
be built to allow uh Supply ships
bringing Aid um to get close to Gaza at
the moment it doesn't have any kind of
deep sea port um a lot more explanation
of what exactly that that means um
because there was a briefing given by
the White House in advance of the State
of the Union Address um it appears that
a ships will uh go to Cyprus um and
there Israeli Security checks will be
carried out and then um there will be uh
us warships uh or US military personnel
involved offshore in the overseeing uh
proceedings but there will be no us uh
military boots on the ground in Gaza
involved in the construction of this
Causeway um we understand that it could
take a month or two to complete um and
of course that won't address then the
immediate need uh to get Aid into Gaza
but it does look like President Biden
really wanted to have some kind of a
concrete step to show that US military
action was being taken amid a lot of
frustration with its close Ally Israel
um it's been calling for weeks now to
increase the flow of Aid going into Gaza
yeah do you think the fact that they
having to build this pier is a sign that
Benjamin Netanyahu isn't listening to
the us about getting more Aid in on the
ground well the calls from the US and uh
from un agencies have been for Israel to
open up uh more border crossings uh into
the Gaza Strip to allow Aid to get
through um and to allow Aid distribution
to take place more effectively of course
what we've seen is um the US and uh
Jordan other countries resorting to Aid
drops uh in recent days which is not a
very effective way of getting Aid to
those who need it the most um I mean is
Isel does have its own container Port uh
ashod just about a 40-minute drive uh to
the north of the Gaza Strip there's been
a lot of resistance in Israel to using
its facilities to bring in Aid and so
Aid at the moment is mostly going in um
via Egypt it's flown in there and comes
in through the crossings uh on the in
the south of the Gaza Strip yanel in
Jerusalem thank you very much",20240308

they don't understand is the houis over
the past nine years they've developed
the capacity to build their own missiles
locally in addition to receiving

Iran through various routes to the h so
they're not going to run out of their

they're actually increasing their

says anyway it's not holding all of the

they can but it's also very clear that
there is immense intern National
pressure growing pressure because there
are 30,000 Palestinians who have been
killed and there are increasing fears
about starvation in Gaza and here in
Israel hostage families have been
telling us that if the government does

in Gaza where it's been reported that
the US has carried out its first airdrop
of aid for the territory thousands of
meals have been parachuted in by three
military planes that follows a pledge on
Friday by President Biden meanwhile
Egyptian sources say talks on trying to
secure a ceasefire in Gaza are due to
resume in Cairo on Sunday it's
understood there has been some progress
but the violence has been continuing at
least 13 Palestinians including a medic
are reported to have been killed by an
Israeli air strike near a hospital and a
United Nations team visiting gaza's
biggest hospital has found that many
Palestinians who were injured as lorries
were delivering Aid on Thursday were
wounded by gunshots American officials
have confirmed that the US military has
carried out its first airdrop of
humanitarian Aid into Gaza let's take a
look at these pictures here you can see
US military planes flying over Dar Al
Bala in the the central Gaza Strip
American officials say over 35,000 amals
were dropped by Parachute it comes after
a promise by President Biden on Friday
following the deaths of 112 Palestinians
during a rush on an aid Convoy on
Thursday let's get more on this now from
our Washington correspondent will Vernon
will good to see you good morning to you
there in DC tell us more about what US
officials have been
saying that's right we received the
statement um from the US military saying
that this first aird drop has been
carried out that was done uh in
coordination together uh with the
Jordanian Air Force uh some C130
aircraft uh dropping over 38,000 meals
along the coastline of Gaza uh say the
US military now this will not be the
first this will be part of an ongoing
Mission there's expected uh to be many
of these us officials say Israel is
supportive of the mission and it's being
carefully planned uh to ensure that
there aren't any civilian casualties on
the ground because this is a a very
complex this is in fact an actually
actually a very inefficient uh way of
delivering Aid getting Aid in by trucks
via land routes is actually um much more
much simpler and much more efficient uh
so I think the fact that the US has
opted for this method not only uh shows
how serious the humanitarian crisis is
in Gaza uh but it also uh I think shows
that uh the US wants to send a message
that more aid needs to get in by land
and indeed in that statement from the US
military today it says these air drops
are part of a sustained effort to get
more Aid into Gaza including by
expanding the flow of Aid through land
corridors and routs will I want to pick
up on what you mentioned there this this
slight nuanced shift in the US position
because America has been supportive
generally speaking of Israeli activity
but this is a change in tone and this
promised by President Biden on Friday
was a shift in that us position what's
the trajectory of this do you
think that's right I mean we've we've
been hearing a kind of increasing tone
of exasperation I think from President
Biden from other uh White House
officials in recent weeks um recently
President Biden said he thought uh
Israel's military operation in Gaza was
over the top uh recently he said that uh
the the rougher uh Israel's plans to
launch an offense into the gazen city of
Rafa uh shouldn't go ahead unless
careful planning uh took place to ensure
that no civilian casualties uh that
there were no civilian casualties and
also yesterday during President Biden's
meeting with the Italian Prime Minister
we saw him say that only a handful of
Aid trucks were getting in uh whereas it
should be you know many more than much
more than that uh so I think you know
there has been uh there has been some
frustration uh but also remember it is
an election year here a particularly
closely thought uh fought uh election
campaign particularly polarizing at
least it's shaping up to be that way and
Israel Gaza is becoming an election
issue here and President Biden has to
walk a very tricky tight rope on the one
hand he has to ensure that the US is is
supporting a key Ally Israel on the
other hand he has to uh make sure he's
not alienating progressives in his own
party uh also putting off traditional
voters and we saw that a few days ago uh
in the state of Michigan when a Democrat
primary election was held there over
100,000 people in Michigan actually
voted uncommitted so most of those were
a protest vote against President Biden
for uh his support of Israel of course
the US uh hasn't uh called for an
immediate ceasefire like many people uh
many of those voters in Michigan for
example uh would like President Biden to
so that I think was um a stark warning
and a concern

Israel is mounting over the deaths of
more than 100 Palestinians Desperately
Seeking aid from a rare Convoy in Gaza
City Israel admits its soldiers had
opened fire saying they were concerned
about security but that most of the
deaths happened in an ensuing Crush some
Palestinians say Israeli troops fired
directly at them France said that firing
on civilians trying to access food is
unjustifiable the UN Secretary General
Antonio guttera said he was shocked to
learn that a 100 people have been killed
he's called for an independent
investigation to identify those
responsible President Biden called the
incident tragic and alarming he also
expressed concern that efforts to broker
a temporary ceasefire between Israel and
Hamas may now be in Jeopardy live now to
Jerusalem and our Middle East
correspondent yoland Nell yoland what
more can you tell us about what happened
around this Aid
[Music]
Convoy well despite the very different
accounts we're getting from the Israelis
and Palestinians some facts are clear
thousands of people had turned out um
they've been waiting for several hours
overnight um in Gaza City on this
Coastal Road this is after a period
where the UN said there were about 3
weeks when no International Aid was
arriving into the north of the Gaza
Strip we were told by witnesses that
people had come from from different
parts of the north hoping to get a sack
flower to take home uh for their family
and they' sat waiting for hours there
were then these very chaotic scenes uh
when a convoy of some 30 lorries arrived
it was being run by private contractors
with the Israeli military overseeing the
operation and there's an Israeli
checkpoint uh just to the South here now
what the Palestinian Witnesses say what
Palestinian Health officials say is that
they saw uh soldiers opening fire and
people um suffered gunshot wounds
particular to their upper bodies that
there were also people who were run over
by the aid lorries in the chaotic scenes
then uh you have the Israeli military
saying that actually most of those
killed uh were killed in a stampede um
that there were attempts to loot the aid
uh from the lorries and and that people
then were caught up in a crush some
people were being run over by the
lorries they say that then uh soldiers
did fire some warning shots to try to
drive back the crowd uh with indications
that people were getting too close to an
Israeli military position and youan
because of the very sensitive uh
perception of Aid getting into the Gaza
Strip and how that plays into the
negotiations currently the concern is
that it will simply derail
them indeed and that's what one Hamas
official has said that there is a risk
of that uh these Talks Of course taking
place in Qatar at the moment with an
Israeli delegation and a Hamas
delegation there and what has been
proposed we understand is a 6 week truce
um during that time you would have uh
some 40 Israeli hostages released for
about 10 times as many Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails and a big
surge in the amount of Aid uh going into
Gaza now President Biden when he was
asked about this by journalists did
acknowledge um that yesterday's incident
could really complicate those talks and
we understand from the White House that
he spoke uh to the cateres to the
Egyptians who are acting as mediators
here uh to try to get an update on
what's going on with those negotiations",20240301

killed while waiting for food Aid in
Gaza City these images are from that
attack in the southwest of the city a
journalist told the BBC that Israeli
tanks opened fire on a crowd who'd come
to collect supplies a large number of
people had been gathered waiting for
food when the incident happened the
Israeli military issued these aerial
pictures of the incident it says dozens
of garans were crushed and trampled as
they surrounded the aid trucks
separately an Israeli Source confirmed
its troops had fired after feeling
threatened by the crowds near the aid
Point let's have a listen to that
statement from the Israeli Prime
Minister's office the trucks were
overwhelmed and the people driving the
trucks which were Garen
uh Garen civilian drivers uh plowed
into um the crowds of people uh
ultimately killing my understanding is
tens of
people now let's have a listen to an
account from a Palestinian who was
there after they stopped shooting we
went back to get our Aid by the time I
got flour and some canned goods and took
it down from the truck they shot at us
they shot me and the truck driver left
and ran over my leg I lost my
nerves if you want to get us Aid this
way then you might as well not bring
anything what has already happened to us
is more than enough we went to get flour
for children we have been eating animal
feed for 2 months and even that ran out
what are we supposed to do where are we
supposed to
go now this all comes as we've received
the latest figures on the numbers of
Palestinians killed in Gaza since
October now more than 30,000 people have
been killed in the territory according
to figures from the Hamas run Health
Ministry there now this graph from the
BBC verify team charts the rising number
of people killed in Gaza from Israeli
strikes which were sparked by the Hamas
attacks on Southern Israel on the 7th of
October now it shows the majority of
those killed in Gaza are women and
children and the number of children
killed so far stands at
21,000 well for more on all of the day's
developments we can go straight to
Jerusalem and join our diplomatic
correspondent Paul Adams who is there
for us Paul tell us more first of all
about what we know happened when those
Palestinians were gathering to receive
Food
Aid well one thing I can tell you
Virginia is that that account that you
heard that brief account from an Israeli
spokesman doesn't really begin to
describe what actually happened nor by
the way were these people waiting for
food Aid this was a convoy driving into
the into Gaza City at 4:00 a.m. in the
dark it had just passed an Israeli
checkpoint when uh
crowds began to descend on the trucks in
scenes that we have seen already many
times
before remember that the situation in
the northern part of the Gaza Strip is
by far the worst people are utterly
desperate any trucks that that arrive
there with Aid and very very few do
immediately get mobbed now this was a
convoy of anywhere between 18 and 30
trucks it had passed through the
checkpoint the Israeli checkpoint and at
some point while the crowds were
swarming onto the truck TR s some of
those people approached to within around
70 M of the Israeli checkpoint the
soldiers there felt they that they were
in some danger they fired shots in the
air according to the IDF and then at the
crowd in what an Israeli military
spokesman described as a limited
response the impression we get having
listened to what the IDF says and heard
from an an eyewitness a Palestinian
eyewitness who was there was that utter
Panic ensued and the pictures that have
been released by the IDF this morning
shot uh from the air at night show the
trucks attempting to move forward while
absolutely covered in people trying to
uh to retrieve Aid with thousands of
people surrounding them and in that
Mayhem it seems a significant number of
people were run over our Palestinian
Source tells us that most of the people
who died we think around 104 were killed
because they were run over by the trucks
not because of the Israeli shooting but
the shooting does seem to have
contributed to the absolute panic I mean
yeah that sounds the circumstances sound
really tragic uh whatever uh we know so
far on what happened Paul and I'm just
reading um on Reuters that a un Aid
Chief has said that they are reped at
the reported killings and injuries
during the transfer of aid supplies in
Gaza City
is there any more reaction that we've
had no I think everyone is still looking
at it trying to figure out exactly what
happened the Israelis you know they're
they're saying you look you need to look
hard at this uh listen to what we're
saying we don't want to have a repeat of
some of the mistakes that they say the
media have made in certain key episodes
in the past all I would say is that
anyone who has access to Twitter can go
uh or X should I say can go on the idf's
uh feed and look at that footage shot in
the dark the early this morning it is
utterly utterly gobsmacking the sheer
size of the crowd the fact that the
trucks are all completely covered with
people trying to retrieve Aid and that
they are moving forward it gives you it
gives me one of the most dramatically
Vivid accounts of the desperation of the
northern Gaza Strip that I have seen so
far and you don't even see anyone's
faces okay Paul Adam thank you so much

Health Ministry in Gaza has announced
that more than 30,000 Palestinians have
been killed in the territory since the
conflict began on October the 7th well
that number equates to about
1.3% of the 2.3 million population there
let's go live now to Jerusalem and our
Middle East correspondent Yulan Nell so
it's quite a an extraordinary toll isn't
it it is indeed and we're hearing from
the Hamas Swan Health Ministry that
there were more than 80 people killed uh
overnight in the Gaza Strip most of
those actually apparently waiting for
Aid uh in Gaza City um when witnesses
there say that there was shelling uh by
Israeli tanks um and still an unclear
picture um from about exactly what has
happened there um but overall now this
really uh Grim Milestone has been uh
passed the uh Health Ministry in Gaza is
really the only official source source
of data that we have for casualty
numbers um and uh it's the one that's
relied on uh by the UN and others and
it's saying that uh the majority of
those who have been killed are women and
children uh since the 7th of October and
also more than 70,000 people have been
injured as well these figures rely on
bodies being brought in uh to hospitals
or seen uh by medical workers so they
can be uh properly registered um but
actually it's thought that real death
toll is going to be much higher than
this because there are several thousand
people who are still considered as being
missing in Gaza many of them buried
under the rubble of buildings that have
been hit by Israeli air strikes now it's
important to say that these figures do
not differentiate between those who are
civilians and and those uh who are uh
Fighters with Hamas or other groups in
Gaza uh when we've asked the Israeli
military uh for comment here it says
that uh some 10,000 people um terrorist
ists are estimated to have been killed
uh during their their operations and
youand tell us about the latest progress
on any on moves towards a
ceasefire well still uh in the
background here we have this big
diplomatic effort going on to try to get
a new longer term truce agreed that
would see more of the Israeli hostages
held by Hamas in Gaza Freed at the same
time and you have an Israeli delegation
a Hamas delegation who are in in katar
katar of course are key mediators here
and the real hope has been um that a new
deal can be agreed in time for the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan which
starts on about the 10th of March um
there's a lot of us involvement here
President Biden has spoken very
optimistically about an agreement being
in place by the start of next week uh
but the other parties involved have
sounded much more cautious there saying
that there are still um big gaps to be
bridged and I suppose one of the the
issues is is if if they do do an
exchange of of prisoners for for
hostages the concern in Israel is always
who they let out um as they saw that one
of the people who they let out in in a
prison exchange before was someone who
then went on to plan the October the 7th
attacks indeed so it's often mentioned
uh by Israelis that um the biggest
prisoner exchange that there ever was
for an Israeli soldier held captive by
Hamas and Gaza saw the release of Yahya
Sina Who is the local uh Hamas leader in
Gaza seen as a mastermind of the 7th of
October attacks um that of course uh
makes it very difficult for people to
accept the notion of uh these these
prisoner swaps and it is thought um that
in exchange for some 40 of the remaining
Israeli hostages held in Gaza that's um
really a minority of them um that we
would have in exchange for that some 400
Palestinian prisoners released from
Israeli jails this is according to the
reports that have been leaked out and
they would indeed uh we're told include
some who have been convicted of serious
uh offenses of terrorism by Israel um
they would be seen as having Israeli
blood on their hands youan n with the
analysis there from Jerusalem thank you

Q54T14yrFDA,Journalists call for access to Gaza in open letter | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Journalists call for access to Gaza in open letter  BBC News.jpg,"now a group of more than 50 broadcast
journalists have sent an open letter to
the embassies of Israel and Egypt
calling for free and unfettered access
to Gaza for foreign media the letter
sent by correspondents and presenters
from the main broadcasting Outlets based
in the UK also appeals for better
protection for journalists already
reporting in the territory 55
journalists have signed the letter
including Sky News is Alex Crawford the
BBC's Jeremy Bowen oligan and fergal
Keane as well as CNN's Christian amanor
well for more on this I'm joined Now by
Alex Crawford who joins us from heral in
Iraq uh she is of course Sky news's
special correspondent and as we've just
been saying is among the signaries of
the letter thank you very much for
joining us especially while you're on
deployment Alex just tell us what the
rationale was behind this letter to
begin with well the main thinking is
that we're all terribly frustrated and
feel we're not really doing um ourselves
um Justice we're not doing the story
Justice and people aren't hearing um
particular information because foreign
journalists aren't on the ground and
this is despite multiple attempts to try
to get access into Gaza since October
the 7th from October the 7th onwards
there have been um groups of people
teams of people media organizations from
all over the world trying to get access
into Gaza and we haven't been able to
and that's definitely compromises what
is probably one of the most important
developing events in um certainly in the
region for many many decades possibly in
the world and will have ramifications
for many years to come Alex you've
traveled the world with your reporting
and you're in Iraq at the moment how
unusual is it in your experience and
through your career to have been unable
to access an area particularly one that
is the center of a major story I think
it's uh Not Unusual that some uh
governments and some regimes will try to
keep you out and that presents uh
definitely a challenge for for
journalists to try and Report accurately
inside but we in the past and even now
we're talking about uh governments or
authorities or regimes that do not
describe them as themselves as
democracies which Israel does describe
itself as Israel is proud proud of um
boasting that it is uh a liberal
democracy with an open media and yet it
is deliberately blocking uh journalists
from all over the world from getting
into Gaza that is the key difference I
mean in the past journalists like myself
have had to use boats to get into
Myanmar have had to use uh all sorts of
of of tactics to try to get inside
closed off areas and we've Managed IT
this one is is monumentally difficult
because it is an extremely small area
that we're talking about there are only
two border points and it is really
really very massively locked down by
Israel uh and also by Egypt and
seriously most governments around the
world should be worried about that and I
was just reading because you wrote a
Blog didn't you for the Sky News website
that you said that last month the
Foreign Press Association attempted to
persuade the Israeli high court to allow
journalists in but it was refused for
security concerns tell us more about
what they said to you after that ruling
then well it was the Supreme Court of of
Israel and it was brought by the Foreign
Press Association as I said there have
been multiple attempts by not only the
big media organizations around the world
but also individuals individual
journalists um uh BBC Sky ITN ITV all
signed Channel 4 all signed a letter in
November as well none of which which
have had any impact or made a jot of
difference the Supreme Court said the
that um they couldn't um they they
wouldn't lift the restrictions imposed
by the IDF and the IDF argued that this
was because journalists could be put at
risk in Wartime and they could endanger
Soldiers by reporting on troop positions
and that it's too dangerous for Israeli
Personnel to be present at the border to
facilitate press entry into Gaza well of
course all those um arguments uh you
could be posed in any war and and and
sometimes they are and usually they're
buy countries or regimes or authorities
who definitely do not want journalists
in and I would argue along with um the
more than 50 other journalists and they
are the top most well-known journalists
in Britain Jeremy Bowen a number of
presenters like Rita chakrabati Clive
mey Michelle hus as well as Tom bradby
on ITN uh all the key um War
correspondents on ITN Emma Murphy Johnny
Irvine Channel 4 Lindsay Hilson Matt Fry
Krishna and Guru Murthy there are a list
of the top most senior journalists
who've been respected and proved their
credentials the world over for many
years who've all become very worried
about the lack of access into Gaza and
what that means on telling uh an
unfolding event and tell it accurately
accurately there are some very serious
allegations against Israel allegations
of war crimes allegations of genocide
which was presented in before the the
icj the international court of justice
now until we get proper independent um
impartial foreign journalists on the
ground there it's going to be very
difficult to disprove or prove those
allegations so we would argue it's in
Israel's interest as well to allow the
free movement of of independent
journalists and of course the argument
is that there are Palestinian
journalists in there uh that's true but
on in every big story anywhere even if
you're covering the G8 Summit or the
Olympics or party conferences in Britain
you would send a a whole group of
journalists to rotate through to refresh
to re-energize to recharge those pal
Palestinian journalists inside um many
of whom have lost their homes are
scrabbling on a day-to-day basis to to
get food and water to just stay alive uh
need refreshing and we need more input
from outside indeed I wanted to to ask
you that uh before we end this interview
because yesterday about 24 hours ago in
fact rushi Abu Alou was sitting next to
me here in the studio um sharing his you
know challenges uh because it's a
personal tragedy um but he wanted to
stay as long as he could to bring that
story to us from the ground but let's
not forget the huge risks that the uh
journalists who remain in Gaza currently
face there are a high there is an
extremely high and very worrying
attrition rate of journalists inside
Gaza and that is also something that
needs investigating with many many
claims and a large amount of evidence
suggesting that they have been targeted
specifically and their families because
they're journalists now until we get
access into Gaza we also cannot prove or
disprove those and those suspicions will
continue and it's extremely worrying for
just independent accurate information if
a journalists inside are being uh
accused of not only being biased or
partisan or being coerced by hamus at
the same time as there are also
accusations that they're being targeted
by the Israeli military there needs to
be uh immediate sort of independent
access to uh an unfettered access to
foreign journalists to either put these
allegations to bed or prove them Alex

Hamas has received a draft proposal from
Gaza Tru talks in Paris which includes a
40-day Paws in all military operations
and the exchange of Palestinian
prisoners for Israeli hostile is at the
ratio of 10 to1 here's the US president
speaking late on
Monday you give us a of when you will
start sir well I hope by the the
beginning of the weekend I mean the end
of the weekend at least my my my
National Security advisor tells me that
we're close we're close it's not done
yet and My Hope Is by next Monday we'll
have a ceasefire well in the hours after
that statement President Biden appeared
on Late Night with Seth MERS on NBC
where he made those comments about
Israel agreeing in principle not to
engage in military activities in the
Gaza Strip during the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan Mr Biden said such a
commitment would allow the hostages
being held by Hamas to be released as we
said negotiations for a temporary
ceasefire continue Israel and amas have
been holding so-called proximity talks
in Kata there are reports that 400
Palestinian prisoners serving sentences
for Terror related crimes could be
exchanged for 40 female and elderly
Israeli hostages the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to
go ahead with an assault on gaza's
Southernmost city of Rafa regardless of
any agreement our Middle East
correspondent yolan Nell is in Jerusalem
and shared this update on what we know
about a possible ceasefire definitely
the most positive comments that we've
had yet those ones from President Biden
although even he said my National
Security tells me advisor tells me we're
close we're not there yet um we know of
course that us negotiators have been
been pushing for some kind of pause for
hostages deal to start before the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan that's
expected to be on about the 10th of
March um and there have been these
important talks have been taking place
in Paris in the past week involving uh
the Israelis also caterie and Egyptian
mediators I have to say the reports we'd
seen in the Israeli media in the past
couple of days were less positive about
the likely outcome of those the US state
department had also been more cautious
about the prospects of a new deal saying
that it depends on Hamas what we're
hearing from the Reuters news agency
this morning is that Hamas officials are
now studying what's being called the
Paris framework um and according to a
source quoted by Reuters who's close to
the talks um that deal includes a 40-day
ceasefire um it would include the
release of Israeli hostages for
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails
at a ratio of 1 to 10 The Source says
and that during um this longer pause um
there would be a big increase in the
amount of Aid going into Gaza something
like 500 Lor loads a day and that there
would also be uh repairs allowed to
hospitals and to bakeries in Gaza yeah
also President Biden appearing on NBC
saying that Israel has agreed in
principle not to carry out Military
activities against Hamas in the Gaza
Strip during Ramadan that's starting in
the next two weeks do you think the fact
that the Muslim holy month is coming is
focusing
Minds
uh definitely and we've had uh Arab
leaders coming out talking about how if
this continues the fighting um during
Ramadan this could be a big inflammation
uh for people around the entire region
so that has been something that uh the
negotiators have been very mindful of uh
during the latest round of talks it's
something that Palestinians in Gaza of
course are really hoping for as well
that there could be some kind of
reprieve from the fighting at that time
uh they could be able to have some uh
some form of a break during Ramadan Sean

response to the October 7th attacks by
Hamas has the highest rate of death of

century most of the deaths from both
events have been civilians but Israel
remains steadfast in its
[Music]
mission
but can Hamas really be eliminated and
with Worldwide calls for an immediate
humanitarian ceasefire what are Israel's
chances of
Victory tensions have grown over the
scope of Israel's military campaign and
the need for a lasting solution this can
only come through a regional approach
that includes a pathway to a Palestinian
state yet prime minister Netanyahu has
openly defied the US with no road map to
peace the conflict has has already
escalated with fears of a wider Middle
East
War despite accusations of breaking
international law and committing
genocide which Israel says are
profoundly distorted Mr Netanyahu
refuses to back
down in its mission to eliminate Hamas
has Israel set itself an unobtainable
[Music]
goal months since the the conflict
erupted Israel whose Army far out strips
hamas's military capabilities is still
facing resistance in
Gaza before October 7th hamas's armed
Wing was thought to have up to 30,000
Fighters the Israel Defense Forces claim
they have killed almost a third of them
and estimates 16,000 Hamas Fighters are
wounded US Agencies think the figure is
lower up to
11,700 and many could return to battle
if those figures are accurate it would
amount to a significant reduction in
capabilities we put them to Hamas which
rejects the figures if what the
occupation says is true how does it
explain the Kasam brigades continuing to
operate with such force and in all areas
of the Gaza Strip it is certain that the
casam briat is able and ready to
continue defending our people in this
war as long as the occupation aggression
on Gaza continues
former Israeli colonal Marie Eis who
once worked as a media adviser for the
PM's liud party gives her assessment of
Israel's military campaign the
commanders have been killed cash a of
weapons have been found that doesn't
mean that we've killed every single
terrorist we are systematically blowing
up the underground Subterranean Terror
system but some military analysts are
more skeptical about the level of damage
to Hamas they could fairly easily
Recruit new Fighters
um so that's probably not the most
important metric that we're looking at
in this the tunnel network is a lot
larger than um than previously estimated
so destroying or neutralizing the
tunnels is uh is is is where you might
describe it as uh um there's still a
long way to go for the Israelis
initially they started off and they were
blowing up the shafts of the tunnel to
try and stop people popping out of them
but because there are so many shafts
linking into the network then that's
relatively futile
so you go down and blow up the whole
tunnel but then that could there could
be um hostages down there so uh it's
really difficult job either way it's a
critical question for Israel Med
is
Hamas is one of two dominant political
groups the other is the more secular fat
which dominates the Palestinian
Authority governing in the West Bank
Hamas won the elections in 2006 ejecting
the PA from Gaza by force the following
year and they have governed there ever
since the PA are seen by many as corrupt
and collaborators in Israeli
occupation under their governance Jewish
settlements in the West Bank deemed
illegal under international law have
drastically increased in numbers
although the PA has publicly condemned
this it has still fueled anger among
Palestinians backing for Hamas seems to
be growing according to a poll of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
from late
2023 it suggests support for Hamas
doubled during the fourth quarter of
2023 from 22% to 43% still less than
half of Palestinians but outstripping
their longtime Rivals fat the rise in
support for Hamas comes almost entirely
from participants in the West Bank 72%
of respondents overall agree with Hamas
decision to launch an offensive on
October
7th and the poll suggests 63% support
armed struggle as the best means of
ending Israeli occupation again the
majority of this support comes from
participants in the West
Bank the polling organization say that
support for Hamas usually Rises
temporarily during or immediately after
a war academic and critic of Israel Dr
Brahim frat gives his view of
Palestinian support for Hamas they are
living with no hope with no future and
Hamas gave them the the alternative
which is through confrontation and
through Revolution that would bring to
them a different approach on that level
so Hamas enjoys the largest support not
only in Palestine but in the entire Arab
and Muslim world we don't have data to
verify support for Hamas regionally but
there are also many Arabs who oppose
them hundreds of Palestinian activists
took part in a rare online event at the
start of 2022 criticizing Hamas
governance of the Gaza STP where under
Israeli blockade people were already
living under dire conditions and there
was high unemployment
[Music]
Hamas says it's engaged an armed
struggle against Israel to end
occupation and create a Palestinian
State they are considered a terrorist
group by much of the West with many
pointing out its leaders still call for
Israel's destruction but a resistance
movement in parts of the Arab W Hamas
agenda is limited within the the
Palestinian agenda so it doesn't have a
global message that uh Advocates
religion and Islam for the world or for
other countries so it's a it's a
National Liberation movement that limits
its objectives its agenda to the end of
occupation and establishment of a
Palestinian State they started carrying
out attacks mostly targeting Israeli
soldiers in
1989 but after 29 Palestinian
worshippers were killed by an Israeli
settler in 1994 at Al ibrahimi mosque
also known as the cave of Patriarchs
Hamas upped the violence starting a
campaign of suicide attacks targeting
civilians over the following three
decades the levels of violence from both
sides got progressively
worse and the failure of peace talks
which had once looked promising
continued to have a defining impact
there is another context to 7 of October
and again none of this is to justify
atrocities but clear that is a context
in which Gaza has been under U Israeli
blockade um since Hamas took over the
strip in 2007 it is's a context in which
Israel's occupation remains entrenched
including the West Bank where Israel has
been consolidating what the European
Union has called a one state reality of
uh inequality and uh Perpetual conflict
which many human rights organizations
refer to as a part
Israel says that the blockade is
necessary because of the threat from
Hamas however to many Palestinians the
occupation renew the Grievances and
observers argue it could reenergize
resistance a concern expressed by a
Palestinian psychologist who grew up in
Gaza as a psychologist I would say that
I'm I'm sure there is a lot of these
kids want to revenge for the death of
their parents I'm sure you know they
they want to revenge for you know their
siblings who been killed and with this a
aties that has been happening in in Gaza
nowadays I don't know how many how many
um you know Fighters Israel made um that
supports Hamas now a wori also voiced by
the Irish foreign minister who
reportedly told the Israeli president on
a recent trip to Israel what you are
doing is creating fertile ground for
more extreme views to grow how worried
are Israelis about the war in
influencing
radicalization they are already so
radicalized our response in that sense
is first and foremost to try to
eliminate the capabilities the ideology
is already there it won't make the
ideology worse than it already is they
did that on October 7th and they have
said that they want to do it
again Israel have never been as explicit
as they are now about their intention to
eliminate Hamas yet earlier experiences
highlight how challenging this is Hamas
is not just a military movement nor is
it just a political movement it is an
ideology that ideology will not be
eradicated certainly not through Israeli
Force of Arms during the second intifada
from 2000 to 2005 and Uprising following
the failure to establish a Palestinian
State Israel killed leader isma
abushanab and Hamas founder shikh Ahmed
yin and then his replacement abdulaziz
RTI but Hamas continued to gain support
from many
Palestinians in 2014 a war erupted in
the Gaza Strip Israel claimed to have
dealt a significant blow to
Hamas however ex Israeli soldier Beni
Sanders who fought in the War claims it
ended up strengthening Hamas I know for
a fact that many civilians were killed
in the area that I was
in and uh I was left uh after that
experience kind of uh questioning what
it what it all accomplished did it
actually strike Hamas did it actually
weaken them did it actually prevent uh
the risk of that happening again and
what I realized in the Years afterwards
was that no it didn't uh not only that
uh Hamas got
[Applause]
stronger
we don't know if Israel will succeed in
its Mission but even its allies argue
that a lasting settlement between
Israelis and Palestinians is the only
way to guarantee peace in the future
some suggest it could be the best way to
weaken Hamas if one truly wants to
marginalize and to weaken
Hamas
then the only way that can happen is
through the creation of a viable or
political trap but Israel shocked by the
brutality of the October 7th attacks
remain firm in continuing to prevent a
Palestinian State and are defiant on
eliminating Hamas I just can't see a
victory day for the Israelis so they
they can uh massively degrade Hamas but
the key thing is then how do you prevent
Hamas reemerging in the sort of afterm
of the major military operation so when
I look at the day after I think that is
Israel will very much control the
continuation of the campaign to
eliminate Hamas capabilities they're
always going to show something but the
bulk of them the threat of them that
we're going to be able to eliminate
under Mr Netanyahu who leads the most
rightwing government in Israel's history
Israel plans to retain security control
for the foreseeable
future as amounting to long-term
occupation supported by ministers and
parliamentarians in Benjamin netanyahu's
coalition government some of them openly
say they want to see Jewish settlements
in Gaza but this post-war vision is not
one that is endorsed by the US following
pressure from the Biden Administration
for a day after scenario defense
minister yuav Gallant outlined a plan
critically it satisfied the US by ruling
out civilian settlements in Gaza prime
minister Netanyahu has since confirmed
local officials would run gaza's civil
Affairs but has not said he'd allow the
Palestinian Authority to
return Israel would retain complete
freedom to conduct military operations
there how post-war Gaza is governed
remains an open question as does the
prospect of a lasting peace deal but
without an alternative to the status quo
there is a real risk of more extreme
exem violence in the",20240226
pyt9nJay060,Israel's Eurovision entry under scrutiny over alleged reference to Hamas | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel's Eurovision entry under scrutiny over alleged reference to Hamas  BBC News.jpg,"organizers of the Eurovision song
contest say they are assessing whether
Israel's entry breaks the rules on
political neutrality after it was
claimed that singer Eden Goan song
October rain made reference to the
current conflict in Gaza well Israel has
warned that it would withdraw from the
competition if the ballot is censored
well there are two specific sets of
lyrics that have caused uproar I can
read some of them to you now who told
you Boys Don't Cry hours and hours and
flowers life is not a game for the
cowards now the reference to flowers is
significant because according to the
Israel hom newspaper it is a military
slang term for war fatalities and these
are the other set of lyrics that are
being scrutinized there's no air left to
breathe there's no place no me from day
today well let's cross live now and
speak to Adrien Bradley who joins us on
the world today he's an Eurovision
expert Adrian good to talk to you uh
talk to me first of all about what the
main controversy is here between the two
sides between Eurovision and
Israel so this there's been quite
ongoing pressure from a number of
countries that are entering Eurovision
about Israel's participation in the
Eurovision the Ebu have been very clear
that they're not they don't want to ban
Israel they've said that it's a
competition for broadcast is not
governments and they've said that the
the broadcast itself has complied with
all the rules but when it comes to the
song The Ebu has really strict rules on
politics in songs they' banned songs
before and this is area where they're in
dispute with Israel right now and it's
we don't know exactly we we we've heard
from papers some reports of What lyrics
are ow and the broadcaster can publish
the entire lyrics of the song for
everybody to see on Wednesday night
after these were leaked because the song
itself wasn't due to be released um for
another couple of weeks
but the normal process is that the Ebu
will approve or not approve a song and
if Israel if it isn't approved and
Israel don't make Chang ches or don't
submit another song they won't be able
to take part in Eurovision and it feels
doesn't it Adrian that Israel is saying
look we're not going to change the song
it's this or we're out it does feel like
that and there there's kind of been
precedent for this in 2021 bellarus were
disqualified this was around the
political crisis that was going on in
their country and the ACT their were
told to change their song now this was a
band that used to mock anti-government
protesters in their songs and believed
in the lyrics they've done that again
they were asked to change the song they
did actually put in a new song which the
Ebu said was also inappropriate at that
point they were disqualified and it also
happened in 2009 Georgia had a had a
song called We don't want we don't want
to put in which the Ebu said the lyrics
were criticism of a Russian leader which
uh Georgia denied they refused to change
it and pulled out of a contest that year
so that there's been precedent for this
it does sound like from all the
statements that can be Israeli
broadcasters made that they aren't going
to back down so they're asked to make
any ch to the song they won't take part
um and we're getting very close to when
there has to be a deadline so March the
11th is the deadline when all the
delegations get together and the songs
have to be agreed so if they haven't
come to agreement by then they won't be
taking part okay Adrien Bradley good to
talk to you thank you very much
indeed",20240223

the world food program has paused
life-saving food deliveries to Northern
Gaza saying Aid convoys have endured
complete chaos and violence due to the
collapse in civil order the Israeli
military ordered 1.1 million Palestinian
civilians to evacuate Northern Gaza and
seek shelter in the south at the start
of its ground offensive in October last
month the UN Agency for Palestinian
refugees underw said at least 300,000
people who' remained in the area
depended on its assistance for their
survival a deliveries to the north since
the ground offensive have been scarce
and dependent on security clearances
from the Israeli military well let's
speak now to Matthew hollingworth who's
representative for the world food
program live in Jerusalem Matthew thank
you so much for being here on the
program so just explain for us uh in a
little more detail why you've taken that
decision to pause food deliveries to the
north so um thank you Matthew and I mean
first of all it is a pause it's not a
permanent suspension this is temporary
in nature um we need to fix a couple of
problems that we were facing and have
faced this week u in the two convoys we
did get to Gaza City um the two convoys
came up uh with two big big concerns
first of all and most importantly when
we did get into Gaza City um
unfortunately um people came under Fire
as they were receiving assistance um you
don't really uh ever imagine that people
could be so desperate so hungry um and
so you know fearful of their own
family's health that they're willing to
run into machine gun fire to receive
food assistance but that's what we
experienced when we got into Gaza City
on Sunday and Monday of this week um
second of all as you rightly said we
also came up against some very serious
insecurity issues just getting into Gaza
City because of the breakdown of Law and
Order which is down to desperation it's
down to to you know hopelessness need uh
needs you know not being met outside of
the of Gaza City as well so those two
concerned married together um worrying
about the people we're there to serve
making sure that we're doing no harm by
providing them assistance and trying to
get that that safety assurance that when
people are going to be supported they're
not going to come under Fire that's our
primary concern and second of all making
sure that our gar and truck drivers our
gar and staff our International staff
who are going in are also not coming
under Fire um when they're providing
life-saving Aid two things in this
question tell me more about the need in
terms of what you've witnessed in the
north and how distressing is it as a
humanitarian to have to pause
humanitarian
efforts I mean the needs in Gaza City
are phenomenal um I spent four or five
hours traveled all around the city met
with lots of people um they are
desperate um people were able to live
off some stocks that were that that that
were still uh in the basements of
buildings in the basement of shops um
but unfortunately that is no longer
possible um people were
able in the past to get hold of
essentially chaff um it was animal feed
and they were using that animal animal
feed to make very basic flour to make
bread that ran out a week ago so people
are absolutely desperate for assistance
for food assistance uh what we've been
able to bring in so far is a drop in the
ocean what we need to be doing is
sending in 30 trucks every single day
consistently regularly without pause
people need confidence and trust that
humanitarian assistance will re will get
to them and they also need to know that
when it does they're not going to come
under Fire they're going to be protected
they're going to be safe none of that
exists yet that's what we're negotiating
to resolve once that's done the pause
will end and we will be back trying to
pump as much food flood food into a
place where famine is knocking at
people's doors a final quick question
you end by saying famine is knocking at
people's doors particularly in children
because more stats on that released by
your organization in the last 24 hours
and you must also be watching what is
happening around rafo with increasing
alarm look um it's we're talking about a
very small area um 140 square miles
there is no safe area across the
entirety of the Gara strip people are in
desperate need throughout the whole of
the strip um but when you look at the
the the level of deprivation
in Gaza City it is phenomenal as you
rightly said we came out with a joint
Report with the World Health
Organization and UNICEF earlier this
week that showed that in a very short
period of time um children are facing
emergency levels of malnutrition and
that should worry us all when you add to
that the Fear Factor on what will happen
next in Rafa potentially a million more
people displaced yet again people who've
already been displaced already lost
their homes and and been pushed around
parts of the strip seeking shelter and
safety and may have to do it again it's
a extremely worrying period um Rafer as
well as our our main entry point into
the strip it's the the artery for all
Aid that's going in which has already
been hampered in the last week because
of protests and violence on the corridor
where where we bring trucks into the
Gaza Strip things need to change we need
more entry points into the Gaza Strip we
need guarantees of safety that when we
can go when we can get Aid in can travel
around uh safely and we desperately need
to ensure that when we're serving people
those people don't actually face more
harm uh and more violence through the
provision of Aid they need safe Aid Drop
Zones where when we provide the aid they
can receive it and take it home to their
families Matthew hollingworth we have to
leave it there but thanks for talking to
us here on verified live we're grateful
for your time",20240221
qAEbFAfBwFQ,US vetoes call for immediate Gaza ceasefire at UN | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US vetoes call for immediate Gaza ceasefire at UN  BBC News.jpg,"well let's take you live to the United
Nations where the Security Council is
hearing arguments around the situation
in Gaza let's have a listen in as the
United States is Linda Thomas Greenfield
is currently speaking more
period And so that ultimately we can
together help create a future in which
Israelis and Palestinians live in states
of their own side by side in peace we're
committed to engaging constructively on
our resolution with you all in the days
to come to that end and we will continue
to tirelessly engage in direct diplomacy
and negotiations on the ground thank
you of the United States for her
statement and I now give the floor to
the representative of
okay we're just going to leave that
ongoing
conversation uh in the UN General
Assembly but what's been happening in
the last few moments is that there was
an Algerian draft
resolution uh about a ceasefire in Gaza
uh there were 13 votes in favor of that
call for a ceasefire the UK abstained
and the US blocked its passage with a
Vita so this is the third time that the
United States has exercised its Visa
veto I should say on Gaza at the UN
Security Council we were just hearing
there from the United States ambassador
to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield well
to unpack all of that I'm joined Now by
Neda toi who is our un correspondent
Neda if you could just walk us through
what exactly has
happened yeah well vir uh the United
States again blocking an attempt in the
UN Security Council to get a resolution
through that calls for an immediate
humanitarian ceasefire it is something
the United States has objected to uh
they have of course uh supported its
Ally Israel and and their military
operation it it's attempt as Israel says
to go after Hamas but in quite frankly
the almost the entire rest of the
council has for months now been begging
for a un Security Council resolution the
Arab group of Nations warning that is
what is taking place in Gaza amounts to
the collective punishment of
Palestinians something the UN agrees
with as well saying the Arab group of
Nations it amounts to a genocide and we
heard the Algerian representative speak
before the vote and he warned that the
situation in Gaza was reaching a
critical juncture where the call for a
ceasefire would soon lose significance
he said every Palestinian is a target
for death extermination and genocide we
must ask ourselves how many innocent
lives must be sacrificed before the
council deems it necessary to call for a
ceasefire so we saw there 13 members uh
endorsing that call for a ceasefire the
United Kingdom abstaining the United
States blocking it and the US ambassador
to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield said
that the resolution was wishful and
irresponsible she actually put forward
this argument that the resolution would
put in Jeopardy talks that the United
States is in at the moment with Israel
Egypt and Qatar to reach a temporary uh
pause uh in the fighting for six weeks
to get all of the hostages released and
the United States has actually proposed
its own alternative
resolution which registers its
opposition to Israel's plans uh of a
ground incursion into Rua and the
Ambassador said to council members that
that that their proposed resolution was
not as some members claimed an American
effort to cover for an imminent ground
incursion but rather it was a sincere
statement of their concern for the 1.5
million civilians who have sought Refuge
that us proposal is still being debated
just to break this down a bit so that
our viewers can kind of understand all
the different things that are being
tabled um Algeria tabled something the
US vetoed that the UK abstained what
exactly has the US put forward then as
its own draft and what's happening with
that yeah so the United States over the
weekend had signaled they were going to
veto this resolution by Algeria and they
have proposed an alternative resolution
now that resolution for the first time
does use the word ceasefire but it calls
for a temporary ceasefire as soon as
practicable now that very much Echoes
language that we have seen President
Biden using publicly saying that he's
used that in talks with Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu again to get
that temporary pause in fighting for 6
weeks to get the hostages released so it
very much Echoes that language but it
does does have also strong language on
the US opposition to an Israel Israeli
ground incursion into Rua saying that
that would harm more civilians it would
forcibly displace them potentially into
neighboring countries a reference to
Egypt saying it would be a threat to
International Peace and security and so
as I say Linda Thomas Greenfield the US
ambassador said that that resolution is
very much a sincere uh representation of
the US's concern for civilians in rough
uh but you know what we've heard from
council members here regini is that it
is time for an immediate ceasefire and
and they want to see that in a security
Council product okay n toi we'll leave
you at the UN for the moment but I'm
sure we will return to events there
throughout the course of the afternoon",20240220

using the word ceasefire during un votes
on the war between Israel and Hamas but
they're using tougher language now the
US has proposed a draft resolution at
the UN Security Council calling for a
temporary ceasefire as soon as feasible
now the United States resolution also
opposes Israel's plans to attack the
overcrowded city of Rafa it says the
assault would harm civilians and push
them into neighboring countries it's not
clear when or or if the text will be put
to a vote but either way it still
intends to veto another measure calling
for an immediate pause to the
fighting well let's get more from our
correspondent Jenny Hill who is in
Jerusalem for us Jenny what more do we
know about this us
resolution well we know that it warns
against as you say that planned ground
offensive in the southern city of Rafa
saying that such a move on the part of
Israel could threaten the peace and
security of the region um the US is
Israel's closest Ally but we have seen
in recent days and weeks a real shift in
tone and language and it looks as though
the Biden Administration is starting to
run out of patience as Benjamin
Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister
continues to defiantly um oppose ignore
international calls for restraint in his
military operation in Gaza launched of
course in uh response to those October
7th attacks now look he's insisted that
he has to go into Rafa where he says
there are still battalions of Hamas
Fighters just yesterday the Israeli
government said that if Hamas doesn't
return all Israeli hostages within the
next 3 weeks it will go ahead with that
offensive and that seems to have really
prompted a bit of a flurry of
international efforts to try to get
Israel to rethink its strategy try to
calm this situation down just yesterday
um all but one of the eu's member states
issued a formal statement um calling for
an immediate humanitarian pors in
fighting and we learned this morning
that reportedly the US's Top Middle East
advisor is due to travel to the region
to hold talks in both Egypt and Israel
in the meantime of course there are more
than a million displaced Palestinian
civilians in G in Rafa City living in
tented accommodation in conditions which
are described as really very unpleasant
indeed and all they can do is watch and
wait to see what kind of deal the
International Community might be able to
thres out with Israel and Jenny that's
pressure from a staunch Ally Mr Nan
who's also facing pressure at home isn't
he when it comes to the economy and and
calls for an early
election yeah I mean Mr Netanyahu has
got by if you like um for a very long
time um on a reputation as the defender
of Israel's security Mr security that
reputation has crumbled um he is in a
coalition government he's held up in
effect by some Coalition Partners who
are very Hardline very right-wing they
don't want to see any kind of peace deal
really in fact if anything they'd like
to see all Palestinians moved out of of
this country um so he himself is in a
pretty precarious position politically
and that is why I think it's one of the
reasons certainly that we see him taking
such a defiant stance you know just
yesterday here in Jerusalem there were
protests women protesting about the
Israeli government's approach to trying
to get its hostages home so yeah he he
faces an uneasy situation here but it's
the international pressure now which I
think will claim his attention all right
Jenny thank you so much for that well
speaking of international pressure
meanwhile at the international court of
justice it's on its second day of public
hearings to decide the legality of
Israel's occupation of Palestinian
territories now South Africa and Saudi
Arabia are among the countries to
address it yesterday the un's top Court
heard from the Palestinian delegation
Israel has declined to take part so
let's speak to our correspondent Anna
hollan who is at the ha for us Anna
thank you for your time what did we hear
from the Palestinian foreign
minister uh well there were some
emotional testimonies yesterday we heard
from uh the Palestinian authorities
representative to the UN his voice was
breaking as he asked the judges here
what does international justice mean to
the children of Gaza today it hasn't
Protected Their Lives or limbs their
hopes or homes we also heard from the uh
International lawyer Philip Sans who
said the Great Hall inside the peace
Palace home to the international court
of justice was not Starry Eyed about the
potential for international Justice and
yet he said this is all we have and he
told me after the hearing that he
believed Leeves an advisory opinion from
this court the un's highest court could
help to set the parameters for a
negotiated settlement in the future and
Anna given that Israel has rejected the
Court's Jurisdiction on the matter what
can the Palestinians truly hope for
here you're absolutely right um Israel
has rejected this Court's Jurisdiction
over its occupation of the West Bank and
yet it has submitted a five-page
document in which it says it believes
this case is harmful to efforts to
achieve a peaceful resolution uh because
the question posed by the UN gen general
assembly is actually Prejudice however
over the next 5 days six days in total a
record 51 countries taking part we'll
start to get some insight into how
different countries positions may be
shifting in line with or in response to
what's happening in aaza in Rafa today
and then it will probably take about 6
months for this court to issue its
advisory opinion these advisory opinions
are not legally binding but they do
carry a huge amount of political weight
so could indeed have some influence over
the future trajectory of this conflict",20240220

program we start in the Middle East
where a member of Israel's war cabinet
has given Hamas a deadline to release
all the hostages or the military will
launch its offensive in Rafa Benny Gant
said that unless they were freed by the
start of Ramadan that's on the 10th of
March troops would move into the city
now Rafa is currently overcrowded with
at least 1.4 million Palestinians
Sheltering there speaking on Sunday Mr
gance who is a former Defense Minister
and a current member of Israel's war
cabinet he said the world must know and
Hamas leaders must know if by Ramadan
our hostages are not home the fighting
will continue everywhere to include the
Rafa area well earlier the UN public
health agency said a key Gaza hospital
has ceased to function following an
Israeli raid the World Health
Organization said it hadn't been allowed
to enter NASA Hospital in KH Yunis north
of Rafa to assess the situation the
Israel defend forces entered the complex
on Thursday saying intelligence
indicated that hostages taken by Hamas
were being held there they released
these pictures which they claim show
weapons found in cars surrounding the
hospital now with exactly 3 weeks to go
before the start of Ramadan reports from
Rafa say that a few people are leaving
but that most are still waiting simply
unsure what to do these pictures are
from Eastern Rafa people have been
inspecting the damage following a
strike they say the place was struck
based on what the residents say there
were 23 people inside they managed to
rescue some the rest are still under the
rubble there's no safe place in the Gaza
Strip they even hit the UN schools and
residential areas they tell people to
evacuate to Safe designated zones that
are not safe there's no safe
place with more on this let's speak to
to our correspondent Jenny Hill Jenny
thanks so much for joining us what more
do we know about the offensive right
now well it's the first time that we've
had any sense of time scale or deadline
um if Israel is is serious about um its
warning um and presuming that
negotiations to broker a temporary
ceasefire and the release of those
Israeli hostages continue to founder as
they have done uh in recent days and
weeks um then we know that Israel has
three weeks to in effect make good on
its promise to get civilians in Rafa out
of Harm's Way before that ground
offensive begins now Israel has not
published any kind of detailed plan as
to how it intends to make sure that
those displaced civilians can be moved
to safety there are very limited options
for them you mentioned that some people
have been trying to leave we've seen
convoys in recent days trying to get out
of Rafa um there are many places for
people to go um some could head north or
west to areas of open ground where there
are no facilities um no access to any
kind of infrastructure um there is talk
that some people might try to get across
the border into Egypt Rafa city of
course is the most southern point of
Gaza people are living in makeshift
tents right up against the the border
wall there in recent days there have
been reports that Egypt looks to be
building some kind of Walled enclosure
on its side of the border which some
believe might be a kind of facility for
taking in refugees but that's been
publicly denied by the Egyptian
authorities who say that they are not
making any such preparations um so
there's mounting International concern
about the safety of the people who've
been displaced several times over in
most cases and are now living down on
gaza's southernmost tip um that pressure
coming most notably from Israel's
closest Ally the US and it's interesting
to note that Ben Benjamin Netanyahu the
is Israeli Prime Minister who of course
says he has to go into Rafa Because he
believes that there are battalions of
Hamas Fighters hold up there um over the
weekend has repeatedly insisted that he
intends to as he puts it finish the job
um making those comments again last
night at an assembled um audience of
Jewish American leaders you know he is
really defying us calls to rethink his
strategy in Rafa and J Jenny we've
obviously talked about uh this threat
from Israel but what do we know about
any progress when it comes to diplomatic
negotiations
negotiations well in terms of the talks
um aimed at brokering a ceasefire and
the release of Israeli hostages um the
signs really aren't good at all the
qataris um who've been leading those
negotiations have admitted themselves
that um prospects don't look good at all
um both Hamas and Israel completely
reject one another's demands um Benjamin
Netanyahu again over the weekend has
repeated what he said previously he
considers hamas's demands to be
completely delusional so not much really
looking good there at all um and
actually if you look sort of to The
Wider context as well um over the
weekend Benjamin netanyahu's War cabinet
has completely rejected the idea of what
they describe as the unilateral creation
of a a Palestinian State that's
something that Western allies were were
starting to talk about as a potential
longer term um settlement whereby Saudi
would normalize its relations with
Israel um there would be at least a
pathway to the creation of a Palestinian
State these were things which were being
talked about particularly by the US
Administration that is something which
appears to have really enraged Benjamin
Netanyahu and he has completely closed
the door on that for for the time being
so in terms of the mood music it really
doesn't look good at all and very few
positive signs and that means that you
know for those million and a half um
displaced civilians stuck in Rafa the
mood is is one of great fear right now
all right Jenny thank you so much for
that update",20240219

Rafa close to the border with Egypt
where around a million and a half people
are now seeking safety we'll get the
latest on the ground in just a moment
but first last November we reported on
the case of a young woman and her
disabled brother tala and yazid in Rafa
they were trying to escape but were
repeatedly turned away at the border
along with their mother and siblings our
special correspondent fergo Kean has
been following the family's story we
came back to no electricity no food for
today she's been a constant caring voice
from within the siege and one more day
closer to my brother running out of
medications and we're still
here tala Abu n's daily life a
Relentless
struggle to care for her disabled
brother
yazid three times they tried to escape
Rafa like last November when our
cameraman first met them at the border
we're trying to do anything that we can
to do to survive because we just I
simply don't want to die at
then back home amid the constant noise
of drones overhead tala tried to comfort
[Music]
yazid and then just a few days ago we
had news from
Cairo they'd escaped to the safety of a
flat in the Egyptian Capital tala
described the moment they left I can't
hear drones anymore um and I can't see I
can't I'm sorry
um I want to be hearing any bombings or
any air strikes
and and it felt really surreal
but normality even being able to boil a
kettle for tea has brought uncomfortable
feelings this is one of the hardest
feelings to talk about
should tah carries the memory of the
people she's left
behind every time I have food to eat or
I don't have to go running for water
or or knowing that everything is
available it makes me feel even guilty
to think about everyone in Gaza the 1.2
million people who are displaced in Rafa
right
now but they had to leave yazd's
medication had run out worsening his
condition he would have a seizure every
time he he
bombing and it got really scary like his
body and his his mind is not being able
to to understand everything that's going
on tala knows a world Beyond Gaza she
studied in the US lived with an American
Family she won a fellowship for young
leaders funded by the state department
but all was coming home to yazid here
together in
2021 will she return to Gaza I ha don't
know how long is it going to take um but

and to our correspondent Paul Adams and
Paul what do we know about conditions in
southern Gaza
tonight well R you mentioned two places
in your introduction one was NASA
Hospital well the situation there is
very unclear the Israelis uh troops have
been in there since early Thursday
morning conducting searches arresting
members of Staff who they believe are
associated with Hamas and looking for
evidence that hostages were being were
being held in the hospital uh they say
that they are doing what they can to
keep the hospital running bringing in
diesel and oxygen and helping to fix a
generator Palestinian sources are saying
that the hospital is absolutely on its
last legs and in fact the head of the wh
has said that effectively NASA hospital
has ceased to function we've heard of
people dying as a result of
interruptions to power and oxygen so at
the very least it's an extremely
precarious situation in NASA hospital to
the South a little way to the south in
Rafa 1.3 million people are waiting to
find out when the Israeli military
assault will come and today a member of
Benjamin netanyahu's War cabinet Benny
gance said that if hostages are not
released by the beginning of Ramadan
that is in precisely 3 weeks then the
Israeli military assault on Rafa would
begin and the White House has demanded
that that cannot begin unless those
civilians are out of the way and at the
moment there is no plan to move them",20240218

Gaza earlier its forces claimed to have

at a temporary ceasefire and the return
of Israeli hostages are ongoing but
there's no sign of a
breakthrough and so the eyes of the
world are on Rafa more than a million
displaced civilians have sought refuge
in gaza's Southern City but Israel
believes Hammer Fighters are hiding here
too and despite growing International
protest plans a major ground offensive

German foreign minister more than half
of gaza's population is currently

start in the US the Senate approved a
$95 billion Aid package for Ukraine
Israel and Taiwan the approval comes
after months of political arguments
Senate Republicans are still divided on
the bill and previously voted it down it
includes $60 billion for ke 14 for
Israel 10 billion for humanitarian Aid
in Conflict zones including Gaza the
bill now heads to the Republican
controlled House of rep Representatives
where we don't know what will happen so
it's not a done deal yet and in the last
hour the US President Joe Biden said
this America can be trusted America can
be relied upon and America stands up for
Freedom we stand strong for our allies
we never bow down to anyone and
certainly not to Vladimir Putin as I've
said before the stakes in this fight
extend far beyond UK Ukraine if we don't
stop Putin's appetite for power and
control in Ukraine he won't limit
himself just to Ukraine and the cost for
America and our allies and partners are
going to rise for republicans in
Congress who think they can oppose
funding for Ukraine and not be held
accountable history is watching history
is watching history is watching failure
to support Ukraine at this critical
moment will never be forgotten
right n as you can see standing by North
America correspondent Nom great to see
you uh let's get to the moments of
history that Joe Biden was just touching
on in a moment but first the
technicalities where does this stand
where are we in this
process well so a flaw vote later four
months later we're finally in this
position where this uh this bill has
been passed by the Senate but as you
mentioned there it's not a done deal
because now it has to go to the house
and the house house is controlled by the
Republicans the Speaker of the House the
Republican Mike Johnson has already
indicated that uh this is going nowhere
um so I mean in terms of what happens
next so um he Mr Johnson has to decide
whether to bring the package to a vote
in the chamber is he going to amend it
and then send it back to the senate or
is he going to ignore it entirely
without getting too much into the weeds
with it if let's just say he decides to
ignore entirely the House Republicans
who did vote for the assistance to to
Ukraine for this this package uh they
could uh join the Democrats in filing a
what's called a discharge petition and
basically that would that's a rare
parliamentary procedure that would
basically circumvent Johnson and then
there'd be a vote but I don't want to
get too much into the weeds with that at
the moment we've got to see uh what
happens next if it goes to the floor it
could take weeks it could take months
before it even lands on President Joe
Biden's desk if at all so okay using
that cliche phrase we'll see what
happens next no no we love getting into
the weeds uh on on this program so I
appreciate that greatly uh let's talk
about the politics of it though from a
kind of step back position what is the
opposition from some to this
package border security uh that's one of
the issues first of all because uh this
is a narrower Bill and uh basically
Republicans particularly those who are
to the very you know right of the party
those who are very closely lined to
Donald Trump they want very strict
border security laws as part of this and
that's that's what you know they have
said that we don't want to pass a
security bill without this the other
thing you've got to remember here is
that Mike Johnson the house uh the
Republican leader the speaker of the
house and many of those Republicans who
are closely lined to Donald Trump who is
likely to be the front runner who is the
front runner and likely to be the
Republican party's presidential
candidate uh they don't want want to
continue supporting Ukraine they just
they they they say they would rather the
money be spent here in the US and so uh
there is this pressure on them for this
bill not to go through now the Speaker
of the House denies that there's that
pressure from uh former president Donald
Trump but that that's some of the
politics that's playing in the
background here Nam thank you so much
for that now it's not just the Politics
as n was talking about their real life
implications we're going to speak now to
Kira rudik who is a member of the
Ukrainian and Parliament leader of the
golos party thank you very much for
coming on the
program hello thank you so much for
having me so what's your reaction to
what's happened there in the Senate and
what potentially could still happen
there in the
US oh well we are very happy that the
process is moving on but it is not final
and I think the toughest uh challenge is
still ahead of us um so basically there
are so many people whose lives
well-being and ability just to exist and
to keep fighting depend on if the
politicians in the United States will
figure out uh and find an agreement and
finding their hearts ability to move
forward uh to keep the promise that the
United States have made you know it is
incredibly hard to explain to people who
are fighting at the front what is going
on and like how did it change from as
long as it takes to
uh it's still four months and we do not
have confirmation for for this Aid okay
can I just ask you about the the the
numbers here $60 billion do heading to
Ukraine if this goes through un amended
give us an idea of what that would be
used
for well it's uh not going to head to
Ukraine there will be 10 billion that
will be used for the aid for our state
so we can cover on the our budget
expenses and the rest will be spent for
the military expenses and mostly they
will be spent inside the United States
to pay for the ammunition to pay for the
missiles to pay for uh additional
manufacturing of the weapons and then at
some point this uh uh these weapons will
go to Ukraine so we are talking right
now about um a really important and
critical project for us because that
will imply having ammunition that we
have a shortage of
uh having their air defense systems
having um different kinds of critical
supplies and um it we we really needed
badly all of that four months ago can
you imagine like what is going on right
now and especially given uh given the
fact that we have no deadline for that
and no uh understanding on when those
missiles and when those weapons will
arrive to Ukraine uh after if the bill
will be passed
and what about the progress I know you
can't draw a direct line from this bit
of money coming through and success or
otherwise on the battlefield of course
but give us an idea on the state of the
military situation now and then if and
when any funding comes what that could
change well I'm not a military expert
but I can tell you couple of things to
have an idea the first one is that while
there are there are those delays in the
support from the United States uh there
are three countries that do not have any
delays in production weapons it's Russia
Iran and North Korea and they are
manufacturing weapons and supplies to
get ahead in ability to attack us and it
is really really dangerous and it was
dangerous last year but right now
they're getting more and more of that
and we see the attacks at the front
intensifying the question is for how how
long our army will be able to hold them
off and this is uh again an existential
question for all of us well the second
sign is that ammunition That was
supposed to be manufactured in Europe is
also delayed so uh we understand that
everybody's trying to help us but we are
paying for every day of this delay with
the lives of our citizens because almost
every night another uh peaceful city of
Ukraine is being attacked ACT people die
lives are destroyed and uh it this
nightmare just continues and continues
and we do not have much to contradict to
that do you have any understanding or
sympathy with the view of some
Republicans in the US that they simply
want money spent in the US for example
on their
border well uh we are talking right now
uh when we talking about the 60 billion
about less than a chunk of percent of
the United States military budget and I
think we as a country have shown that we
can use those money very effectively and
efficiently by weakening Russia and
destroying so many of their forces so
many of their um weapon Supply soldiers
we are the only country in the world who
does not have a fleet but is able to
destroy enemy's Fleet like almost 20% of
that so whatever money are being sent to
Ukraine its money very well spent okay
Kira rudik thank you very much for
coming on the program thank you thank
you and glory to Ukraine",20240214

has appealed for the more than 1 million
Palestinians Sheltering in Rafa in the
southern Gaza Strip to be protected once
again urging Israel not to carry out a
big assault without a credible plan for
the safety of civilians he was speaking
after meeting the Jordanian Monarch King
Abdullah in Washington the King has
repeatedly pushed for a full truce to
end the conflict that started when Hamas
attacked Israel on over October the 7th
on Monday morning a series of Israeli
air strikes there killed at least 70
people with Israel warning of an
impending ground offensive more than
half of gaza's population now live in
Rafa the potential for a ground campaign
has sparked alarm from Israel's allies
including the United States as The King
and I discussed today the United States
is working on a hostage deal between
Israel and Hamas which would bring a
immediate and sustained period of common
to Gaza for at least 6 weeks which we
could then take the time to build
something more enduring nearly 100,000
people have been killed injured or are
missing the majority our women and
children we cannot afford an Israeli
attack on Rafa it is certain to produce
another humanitarian catastrophe the
situation is already unbearable for over
a million people who have been pushed
into RAF since the war started we cannot
stand by and let this continue we need a
lasting ceasefire now this war must
end for more analysis on King abdullah's
visit to Washington here's our North
America correspondent namia ikbal this
was a very significant meeting in that
uh King Abdullah is the first Arab
leader to meet President Biden since
October the 7th and the King has been
very open about what he thinks should be
happening and he's laid those goals out
to President Biden we heard it in his
statement he wants an immediate
long-lasting ceasefire he also wants
humanitarian Aid to be sent into Gaza
he's worried about the military
operation in Rafa and he also wants a
long-term solution a two-state solution
these are all issues that President
Biden has also raised um and King
Abdullah is meeting President Biden
where the tone has slightly changed in
Washington uh last week President Biden
issued a a rare rebuke of Israel in
which he said the military operation
Gaza had gone over the top critics have
pointed out that there has been no
practical change however in America's
approach they they continue to give
military aid to Israel uh but the king
will be hoping to use his influence with
America uh Jordan is incredibly
important as a regional Ally to the
Americans uh the king also enjoys a very
close relationship with America he takes
pride in his close relationship with
President Biden all the presidents
before him but it is a it is a very
difficult tricky balancing act because
in Jordan there has been much unrest
amongst a lot of people uh there's been
Street protests because of what's
happening in Gaza many calling on uh the
Jordanian uh leadership to abandon its
peace treaty with Israel to abandon its
defense agreements with America that's
not likely to happen uh the King will
want to use his influence so this
meeting with President Biden has been a
very important role of the dice in that
sense in order to make his feelings
heard to
America we can now live cross live and
speak to Dr Alam Salah who is senior
electure in politics and international
relations at Australian National
University but is joining us today from
leads in the north of England welcome to
the program we've heard about the
concerns from King Abdullah and also
President Biden they are by no means
alone what would be the Diplomatic
consequences of an assault on
Rafa well definitely would have many
different consequences first of all
diplomatically speaking uh it would
internationalize and regionalize the
conflict into uh Egypt involving Egypt
that means uh learning from the past
Egypt knows that uh uh hundred thousands
of refugees U moving to to to to Egypt
would have uh security consequences like
what happened in the early 1970s when
Palestinian uh refugees have caused and
posed threat in for for Jordan
internally that means of course many
militants might move to Egypt uh with
the refugees and this is something that
Egypt cannot uh accept politically
speaking uh it would uh stop any kind of
chance for the ceasefire we know that
the United States kares and and Egyptian
officials are gathering today in in
Cairo to to to discuss the six week
ceasefire and this would be uh
definitely compromise such uh attempt
economically speaking uh uh this would
have some economic B for for Cairo like
what happened in 2011 onwards when 100
thousands of Syrian refugees moved to
Lebanon and turkey uh this is also
something that that Egypt is not ready
to pay for um uh this is uh also U
difficult for for Cairo to accept simply
because they it is very it will be very
uncertain whether these refugees uh will
be allowed to return to to Gaza one day
or if any when so this might be very
prolonged uh process that might uh uh
undermines uh security economy and
political situation of uh um Egypt in
such a war so this then puts added
pressure on Egypt to add momentum to the
peace process what realistically can it
do what can it bring to the table well
uh uh of course uh it's it's very
complicated it's is a multier issue over
1.3 million Palestinians are gathering
in in an area smaller than 64 kilometers
Square uh uh and and this might end with
a humanitarian catastrophe of course
with a security catastrophe but for Tel
Aviv of course uh they believe that they
have started a war and if they stop it
here it would be an unfinished game and
therefore they cannot accept any kind of
uh compromise with with this part of uh
Gaza because they believe many militants
Hamas militants are amongst these uh uh
over 1 million people gathering in in in
the southern part of Gaza Dr Alam Salah

News Now 3 hours of fast moving News
interviews and reaction first the
Israeli military has rescued two of the
hostages abducted by Hamas during a raid
in the Gaza Strip the release of the
hostages was announced shortly after
Israel carried out an intense aerial
bombardment of the southern city of Rafa
well this was the scene after those
Israeli strikes this morning the
spokesman for the Hamas run Health
minister says at least 67 Palestinians
were killed a doctor at a nearby
hospital said it was unable to cope with
the number of injured helicopters and
Boats were also involved in the attack
the two Israeli hostages Fernando Maron
and Louis har seen here reunited with
their families are said to be in a good
condition it's thought to be only the
second time Israel has carried out a
successful military operation to rescue
hostages the Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said only continued
military pressure will free more
hostages Israel's offensive in Rafa
looks set to continue our International
editor Jeremy Bowen examines whether
this is to become the next Battle Zone
in Gaza where will they take us what
will they do with us Rafa is the most
southerly town in
Gaza and it's the place where most of
the population of Gaza has been fleeing
to as the Israelis have advanced from
the north
you can see the influx of people from
these satellite pictures now you can see
the difference all those little markings
are tense there are about 1.4 million
people estimated to be in Rafa that's
five times its usual population they
thought they might be safer there but
now Israel says they're going to attack
we have instructed the Army to prepare
the operation in Rafa the Israelis say
moving in on Rafa is a military
necessity in pursuit of what the Prime
Minister calls total Victory against
Damas they want to get into those
tunnels we're going to get them one M
after another one tunnel after another
and as well as that they want to get
more than a 100 Israeli hostages back so
many people have ended up in Rafa
because they've been pushed down from
the north and there's nowhere else for
them to go they've reached the Border
they're living in terrible conditions
there exhausted after 4 months of War we
hear that the Israelis are a military
operation in the South where will they
take
us the Israelis say that they can open a
safe passage for civilians in Rafa but
the man who heads the UN agency that
looks after Palestinian refugees doesn't
believe them we haven't seen any safe
even since the beginning of the war but
there is nothing safe in Gaza the
problem with Israel's argument is a safe
passage to where north of them there's
the devastation of War and the Israeli
Army
south of them there's the closed
Egyptian
border well let's speak to uh Jeremy now
so we have two Israeli hostages rescued
67 Palestinians killed will Netanyahu
Jeremy see this latest offensive as a
success well to start with the Israelis
are saying this is not the big offensive
that people have been talking about uh
you know the issue as I was saying in
that video the issue
is that they they want to go down and uh
as they would see it go after Hamas in
that area but there are these roughly
million and a half civilians who were
also there um so this was a raid to get
those hostages out and the Army the
Israeli Army has been saying that
they've known about their whereabouts
for some time and they've been planning
this and they decided to go in under a
very heavy bombardment and subsequently
is they pulled out an even heavier
bombardment which is why so many
Palestinians were killed but it's not
the big raid however of course for Mr
Netanyahu it's Vindication of his point
of view which he says to get hostages
out it's not about doing deals with the
terrorists of Hamas it's actually about
showing that Israel is strong and
remorseless and uh and that Hamas will
therefore be forced to give up the
people we saw in your report there that
um the the population of Rafa has
swelled um people seeking safety heading
there but but they face further attacks
what what can they do
now I think the people in Rafa at the
moment are there's nothing they can do
uh when they they they talk in terms
that we sit here waiting for our fate we
talk here we sit here waiting for death
as's they've ended up in Rafa because
they've they've run out of places to
hide they've gone right down to the
south of Gaza and the the very heavily
defended Egyptian border is a hard stop
for them uh the so the uh the Americans
are putting a lot of pressure on Israel
if they're going to attack in a big way
Rafa I mean a really big way taking days
or weeks is to move those people out so
there are some theories that they might
be moved back up to the north of Gaza
which by the way is a
wasteland uh but I mean how moving 1.5
million people in short order uh you
know it's a I think there's a lot of
magical thinking involved in those
theories I I don't see where anywhere in
Gaza is
safe what is the situation like that
you're hearing from from people in refer
at the moment we're going to be speaking
to someone from UNICEF uh who who's in
Rafa but but it is the situation as dire
as we're
hearing I think it's desperate I think
it's absolutely desperate these are
people don't forget who many of whom
have lost everything their homes further
north are in Ruins many of them have
lost members of their famili sometimes
large numbers of people from their
families they haven't had they haven't
eaten properly in a long time shortages
of water uh living out of
doors uh it is you know it's not like
they're on a camping holiday there
they're in they're they are uh going
through massive trauma that is going to
affect the the way they think and look
at life I think from until the day that
they
die okay Jeremy B we'll leave it there
for now thank you very much for joining
us well as we've been reporting the
Hamas ran Health Ministry says at least
67 people died in a bar of Israeli air
strikes this Palestinian described what
happened during the Israeli
bombardment at approximately midnight we
heard the sounds of strong explosions as
if hell had opened up on the
civilians look what happened the
Israelis claimed that they freed
hostages from this place but we don't
know what happened we were sleeping in
our homes and we don't know anything
we didn't see any hostages here but we
saw a helicopter landing there was Heavy
shooting as if it was a very big battle
the world has turned into hell for the
lives of
civilians well the UK's foreign
secretary Lord Cameron has warned
against a planned Israeli invasion of
Rafa which is providing Refuge to more
than half of gaza's 2.3 million
population well we are very concerned
about what is happening in in Rafa
because let's be clear the people there
many of them have moved four five six
times before getting there and uh it
really we think is impossible to to see
how you can can fight a war amongst
these people there's nowhere for them to
go uh they can't go south into Egypt
they can't go north in back to their
homes because many have been destroyed
so we are very concerned about the
situation and we want Israel to stop and
think very seriously before it takes any
further action but above all what we
want is an immediate pause in the
fighting and we want that pause to lead
to a ceasefire a sustainable ceasefire
without a return um to further fighting
that's what should happen now uh we need
to get those hostages out including the
British Nationals we need to get the aid
in the best way to do that is stop the
fighting now and turn that into a
permanent sustainable ceasefire Lord
Cameron there well this bombar follows
Israel saying that two hostages held by
Hamas have been rescued in that raid in
Rafa in southern Gaza Adan berer and Aro
is a relative of the two hostages who
are rescued let's hear from him after he
was reunited with them at hospital we
were a bit shocked we didn't know we we
haven't expected
it and we saw them and the heart was
beating on 200 maybe maybe more and a
lot of Tears hugs not many words just
being together surrounded by the family
and surrounded by our beloved people
that were without us for so long more
than four months we were so happy to see
them um I can't I I don't know what is
the real situation that they are
mentally um they look okay physically
they look okay but I'm sure that you
know we're going to have ups and downs
in the coming days or weeks and we
really um hope for good and we wish them
H good health
was a relative of two of those host
hostages rescued there well let's speak
now to heish Young Who is the senior
emergency coordinator for Unicef Gaza
and he joins me from Rafa thanks so much
for your time we do appreciate it here
on BBC News uh can you tell me what it
was like in Rafa last
night uh thanks Kylie um I think I can
just verify what some of your previous
speakers said um it was horrendous the
bombarding started around midnight
perhaps a bit before that um and it was
relentless certainly nobody in Rafa got
any sleep last night um you know we were
well the bombardment was all over Rafa
um I I believe some of it was a
distraction from the actual operation
that went on so it was going on
everywhere our building was shaking all
night um of course we we had the
privilege to live in a a a good building
I I can only imagine what it was like
for people who are the vast majority of
whom are living in tent and makeshift
shelters um it was uh yeah it was very
um it was horrendous I think you've
already been given the numbers we've got
the same um around 70 casualties 14
residential buildings uh um destroyed
but I think uh if I can kyli it's really
important to to get Beyond those numbers
because you know in situations like this
we' we've become overwhelmed by the
numbers and we become some somehow
immune to them um this morning when I
got into this makeshift facility where
we are now this is the coordinated
Operation Center where the UN ngo's work
one of my colleagues a Palestinian
colleague from um one of the other
organizations working here um was trying
to relate what the story you know what
last night was like for him and he just
broke down weeping telling us how he was
lying under his bed with two young
granddaughters clinging to him both of
them just screaming hysterically uh
throughout the night um with every every
blast that went off um and uh you know
children just should not have to suffer
this children should not have to go
through this thousands of Israeli
children have been traumatized by what
happened on the 7th of October and now
you know all the children of Gaza um are
are are terribly traumatized by
everything uh that's going on now we're
seeing pictures of the uh the C in um
Rafa there and as as we've been saying
so many people fled there for safety
what is the situation like on the ground
for people there so the situation on the
ground in Rafa is already catastrophic I
mean I think it's people need to to
realize that it's not going to be made
catastrophic by uh um a full ground
Invasion it already is catastrophic
there's barely enough food for everyone
to eat there's not enough water there's
not enough Medical Services or medicines
um all children have been out of school
since uh the beginning of October
there's massive overcrowding with
hundreds of thousands of children um and
and their families living in appalling
conditions like I said the lucky ones
are intense um many many are living in
makeshift shelters um it's really cold
here at night I can't I can't imagine
what it's like um you know trying to
take care of uh small children out there
um you know there is relief coming in
organizations like UNICEF and many other
good organizations are are doing their
best we've bought in hundreds of
thousands of pieces of warm clothing for
example um for kids um ourselves and wh
are bringing in medical supplies and
vaccines wh and unra of course are doing
a lot world food program is bringing in
a lot of food um but there are so many
obstacles in the way the security
situation makes it very difficult to
work um and there are many many
bureaucratic obstructions that are put
in our way um there's limitations on the
trucks there's limitations on our
movement um there are limitations at
every step of the way that make it uh
very very difficult for the humanitarian
organizations to work make it difficult
for us to reach and take care of
children who are in dire need hey Miss
Young from UNICEF there in Rafa Forest

Pd11_LWponc,Israeli strikes kill dozens in Rafah as raid rescues two hostages | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israeli strikes kill dozens in Rafah as raid rescues two hostages  BBC News.jpg,"the Israeli military says it's rescued
two of the hostages abducted by Hamas
during a raid in the Gaza Strip their
release from an apartment in Rafa was
announced shortly after Israel carried
out an intense aerial bombardment of the
city the two men Fernando Maron and LS
ha aged 60 and 70 respectfully are said
to be in a good condition they've been
taken to a hospital in central Israel
it's the thought to be only the second
time that Israel has carried out a
successful military operation to rescue
hostages dozens of Palestinians were
reported to have been killed during the
Israeli air strikes in Rafa overnight
residents told the BBC that there've
been around 50 air strikes in the early
hours of Monday um as well as that
helicopters and boats took part in the
attack well earlier Benjamin rad from
the UCL Center for Middle East
development told told us more about the
critical situation in southern
Gaza Rafa appears to be the very last
refuge for uh Hamas leadership and the
remnants or what's left of hamas's
Fighters and also where the government
believes that the a good portion of the
hostages may be kept as we've seen from
the two that were rescued it also limits
really where they can go at this point
now as they get hemmed further and
further to the south of the country now
they're pushed against the border the
idea is to provide little opportunity
for homas leadership including yoir and
others to find Escape Routes out of the
out of the
area Benjamin Netanyahu must be coming
under considerable uh pressure uh
certainly the US indicating that it's
the welfare of those within the strip
that they are concerned about um and yet
he remains
defiant yes and let's not um pretend
that it's a coincidence that this
operation was scheduled at the time as
the United States those of us here were
watching the Super Bowl so it was really
meant to be I believe uh timed in an
opportune way to minimize detention and
scrutiny and also netanyahu's position
is that any attempt to seize operations
or not pursue it to its utmost end which
he believes includes going into Rafa
would essentially hand Hamas an
opportunity to regain control or to
reconstitute itself and also lastly is
the pressure to put on Hamas as part of
the ongoing hostage negotiations because
we've seen Netanyahu already rejected
the counter proposal that Hamas offered
last week Benjamin do you do you think
in a in a conflict such as this that the
solution is going to be a military one
or not well it depends on if the if the
main objective is to free the hostages
then no a full military solution will
very unlikely to lead to the safe um uh
to the rescue of the remaining hostages
it's very difficult to see how that can
be the case and if it's going to be an
enduring solution not just a temporary
one it's going to have to involve more
diplomacy and less military action and
ultimately it has to involve something
that creates a semblance of a
Palestinian state or um autonomous
governing entity as it stands we're not
hearing any of that from the Netanyahu
side and that's what poses a problem
however as you mentioned he faces
tremendous domestic opposition as well
specifically from right-wing members of
his cabinet who are insisting that he
not yield at all in these
operations as far as the Middle East
goes I mean relations here are really
being uh threatened particularly moving
forward I'm looking at Future
cooperation within the region not just
for Israel but for the likes of the
United States as
well well a lot of this will hinge on
how quickly Israel can get in and get
out of Rafa and continue the operations
it is carrying out now and secondly we
have the parallel track of negotiations
taking place and all indications from
the state department are that they are
progressing and moving forward they're
speaking with very confident language
that some agreement will be reached and
then we also know that the Saudis are
very eager to see this all come to an
end so they can resume talks towards
normalizing relations with Israel we
know that this is something that's been
sitting on the back burner but that both
countries have an interest in pushing
forward so the momentum is there barring
any um catastrophic or horrific um
action by the Israelis that results in a
large number of Civilian deaths as part
of this Rafa operation that remains to
be
seen that was Benjamin rad there we're
going to cross live now to Jerusalem and
speak to our correspondent there Barbara
PL user hello there to you Barbara um
what more do we know about the hostages
that were rescued first
off well they were rescued in quite a
dramatic operation overnight in Rafa two
older men their names are Fernando Simon
marman aged 60 and Louie har aged 70 so
they've been in captivity for 128 days
uh but the Army is saying they're in
good medical conditions so that would be
a relief for their families and the
military's been saying a little bit more
about what went into it they said they
two men were found in a residential
building in Rafa on the second floor
that they had been monitoring that area
for quite a long time and then they
spent sent in a special uh Joint Forces
operation which involved the Army uh
this the internal security service as
well as the special police forces they
breached the building with an explosive
they said uh there was a lot of heavy
gunfire during the rescue operation and
then there were the air strikes as the
the team and the two hostages were
extricated uh from the area and uh the
military spokesman said also that the
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as
well as top military officials were
monitoring it as it went ahead yeah
Daniel hagari was speaking just a short
time ago did he make any reference to
criticism of the their offensive in
Raa well it's interesting because during
this heavy bombardment overnight the
Palestinian residents of Rafa panicked
because they thought this was going to
be that ground offensive that Mr
Netanyahu has been talking about but it
wasn't that is still being planned the
military has been tasked with a plan to
come up for that as well as a plan to
evacuate the civilians and you know
there are more than a million displaced
Palestinians who are Sheltering in Rafa
as a sort of last place where they could
go as the Israeli Army moved through the
Gaza Strip um having people evacuate to
the South so so Mr Netanyahu has uh been
coming out and saying we will have a
plan to evacuate them we're working out
the details he hasn't given those
details he had a chat with that about
with about that with the uh American
president yesterday who's very concerned
about the possibility of heavy
casualties but also the humanitarian
situation there which is already very
Grim becoming much much worse and Mr
Biden told Mr Netanyahu uh that plan to
evacuate it has to be credible and it
has to be executable it has to be
possible in order to protect this the
the civilians but that is not something
that seems to be imminent because a plan
like that um will take some time Barbara
just how strained are not only
diplomatic relations in the region but
also amongst the Allies um that Israel
counts upon for example the United
States I think things are quite strained
uh with the United States uh because the
Americans have been pressing the
Netanyahu government
um very consistently and in person and
on the telephone to tone down and Tamp
down on the military operation to do
much more to let in humanitarian Aid and
to take measures to protect civilians
now they have had some success but it's
been quite modest uh and that is I think
frustrating the administration
considerably you have heard uh rhetoric
from the secretary of state that has
been getting tougher but also now from
the president over the last few days in
which he actually called the military
oper operation over the top in Gaza
something that many critics have been
saying for a long time including
constituencies that are important to Mr
Biden politically uh but others as well
um in terms of the region the that is
very tense at the moment and I'll just
focus on Egypt which of course has a
peace treaty with Israel and that is a
has been an anchor a Cornerstone of
regional St stability for decades Egypt
according to reports is saying that it
would it would tear up that treaty or
pull out of that treaty if Israel
carried out a ground invasion of Rafa
now they haven't been saying that
publicly publicly they have been warning
of dire consequences but just those
reports give you some idea of how
concerned the Arabs and especially Egypt
which is on the border with Israel and
the border with Gaza uh and Rafa see any
possible U major military operation in
Gaza in Rafa sorry okay Barbara plasa
something to watch keenly there thank
you very much indeed thank you",20240212

MP who supported the genocide case

treason and faces expulsion defending
oneself doesn't give one the right to to
kill other people especially innocent
civilians it's very clear everybody
myself and my
comrades we were of course totally
against the terrible Carnage that Kamas
carried out but we said from the
beginning that the
solution and is not retaliation is is
not a revenge and it's not war so what
is it only a political solution and the
strain of War here in Northern Gaza no
police no law and order food convoys
attacked it's even worse in the South
with looters threatening to paralyze the
entire Aid operation we've seen it
growing over the last weeks and I think
as the situation people come more
desperate as opportunities appear we see
the attacks on these trucks the attacks
on vehicles and now the attacks on
drivers and so it's become a very
Lawless area for people then to operate
and for us to operate in that it's it's
it's it's impossible actually we can't
get into gaza's chaotic desperate tent

drone strike in the Iraqi Capital
Baghdad killing a senior leader of an
armed pro-iran group three people were
killed in the attack including a
commander of the group that us officials
say was behind recent attacks on us
bases in Iraq and Syria in a moment
we'll speak to our International editor
Jeremy Bowen in Israel but first oliran
is in Baghdad for us tonight and Alla
you try to get close to the scene of
this attack this evening what happened
well this was an attack at 9:30 in the
evening Sophie there were three audible
explosions we could hear them at our
hotel and this is a time when people are
out on the streets in Baghdad when cafes
and restaurants are open now we got to
the scene pretty quickly there was a
security presence already there of Iraqi
police and we tried to approach the
burnt out wreck to speak to people and
ask them about what they had seen and
heard and we were very very quickly
surrounded there was a lot of anger a
lot of hostility in the crowd uh people
telling us we were not welcome because
foreigners were responsible for what had
happened for the attack on the Iraqi
commander and therefore we as foreigners
were not welcome at the location now we
were not harmed we were able to pull
back to an area where even more security
forces were arriving and members of
Iraqi SWAT teams and then a crane came
in to take away the wreckage of the car
and the crowd actually started following
now there have been calls tonight from
uh Shia paramilitary leaders pro-iranian
militia leaders for their supporters to
come out on the streets to show their
anger there have been calls also for
retaliation specifically one militia
leader saying We Want Blood for Blood
now us Central Command has said this was
a necessary strike to protect American
lives and that they would not hesitate
to take further measures in the future
but we've already we've already had one
very angry response from the Iraqi
military saying this is a threat to
sovereignty and to Safety and Security
in the country and it's hard to see how
it can do other than increase the level
of tension here Allan with the very
latest there from Baghdad thank you well
let's go to our International editor
Jeremy Bowen who is in Jerusalem Jeremy
just put in context how significant this
escalation is
tonight well it's clearly a serious
escalation though the Americans are
saying this is really about stability in
sending a message to Teran it all
depends what happens when the inevitable
retaliation occurs and whether they do
get as all is said Blood for Blood and
whether that blood is American because
that will then uh prompt another
American response without doubt now the
whole region is a flame and here in
Jerusalem The American Secretary of
State Anthony blinkin has been meeting
uh Palestinian president mahmmed abas
and also the Israeli Prime Minister uh
Mr Netanyahu and he's been trying to
pull off Mr blink a diplomatic miracle
if you like to close the gap between
Israel's position on a ceasefire in
Gaza and the position held by Hamas now
as well as that there's concern about
what's happening north of here on the
border with Lebanon where there has been
an increasingly intense war going on
since October the 7th and Israel says
that if hisbah the pro Iranian group in
Lebanon doesn't pull back from the
border then it will take even more
action and I've been up right up to that
Frontier Israel's border with Lebanon
feels isolated and empty in Matula
Israel's most Northerly Community the
only residents left are mobilized Army
reservists here they're surrounded on
three sides by hisbah Iran powerful Ally
in Lebanon one of the men who didn't
want his face shown pointed to his
brother's positions mile and then to the
north is half a mile the border with
leanon and then in the east of us it is
half a mile definitely can can turn into
a big war and a big war with hisbah it's
not like Hamas the real army very
trained greatly equipped great
intelligence and they have a lot of
experience real experience in Syria
Israel released video of their attacks
and what they said were hisb positions
tens of thousands of civilians on either
side of the Border have been evacuated
the war there is
intensifying yeah more urgent for
Anthony blinkin is a ceasefire in Gaza
but prime minister Netanyahu doubled
down calling for total Victory and
dismissing the h Mass response to the US
ceasefire
proposal the US Secretary of State still
believes a deal is possible and at the
agq of the rivals of Hamas the
Palestinian Authority he repeated to
president Mahmud Abbas that America
wants a Palestinian state which Israel's
leader opposes and reminded Israelis
later that their suffering was no
justification for killing Palestinian
civilians that cannot be a license to
dehumanize
others the overwhelming majority of
people in Gaza had nothing to do with
the attacks of October 7th and the
families in Gaza whose survival depends
on deliveries of aid from Israel are
just like our
families their mothers and fathers Sons
and
Daughters Gaza is the key to stabilizing
the Middle East this is the occupied
Goan Heights another potential flash
point where the borders of Israel
Lebanon and Syria meet over on the
Syrian side you can see ruins from
previous Wars Anthony blinkin warns this
is the most dangerous moment for the
Middle East since
1973 without a ceasefire in Gaza the
risks that a wider war will intensify
remain very
real Israel has heavily reinforced its
northern Borderlands this is a former

could become even
worse this is the most dangerous the
most unstable Frontier in the Middle
East at the moment what started as a
low-level War back in October has been
intensifying but all sides know how much
worse it could get not just causing
great destruction in Israel and in
Lebanon but it's also got the capacity
to ignite the region
the fate of the whole Middle East not
just Israel's empty evacuated Northern

3xHQtW_fCHg,Israel PM rejects Hamas's proposed Gaza ceasefire terms | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel PM rejects Hamas's proposed Gaza ceasefire terms  BBC News.jpg,"hello I'm Marian maseri a very warm
welcome to the Daily Global on BBC News
let's start in the Middle East where in
the last hour Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will
not be satisfied with anything other
than total victory over Hamas he also
said Israeli troops have been ordered to
prepare to operate in Rafa in southern
Gaza let's listen to some of what he had
to say tonight I am here to tell you one
thing we are on our way to a complete
Victory the victory is our reach it's
not about years or decades it's about
months the IDF is doing wonderful work
it's working systematically in order to
achieve all of the goals of the world
that we the at the political ranks have
given it which is relinquishing Kamas
releasing the hostages and making sure
Gaza is not threatening Israel anymore
to begin with I said that the final
Victory is our goal this was the
decision I brought to the government at
the beginning of the war and we will not
we will not be satisfied with
les on the next half an hour we're
expecting to hear from US Secretary of
State Anthony blinkin following his
talks with Israeli and Palestinian
officials now those talks come after
what many people see as a positive
reaction from Hamas to a proposed
ceasefire deal which was put together
last week but Mr blinkin has now met
both the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and president Isaac Herzog and
has described a ceasefire deal as both
possible and essential well some reports
suggest the plan provides for a truce of
at least 40 days in return for the
release of Civilian hostages held by
Hamas for now though the war which broke
out in October continues the Hamas run
Health Ministry in Gaza said at least
100 people were killed overnight and
there has been heavy further heavy
bombing of Southern cities including in
Rafa meanwhile Israel says 31 of the
hostages held by Hamas and other groups
in Gaza are now known to have died well
let's hear now from Mr blinken about the
ongoing hostage situation the hostages
are foremost uh on our minds and in our
hearts uh and uh as as you know uh we
now have uh a response from Hamas to the
proposal that was uh put on the table
Way Forward we're looking at it
intensely well Gerson Basin was an
Israeli negotiator for 17 years says he
gave his assessment on the ceasefire
negotiations the Hamas response does
enable some room to maneuver if Hamas
would be willing to separate the first
phase from the second and the third in
other words if Hamas wants a ceasefire
now for 45 days which is something that
I think the Israeli Army would like as
well this could be done and we could see
the release of Civilian hostages from
Gaza those who were remaining
alive well with me now is BBC's chief
Chief International correspondent lease
duet and Lee a difficult job for Mr
blinkin this puts him in a very very
tough position all we've had is these
very public remarks by prime minister
Netanyahu a ferocious rebuke to these
really incessant efforts by the United
States and its Arab Partners to come up
with a plan and it's hard to square
prime minister netanyahu's description
of the Hamas counter offer as
delusional with the remarks we heard
yesterday from the Qatari prime minister
a key mediator in these talks he
described it as positive uh Anthony
blinkin in his first remarks we'll wait
to hear from him shortly he had said
that it was the best way forward a lot
of work still to be done but trying to
give a sense that there was still
something to work for but listening to
prime minister Netanyahu you had a
feeling that this was dead in the water
now he may saying that for public effect
it is known you know sources say that
sometimes in private negotiations he
adopts a different tone and a greater
Readiness to consider proposals but the
Israelis seem to see this as an effort
by Hamas to end the war on its own terms
which is utterly unacceptable but it's
interesting what gersan Basin said which
is which goes to the heart of the matter
now is it possible to salvage something
from this proposal the Hamas counter
offer is a three-phase one over about
135 days and the first phase which would
include a a temporary pause of about 45
days would release the most vulnerable
of the hostages women children the
elderly the ones of which there is
greatest concern about greatest there's
concern about all of them but those
first in exchange for some prisoners and
some desperately needed humanitarian aid
but we make it we'll see just what kind
of a tone um and blinkin adopts uh it's
it's very cuz this is all there is right
now and it's all about tone isn't it
really because if you heard the tone of
Mr Netanyahu you could feel there that
there was no consiliary element in his
tone at all but there never is his manra
has not shifted an inch total Victory
absolute Victory and tonight he said it
was within touching distance it was a
matter of months now as you know when
you've reported on your program there
had been assessments by his own military
team that actually they weren't that
close that Hamas was actually even in
the north of the Gaza Strip which has
been raised to the ground where Israeli
forces in large part moved away from to
concentrate on the south Hamas was
reestablishing civilian control Hamas is
still able to fire rockets at Israel and
of course alarm Bells Are Ringing right
up to the UN Secretary General Antonio
guz said if you carry out what you say
is your plan then to go for for Rafa at
the southernmost corner where half of
the population has been pushed this
would be the disaster of disasters in
the meantime people are still dying in
Gaza uh we saw the Hamas ran Health
Minister saying over 100 were killed uh
just in the last I think day or so over
27,000 Palestinians and of course there
are still Israeli hostages being held
there I mean this is the I mean Mar we
just reported that 100 died you know
before all this if one person died it
would have been a story
now given the enormity of this
staggering death toll the United Nations
says that if you try to tally up the
Dead the missing and the injured it's
actually 100,000 people which some
177,000 children having one having lost
one or both parents that's a 5% of
gaza's population and prime minister
Netanyahu and the public opinion in in
Israel backs him they want him to hit
Hamas hard as well
uh are saying they want this war to
continue but tonight of course we've
heard of the anguish of the families of
the hostages they of course have been
there's been that blow that 31 families
were told their loved ones are dead
that's a fifth of the hostages in Gaza
so tonight they are urging the Prime
Minister and others again to put the
lives of the hostages first before the
military plan",20240207
liDAI7pmTzg,Have air strikes on Yemen reduced Houthi attacks? | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Have air strikes on Yemen reduced Houthi attacks  BBC News.jpg,"the US and UK have been launching air
strikes on the houthis in Yemen the
houthis are responsible for attacks on
vessels in and around the Red Sea BBC
verifier we've been looking at what's
going on and the impact it's having
let's start off back in November in this
area off the coast of Yemen this is
where houthis backed by Iran have been
launching attacks on ships the first few
are mostly here in the Red Sea many are
near a pinch point the Babel Manda
straight here's an example when houthi
seiz that part isra owned cargo ship the
Galaxy leader and released this footage
after the initial attacks the US and UK
launched air strikes on the houthis on
the 11th of January there were a second
set on the 22nd and over the weekend
there were more this verified video
shows air strikes in the city of s on
Friday night the UK's defense secretary
said these strikes would further degrade
the abilities of the houthis on Sunday
the US said they targeted missiles being
prepared to launch against ships in the
Red Sea data though shows that hthi
attacks have continued in recent weeks
certainly after the initial us UK
strikes they started to move South into
the Gulf of Aiden one example the Marlin
Luanda a tanker with links to the UK it
was set on fire after being hit by a
missile in the 3 weeks before the first
us and UK strikes there were six attacks
on iips in the 3 weeks since the US and
UK action began there were nine no houy
strikes on chips have been confirmed
since last Thursday but it's too early
to be sure if things are changing and
here's the impact there's a lot less
traffic going through the Red Sea now
the volume's Fallen 30% since mid
January if you look at the red here
vessels are now sailing around Africa
and that takes a lot longer it also
costs more this shows the increased cost
for transporting rate it shot up and
those growing costs will have an impact
here they could mean higher cost for
customers",20240206
gtLlqDGQItw,What is Iran's 'Axis of Resistance’? | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\What is Iran's 'Axis of Resistance’  BBC News.jpg,"as the crisis in the Middle East
escalates there's one country the US
references all the time we do not want
this war to widen but if Iran or its
proxies attack us Personnel
anywhere make no mistake we will defend
our people we will defend our security
swiftly and decisively last weekend
three US soldiers were killed in a drone
attack the location was Northeastern
Jordan the target was US military base
called Tower 22 the group claiming
responsibility is the Islamic resistance
in Iraq but the US is clear on where
blame really lies our teams here are
continuing to do the analysis but we
know that um Iran is behind it and um
certainly as as we've said before here
in this in this briefing room um Iran
continues to arm and equip these groups
to launch these attacks Iran calls these
claims baseless accusations but Iran
does have a network of allies across the
region it has a name for it the axis of
resistance United it says in its
opposition to Israel and the US this
axis includes the group behind the tower
22 attack Iran has taken advantage
frankly of the the current moment of
conflict to do what Iran has been doing
for many many years which is to
disrupt uh to Target the US and partners
in a variety of ways
um mostly through the efforts of its um
proxy militias and since hamas's attack
on October the 7th and Israel's response
to it this disruption has taken many
forms for example houthi rebels in Yemen
have repeatedly attacked shipping in the
Red Sea the US says there have been over
160 attacks by militia on its military
positions in Iraq and Syria but how does
this network of allies work how close is
their relationship with Iran and what is
Iran trying to achieve if we go back to
1979 there was an uprising in Iran
against the monarchy Iran became an
Islamic Republic ever since it sought to
spread its influence in the region in
recent years that's involved support for
the Assad regime in Syria where Iranian
forces have been deployed support for
large militant groups such as Hezbollah
in Lebanon and the houthis in Yemen and
support for smaller groups including in
Iraq we have a whole range of Iraqi Shia
militias um which have been formed in
lots of different ways and have very
different connections with Iran and in
fact the they're in an umbrella movement
that has non- Shia militias included as
well so it's very complicated to
navigate the types of links uh within
that part of the axis of resistance and
Iran support for its Network comes in
several forms first money in 2020 the US
estimated that Iran gave Hezbollah $700
million a year as well as a $100 million
a year to Palestinian groups including
Hamas and it estimates the houthis have
received hundreds of millions of dollars
too Iran doesn't acknowledge this
funding but as well as money Iran is
supplying weapons too recently two US
military personnel died in an operation
to intercept a boat in the Red Sea the
US released this image it says the boat
was transporting iranian-made weapons to
the houthis or there's Hezbollah one
estimate put its Arsenal at 130,000
rockets and missiles it's believed many
of those
come from Iran and if Iran is supplying
money and weapons is it also
coordinating the actions of its allies
after October the 7th the US
acknowledged we have not yet seen
evidence that Iran directed or was
behind this particular attack more
broadly Iran's allies appear to operate
with a significant degree of
Independence but that needs placing in
context Iran does not
necessarily exert daytoday oper
operational control over each and every
one of its proxies but that's that being
said when you provide strategic
Direction when you provide significant
material when you provide significant
training uh you cannot expect you cannot
um avoid uh culpability and given this
level of support from Iran inevitably
many are asking what does it want well
to understand this we again need to look
at Iran's history not least the Iran
Iraq war of the 1980s which began when
Iraq invaded Iran doesn't necessarily
see itself as an aggressive actor it
sees itself as deeply
vulnerable uh in particular uh memories
of the Iran Iraq war um when it was very
vulnerable to Iraqi missiles and many
people died are absolutely key in Iran's
political conception of where it sits in
the region um so its whole policy is
built on never again allowing itself to
be encircled or isolated and to meet
that goal the axis of resistance is
crucial it is not looking for a massive
escalation and a war outright with the
us or Israel what it's interested in
however is maintaining the kind of
equilibrium and violence groups that it
has across the region in a statement
this week Iran's revolutionary guard
said we do not seek war but we are not
afraid of War Iran's motivations and
Ambitions are a fiercely contested
subject but as the US calibrates its
response to the tower 22 attack there's
no debate that the axis of resistance is
crucial to Iran's efforts to position
itself in the region and to challenge
Israel and America",20240205

against the iran-backed group us Central
Command said it struck missiles which
were preparing to launch against ships
in the Red Sea the British prime
minister Rishi sunak said the joint air
strikes were in self-defense that houthi

Consequences this as America's top
Diplomat US Secretary of State Anthony
Lincoln embarks on his fifth trip to the
Middle East in the past 4 months tension
with Iran which supports the houthis are
rising and Washington has also accused
tyan of having its fingerprints on the
Drone attack that killed 3s US soldiers
at a military base in Jordan last week
the White House has warned that its
retaliatory air strikes on Iran link
Targets in Iraq and Syria are just the
beginning not the end of its response
Iran denies involvement but its
affiliate the Islamic resistance in Iraq
has claimed
responsibility so what is the US
Secretary of State hoping to achieve on
his Middle East Tour while an American
official says Anthony blinkin will push
for progress on a hostage deal that
includes a humanitarian pause he'll talk
to Arab Nations about what happens the
day after a deal is struck and we're
told Mr blinken plans to talk directly
to countries in the region about the
scope of us actions taken in retali
for the deaths of those US service
members last week well let's go live to
our Middle East correspondent Hugo Pacha
who is in Baghdad for us so uh Hugo a
busy agenda for Mr blink it is a bit of
a juggling act that he's got isn't
it exactly so you know the main goal of
his trip is to try to secure the release
of the hostages who remain in captivity
in Gaza more than a 100 hostages who
were kidnapped during the Hamas attack
attacks in Israel back in October and
the at the same time uh secure a pausing
hostilities in Gaza to Guaranty the
delivery of humanitarian Aid to the
Palestinian uh population of Gaza but at
the same time we're seen that you know
the Americans are heavily involved in
what is happening elsewhere in the
region we've seen that there have been
more American air strikes targeting the
houthis in Yemen the Americans are
saying that this is about uh
guaranteeing a freedom of navigation uh
in that uh region that this doesn't have
anything to do with the war in Gaza the
houthis are saying that these attacks
are going to continue that they are
acting uh in solidarity with the
Palestinians in Gaza and that uh these
attacks are going to continue unless
there is a ceasefire in Gaza so Gaza at
the very heart of what is happening in
Yemen and then uh the situation here in
Iraq and Syria uh American officials are
saying that the American response to
those attacks targeting uh us bases in
those countries uh have just begun and
uh more attacks are going to uh come in
the next uh few days we saw the first
wave of air strikes targeting Iranian
interests in Iraq and Syria on uh the
weekend and I think uh the focus now is
on Iran and its Proxes and how or if uh
they're going to respond so a very busy
agenda for Anthony blinkin as he returns
to the Middle East yeah I'm interested
you're in back out what has been the
government reaction there to those
retaliation strikes from the US on those
Targets in the Middle
East yeah I think people are still
waiting to see what is going to come
next because the Americans are saying
that this is just the beginning that
more air strikes are going to happen or
more steps are going to be taken to
Target those uh groups uh supported by
Iran uh groups that have been uh behind
uh you know attacks on us bases uh in
Iraq and Syria at least that's the
accusation being made by the Americans
uh but there was you know some strong
response from the Iraqi government
saying that those air strikes violated
uh the country's sovereignty now they're
making the case for negotiations to
happen for the end of the American
Military presence here uh in Iraq uh I
don't think anything is going to happen
anytime soon but again uh it shows how
tense how volatile the situation here uh
has been uh and again I think people are
waiting to see not only in terms of what
is going to happen uh in relation to
those uh American uh attacks but also
how or if uh Iran and its Proxes are
going to respond you Goa a Middle East

senior International correspondent Olan

do we
know well America's retaliation is
underway Jane we know that 85 targets
have been struck in Syria and here in
Iraq American bombers have been flying
long range missions from the United
States which hold that they have
targeted command and control centers
associated with Iran's revolutionary
guards and with Allied Iranian militias
now the region has been on a countdown
Jane since last Sunday since those
American troops were killed President
Biden has been trying if you like to
square a circle to come up with a
response that is strong enough to
satisfy public opinion in the United
States in an election year strong enough
to satisfy Republican pressure but not
so strong that it triggers a much
harsher reaction from Iran or from any
of these proxy militias now that is a
very difficult balance to strike we
don't yet have any reports about the
casualties the numbers of people killed
or the damage that has been inflicted by
these strikes tonight the Americans have
said it will be a multi-tiered response
it could be several locations over
several days we've been told that the
first thing we see will not be the last
thing we see so this action will
continue and the US Secretary of State
Lloyd Austin has said there is a way to
manage this so that things do not
escalate out of control well now we will
see if that is actually the case the
Middle East is a tinder box at the
moment this is a new and dangerous
moment but the Iranian leader himself uh
Ibrahim RI said today that Iran did not
want to start a war but that if anybody
tried to pressure it or bully it there
would be a strong response so white
house and Tran saying the same thing
they don't want a major escalation but
it's unclear if the situation will be
contained",20240202

as President Joe Biden has approved
sanctions on four Israeli settlers
accused of attacking Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank the sanctions block
the individuals from accessing all of us
property assets and the American
Financial system violence in the West
Bank has spiked since Hamas launched an
unprecedented attack on Israel on
October the 7th Mr Biden signed a broad
executive order saying violence in the
West Bank had reach reached intolerable
levels threatening peace and stability
in the region well our Middle East
correspondent Nick beak is in Jerusalem
and gave his analysis on what this says
about tensions between Israel and the US
this is significant and also symbolic
and as you say it's the first time the
Administration has imposed these sort of
sanctions and just listening to White
House officials they say that they
mirror the kind of measures that
normally would be put on terrorist
suspects or terrorist
sympathizers to use their terminology
and the reason for this the White House
says is that the the levels of settler
violence against Palestinians in the
West Bank has reached an intolerable
level and they say it's not just
Palestinians there who are suffering but
also the prospects of a peace deal in
the future a two-state solution are all
being undermined by this and so that's
why this action's been taken it means
for example these four individuals won't
be able to access any funds any
donations or money that might be coming
from the United States as well as not
being able to to travel there now the
the Israeli government here LED of
course by prime minister Benjamin Nyah
who was said these aren't needed because
they're already taking tough action
against settlers and any violence there
and also within the settler movement
here in Israel they've condemned this
action by the us too and Nick let's also
talk about this potential progress to a
ceasefire uh in the fighting in Gaza
what is the latest in those
conversations what's happening behind
the scenes and of course there's also
the conversations about the release of
those Israeli hostages all going
on absolutely I mean for the the
families of the hostages who were taken
by Hamas on October the 7th as well of
course of the people of of Gaza a a
peace deal some sort of ceasefire can't
come soon enough and some hope has been
generated in the past 24 hours or so uh
in particular because of comments from
the foreign Ministry in Qatar saying
that Hamas was looking at a deal and had
been broadly optimistic and had been
broadly accepting of it just to sort of
rewind a little bit you might remember
back in November katar the Gulf State
played a really leading role a crucial
role in getting the initial wave of
hostages released at the weekend there
were these talks between Israeli
American qari and Egyptian officials
basically spy Chiefs people who normally
do all their work in the shadows behind
closed doors so there was this
conversation uh in Paris at the weekend
and now behind the scenes the diplomacy
and the the work continues so at the
moment there isn't any deal but if you
look at the Israeli newspapers this
morning and the and the websites this is
the lead story for everyone there is
cautious optimism cautious though that
we may be inching towards a deal but as
is often the case you know it might come
very very quickly or it might be that
there are stumbling blocks that means
behind the scenes the
negotiations negotiations continue for
some days and some weeks so we're in
this process but hard to assess at what
point we're at at the moment Frankie

series of strikes on Iranian Targets in
Syria and Iraq after a drone attack
killed three US soldiers in Jordan near
the Syrian border on Sunday the attack
injured 41 other US troops at this
military base known as Tower 22 the US
defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the
United States would not tolerate attacks
on American troops this is a dangerous
moment in the Middle East we will
continue to work to avoid a wider
conflict in a region but we will take
all necessary actions to defend the
United States our interest and our
people and we will
respond when we
choose where we choose and how we
choose our North America editor Sarah
Smith joins us now and what more do we
know about that
response well we know that plans have
been approved approved for a series of
strikes over a number of days so this
action will take a while uh targeting
Iranian personnel and Facilities but not
inside Iran in Iraq and in Syria that's
where the uh Iranian backed militia
who've been attacking US forces have
been operating from that's where uh they
were operating from when they killed
three US soldiers at the weekend and
that distinction is very very important
because if America was actually to
strike targets inside Iran itself that
would risk dangerously escalating
tensions in the region and this is the
the really delicate balance America is
trying to come up with they need
decisive retaliation that is dramatic
enough they hope to deter further
attacks on their forces but at the same
time they don't want to do anything that
could cause the conflict to spread
that's the very thing they've been
trying to avoid happening and Sarah in
another development we've learned
tonight that President Biden is taking
action against the number of Israeli
settlers who've been accused of
attacking Palestinians in the the
occupied West
Bank yeah this is really unusual he's
signed an executive order so that means
the president can do this all by himself
to impose sanctions on just four for now
um Israeli settlers and there has been
an an uptaking violence some of it
deadly against Palestinians in the West
Bank America has been growing
increasingly frustrated by that so they
are applying now the same sanctions
against some Israeli settlers that they
apply to terrorist organizations and
that has clearly infuriated the Israeli
government who say they're the ones who
will take action against law Breakers in
their country and that these unusual
measures are completely unnecessary and
I think this gives us a glimpse of uh
something wider and important that has
been going on and that is America and
President Biden himself's frustrations
with the Israeli government they're
having constant conversations not just
about this but about the conduct of the
war in Gaza they're having disagreements
and they feel that Benjamin Netanyahu
the Israeli Prime Minister is not
listening to them um not doing what they
ask and this I think just shows us a
rare sight in public of what is an
increasing riff between America and
Israel",20240201

to use against our troops and our
facilities and to send send a strong
signal uh uh to their backers in the
irgc that these attacks are unacceptable
and we're going to do the president will
do what he has to do to protect our
troops and our facilities and to look
after our national security uh our
national security interest in the
region Brad Bowman is a senior director
of the center on Military and political
power at the foundation for defense of
democracies Brad thank you very much for
being with us um what do you take from
what you've heard this afternoon what
what do you think President Biden and
his security team are
thinking I thanks for the opportunity to
join you I think the Biden
administration's clear goal here is to
restore deterrence which was clearly
tattered I mean we've seen more than 167
attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria
and now Jordan with these three service
members paying for it with their lives
and this Administration has to act
there's bipartisan consensus on that I
believe it has to act strongly it's
premise throughout uh the last few weeks
at least since October 7th if not long
before that is that American restraint
uh was the best way to do this uh many
Republicans on Capitol Hill worry that
that restraint is what got us to this
point and that restraint has been read
by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its
Terror proxies as weakness and a green
light for additional aggression that's
really interesting because I was asking
this question last night whether
American first policy talk of withdrawal
the language from the administration
that there needs to be restraint whether
all of that in is in fact seen as
weakness in Russia Iran China um we've
seen a tweet today from from Wesley
Clark the former supreme commander of
NATO who said stop talking about about
retaliation and restraint just go after
the people who are sending the bombs and
that's
Iran yeah you know we sometimes forget
you know I worked for in the US Senate
for nine years we sometimes forget that
leaders can't talk to One audience at a
time right and so when when you're
speaking in Brussels or Washington or
Davos you're talking about restraint and
reason and proportionality it all sounds
very good and it earns you cool points
but I I do worry many in Washington
worry that our adversaries hear very
differently and if you're on a
playground you say hey I don't want to
fight I don't want to fight what do you
expect the bully to do keep throwing
punches and unfortunately that's what
we've seen both in the Red Sea with the
houthis and also in Iraq and Syria with
the Iranian proxies and militias there
so when you talk about a strong response
are you saying that it needs to go
beyond a strike on the proxies does it
have to in some way stretch the
boundaries of what we might ordinarily
consider
proportional my view is that what the
Islamic Republic of Iran is doing is a
decades long strategy where they're the
puppet master and they use Terror uh
puppets proxies around the region I'm
thinking of Hezbollah Hamas Palestinian
Islamic Jihad and now the houthis to
advance Iran's foreign policy objectives
while displacing the consequences and
the counterpunches onto others usually
Arabs it's it's going quite swimmingly
for because everyone's focusing on the
proxies right now meanwhile Iran is
inching toward a nuclear weapons
capability and and has has put a least
on hold for now normalization between
Saudi Arabia and Israel so um the bottom
line is we can't have our adversaries
from an American perspective thinking
that they can kill American Service
members and get away with it so we're
going to see a strong response I predict
much of it will come in Syria maybe in
Iraq there's some reasons why the
administration might want to avoid that
um and I think if we only go after the
proxies and not go after some of the
Islamic revolutionary guard Corp uh
elements particularly in Syria and
elsewhere then it plays right into
Iran's Puppet Master puppet strategy
that I just described all that said
you'll have heard our discussion on the
deal that's being discussed was
discussed in Paris at the weekend and
also the warnings from the Qatari prime
minister who was in Washington yesterday
that a response that goes too far could
complicate the whole
process that's fine it's interesting
though people always express concern
about escalation when America is talking
about responding but let me
reiterate 167 attacks since October 17th
on US forces so how would anyone expect
the United States to respond and uh you
know I think In This Moment the danger
really is too weak of a response but
I'll hasten to add if the administration
hits back hard and doesn't take steps to
protect American forces we're going to
Simply see a more American casualties we
saw that after the solomani killing in
January 2020 where we had more than 100
americ an in two bases in Northern Iraq
suffered from traumatic brain injury
because there wasn't sufficient air and
missile defense in the region so hit
them hard yes restore deterrence if
possible but expect an escalation at
least in the short term and make sure
you've taken steps in advance to protect
American forces that's what I would be
offering to the administration in this
moment well the president has put them
on notice uh we will keep watching
through the night um because it sounds
like it could be imminent Brad Bowman
thank you very much indeed for that
thank you thank you",20240131

because for weeks Aid agencies have been
warning of the huge scale of Destruction
in Gaza no journalists though have been
allowed in to independently check those
claims now BBC verify working with
academics whove used satellite radar
mapping analysis can show the extent of
Israel's military strikes they found
that more than half of gaza's buildings
have now been destroyed or damaged
during the war with Israel BBC verifies
Merlin Thomas has the latest
more than half of gaza's buildings have
been damaged or destroyed since Israel
launched its retaliation for the Hamas
attacks of 7th of October that's
according to new data now take a look at
this map of the Gaza Strip this is from
the 12th of October just a few days
after the War Began and the red bits you
can see show the damage of destroyed
buildings in the area but look at this
this is on the 29th of November you can
see just how much of the north was
destroyed that's why the original
Israeli offensive was focused since then
that offensive was expanded to the whole
Strip This is the most recent map we
have from the 29th of January you can
see the extent of the damage
particularly in the South and Israel had
repeatedly told gazans to move South for
their safety this is the city of carun
and it's been severely affected and if
we look at satellite images that gives
us an idea of the scale of Destruction
on the ground particularly because no
International journalists have been
allowed in by
Israel this is from the 2nd of December
near two months into the war and you can
see just how much of the neighborhood of
carun looks undamaged this Tower here Al
it was the tallest building in the
neighborhood now just 6 weeks later take
a look at what happens much of the
neighborhood has been flattened by
Israeli attacks and the damage is even
more striking from ground level what
were once bustling cities full of life
now derelict and destroyed the Israel
Defense Forces have said these attacks
areen necessary because Hamas
deliberately embeds itself in civilian
areas but questions have been asked
about destruction of buildings seemingly
firmly in the control of the IDF take a
look at this this is a video it's isra
University in Northern Gaza and it was
already badly damaged before it was
blown up completely and what looks like
a massive controlled explosion the IDF
says the approval process for the blast
is now being
investigated and large areas of farm
land across Gaza have also been
extensively damaged that's important
because although Palestinians were
heavily dependent on Imports before the
start of the war a lot of their food
came from farming and food production
from inside the strip but areas that
were once used to produce food have now
been churned up and bulldozed marked out
for Israeli armored
vehicles now Aid agencies say half of
gasa's population faces starvation the
IDF told us they found
Hamas tunnel entrances and rocket launch
sites in various agricultural areas and
with so many neighborhoods and homes
destroyed people have had no choice but
to flee more than 80% of gaza's
population have been displaced and
nearly half of them crammed in the far
southern end of the strip that's
according to the UN so small cities of T
have sprung up in Rafa close to the
Egyptian border this is from the 15th of
October if you watch this area because
you'll see just how many tents have
popped up people who have come seeking
Refuge displace people and the Israel
Defense Forces have repeatedly Justified
their actions by noting that Hamas
deliberately embeds itself in civilian
areas and explains the destruction of
buildings in light of targeting Fighters
but experts have said the extent and
pace of the damage when compared with
other conflicts like Ukraine and Syria
is unprecedented
gaza's landscape has changed forever for
those who survived the bombardment the
question is will there be anywhere left
for them to go Merlin Thomas there on
the BBC verifi team well among the sites
destroyed are significant religious
buildings between October the 7th and
the end of last year Israeli bombardment
has damaged or destroyed 72 mosques and
the only two churches in Gaza Heritage
that locals say is now lost forever
our Global religion reporter reaha Kara
explained how they'd measured the damage
to those sites under International
humanitarian law it's considered a war
crime to Target religious sites unless
they are being used for military
purposes now the Israeli Defense Forces
they argue that some of these sites have
been used by Hamas for military purposes
Hamas say that 378 mosques and three
churches have been destroyed but we
can't independently verify those figures
and so this is why it's very important
for us to do our own counting because we
are able to then attribute what we found
online which is at least we found 117
leads on social media that alluded to
the partial destruction or complete
damage of overwhelmingly mosques and
churches and we have been using user
generated content that is Imes and
videos that people have posted onto
social media and comparing them to
befores and afters um of these mosks and
churches as well as satellite imagery
yeah and piecing together all those
different bits of information and being
able to verify you know that those
images are what they say they are is is
a task in itself isn't it um paint a
picture for us if you will of the type
of Destruction that you've seen in these
images well the most Stark for me is um
when we were using satellite imagery I
think
when you're on social media and you are
looking to compare it's very easy to
find before and afters of the
destruction you will see many raised
flattened uh mosques or partially
damaged churches but an aerial view
really provides a stark image of the
before which is very vibrant colorful
neighborhoods compared to the afters
which are very gray no color yeah it is
terrifying isn't it and especially when
with looking at images like this as well
of just utter destruction um and there
is a specific church as well that you've
been looking into because not only of
course are these images of of lives lost
uh damage that and as we said there
locals saying the sort of culture that
will never come back there are
individual stories involved in each of
these tell us about the church that you
looked at specifically so St por ferious
church was one of the churches that was
partially damaged um earlier during the
war on the 19 19th of October uh one of
its outbuildings was um hit by a by an
Israeli air strike that wasn't meant to
hit the church grounds um and 18 people
were reportedly killed five of which
have been told were babies um I spoke to
one Lady Marian Saba who fled there with
her family thinking that going to a
church would keep her and her family
safe um but her brother-in-law died
during the uh attack and she is so
concerned for her child who is only a
year old um that 2 weeks later after the
church was attacked she had her baby
baptized if for fear that if her baby
dies she will she will die without one
wow um it's these individual stories
that once again underline just the
tragedy of all of this um you touched on
what the RF have been saying in response
to you know these attacks that have hit
religious facilities what are they
saying well the IDF they have long
argued that Hamas militants are using
some places of worship to launch attacks
from and that's why they are targeting
them the thing is it's unclear how many
of these sites are ham our strongholds
or how many have been um how many have
been targeted by the IDF so they say
they are acting in accordance with
International humanitarian law um but
they also say that they are trying to
mitig civilian harm as much as possible",20240130
PhcGamJhJek,"UK considering recognising Palestine state, Lord Cameron says | BBC News","data/en_BBCNews\UK considering recognising Palestine state, Lord Cameron says  BBC News.jpg","the foreign secretary Lord Cameron has
suggested Britain is ready to bring
forward the moment when it formally
recognizes a Palestinian State he told a
reception at Westminster that the
Palestinian people had to be given a
political Horizon to encourage peace in
the Middle East well let's get more on
this James landel our diplomatic
correspondent is here with me really
interesting these comments James and and
you were there listening to David Cam
and so to just tell us more about how he
framed this essentially what he was
saying is that something has to be done
to start to political discussion so not
just the immediate short-term talks to
try and end the fighting now but
actually something that can start
unpicking a political process and his
suggestion one of the suggestions was he
said look you know there are lots of
preconditions Hamas has to stop fighting
it has to be guaranteed no longer a
threat the leadership have to leave Gaza
Etc but he also said on the Palestinian
side some movement has to happen to try
and give an incentive to Palestinians to
engage in a in politics rather than
fighting and his idea was to say look
why why don't you have the recognition
of a Palestinian State not as the end
outcome of long-term solution to the
Middle East crisis but something that
would be part of the negotiation so it's
more immediate as as as he said it
provides a political Horizon for
Palestinians now that is a change in the
British position the British position
was always you know we'll support you
know two State solution at some point
he's just saying well maybe we bring
that earlier it's really interesting and
certainly the timing of it is also
interesting would the UK consider doing
this unilaterally no I mean the minister
was asked about this in the house of
comms today he made it very clear this
is not something that's going to be done
unilaterally is a straightforward you
know oneoff thing this is clearly
something that Mr Cameron wants to do
with allies uh but what he said and it's
certainly not going to happen tomorrow
um there has been some criticism in the
House of Commons about this some
conservative MPS have said you know this
whole idea of re would be rewarding
Hamas for the atrocities of October 7th
I think the government's position is
this is not that this is not anything
immediate it's just saying in the future
when those negotiations potentially if
they happen maybe you bring forward that
process to give Palestinians some
confidence that in Mr Cameron's words uh
that there is irreversible progress to a
two-state solution and really briefly I
mean you are talking about longterm
because obviously in the immediate and
the short term I mean the number of
obstacles to actually getting to that
place are just enormous enormous there's
very very little trust and that's why Mr
Cameron is in the region again his
fourth trip since he's only been in post
for two and a half months he's in Oman
um just trying to keep everybody talking
for all the problems that are many at
least there are conversations going on
at the moment James SEL thanks very much
for taking through thank you",20240130

but it will protect itself and respond
appropriately following the Drone attack
that killed three American soldiers and
wounded dozens near the Jordan Syria
border at a remote Outpost called Tower
22 since Israel's retaliation for the
October the 7th attacks US military
bases in Syria and Iraq have been
attacked more than 170 times the group
behind the deaths at the tower 22 Base
called Islamic resistance in Iraq a part
of an Iranian sponsored Network across
the Middle East known as the axis of
resistance there's a number of
pro-iranian militias based in Iraq Syria
Lebanon the Palestinian territories and
as far south as Yemen all are opposed to
Israel and the United States from
Washington our North America editor
Sarah Smith has the
latest in The Situation Room President
Biden with his defense secretary is
considering his military reaction we're
told he's weighing his options he needs
to retaliate but without causing more
conflict we do not seek another War we
do not seek to escalate but we will
absolutely do what is required to
protect ourselves to continue that
mission and to respond appropriately to
these attacks shortly after he learned
of the attack yesterday Mr Biden Ved the
US will respond and we shall respond now
he needs to decide what that response
will be his secretary of state warning
other actors not to get involved from
the
outset we've been very clear in warning
that anyone looking to take advantage of
conflict in the Middle
East uh and try to expand it don't do it
the US has not said which militia group
it believes is responsible for the
attack on their base in Jordan or why
the deadly drone was not
intercepted President Biden's opponents
lay the blame on him and are demanding
he Target Iran itself in response
Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on X I'm
calling on the Biden Administration to
strike targets of significance inside
Iran not only as a reprisal for the
killing of our forces but as DET Terence
against future aggression the Senate's
top Republican Mitch McConnell said the
cost of failure to deter Americans
adversaries is again measured in
American lives and Donald Trump's
response well he claims this attack
would never have happened If I Was
President not even a
chance in Teran the Iranian government
denied involvement in the
attack a spokesman said the militias do
not take orders from
Iran the three soldiers killed yesterday
have been named as specialist Brianna
Moffett specialist Kennedy Sanders and
Sergeant William
Rivers their deaths will Mark a new
phase in America's role in the
escalating tensions of the Middle
East
so what are the options that President
Biden is weighing up inside the White
House well he could redouble America's
efforts to attack the Iranian banked
militias in the region who have been
striking at US forces but those have
obviously so far failed to deter those
groups from striking at Americans a much
more aggressive response would be to try
to Target the source of the Iranian
missiles and drones that those groups
are using he could go after uh the
Iranian Revolution guard in positions in
Iraq or Syria rather than in Iran itself
but even that would risk some kind of
escalation from Iran I mean just as the
US says it is not seeking war and it
doesn't want conflict with Iran it's
pretty convinced that Teran doesn't want
some kind of direct conflict with
Washington but everybody knows they have
to take great care in this delicate and
dangerous situation Sarah thank you Lee
duet is here with me in the studio Le as
well as focusing on how to respond to
the deaths of its Soldiers the US is
still trying to find ways to pause
Israel's war in Gaza and bring home the
remaining hostages held by Hamas which
is regarded as a terrorist organization
by many Western governments including
the UK what can you tell us in the last
hour the US's top Diplomat Anthony
blinkin that you heard in that report
said that the United States was very
very actively pursuing this now we
focused on these talks briefly last
night here on the 10 what's new today is
that there are new details provided by
the prime minister of Qatar which is
playing a pivotal role in these
discussions and he said in Washington
that they were now ready to present a
framework to Hamas after a weekend of
talks in Paris involving spy Chiefs from
Israel the United States and Egypt the
Prime Minister spoke of good progress he
said in achieving a ceasefire which
would allow um some 100 hostages being
held by Hamas um in Gaza in exchange for
thousands of Palestinian prisoners and
the delivery of more Aid now it has to
be said that today there's a less
positive assessment from Israel which
spoke of significant gaps unacceptable
conditions and one official vowing that
Israeli troops won't leave Gaza until in
his words complete Victory but Israel is
under pressure to bring the hostages
home most of all from the amilies of the
hostages so while there are gaps these
crucial talks Will Go On",20240129

Paul Adams BBC
News Let's cross now to Washington and
speak to our correspondent Gary odonahue
President Biden has made it clear that
the US will retaliate Gary but what
might that look
like Marita there's huge pressure going
to be huge pressure on Joe Biden to
respond to this particularly now we're
in an election year one Senator one
Republican senator has already called
for direct strikes on Iran itself now
Joe Biden has said America will respond
at a time and place of its choosing and
he's been meeting with his top military
and intell Ence brass today typically in
these circumstances the Pentagon offers
a menu of options possibly ranging from
a strike on the group that launched the
Drone right through to attacks on Iran
now all this goes against the background
of sensitive talks in Paris over a
possible ceasefire in Gaza and the
American desire to stop this escalating
further there have been dozens of these
attacks on Americans throughout the
region since October and there have been
responses the problem is that this one
killed Americans and for Joe Biden that
means that public opinion and the desire
to deter Iran means that the response
this time will have to be qualitatively
different Gary thank you well Lis dueta
Chief International correspondent is
with me is this the escalation that
everyone has been fearing Le well it's
an escalation in two ways it's an
escalation in tension in the region but
also as we've been hearing from Gary a
huge ratcheting up of pressure on the US
president who is the Commander in Chief
since this uh Gaza Israel war erupted on
October the 7th the United States has
been trying to do everything possible to
avoid the enlarging and intensifying of
this confrontation most of all
Washington and Teran have avoided direct
confrontation President Biden knows that
if he and his military and intelligence
advisers do succumb to that pressure to
attack Iran directly that will set off
and even more dangerous spiral they have
many other targets to choose from there
are Iranian assets across the region
they have struck them before during this
crisis but the real problem Rita is that
they have to be not just seen to do
something they have to seen to succeed
and we've already seen that with the
attacks against the houthis in the Red
Sea it didn't stop the houthi attacks it
only intensified them and similarly this
attack this retaliation by America may
not stop the attacks all that will stop
the attacks is a ceasefire in Gaza and
that has not been on President Biden
agenda nor the Israelis but there are
talks underway as Gary Odon who
mentioned a small glimmer of hope
tonight those talks involving senior
intelligence figures from from Israel
the United States from Egypt Qatari
prime minister are being described as
positive Prime min Min Netanyahu of
Israel has said though the gaps are
significant but the talks are
constructive they will continue it is a
second stage of a exchange of Israel
hopes all of the remaining hostages
around 130 held by Hamas and other
groups in exchange for what Hamas wants
is all the prisoners in Israeli jails
all for all that's not going to happen
we understand that the one of the gaps
is around how long truce would have to
happen to have that many prisoners
released in exchange for that many
hostages there was an estimate it could
take two months and meanwhile Israel is
intensifying its attacks against Hamas
in Gaza which is causing ever growing
hardship and suffering Le thank you very
much least do set there",20240128

week to discuss the decision by the
bod's top Court to call for Israel to
prevent genocidal acts in Gaza Israel
has made clear it will continue to
defend itself against Hamas and has
described claims of genocide as
outrageous the judges stopped short of
demanding an immediate halt to Israel's
military operation here's our diplomatic
correspondent Paul
Adams gaza's despair just seems to
deepen Gaza City a rare glimpse of Aid
brings chaos and precious little relief
after 3 and a half months of war the
Palestinian population is on its knees
hungry sick or dead whether this amounts
to genocide is a decision for another
day but all this the un's top Court
insists has to stop before it gets worse
the military operation conducted by
Israel after 7 October 2023 has resulted
inter Alia in tens of thousands of
deaths and injuries and the destruction
of homes schools medical facilities and
other vital infrastructure as well as
displacement on a massive scale in these
circumstances the court considers that
the catastrophic humanitarian situation
in the Gaza Strip is at serious risk of
deteriorating further before the court
renders its final judgment by
overwhelming majorities the Court's 17
judges ruled that Israel must avoid void
killing or seriously harming
Palestinians mentally or physically
inflicting living conditions designed to
destroy the Palestinian population in
whole or in part or imposing measures
which prevent Palestinian births the
judges also said Israel must take all
measures to prevent and punish public
incitement to genocide and do more
immediately to improve humanitarian in
assistance on October the 7th last year
Hamas gunman launched devastating
attacks on Israeli communities bordering
the Gaza Strip more than 1,200 Israelis
were
killed Israel's response was
overwhelming since then more than 26,000
Palestinians have been killed mostly
women and children entire neighborhoods
have been destroyed almost 2 million
Palestinians have had to flee their
homes States now have a clear legal
obligation to stop Israel's genocidal
war on the Palestinian people in Gaza
and to make sure that they are not
complicit the icj order is an important
reminder that no state is above the
law crucially the court did not demand
an immediate ceasefire but it wants
Israel to behave very differently at a
time when its prime minister says the
war could go on for many more months
like every country Israel has an
inherent right to defend itself the vile
attempt to deny Israel this fundamental
right is blatant discrimination against
the Jewish State and it was justly
rejected the charge of genocide leveled
against Israel is not only false it's
outrageous and decent people everywhere
should reject
it the court also called for Israeli
hostages to be released without
condition but it's powerless to make any
of this happen today's ruling was
significant but it doesn't necessarily
mean that an end to the agony of
Palestinians or Israelis is any closer
Paul Adams BBC
News well a little earlier our Middle
East correspondent Mark loen explained
whether the ruling will materially
change the situation in
Gaza it's legally unenforceable on the
ground Sarah unless it is referred to
the UN Security Council and then passes
in a in a resolution there although the
us could veto that uh but I think what
it does do is it places renewed scrutiny
and renewed pressure on Israel over its
actions in Gaza uh uh to stop um to to
to stop any possible actions that could
be classified as geni genocide uh to
increase humanitarian Aid and to stop
inflammatory language now it is I think
in a sense it's kind of a cog in a wider
wheel of diplomacy and pressure that is
that is in action and is being placed on
on Israel uh so on Friday uh President
Biden spoke to the Emir of Qatar and
president of Egypt about renewed
attempts to reach a ceasefire and we
understand that talks could begin in
France possibly as early as tomorrow uh
between the leaders of the CIA Israel
and Egypt's intelligence agencies and
top officials from Qatar to try uh to
push both Waring sides towards a new
ceasefire deal but at the moment of
course Israel and Hamas are still very
far apart on key issues like the
duration of a ceasefire uh the way which
hostages and Palestinian prisoners could
be released so there are no hopes of an
imminent breakthrough but I think it all
adds together all of these different
elements into a sign that things are
beginning to move again",20240127

Command confirmed today it had shot down
another anti-ship ballistic missile that
was flying towards the USS car from
houthi controlled Yemen the ship was
operating in the Gulf of Aiden a lot of
the focus so far has been on the US UK
response to these attacks but Reuters is
reporting that China is now getting
involved citing four Iranian sources the
report says officials from Beijing have
been asking Iranian counterparts to help
re in the h is the discussions took
place in recent meetings in Beijing and
Tran the attacks have raised the cost of
shipping and insurance for Western
companies that much we know but this is
also a route that is used widely by
ships from China who are exporting to
Europe and we all know what sort of
pressure the Chinese economy is under
right now Beijing does have some
leverage too they take 90% of the
Iranian crude that was exported last
year let's bring in there Neil Thomas
he's a fellow for Chinese politics at a
Asia Society policy Institute Center for
China analysis welcome to uh the program
um it's really interesting this because
we've been wholly focused on on the
western companies but of course a large
part of the Chinese economy is still
dependent on exports and they come on
this
route that's true uh it's certainly
something that concerns International
Trade r large not just the Western
countries there are some reports however
that the houthi rebels in Yemen are
allowing Chinese Flagg ships to sail
through those contested areas and that
the Chinese kind of commercial Navy
isn't experiencing the same type of
difficulties but still like creating
that instability creating that R of
something going wrong in a Chinese ship
or Chinese trade routs uh coming under
attack or you know seeing the danger
plus you know therefore the insurance
premiums rise more generally that's
certainly uh threat to China's interests
as well in the longer term yeah because
I mean just just on that point quickly I
mean presumably not all Chinese exports
travel on Chinese
flagships exactly so it's a problem that
is maybe less direct and less present
for Chinese importers and exporters and
the Chinese economy r large so you
haven't seen uh quite as strong or
immediate a reaction from the Chinese
government but uh perhaps it's an
indication that that is beginning to
change we've seen before in fact we saw
it last year didn't we the sort of
influence that China has over some of
its allies um they broke broke it a deal
between Saudi Arabia and Iran for
instance so so am I right that they they
do have significant leverage over
tan they do have some leverage over tan
that at least is clear I mean China buys
a huge majority of Iran's exported oil
which is obviously a Lifeline for a
regime that's under significant us and
international sanctions uh and you know
China is you know trying to increase its
own presence and diplomatic uh power
within the Middle East so China has some
leverage and some uh intention and some
interests there but at the same time
Iran also has its own uh interest and
its own kind of allies if you like
various Rebel groups and other uh
organizations in the region that it has
to look out for so it's not necessarily
a complete convergence of interests or a
complete asymmetry of power where China
can simply say something H to Iran and
that would be enough to uh stop the
houthis from threatening international
shipping so it be really interesting to
see just how much influence China has so
this will be a big test of its uh
leverage over Iran and whether this
leads to any kind of calming of the
situation if it does that's a big
diplomatic victory for China and that'll
be seen across the region and across the
world
if it doesn't make any difference well
that's going to make China question
potentially what it's getting out of its
relationship with Iran and we could even
see some type of uh economic pressure
being put on tan by Beijing yeah now
while we have we have you uh can we talk
about another issue I mean we've been
learning today that a British man who
disappeared in China five years ago uh
has been jailed on espion charges in
fact he was he was jailed two years ago
beijing's foreign Ministry confirmed
that Ian Stones a businessman around 70
years old was jailed for 5 years by a
Chinese Court in 2022 he was found
guilty of being bribed into providing
intelligence illegally said the Chinese
by external
forces the Chinese Court tried the case
strictly in accordance with the law
fully guaranteed the various legitimate
rights of in stones and arranged for the
UK side to visit and attend his trial
China is a country governed by the rule
of
law so seran Duncan Smith former
conservative leader said that he'd
raised this issue with the British
government uh over a number of years
Neil um and nothing had come out of it
until we got this news today and it just
begs the question what the right
strategy is because there are others
being held in China the policy seems to
be that they don't like the British
government don't like publicity um while
the negoti negotiations ongoing does
this suggest that actually maybe
publicity would be
better it's hard to
say definitively it all depends I think
to some extent or depends to some extent
on the nature of the charges the nature
of different cases but it's certainly
true that we've seen in the past that
the level of publicity attached to some
of these detentions of foreigners in
China has arguably contributed to their
eventual resolution not necessarily
their quick resolution if we remember
the case of the the two Michaels the two
Canadians detained after uh Huawei
executive mongan Joe was detained in
Canada uh it took them 3 years to be
released uh by Chinese authorities after
M had been released uh by the Canadian
authorities but there was a huge amount
of attention on that case and now both
the Michaels are back home in Canada so
it did lead to a resolution uh and argue
that publicity did contribute
interesting Neil Thomas thank you very
much for your thoughts this evening uh
we will see uh what comes of that
Chinese leverage over Iran but",20240126

Counterpoint we've heard the the legal
mechanics but big picture what's next
well big picture is that first of all we
haven't heard from the Israelis what
they're going to say I think we can
guess they're not going to be at all
happy with this uh under the terms of uh
the court of which they are a member
they are supposed to follow through and
do all these things they will argue
they're doing a lot of them already uh
Israel this is one of the provisional
measures Israel must take all measures
to prevent any acts that could be
considered genocidal including killing
members of a group causing bodily harm
inflicting conditions asde to bring
about the destruction of a group
preventing birth so it's not saying
you've got to stop your War it's saying
You' got to fight it in a very different
way and Israel has been saying
throughout it is fighting it within the
constraints of international
humanitarian law and this is the
un's most senior Court saying that
they're not doing that and they need to
do it ASAP without
prejudicing the uh consideration the
court will give to South Africa's
petition in over a long period okay
Jeremy very grateful for your analysis
really appreciate you being with us uh
you mentioned the Israeli government
there we will be hearing uh in around an
hour's time from Mark regev who speaks
for the Israeli government if you're
just joining us you're watching BBC News
we've been watching a ruling in the
international court of justice which has
been giving a provisional ruling on a
case brought by South Africa against
Israel a case of genocide one of the
most serious war crimes if not the most
serious War crime that can have action
brought against it the icj rules on
State against State cases both South
Africa and Israel are signatories to the
genocide convention which is why the icj
has been ruling on this case we can go
live now to the ha and our correspondent
Anna hollan who's been watching
proceedings in the court and Anna talk
to us about the reaction when these
preliminary rulings were
given uh well uh we were inside the
courtroom reaction there was very quiet
as all the journalists were trying to
follow exactly what this means what the
judges have ordered is that Israel stick
to its obligations under the genocide
convention something that actually
Israel has maintained it has done
throughout this entire process ever
since it responded to the Hamas attacks
on the 7th of October uh so just to run
through what uh judge Joan e Donahue
said uh she ordered that uh Israel must
take all measures within its powers to
prevent any genocidal acts it must
ensure there are no statements that
could be seen as incitement to genocide
I'm just looking at some of the reaction
coming through already from various uh
human rights groups this is being seen
as a victory for South Africa which
brought this case under the genocide
convention and yet all the judges are
really doing is saying that Israel must
uphold its existing obligation something
it says it's already doing uh to bring
you a reaction quickly from Human Rights
Watch uh they say the world Court's
Landmark decision puts Israel and its
allies on noticed that immediate action
is needed to prevent genocide and
further atrocities against Palestinian
in Gaza to remind you uh genocide is the
intent to destroy in whole in part an
entire ethnic racial religious or
national group that will be dealt with
later on the merits of the case this is
purely about the provisional measures
requested by South Africa designed to
prevent any escalation and any actions
that could constitute genocide under the
genocide convention okay Anna hollan who
is in the ha for us Anna thank you very
much really appreciate it let's go now
to South Africa and speak to Kingsley
maabela former Chief of Staff to uh
South Africa's foreign affairs minister
uh Mr makab thank you very much for
being with us sir what is your immediate
reaction to this ruling by the
icj good afternoon what a pleasure to
talk to you it's um the ruling actually
um Vindicated sou Africa's concern about
the possibility that there's genocide
going on in G
that's one H but the Judgment the
Judgment was quite lengthy in spelling
out what what what they think are Prim
facty evidence that genocide may be
going including statement made by Senor
Israeli officials and so on so the take
from this is is the responsibility of
Israel as occupying power to take
appropriate measures to prevent genocide
I think that's what everyone takes out
of that of course it was not expected
that the court would interfere with the
what is essentially a mandate of the
security Council to order a ceas fire
Sara didn't get that but Sara got at
least the greater part of what it
requested and and actually the majority
of Judges voted in favor of S afa's View
uh you mentioned an important point
there there was no order of a ceasefire
now you say that in many ways South
Africa wouldn't have expected that but
it's certainly something it would have
wanted is there a feeling or will there
be a feeling amongst Mr ramapo's office
that this doesn't go far enough and that
the court could have done
more well in the absence of a a ceire
judgment the responsibility of course is
squarely a place on Israel to take
appropriate measures to prevent genocide
I think that's that's enough on its own
uh you would you would know there been a
cronous debate within the security
Council around the question of ceasefire
of course Israel takes out of this
judgment the fact that it wasn't ordered
to um seize the hostility immediately
but there are certain measures that are
required to be implemented with
immediate effect including preserving EV
evidence there really it has been a very
bad judgment for Israel in my view the
icj Mr Mela does not have enforcement
Powers it can issue this provisional
ruling but it does not have enforcement
powers and in any case Israel has not
only said that it is already doing its
utmost to prevent harm to civilians but
it's also said that it may not adhere to
any icj ruling how will South Africa
react if that comes to pass well well it
would it would be a very big problem in
terms of pivate Regulation perception if
Israel really refuses to implement any
of the measures that the court came up
with I think it will lose out in terms
of the face around the world but U
really um the question of Israel
expecting not to honor this it's
something else of course article 59 of
the of the Court spells out that its
decision is advisory but it's a prudent
advisor it's very wise advis that one
who think Israel would hit the call
would heit this advice

us",20240126

Fierce fighting around hanun the IDF
saying they have encircled the city in
the south of Gaza but also we understand
there is fighting around some of the
hospitals there that are there so let's
take you to Gaza we can speak to Leo
caner as the head of mission for
Palestine with the msf also known as
Doctors Without Borders uh it's very
good to see you Leo thank you for
joining us can you tell us where you are
firstly I just arrived in car yesterday
and I was in for the last two weeks were
you in
hanun yes we were in the west we are
living in the west side of hunis and I
went to visit the nas hospital and the
European hospital as well what was the
situation in those hospitals and Leo
what was happening around them was there
fighting around the
hospitals it's catastrophic you know I
just went there just a week ago and it
was already fighting quite close to the
hospital when I was there there was a
bomb who fell down just 150 M away from
the hospital it killed two boys four
years old and 5 years old plus six six
more people uh and 80 wed so already
when I was there a week ago the fighting
was quite close since a few days it's
becoming increasingly uh uh uh close in
the immediate vicinity I just talk with
my team this morning they are very
scared about what is going on they don't
know where the troops are they hear a
lot of shooting and bombing uh they are
so scared to get out of the hospitals
because they are scared of being shot at
like it happened in shifa hospital in in
the North like in Indonesian Hospital in
the north as well uh they're really
terrorized by what's happening and we
can see that currently the Israeli
military ring is on purpose terrorizing
the healthcare worker it is not
acceptable they had to bury bodies
inside the hospital because they were
too scared to go to the cemetery that is
just 100 meters away from the
hospital and what is happening in terms
of treating people inside the hospital
what is needed there how overcrowded is
it what do you have in terms of
equipment do you know it was already
overcrowded when I when I get there um
uh people everywhere idps everywhere uh
uh way too many patients for the number
of healthcare worker so many patient
were just laying on their beds for for
for days for weeks without the proper
without the proper medical care because
there are not enough staff currently uh
More than 70% of the staff has left ner
because they're scared for their life
and this is not acceptable what is going
on we we are forced to abandon patients
to to let patient dies die on their bed
uh because because healthare worker
cannot stay in the hospital it's it's
it's happened in the North it happens
again in the South Naser hospital and
European Hospital are the last two
hospital that were functioning in in in
the South now Naser is barely
functioning anymore because there are no
more staff and no more staff to take
care of the patient patient are in
critical condition they need a lot of
care and we cannot give to
them in going on is any medical Aid
getting across the border to the NASA
Hospital you know we managed to get some
Medical Aid across the border but it's
very difficult to bring it to the
hospital when I was there a week ago we
brought full full care of medical supply
so they they have some medical supply to
carry on even if it's not enough
especially in term of pain killer uh but
when you talk about the north of Gaza
which we tend to forget a bit like like
shifa Hospital like Indonesian Hospital
there is no Supply at all almost that
can reach this area when I was there I
tried four times to go in North Gaza
four times we were denied by the Israeli
Army to to reach this area this is uh
completely forbidden under international
law to forbid humanitarian people to
bring essential Goods like medicines uh
uh to the population uh what is going on
in Gaza now it's too much uh uh it's a I
I hope we're not getting used to it it's
a it's it's a massacre that is going on
every day uh I can remind you that since
the beginning of the war it's 25,000
people who got killed uh if we just
count the women and children it's 15,000
women and children who got killed in the
beginning of the war it's
150 children and women being killed
every single day since the beginning of
the war it is not a normal War it is a
war that is targeting civilians when I
was visiting Nas hospital and European
hospital I was shocked but truly shocked
by the number of children and women
inside those hospital it was mainly
women and children I have never seen
this in any other world and I've been in
in in working in other Wars as msf we've
been working in other Wars mostly you
see combatants and you see some civilian
people but here it's the opposite you
see mostly civilian people getting
treated for for for for for very
difficult wounds the M are crushed a lot

what more do we know well all we have at
the moment is confirmation from two
unnamed us officials that Jets from the
US carrier in the Red Sea the USS
Eisenhower along with British Jets they
say have been taking part in strikes on
the houthis in Yemen uh we have not yet
had confirmation from Downing Street or
the mod that that has has happened but
you know remember this is the second
time that uh this coordinated action has
taken place it happened 10 days ago when
British Jets from RF ceria in Cyprus
which I think probably would have been
involved again took part with American
Le strikes against the houthi
specifically going over command and
control and also sites where they have
been uh storing manufacturing drones and
and missiles which they have been using
to Target Merchant shipping in the Red
Sea in the Gulf of aen and the Hope was
that initial set of strikes on the 12th
of January would stop them but they
haven't stopped they've carried on
fighting now in between then and now the
US has taken some limited unilateral
action just their own uh ships in in the
Red Sea firing trying to destroy what
they say aoui missiles about to be fired
this looks like it would have been you
know a lot more intelligence used like
the first time a coordinated attempt to
try to degrade at least the hou's
ability to do this the trouble is the
houthis show no sign of backing down at
the moment determined group who have
been fighting the Saudis and the other
thing to say is that you know the US and
the UK have been involved in this action
no other country have and that's I think

because two US Navy Seals who went
missing during an operation to see some
of these Iranian made weapons uh that
were Bound for the houthis uh we're told
are dead uh this was the statement we
got from us Central Command um after
10day exhaustive search they say our two
missing US Navy Seals have not been
located and their status has been
changed to deceased that incident wrong
took place uh a few days ago when elite
soldiers were boarding a ship off the
coast of Somalia but we've also been
told that there were
strikes uh on the al-assad airbase in
Iraq in which two uh military personnel
have been very seriously injured and
suddenly we've got American Personnel
dying and being wounded over 140 strikes
on us uh bases and and installations
since October the 7th so slowly but
surely as Lee says this this is starting
to spread and the Americans are being
dragged into
it I think that's absolutely R and I
think Le's analysis here Not only was it
eloquent but I think it really points to
something from a domestic standpoint
here in the United unit states where you
have bipartisan consensus you have
Republicans uh in the Congress who are
saying why are we sending American men
and women to needlessly die overseas
particularly in the disastrous way that
we pulled out of Afghanistan and then
you have more moderate SL Progressive
members like Rana from California uh my
beloved home state and District in
California who a Democrat who has said
why are we not invoking the War Powers
Resolution why is the President coming
to Congress because under our
constitution you have to declare war not
through the president but through the
Congress and why is the president taking
these because he doesn't he doesn't want
to declare award does he's in an
election year and he certainly doesn't
want to be suggesting that he's sending
more troops overseas having brought
troops back from Afghanistan not in an
election year and that's the sticky
situation the president finds himself in
he's wedged in by the Democrats he's
wedged in by conservative Republicans
and he has to work with his British and
other coalition Partners to clearly
articulate as Le said the need to open
the Red Sea the need for shipping to get
through the Suz Canal because otherwise
the costs are going up the supply
disruptions continue to grow and there's
growing sense here in the United States
that the president's not up to the task
the way he's conducting this operation
yeah you you'll have heard um Lee say
that it's it's not going to work there
was some frustration irritation I think
on the part of the White House Tim that
Grant chaps the you UK defense secretary
was sort of almost triumphant in the way
that this was going to work that this
would sort of deal with the issue and
quite clearly it wasn't going to deal
with the issue and of course the
Americans are deeply involved in the
peace plan in Yemen which could unravel
if this
expands yes but I think it's been
interesting how David Cameron has
actually been uh in in Washington um
sort of making the case often uh on
behalf of the American government
sometimes whether it be about uh Ukraine
which is has has been an issue that
where there's been political splits in
the US and concerns about whether there
will be uh enough commitment going
forward for that and it's been Cameron
that has been out there making the case
on on American Media and equally on on
this issue where UK government ministers
are getting involved in on us media
often to be backing up the American
government uh when it is facing internal
uh problems and internal debate and I
think that's going to I think Cameron
himself now as back as the foreign
secretary is going to be increasingly
important having been a former prime
minister he's able to have the
Diplomatic heft to go to a lot of uh
capitals and to get to meet people that
maybe other foreign secretaries wouldn't

that issue do do you think the UK is

BgBgN-Zfz10,Families of Israeli hostages storm Knesset parliament meeting | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Families of Israeli hostages storm Knesset parliament meeting  BBC News.jpg,"Visions in Israel Over the war in Gaza
have been highlighted in the country's
Parliament today the knesset families of
Israeli hostages who are still being
held in Gaza have broken through
security and stormed a finance meeting
well they were protesting that the
finance committee was actually sitting
deliberating while their children were
still in
captivity we're shouting shame on you
and demanding that the committee members
get up and act the families called for
the government to do more to secure the
release of their loved ones the protest
highlights growing domestic descent in
Israel about the war with Hamas that's
now in its fourth month what it comes as
Palestinians in southern Gaza say the
Israeli bombardment is the most intense
they've experienced since the War Began
the Gaza Health Ministry says that9
Palestinians have been killed in the
last 24
hours well let's go live to Jerusalem
and to our Middle East correspondent
Mark loen and Mark let's start with
those events in the knesset Joseph get
give us a sense of how much pressure
Benjamin Netanyahu is now coming under
from hostage
families I think uh pretty significant
pressure Matthew and growing by the day
uh this was quite dramatic scenes
although the numbers themselves were
quite small but the fact that these uh
that these family members uh managed to
get into that uh finance committee
meeting Ian we think actually they were
probably invited by another committee
into the conet and then once they finish
their appearance they then sort of
pushed through security into the finance
committee you can just see the depth of
emotion I mean one one person shouted we
won't let you breathe until our kids
come back another held a placard saying
you will not sit here while they die
there there is a real sense from many of
the relatives of the 130 or so hostages
who are still not back here in Israel
unknown how many of them are dead uh
that the the government is not doing
enough to prioritize their release and
last night on on Sunday night Benjamin
nahu gave a a press conference in which
he said he would flatly reject any
hostage release deal that uh would
ensure that Hamas allow could could
regroup in in Gaza uh that Israel would
have to withdraw its uh troops and that
would allow Palestinian prisoners to be
released from Israeli jails he said he
would not strike a deal with as he as he
put it those Hamas monsters so you know
he is determined to push with this
offensive with the aim in his words of
complete destruction of Hamas uh but the
families of the hostages and many
Israelis in fact the majority of
Israelis according to opinion polls feel
that the priority needs to be the
release of those hostages and Mark let's
turn to events on the ground because
reports from Southern Gaza from some
people saying it's the most intense
bombardment they've seen since the the
war actually
began yeah I mean the the health
Ministry in Gaza run by Hamas has said
that 50 people were killed in overnight
bombing um and 100 people injured in
around Kan Yunis uh there is intense uh
bombardment now aerial and Naval around
Kan Yunis which is where Israel believes
the top Hamas commanders are holed up uh
it is focusing also around a couple of
hospitals in the South one of which has
been stormed with uh Israeli troops uh
arresting the Medics uh or taking them
in for questioning the Medics inside
that hospital and another one uh it has
been surrounded we understand by Israeli
tanks uh Israel insists of course that
medical facilities are being used by
Hamas uh to launch attacks against
Israeli soldiers that is something that
is denied by uh the Medics and by and by
the authorities down in Gaza uh but uh
there is a real sense that that the
south of course Remains the focus of the
military activity and that is that from
from Kan Yunis uh more and more refugees
are moving even further south to Rafa
Rafa is right on the on the border with
Egypt and that is where the vast
majority of gazans are now taking Refuge
it is is a city that before the war had
a population of around
280,000 now has about 1.3 or 1.4 million
people Sheltering there that gives you a
sense of of of the sort of uh the
inundation of people who have gone down
to Rafa and the BBC has now estimated
that about 75% of Han Yunis which is the
main city in southern Gaza is now under
Israeli control Mark loen there in
Jerusalem thanks very much well I've
been speaking to Maru Levy whose
brother-in-law is one of the hostages
being held in Gaza and I started by
asking for his reaction to those scenes
in the knesset and whether he shared
their
frustration yes of course I'm I'm I'm
I'm part of the families and and we
communicate all the time this weekend
was very intense um ever since um Hamas
published another psychological warfare
video on
Friday it led to a lot of frustration
anger sadness among the family amilies
and and so today every Monday families
of hostages go to the knesset to
Parliament to go to the different
committees one of the Committees the
finance committee uh there was an issue
of entering so families decided to to
enter without a permission and voice the
pain um I spoke with with one of them
earlier today um and I understand the
reasons why they did it they want the
Committees to continue discussing the
issues of the hostages can you also see
why their questioning the basic strategy
the notion of Maximum Force to get more
hostage releases except it hasn't
yielded anything and there's a growing
frustration among some of the family
members about the basic strategy
here yeah I think there there varing um
opinions among the families about the
strategy about the policy of the
government and this weekend we saw uh
several rallies one of which was held in
front of the prime minister's residence
in cesaria
um I I understand why there is criticism
of of the policy as you said it didn't
yield the resorts we wanted hostages are
not returning home um and then we
receive news about um killed hostages
every week uh and so we we beg and we
don't beg we demand the government to
take our voices into account and ensure
that the policy they Implement in the
Gaza STP uh ensure that hostages return
home that needs to be this shortterm
goal of the government uh and of this
operation uh irrespective of the
long-term goal of dismantling Kamas I'll
come back to that point in a moment but
let me ask you when and what you've
heard most recently about your
brother-in-law so the last we've heard
about my brother-in-law was in in late
November from one of the hostages that
was released he was alive then but but
sadly we have no news about him or about
any of the hostages
um hell captive byas I wish I I had a
better answer but the ICC is not allowed
to visit them we don't receive proof of
life and the Israeli authorities do all
they can to provide us information but
obviously that's limited to an extent
because of security
concerns um and Kamas will will not
provide us that information all they do
is provide psychological warfare videos
um as they did last weekend and then on
Friday President Biden's middle east
coordinator is now in Cairo trying to
make progress on all of this us
officials are reported as saying one of
the further complications is that hass's
demand is for a permanent ceasefire for
any further hostage releases is that in
your view a price worth
paying I I I'm not responsible for
making that decision um I think Israel
has a v viable interest that it needs to
Pres Reserve um if I look outside as an
analyst let's say rather than a family
member and understand the the complexity
the GE political complexities that the
government is facing I think that um we
cannot allow Hamas to remain in power in
the Gaza Strip after this operation
after this war for the mere fact they
committed to continue um during October
7 over and over again um and so I hope
the the different stakehold will be able
to bring both Israel and Hamas and their
accomplices closer in the negotiations
it seems like there are different
proposals yes um families met the Prime
Minister today and he said that Israel
provided a counter proposal over this
weekend um he couldn't elaborate about
it and we hope that proposal will bring
about some progress in negotiations a
final question then because we're seeing
a real intensification in terms of the
intensity of attacks in the South around
K Unice how difficult how excruciating
is it for families every single day to
to watch events on the ground when they
have no idea if their loved ones are in
that
vicinity I think it's it's difficult um
generally we don't want to witness war
and suffering uh in our region so it's
difficult to to see it difficult to read
the news difficult to wake up every
morning woring to that we hear about a
loved one of us um being killed whether
those or held hostage like my
brother-in-law uh soldiers on the ground
and I have compassion to any
non-combatant who is involved in in the
middle of this fight um uh it's
difficult uh and I don't trust Kamas to
be a good faith uh partner in in solving
this crisis the opposite they're doing
the opposite um they already killed a
few of the hostages and release video
that really make our life very
excruciating I hope this will end soon
um for the sake of everyone uh but I
understand that it cannot end without
the release of the hostages without the
dismantling of
Kamas Ashi Levy talking to me a little
earlier on the program let's",20240122

Netanyahu says he has told the United
States He opposes the establishment of a
Palestinian State once the conflict in
Gaza comes to an end in a news
conference Mr Netanyahu said Israel must
have security control of all territory
west of the River Jordan which would
include the territory of any future
Palestinian State there's been a
critical response from Washington US
state department spokesman said there
was no way to ensure Israel's long-term
sec security without a two-state
solution many nations including the US
have long called for a two-state
solution in which a future Palestinian
state would sit side by side with an
Israeli one Mr Netanyahu however has
spent much of his political career
opposing Palestinian statehood let's
have a listen to what he told Thursday's
news
conference in any arrangement in the
foreseeable future with a settlement or
without a settlement
Israel needs security control over all
territory west of the Jordan River this
is a necessary condition and it clashes
with the idea of Palestinian sovereignty
what can you do I tell this truth to our
American friends and I also stopped the
attempt to impose a reality on us that
would harm Israel's security the Prime
Minister needs to be capable of saying
no to our friends saying no when
necessary and saying yes when
possible benan yah who there Ben Menan
rad is a senior fellow at the University
of California burkel Center for
international relations and a lecturer
in Middle East studies he says he's not
surprised by Mr netanyahu's comments it
doesn't facilitate the pathway towards a
solution that I think will bring a
diplomatic end to the crisis but given
netanyahu's stance historically as your
U reporter indicated it's it's
consistent with his position for a long
while but it's it's not going to move
move things forward is it is he is he
being
realistic oh no he's not being realistic
I if the solution the goal is to get the
hostages released and to create a secure
and stable environment to prevent
incidents like October 7th from
happening it's by all accounts it's
difficult to do without creating a
viable pathway towards a Palestinian
State we're seeing divisions in
netanyahu's own cabinet over that very
same issue and I think very much he and
his uh right-wing members of his
Coalition stand alone on this um and
what do you make of him publicly uh
coming out to rebuke the United States
on
this well this is very much for internal
domestic consumption again he has
extremist members of his cabinet and
he's holding on to a very thin Coalition
in his ruling government so if he
doesn't come out and Proclaim and stake
these positions that he needs to
maintain he risks losing the support of

JBCQJ7AIfxs,Israel-Gaza: Aid package delivered to people in Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel-Gaza Aid package delivered to people in Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"let's turn to the war in Gaza and Qatar
says that the First Consignment of Aid
under a deal which was broken between
Israel and Hamas has entered the
territory planes carrying 61 tons of Aid
had flown into Egypt it's understood
that has now been delivered to Gaza
although it's not known if it's been
distributed just yet Hamas has said that
for every box of medicine intended for
Israeli hostages who were taken during
the attack on the 7th of October a th
boxes would be reserved for residents of
Gaza meanwhile the fighting continues
officials from the Hamas run Health
Ministry in Gaza say at least 16 people
were killed and many more injured in a
missile strike on a building in Rafa in
southern Gaza they claim several
children were among the
casualties and in the last hour a feed
from cameras in Rafa caught this
explosion details about what exactly
happened have not yet emerged Israel
which along with several Western
countries considers Hamas to be a
terrorist organization has previously
said it provides warnings to civilians
of potential action and only targets
militants well earlier I spoke to James
denlo head of conflict and humanitarian
policy and advocacy at save the
children well I think the first thing to
say is that uh getting Aid into a
population that needs it shouldn't
require high level diplomacy
age should be uh uninterrupted and
unimpaired by all parties to any
conflict so while it obviously is uh of
good news to have medicine for all of
those who need it it's sad that it takes
so much political capital for this to
happen uh children who need access to
Food Water medicine shouldn't have to
rely on uh the leaders of regional
countries uh coming to make agreements
but short windows for that to get
through and of course the scale of
needing Gaza for the over 1 million
children there is absolutely vast and
while again these medicines and these
key uh drugs Etc are are vital uh we
shouldn't forget that we are dealing
with uh a situation in which every
single child in Gaza is hungry but many
children in Gaza numbering in the tens
of thousands are are are heading towards
uh famine conditions and of course the
prospect of the death toll uh going up
very significantly in a very short pace
of time yeah that warning has been given
over the last
few weeks or so about the the situation
of famine I mean just take us through
the the level of um of need in Gaza at
the
moment well the level of need is is
absolute across every section and sector
of the humanitarian response yesterday
saw 225 a trucks uh go into Gaza
compared to the pre-conflict average of
500 but we shouldn't get ourselves uh
focusing entirely on numbers of trucks
because of course uh the population
across Gaza has different needs and and
parts of the North in particular are
finding it very hard to get access to
Aid and the numbers of convoys that are
given permission to get to that
population is extremely low indeed and
today of course we've seen uh the main
access road from north to south cut off
we've also seen uh issues over the last
week or so in terms of a communication
blackout and inability uh to communicate
uh whether that's Aid operators or the
population trying to work out where is
relatively safety relatively safe
because of course there's no single safe
place in Gaza so um when you're talking
about that mismatch between the the
actual need for Aid and the amount that
we're able to get in and distribute
effectively Mass suffering happens in
between and of course I I would really
sum up our response at the moment as not
reversing or addressing the humanitarian
crisis but simply slowing its descent
into greater levels of hell",20240118

Al1QGEwai58,Yemen: Houthis to be re-designated as terror group by US | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Yemen Houthis to be re-designated as terror group by US  BBC News.jpg,"Yemen's houthis have said they'll carry
on attacking ships in the Red Sea to
protest against Israel's bombardment of
Gaza despite a US decision to return
them to the list of global terrorist
organizations the group's leadership has
condemned Washington's move describing
it as an act of blackmail a Us official
said the redesignation on the specially
designated Global terrorist list or
sdgt would take effect in 30 days to
allow time to Ure sure the measures will
Target houthi members and not the
impoverished people of Yemen the US
stopped short of also declaring the
hou's a foreign terrorist organization
or fto as the state Department's
spokesman explained we decided that the
sdgt designation gave us the tools to
deny the houthi access to the financial
system and gave us the tools to uh
impose additional actions additional
sanctions on anyone who does business
with the the um houthis while minimizing
some of the downstream harm to human
many civilians and the deterrent effect
that we thought the nfto designation
would have on Aid groups well just
before move we move on let's just take a
look at who the houthis are well they're
a political and military group from a
subsect of the country's Shia Muslim
minority the zedis they control a large
part of Yemen most of the population
lives in houthi areas including in the
capital sah its control of the Red Sea
Coastline makes it attacks on commercial
shipping possible the movement formed in
the 1990s against this man the then
yemeni president Ali Abdullah Salah in
the early 2000s they fought a series of
rebellions against Yemen's government
president Salah tried to eliminate the
houthi rebels but failed since 2014 the
houthi movement has been fighting a
civil war against Yemen's government
Iran is accused of supplying weapons to
the houthi something it denies saying it
only supports them politically let's go
live now to our correspondent Tom
baitman who is our state department
correspondent in Washington he was also
our Middle East correspondant up until a
very short time ago Tom hi good to see
you there in Washington so just explain
to us the state Department's decision
here on the houthis and what it will
mean well what they've done is to
redesignate effectively the houthis as a
terrorist organization but it's not as
straightforward as them just putting
them on a list because what you heard
there from Matthew Miller the spokesman
was the kind of designation that they
are using now without getting sort of
Lost In The Weeds of a jumble of uh
letters um he mentioned the uh type that
this is there are effectively two forms
of designation one is a bit tougher than
the other now under the Trump
Administration in its uh Dying Days
president Trump designated the houthis
as a terrorist organization under both
uh of those lists uh one of them
effectively means there can be Criminal
sanctions it would be a crime to provide
material support to the houthis uh so
that's obviously a massive disincentive
and that is why Aid groups in particular
back then in early 2021 were really
worried about this because they thought
it would prevent or make it legally very
difficult for them to provide Aid to
people that need it in houy controlled
areas of Yemen and with the dire
humanitarian conditions there they were
very very worried about the impact So
within a few weeks the Biden
Administration reversed the the Trump
decision um under both of those
designations now what has happened now
is that the Biden Administration has
redesignated the houthis under the sort
of lower level or the slightly less
severe designation and that is the
specially designated Global terrorist
group as opposed to a foreign terrorist
organization I think really uh it got to
a point where the pressure was so great
uh on the administration that they had
to they felt they had to do this
President Biden for example was asked a
couple of days ago by a reporter are the
houthi terrorists he said yes I think it
become inevitable they we going to do
this designation given of course that
they're carrying out Military strikes
against the houthis in Yemen yeah and
what's the view there on that that the
US and the UK are carrying out these
military strikes on houthi Targets in
Yemen to try and stop them from
targeting shipping in the Red Sea many
saying well that's not working those
military strikes have continued and
shipping continues to be affected some
are suggesting that by now introducing
this designation that's a sign that
actually they are recognizing what
they're doing so far isn't working
what's your
view well I don't think so in the sense
that I think the the Des the terrorism
designation would have been in the
pipeline for for quite a while um you
know the big action here is the military
action the terrorism designation I think
official US officials would see this as
a sort of far lower level uh you know
piece of policy or activity uh and and
the reality is it won't have that much
of an impact on the ground as far as the
houthis are concerned because they're
already subject to so many sanctions I
mean um Matt Miller was asked in that
press conference about this and he said
well they hardly have a bank account in
the Bank of New York um uh they're
already subject to a lot of sanctions so
it's largely it's symbolic although it
will'll still come with those concerns
about an impact on humanitarian Aid us
officials are saying there will be what
they call carve outs to ensure they can
still get food and uh medicine in there
as for the impact of the US UK military
activity that's a really good question
because what we've seen since the uh the
The Joint British American strikes on
Thursday was that the houth the houthis
are still firing ballistic missiles at
ships but what we haven't seen is the
scale of attack that we saw in
particular on Tuesday um of last week
that was a sort of swarming attack of
suicide drones ballistic missiles and
cruise missiles I think so far my sense
is US officials feel that this has been
a sort of tactical success they've
degraded a bit of capability for the
houthis they have deterred them to some
extent but that doesn't answer the much
much wider strategic question and that
is now that we have a sort of Battle of
narratives because the houthis are
saying they're trying to get a change of
policy they want to isolate the US they
see it as acting as a diplomatic and
Military shield for the Israelis as they
continue the bombardment on Gaza the
houthis like much of the Arab world want
a ceasefire and an end to The Siege on
Gaza the US and the UK are saying these
things are completely disconnected that
they're just trying to protect
international shipping uh in the Red Sea
but of course all of this uh has you
know a lot of potential to spread and
widen so while the US is trying to deter
the houth they got to walk this very
fine line trying to prevent an
escalation in The Wider region okay Tom
thank you for now",20240117
uE8k03LLg5k,Israel and Hamas reach deal on aid to Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel and Hamas reach deal on aid to Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"qatar's foreign Ministry announced
Israel and the Palestinian islamist
group have agreed to deliver medicines
hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in
exchange for supplying Aid to civilians
following French and Qatari mediation
the United Nation says the war has
displaced roughly 85% of gaza's 2.4
million people many of whom have been
forced to crowd into shelters and
struggle to get food water fuel and
Medical Care under the deal the
humanitarian Supply will leave the
Qatari Capital Doha for Egypt later
today the aid will then be taken to Gaza
to be delivered to civilians while
medicin are to reach Israeli captives
more than 132 hostages are thought to be
still held in Gaza live now to our
Middle East correspondent yoland Nell
yoland what more can you tell us about
this deal and how difficult it was to
come to an
agreement yes so this is a deal we first
heard about a few days ago and then it
seems to have hit some logistical
problems now those have been resolved we
understand um Qatar has been the
important party here assisted by the
French the French saying that something
like 45 of the remaining hostages are
suffering from chronic diseases or need
life saving medicines of other kinds uh
so now those medicines have been
acquired and we understand that they
will be flown uh from Doha today um on
Air Force jets uh taken into Egypt and
then will be transferred across to G in
exchange we understand Hamas has
accepted that there will be a big
increase in the number of medicines
allowed in for Palestinian civilians
suffering in Gaza right and what about
the broader Aid question in
Gaza I mean this is a big issue we've
had the world food program coming out uh
in recent days saying that people are at
risk of dying of starvation just miles
away from trucks full with food and
they're really asking the different un
Aid agencies for more entry points to be
opened up to go into Gaza an easing of
the very uh tight and they say laborious
um Security checks uh that need to be
carried out things made more streamlined
also making it easier for f humanitarian
workers to distribute the aid giving
them some guarantees of safety because
at the moment that is one of the major
problems even when Aid can be gotten
into Gaza you can't distribute it easily
around the Gaza Strip there's so much
ongoing fighting in the South there are
other issues like another
telecommunications blackout so it makes
it very hard to coordinate with teams on
the ground youand the fact that this
agreement was struck is it a sign that
there is hope for more diplomacy and
even a
ceasefire I mean what's interesting is
the fact that this uh deal was announced
and we just also had last night the wh
house saying that uh its Middle East
Envoy had just been in Kat and had taken
part in very very serious and intensive
discussions about the possibility of
another hostage release deal uh in
exchange of course that would be for uh
some kind of a ceasefire um so the White
House saying that it's hopeful although
indicating that there's still a long way
to go although the fact that the
agreement includes medicines to be
delivered to the Israeli hostages is an
implicit admission or admission perhaps
is the wrong word but it's implicit
indication that they're still alive and
can be
located
um that does appear to be a sort of
hopeful sign from this and it's really a
hopeful sign for the families of the
hostages some of them had actually gone
to Qatar to meet the prime minister in
recent days and and really press uh for
some kind of breakthrough starting off
uh with the medicine we know of course
that some of the hostages are older
people uh people who were taking daily
uh medicines for different health
conditions um and that also there were
others who were injured um and that has
also been a factor a lot of concern
about what's happened to them a bit of
information that has come from the
hostages who were released under that
deal um that saw about half of the total
of 240 hostages originally taken on the
7th of October uh by Hamas uh released

we've heard a lot about on the Israeli

CBwxCXeITJ8,Israel continues bombardment of southern Gaza | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel continues bombardment of southern Gaza  BBC News.jpg,"the fighting has continued in Gaza
Israel launching fresh strikes on the
southern part of the territory let's
show yuhan unas where Palestinians are
running to find shelter as a strike hit
near NASA hospital this was earlier
today Israel has said it's continuing to
find tunnels and weapons and has killed
dozens of militants its military
released this video which it says shows
a tunnel beneath hunus which it claims
Hamas is used to hold some of the
hostages taken in the deadly raid into
Southern Israel on the 7th of October
the Hamas run Health Ministry says more
than 60 people have been killed in and
around hunus it says the total number of
Palestinians killed since October the
7th now stands at
23,46 I've been speaking to Abu Baka
he's a resident in central Gaza and he
described how the situation looks there
today the situation just daily
deteriorates you can see that the
bombing hasn't stopped since the since
yesterday and yesterday was a very rough
night for for for those who are living
in the the southern territory in in the
Gaza Strip so yeah it's just been a
another bad day unfortunately and these
pictures that we see now are a people
queuing for uh water desperate for water
because so much of the water is
contaminated in Gaza at the moment can I
ask you about that Abu Baker As we look
at these people queuing for water do you
have you and your family clean drinking
water unfortunately no and it's the same
story for for most Palestinians because
we are very we're very getting to used
we're getting to used to this kind of
polluted water since the start of the
war we don't have this kind of water
that is polluted and sometimes we need
to just go to the Sea and and try and
try to drink from the sea which is
completely salty water so it's just like
as of told you it's getting dire and
even it's not for water it's for the
other Med for the other medical supplies
in particular and the other food Aid
which which doesn't reach because
talking about the humanitarian Aid that
has coming to the Ser hasn't reached it
hasn't reached most people here in the
Gaza Strip only a small part of of the
population in the Gaza Strip who are
stuck in the especially in the southern
territory of the Gaza St in RAF and unun
and and Central Gaza and dur now the
number of people in these areas are
unbelievable the number is just insane
you're talking about a million point9
900,000 people displaced now in these
areas so the food given and the water
given to these people is not enough for
sure it's not enough and most people are
now in tits it's a rainy day today in
Gaza so you can see how much suffering
there is with people who are especially
intense and unpredicted shelters they're
just suffering and it's a it's a
heartbreaking day so when it trains it
bins as they as as I've always said that
even when it trains in Gaza especially
in this war it BS
and yes this is the situation in Gaza
right now you cannot the the scarcity
the level of scarcity we have from food
water medical supplies in particular The
Continuous attacking by Israel for the
hospitals is just making the situation
worse and worse every day so so Abu Bak
if the if the aid is not getting through
what have you and your family had to eat
in the past 24 hours well it's getting
it through but I want to make it clear
it's getting it through but it's not
it's not reached us at all so what I've
eaten with my family is only some some
Tomatoes it's the same story and
sometimes we can get some Whitey cheese
but make sure that the food we are
eating are of the lowest quality what is
it like when I and my when my family and
I eat canned food usually given for pets
what is it like when a six-year-old
child asks me that my that his
wish that he he wished or or he wishes
that he were a monkey that he could be
given his favorite fruit bananas it's
just heartbreaking you can't really
imagine it I yesterday yesterday with my
family had to use wheat seeds usually
given for birds to eat them what what
what other Solutions what other
Solutions we should we have we are out
of solutions we're out of everything
this is the story inide CA so when we
don't have this kind of you know this
kind of food what we have the illnesses
that Cana can I ask you can I ask you at
the moment as well do you feel safe
leaving your house moving around at all
not at all not at all because there's no
safe Zone in Gaza there is no safe
Street in Gaza even the streets that
could be making out making it out for
for residents to flee to Rafa the
southern area of the STP have been
bombed so the streets now destroyed it's
it's not it's not safe at all Abu Baka
giving us a sense of what daily life is
like in Gaza",20240111

emphasized the need to prevent the
conflict from spreading earlier he met
the president of Israel Isaac Herzog who
thanked the US for standing steadfast
with
Israel Mr blinken's visit comes as
Hezbollah said one of it commanders was
killed in an apparent Israeli drone
strike in southern Lebanon Israel's
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on
the northern border where he signaled
that he's prepared if necessary to
escalate military operations in Lebanon
hamas's health officials say more than
23,000 people have been killed in Gaza
by Israeli strike since the conflict
began three months ago here's Secretary
of State blinkin speaking after he met
the president of Israel Isaac Herzog um
I've just come from a number of
countries in the region uh Turkey Greece
uh Jordan cutter United Arab Emirates
Saudi Arabia and I want to be able to
share some of what I heard from those
Leaders with the president as well as
with the prime minister in the cabinet
later today um and of course we'll have
an opportunity to sit with the families
of some of the hostages and uh discuss
our Relentless efforts to bring everyone
home and back with their families uh and
there's lots to talk about uh particular
about the way
forward so I look forward to these
conversations as always great with you
now let's have a listen to what
president Herzog had to say as he
thanked Washington for its support of
Israel and here with the hypocrisy of
South Africa we will be there at the
international court of justice and will
present proudly our case of using
selfdefense under our most inherent
right under International humanitarian
law where we are doing our utmost under
extremely complicated circumstances on
the ground to make sure that there will
be no unintended consequences and no
civilian casualties well earlier I spoke
to our Middle East correspondent yolan
Nell who told us more about what we can
expect from Secretary of State blinken's
visit he's got a lot here to discuss um
both trying to stop a regional conflict
looking at luring the intensity of the
fighting in Gaza and also looking as he
was indicating uh there to the Future to
a post-war vision for Gaza and the
indication really is that this will give
some kind of reassurance uh to Israel's
Arab neighbors who uh Mr blinken has
been re meeting in recent days um and
you know he has a day now of of
back-to-back talks uh where he's he's
looking to achieve so much but then
events on the ground can really easily
overtake him here still the fighting
remains very fierce in Gaza from the
indications of the past day or so
particularly in the center and in the
south of the Gaza Strip despite the fact
the Israeli military um trying to give
assurances it's moving into a new phase
of less intense more targeted fighting
and also um as Mr linkoln has been
trying to calm things down a lot going
on uh behind the scenes diplomatically
between Israel and its neighbor Lebanon
we're getting indications of yet another
strike in southern Lebanon taking place
this morning that's not confirmed as yet
and yolan just briefly um obviously the
conversation will also be what a
postconflict Gaza would look
like that's right and really uh Mr
blinken has been saying here that he
wants to talk about the future
governance of Gaza this is something
that is generally considered to have
been um ignored uh somewhat by Israeli
political leaders it's taken some time
for the Israeli War cabinet to come
around to talking about that um and also
just to have a a brief plan published uh
by Israel's defense minister last week
giving um really an outline of what uh
Israel's strategy could look like saying
that Palestinians will be allowed to go
back to their homes Mr blinken um has
been saying that he thinks displaced
Palestinians must be allowed to go back
as soon as conditions allow uh but there
are some indications in Israel's media
that that could be tied to a possible
new hostage deal to bring home the 100
plus hostages that remain in captivity
in Gaza yoland n speaking to me",20240109

where America's top Diplomat Secretary
of State Anthony blinkin continues
diplomatic efforts in a bid to prevent a
regional escalation of Israel's war in
Gaza he'll hold talks with the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia today on
containing the international shipping
threat in the Red Sea by the
iranian-backed houthi rebels of
neighboring Yemen before traveling to
Tel Aviv ahead of his arrival in Israel
intense Israeli air strikes have been
continuing in the Gaza Strip as well as
ground battles with Hamas Fighters
Israeli forces say They carried out
strikes on 30 targets overnight there's
also deep concern over the dire
humanitarian situation in Gaza where AID
organizations say their doctors have
been forced to pull out of one of the
last functioning hospitals after the
surrounding area was designated a combat
zone by the Israeli military the World
Health Organization says that if the
alaxa hospital is stopped from operating
it will be a moral and medical outrage W
Davis sent this report from Jerusalem
and and I should warn you it contains
distressing images right from the
start images coming from jabalia in
Northern Gaza today are difficult to
watch reporters quickly on the scene
describe dozens of bodies lying in the
rubble of a destroyed building many of
them women and
children unconfirmed Reports say at
least 70 people were killed here in what
was reported to be an Israeli air strike
the Israeli military has not yet
responded to a BBC request for more
information across Gaza say Aid agencies
the civilian toll is
unbearable this the aftermath of another
attack in Han unun Health officials say
that even medical facilities including
hospitals are unsafe as Israel's
Relentless campaign continues against
Hamas military targets the stock inside
of this Hospital are heroes who are
doing everything they can without sleep
without food food without knowing if
their own families are safe in order to
save the lives of others so this
hospital and the staff in this Hospital
have to be protected with an increasing
sense of urgency The American Secretary
of State is on a Whistle Stop tour of
middle Easter capitals with real concern
about the humanitarian situation and the
possibility of a region-wide conflict
Anthony blinkin is being urged to use
America's influence over Israel to
demand an immediate
ceasefire but even if Washington presses
that point Israel's leader isn't yet
listening we are not stopping until
Victory the war must not be stopped
until we achieve all of its goals the
elimination of Hamas the return of all
of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza
no longer poses a threat to Israel I say
this to both our enemies and our friends
while aladu wishes fighting would end
he's already lost family and several
colleagues today the alaz correspondent
buried his son Hamza also a reporter
killed in an air strike after Israel
says they were targeting a suspect and
were aware of others in his car the
latest of at least 75 local journalists
to have been killed in Gaza paying the
highest price to report this war to the
world W Davis BBC News
Jerusalem let's go live to Jerusalem now
and speak to our Middle East
correspondent Yulan Nell and Yulan can
you just give us the context to what we
are hearing um about what Anthony
blinkin is going to be saying about
about saying that Palestinians shouldn't
be pressured into leaving Gaza just
explain why why this has come about
because there an Israeli ministers
talking about this weren't
there that's right there have been some
Israeli ministers within the coalition
government uh they're on the far right
in particular that have been calling for
forced displacement of Palestinians in
effect uh from the Gaza Strip uh
Washington has already issued sharp
rebukes about that um and said that
Palestinians must be allowed to return
to their homes um in the north of the
Gaza Strip first of all as soon as
conditions allow so that will be uh part
of Anthony blinken's message as he comes
here otherwise we can expect him to
continue this conversation about trying
to stop the regional spillover of this
war um he's also said that it's
imperative that Israel takes more action
uh puts a premium on protecting
civilians in the Gaza Strip and also
does more to help in terms of getting
Aid not just into Gaza but allowing that
Aid to be distributed where it's really
needed and as we were seeing in we's
report there um Benjamin Netanyahu
remaining uh defiant in terms of any
calls for a possible ceasefire um are
are there talks still ongoing right now
in terms of a possible pause in the
fighting because there was a lot of talk
about that a few days ago but that seems
to have gone quiet
well of course the ceries have been
important mediators and this is
something that was addressed when Mr
blinken was meeting uh cat officials in
the past day um and they have uh given
assurances that there are still
continued efforts uh to reach a new
ceasefire deal with Hamas to bring home
uh the remaining 100 plus Israeli
hostages still held by Hamas and other
armed groups in the Gaza Strip and we
also saw unusually uh some of the
hostage families heading to katar
themselves to meet katerie officials uh
trying to keep the issue uh of their
loved ones on this diplomatic agenda uh
Mr blinkin himself has put it high up on
his agenda this issue of bringing back
uh the Israeli hostages when he was
laying out what he hoped to achieve in
the Middle East okay thank you very much

the fighting as we've mentioned at least
70 people were reportedly killed in
jabalia in Northern Gaza the Israeli
Army said it has completed the
dismantling of hamas's command structure
in the northern Gaza Strip among those
killed in southern Gaza is Hamza Al
dadul an Al jazer journalist and
cameraman who was reported to have been
hit by an Israeli drone strike Hamza had
been working alongside his father who is
the aler correspondent in Gaza this is
why pictured at his son's funeral along
with other members of his family dozens
of journalists have been killed in Gaza
since fighting began 3 months
ago one more on this I'm joined Now by
Jody Ginsburg from the committee to
protect journalists thanks very much for
being with us do you have any more
information about how this happened so
what we believe is that Hamza was in a
car with a freelance journalist and
another um member of Al jazer staff uh
and they were on the road between KH
yunes and Rafa when their car was hit by
a drone strike we understand understand
that they were on route to an area
designated a humanitarian Zone to report
on on bombings in that area when the car
was hit and so far it's been a deadly uh
conflict to report on Ian there's
obviously casualties amongst the people
who live there but also on on
journalists tell us about the way
journalists are managing the risks there
well as you say it's been the deadliest
Conflict for journalists that that the
committee to protect journalists has
ever documented and we've been doing
this work for more than uh three decades
more than 75 journalists have been
killed since October the 7th it's
extremely difficult to manage the risks
we need journalists and it's really only
gazan journalists who are able to
document this war because International
journalists have have had very little
access almost impossible to get into
Gaza they're the only ones doing this
work and so they're traveling to places
like hospitals uh like uh uh refugee
camps to report on the effects of the
war but those places themselves are also
under attack so so there's nowhere
really safe for journalist to operate
and tell us about the reaction from from
Al jazer and and whether there's going
to be any kind of proper accountability
as as to what happened here so Al jazer
have condemned this killing uh they've
accused the Israelis of deliberately
targeting the journalists we as the
committee protect journalists continue
to demand independent investigations
into these deaths uh we've seen a number
of cases where journalists clearly
wearing wearing press Insignia where it
was known that they were operating have
been killed and it's really important
that we see investigations that those
responsible are held accountable
journalists as civilians and must never
be targeted uh in a war Jody Ginsburg
from the committee to protect
journalists thank you very much indeed
for joining us thank you",20240107
lnBbbwaDz8A,Israeli minister outlines plans for Gaza after war | BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israeli minister outlines plans for Gaza after war  BBC News.jpg,"let's turn to the Middle East now where
Israel's defense minister has been
outlining his plans for Gaza once its
war with Hamas is over it comes almost
three months after hamas's deadly
October the 7th attacks on Southern
Israel which triggered the conflict
under yuav galant's four corner
proposals Hamas would no longer control
Gaza and Israel would retain overall
security control a multinational force
would take charge of rebuilding Gaza
after its widespread destruction in
Israeli bombing neighboring Egypt would
also have an unspecified role under the
plan but Gaza would be run by
Palestinian bodies as long as they were
not hostile towards Israel while
fighting in Gaza has continued alongside
the plan's publication the Hamas run
Health Ministry says that dozens of
people have been killed in the past 24
hours let's go straight now to our
correspondent Yulan Nell who's in
Jerusalem for us so Yulan how does this
plan tally with the ideas that the US
was suggesting for the day after in Gaza
well uh Washington which is of course
Israel's closest Ally has been calling
consistently for a detailed uh plan for
the day after what we have at the moment
is really a kind of set of bullet points
from the defense minister um but uh
there has been this insistence that it
should be Palestinians who are governing
uh in Gaza in the future and this plan
uh does account for that it says
specifically that there will be no
Israeli civilian presence in the Gaza
Strip at the end of the war um now that
is important because you've had
far-right ministers in Israel's
coalition government who have been
calling for the return of Jewish
settlers to the Gaza Strip and there are
some who've been calling for the forced
displacement of Palestinians and that is
something that has um stirred up a lot
of anger around the region with other
Arab countries um also uh with the
Americans saying that that talk was
inflammatory and
irresponsible what about the
Palestinians what's their view on
this there's been relatively little
comment uh from the palestin Ians so far
uh perhaps because this is really just
the kind of sketch of a plan we are
going to have the US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin coming in a few days
time and he will be visiting Palestinian
leaders in the Palestinian Authority in
the occupied West Bank as well as
Israeli leaders and we know that in the
past uh the US has been pushing for the
Palestinian Authority kind of a
revitalized Palestinian Authority to
have a role in the future of Gaza uh the
Palestinian Authority is the body that
governs parts of the West Bank but on
the Palestinian side you know it has
proved to be unpopular Palestinians have
been saying in polls uh that really uh
it it would take a kind of a different
look to to the makeup of the Palestinian
authorities they see at the moment for
them to be convinced that it could be uh
put in control of the Gaza Strip as well
and how difficult would would it be to
assemble the multinational force that
Israel is talking about to to how would
who would be part of
it I mean that of course is still uh to
be discussed there's so much to still to
be discussed uh with this plan uh
perhaps not surprising it's saying that
the US would take a lead role here it
has already been so much involved uh in
this war but uh I expected they would be
looking to International bodies to the
UN agencies that already have a big role
in getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza um
and already have had historically a long
presence in the Gaza Strip to be very
involved in the Reconstruction efforts
uh but it's sort of made clear by other
statements from the Israeli defense
Minister that Israel would insist that
it still has Security checks on all
materials that are going into Gaza and
there have been calls too for um
reinforcement to to stop smuggling
across the border with Egypt because
there's a lot of concern about how um
Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza
have brought in weapons or weapons Parts
in the past we know that the Secretary
of State as you mentioned earlier
Anthony blinkin is going to be having
talks again how is it going because at
the moment Israel hasn't seemed to have
listened at all on on the US's request
to try and scale back uh some of the
operations in Gaza to try and protect
human life and also allow more
humanitarian Aid in how is that
discussion going to go given that Israel
hasn't changed its uh its Methods at the
moment well it's interesting that at the
top of the list of what Anthony blinkin
says he wants to achieve in this region
is the protection of civilians in Israel
the West Bank and Gaza he says and we we
know of course that there have been
these calls from the US to the intensity
of the operations in Gaza because of the
high numbers of civilians uh being
killed now what we have seen is Israel
saying that it's starting to pull out uh
some of its Ground Forces its combat
troops but at the same time we have seen
in recent days still very heavy
bombardment um of the Gaza Strip and
heavy heavy shelling as well and that is
continuing to cause high numbers of
Civilian casualties youan n for the
latest there from Jerusalem thank you
very much",20240105

that one in five commercial ships are
now avoiding the Red Sea because of the
threat of attack that's according to the
international chamber of shipping it
includes ships operated by two of the
world's biggest shipping firms meis and
hapag Lloyd later today the UN Security
Council is expected to meet and produce
a diplomatic response the Red Sea
accounts for 15% of the world shipping
and plays a crucial part in the global
supply chain you UK companies have been
telling the BBC that shipping delays
could push up prices well let's speak
now to T fber who's the CEO of freightos
an online Marketplace for the
international shipping industry base in
Israel uh thank you very much for being
with us today Mr shriber um one in five
commercial ships avoiding the area now
some might say it doesn't sound that
dramatic one in5 is
this well yes it's hugely dramatic to
put it in context there's a about 4 and
a half million 20ft containers
equivalent going back and forth through
the seers canal um and daily this is
changing you know um there's a couple of
days of quiet and they start getting
rooted through the SE Canal again and
then there's a a rocket or an attack and
ships are either being told to stop and
wait or they're being sent back to go
and circumvent all of Africa which takes
an extra couple of weeks um so this is a
a huge um issue for for world trade and
vast numbers of goods which are being
delayed and um rerouted you know dayto
day sure so there was a big attack over
the weekend on a m MK ship which uh
houie Rebels from Yemen tried to board
and it also provoked or brought about I
would say probably the most dramatic
response so far the US Navy defended The
Vessel sank the boats of the attackers
is there a chance that that dramatic
response itself could uh stem the stem
these
tax I think not immediately uh in fact
musk had just suspended um sailings
through the Red Sea and then they just
reinstated that and then this attack
happened and so they've suspended them
again uh and I'm sure they'll be uh
cautious before uh rerooting it so of
course people are are watching uh the
news and the uh response of the American
Le Coalition uh but but it won't take
you know it won't take just one
Counterattack to make the make the
carriers feel confident they're going to
be watching this for several days or
even weeks before they feel safe to send
their Crews back through the SE Canal H
clearly this is creating headaches for
people like you in the industry but for
ordinary consumers at home there are
warnings of of of price Rises um what do
you think Could Happen what could the
consequence be for ordinary consumers so
that's also evolving uh rapidly let's
talk about prices and let's talk about
supply shortages uh in terms of prices
um our freightos terminal tracks the the
prices and our fbx11 index before New
Year had shown prices jump on the sewers
route uh from $1,200 to $1,600 that's a
30% increase which may sound like a lot
but in our industry it's a very volatile
industry that's not considered a very
dramatic uh increase but over the New
Year prices shut up to over
$4,000 uh we'll see if that will stick
or not but that's already a substantial
a price increase and you could see a
little bit of that passed on to
Consumers if the prices stay so High um
in terms though of prices and Supply
it's worth pointing out that fortunately
we're after the holiday season so the
peak season of shipping of course is is
the leadup to uh Christmas and
Thanksgiving in the US uh that is passed
and in general the network has got spare
capacity now unlike during covid uh the
last time the SE Canal was blocked in
March 2021 uh there was a big shortage
of of shipping capacity uh there is over
shipping capacity right now sure so the
network is able to better um cope so we
will see some delays and some price
increase but we're not expecting okay
anything nearly as dramatic as we saw
during covid hopefully great stuff T

hour that Hamas says its Deputy
political leader Salah alarri has been
killed in a blast in Beirut the capital
of Lebanon local media have described
the explosion as an Israeli drone attack
on the Hamas office in the south of the
city Reports say five other people were
killed in the blast video footage shows
a car in flames and damaged to buildings
in a busy residential area which is
known as a Hezbollah stronghold well
within the last hour and advisor to the
Israeli Prime Minister has said that
Israel has not taken responsibility for
that attack but they say it was not an
attack on the Lebanese State saying
whoever did this did a surgical strike
against the Hamas leadership well Hamas
has blamed Israel for the strike earlier
I spoke to our correspondent in
Jerusalem about the reaction from
Israeli authorities and we did reach out
to them after local media as you've
mentioned Ben um attributed this blast
to an Israeli drone attack we reached
out to the IDF who came back to the BBC
and said they would not comment um on
reports from foreign media um we did get
confirmation that it's that Salah aluri
the uh Deputy head or the deputy
chairman of hamas's Po Bureau um has
been killed in this blast and we have
had uh we've had reaction from lebanon's
caretaker prime minister naib mikati he
described the blast um as a as a new
Israeli War crime that aims to drag
Lebanon uh into a new phase of the
conflict according to what he said we
also um got this line just now from Mark
RV an adviser to the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he was
speaking to the American Network MSNBC
and said that Israel did not take
responsibility for the attack but quote
whoever did it it must be clear that
this was not an attack on the Lebanese
State whoever did this it was a surgical
strike against the Hamas leadership
confirming there that a senior Hamas
official has been killed um in this
blast I think it's very significant and
it's worth pointing out who was skilled
but also where he was killed you refer
to it um Salah Lori was killed in the
dah the southern district which is seen
as a hisbah stronghold Hamas and hisbah
have very close a very close um
relationship salahi himself um is very
involved in hamas's military structure
he was one of the people that formed the
um aadin Kasam brigades the military
wing of Hamas so this is a very Hamas
senior official right up in the pit
Bureau of the group killed in Hezbollah
stronghold yes and Sean you mentioned
this as well there will be a lot of
nervousness right now and we've talked
about this before about the potential
for this Israel Gaza crisis to escalate
beyond the borders of Gaza and Israel
and this could be a sense that that is
happening um what do we know and and you
touched on the response we've had both
from the IDF but the authorities there
about it being a targeted strike but it
will make a lot of people very nervous
that this crisis is
spreading it will make a lot of people
very nervous especially of course um in
Lebanon but look if if if what you can
read in nij MTI the the Lebanese prime
minister he is accusing Israel of
dragging Lebanon into this conflict and
also remember as we as you say Israel
has not taken responsibility for this
attack but the timing of it this comes
as the northern border between Israel
and Lebanon has been heating up quite a
bit with a continued exchange of fire
with very very strong rhetoric from the
Israeli um leadership whether it's
Benjamin Netanyahu or uh or the you know
a war cabinet minister or the defense
minister they've all Ratched up the
rhetoric that if hasbalah is not going
to be limited um and pulled back from

senior Hamas Commander Adel mama in an
overnight strike in central Gaza the BBC
has not been able to verify the Israel
Defense Force claim that he led an
attack on a kibuts in southern Israel on
the 7th of October in Israel the New
Year began with air raid sirens in Tel
Aviv and other areas after Hamas
launched more rockets and there was no
letup in the air strikes hitting Gaza
with at least 24 people killed but
Israeli tanks have pulled out of some
parts of Gaza City ahead of a planned
troop ruction our Middle East
correspondent Yulan Nell is in Jerusalem
she gave us more details about last
night's Hamas rocket
attacks so it was just after midnight
local time people in Tel Aviv have been
seeing in the new year and there were
these Air Raid Sirens that went off as a
barrage of rockets uh Hamas used its
longer range M90 Rockets were fired
towards Tel Aviv also were parts of
Southern Israel um now Israel's Iron
Dome missile defense system was quickly
in action there with a thuds of uh
interceptions bringing down those
Rockets but really a very Grim start to
the new year uh meanwhile in Gaza itself
in the dark we had scenes of Rescuers
scrambling in the rubble of B buildings
that had been newly flattened by Israeli
air strikes um some 50 people killed in
the latest air strikes in Gaza City
about 20 of them people who are taking
shelter of the alaka University we
understand um also in the Center and in
the south of the Gaza Strip fighting
there remains extremely
intense Julet tumer who's director of
communications for the United Nations
relief and works agency known as unra
and give us a little bit of an
impression of What It's Like on this
first day of 2024
there thanks uh so much Happy New Year
look not much difference um the the air
strikes and the bombardment continues
and with that uh crowds and crowds of
people continue to head south in search
of safety that sadly has not existed for
almost three months now across the Gaza
Strip and in in your estimation when
Israel says that it plans to well that
the conflict could continue throughout
the year what does that do to
particularly children's psyche
perhaps I think to everybody psych um
the the continuation of of the war and
any int ification and expansion is going
to mean more suffering everywhere more
loss and more grief it is time for a
ceasefire what about shelter how how are
you getting on with providing shelter
for you have been forced to move from
one place and then had to move
again yeah well umra right now is
hosting 1.4 million people across our
shelters in the in the Gaza Strip people
continue to come to these shelters and
they are overcrowded mainly in the South
so some of them have been just um forced
to live wherever they can including out
in in in the open and um they are
um they're very very um difficult
conditions across um these um these
shelters and there needs to be much more
um supplies coming in to help uh people
in in need and on that issue of supplies
there are reports of negotiations going
on behind the scenes to try to get to a
point where more can can come in can you
explain to us the logistical and the
security concerns
at the moment you have to overcome when
you do bring material in look it's a
very complex humanitarian operation in
in the Gaza Strip yes there isn't much
suppliers coming in so that's for sure
there's also the bombardment itself that
stands in in the way uh there's also um
hits against uh humanitarian facilities
and humanitarian workers including the
recent shooting that we had against one
of our convoys but there's also high
high levels of desperation of hunger
among people in in in Gaza uh which
means that every time we go and provide
Aid especially in areas that we're not
able to reach as much as we should
people just come to our trucks they take
stuff uh and they start eating it then
and there and so this is why it's
absolutely fundamental that there's a
humanitarian ceasefire we know from the
shortlived pose from a few weeks ago
that we managed to bring in more
supplies that we managed to um get into
other areas that were restricted
previously and that people finally had
some rest fite",20240101

been trying to move to the southern
Border Town of Rafa which continues to
see an influx of people seeking safety
our correspondent Shima khil sent this
report from
Jerusalem a massive Israeli bombing in
Northern Gaza turns an extensive network
of Hamas tunnels into dust these IDF
pictures show a well equipped
infrastructure of long and branched out
tunnels in which the Army says senior
Hamas members moved and
operated in central Gaza more than
150,000 people were ordered to evacuate
two of the area's biggest refugee camps
and this is where they were told to go
for safety the area of derl Bah itself
reeling from the aftermath of
strikes we were sitting at our homes
peacefully and all of a sudden a missile
hit and destroyed my house my neighbor's
house the whole neighborhood my children
are displaced now and we don't know
where to go have mercy on us help us
it's a devastating
situation people are sleeping on the

killed just crossing my M repeatedly I
already lost my older brother brother I
can't lose my younger brother and this

Jerusalem meanwhile Israel has responded
furiously to South Africa's application
on Friday to the international court of
justice to rule that Israel has carried
out what it called genocidal attacks in
Gaza Israeli foreign Ministry spokes
person Leo haat said Israel rejects with
disgust the blood libl spread by South
Africa in its application to the
international court of justice while he
goes on to say South Africa's claim
constitutes a Despicable and contemp
pous exploitation of the Court well our
Middle East correspondent yolan Nell is
in Jerusalem and she told us more about
that response from the Israelis the
Israeli government isn't sitting today
because it's the Jewish sabbath but this
was a very strongly worded response that
we had from the foreign Ministry
spokesperson and at the same time though
I think some of it would be expected
it's often um quite a difficult
relationship with South Africa because
um o of the fact it has very strong
support uh for the Palestinian cause um
often identifies the ruling ANC party in
South Africa between the Palestinian
nationalist struggle and its own past
struggle against AP
parde and Yan we um heard about those uh
gun battles in hanun what more can you
tell us about what's
happening yes so residents of hunas were
telling us that they could hear very
loudly uh gum battles taking place on
the streets presumably between Hamas
Fighters and and Israeli soldiers who
are there deep in the heart of this city
the main southern city o of Gaza seen as
a place where perhaps the Hamas leaders
the likes of Yahya Sina whose Hometown
it is he is the leader of Hamas in Gaza
perhaps they could be hiding in
underground tunnels there um that's what
the Israeli military thinks uh We've
also had Israeli artillery pushing into
the city artillery shells um and also uh
more Israeli air strikes three people
killed according to medics um by an air
strike earlier this morning um and so
really that does appear to be a main
focus still of Israel's ground offensive
but at the same time it is pushing into
these three Urban refugee camps in the
center of the Gaza Strip where there've
also been air strikes ahead of the
advance of Israeli tanks overnight and
we're seeing many pictures aren't we of
those being displaced uh by this latest
offensive the UN saying around
150,000 uh people are there safe places
for people to
travel I mean it's extremely difficult
what we're seeing is that people are
using whatever means they can either
fleeing on foot using donkey carts in
some cases a few people have got their
vehicles with enough fuel and to make
the journey and they're sort of going in
short hops as they fled um from these
different camps in the center of Gaza
Strip as Israel's ground offensive has
advanced just in the past week heading
first to deala a big town there which
has also been hit by air strikes as we
um and then going south into Rafa the
town on the Egyptian border um but of
course this is now the most densely
populated part of the Gaza Strip there
are hundreds of thousands of people who
are displaced there uh the UN says that
it's extremely difficult uh to deal with
in terms of they're seeing now a spread
of disease in the areas where there are
these overcrowded shelters and people
living in very difficult conditions some
of them sleeping rough or else in sort
of makeshift that they've set up",20231230

the Israeli military has continued its
bombing of the Gaza Strip overnight
while heavy combat continues on the
ground gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry
says at least 241 people have been
killed in the past 24 hours in his first
interview since the War Began the
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas
described the conflict as a grave crime
against his people all this comes
shortly after the head of the Israeli
Army warned the dismantling Hamas could
take many more months Graham Satchel
reports night after night for weeks now
the families of those taken hostage take
to the streets of Tel Aviv they're
putting pressure on the Israeli
government to bring the hostages back
alive and stop the
fighting they need to look at other
options the military pressure will
continue but we see they they don't have
any result the head of the Israeli Army
hery Hali said the war could take many
more
months there are no magic Solutions he
said there are no shortcuts in
dismantling a terrorist organization
only determined and persistent
fighting in Gaza itself hospitals are
overrun with the injured and the dead
the World Health Organization says
almost all the hospitals in the Gaza
Strip have now stopped
functioning there's blood everywhere in
these hospitals at the moment we're
seeing almost only trauma cases come
through the door and at a scale that's
quite difficult to believe um it it's
it's a blood bath as we as we said
before it's
Carnage in his first TV interview since
the War Began in October the Palestinian
president mmud Abbas described the
situation as a catastrophe and warns the
West Bank could implode at any
time a huge crime has been committed
against the Palestinians over the past
79 days not just in Gaza but also in the
West Bank and

Ministry says 241 people have been
killed in the last 24 hours taking the
total to more than
20,000 Israel's Campaign which it says
is to destroy the leadership of Hamas
shows no sign of ending Graham Satchel
BBC News well earlier our Middle East
correspondent yolan Nell explained what
else the Palestinian president had to
say in his interview I mean this was
quite a wide raging interview his first
since the 7th of October attacks and he
spoke to Egyptian television of course
Egypt has been uh playing a key role as
a mediator trying to uh broker a new
ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas
in recent days um really he talked about
how this was unprecedented in the
history of the Palestinian people how
Gaza had been rendered
unrecognizable by the the fighting that
was going on he was very critical of the
US accusing it of prolonging the war by
consistently blocking resolutions at the
UN Security Council calling uh for a
ceasefire um but he also gave a warning
that the occupied West Bank where of
course his Palestinian Authority has
limited governance that that could also
implode and just looking at what's
happened overnight we are hearing from
Palestinian Health officials that six
Palestinians have been killed in one of
the urban refugee camps in the North O
of the West Bank close to tul
um and he's uh that means that now more
than 300 Palestinians have been killed
uh by Israeli forces uh by um Israeli
settlers as well since the 7th of
October attacks now in toon the Israeli
military hasn't yet commented on what
its operation there was all about and
you land you mentioned that Egypt's
mediating rule there are reports in
Israeli and Arab media about Egypt
proposing a ceasefire plan do we know
any more details about
that yeah this was a ceasefire plan that
also included um an ability to release
uh more of the hostages of course more
than 100 hostages uh still being held in
the Gaza Strip and we've had hostage
families um as recently as last night
holding protests accusing their
government of not doing enough to bring
their loved ones home um but what we
understand at the moment is that the the
talks um that the initiative that Egypt
proposed has uh faltered uh with both
Israel and Hamas really uh blaming each
other for that but there was a senior
Hamas official who also came out saying
that uh Egypt's initiative had prompted
other countries to make their own
proposals that there were still uh
negotiations going on in the background
even as the fighting on the ground
remains extremely intense that was your
land now well",20231227

rise the Hamas run Health authorities
say more than 20,000 people have now
been killed in Gaza since Israel
launched its offensive Israel maintains
it tries to avoid civilian casualties
and blames Hamas for hiding amongst the
population yes yes the IDF released new
footage showing what it says are tunnels
under the strip used for military
purposes Hamas operates from civilian
areas it uses them to cover its
terrorist activity it is a very complex
challenge that we face and we do it well
so our forces in the field achieve good
results like the Brigade that found the
tunnel
Network while the vast majority of
Destruction has been in Gaza the west
bank has not been spared in the place
where Christianity was born they marked
the birth of Christ by remembering the
deaths this conflict has brought we used
here to have the lightning of the tree
Christmas tree in the middle
here and we used to have a big Christmas
Market in the playground down in the
school and we used to celebrate every
night at least for a week before but
this year we are just praying By Night
the Holy Mass and we will pray for
peace but those prayers are yet to be
answered this has been the most
devastating conflict between Israelis
and Palestinians in modern times and it
shows no signs of ending Joe Inwood BBC
News now let's go live to Cairo Egypt
where we can speak to Sadam s he's the
regional development lead at anera
that's the American near East Refugee
Aid NGO now I understand uh s Saddam
that you have been coordinating some of
the aid that is going through to Gaza
from the Rafa Crossing tell me about the
situation when it comes to Aid at the
moment um thank you for hosing me um
today and Merry Christmas to everyone um
I've been deployed as an era um uh I'm
already I'm I'm based in Jordan I've
been deployed to Egypt since the
beginning of the war trying to
coordinate the entry of Aid um through
Egypt to Gaza so far anera been um you
know a little bit successful in um in
allowing some of the aid to get in into
Gaza that you know we're focusing on
food um so far anera been been able to
distribute over 8
million food barcels vegetables baskets
doing shelters cleaning um we were able
to do over 1 million medical treatment
um for the health facilities inside
inside Gaza with five bbub health
clinics um and and winterization inside
Gaza as you know you know we're we're
looking inside Gaza the situation is
very dire we're looking at nine out of
10 people who are eating less than one
meal a day um and and and this is a a
testament you know by uh the world food
program and the integrated food security
uh classification that was activated
just recently that is uh ringing the
alarm that we're looking into a famine
in Gaza um we're looking at 85% of Gaza
that is being displaced we're looking at
1.9 million people out of their homes
and San how much relief has this UN
resolution the security council's vote
last week made if anything in terms of a
difference to the aid that's getting
through
unfortunately since the very beginning
of the war and this is a a reality
humanitarian Aid um is um is not enough
um the amount of trucks that are are are
going in inside Gaza are not enough on
normal day before the war we were
looking at minimum 500 trucks going
inside Gaza today we're looking at less
than 100 trucks going inside Gaza and
we're looking into a a catastrophe
because the displacement the need is
massive um children are reported who
have dehydration they're not eating um
they the word food program are saying
nine out of 10 people are eating less
than one meal a day so that is a
testament that the aid that is going in
is not enough and we need more of that
uh and we need more humanitarian Aid to
be allowed in there are many
organizations like anera who have great
responses the very beginning of the war
because of the humanitarian situation
inside Gaza that we need to support and
push for more humanitarian Aid to get in
inside Gaza and Sadam is there anything
more your contacts and on the ground can
tell us about this air strike today at
the Alm uh Al magazi refugee camp uh
we're hearing that at least 70 people
have been killed that absolutely
absolutely like we have a team um we've
been operating in Gaza for over 45 years
our team are from Gaza humanitarian
workers are um are at at a critical
position you know because of the
communication blackout uh uh uh uh the
bombardment that is happening in a very
um chaotic way we're we're hearing every
day from our team about the risk of
Distributing aid but as well about the
bombardment that is happening all over
Gaza that is challenging the
humanitarian distribution inside Gaza
that is creating barriers even if you
have Aid it's still very difficult to
get that Aid to where it's needed so we
need a ceasefire we need more
humanitarian Aid getting into Gaza to
support children women the people who
are the 85% of people who are displaced
inside gazan okay Sadam s from anera
thank you very much for bringing us up
to date on the work that your
organization does and on the situation
in Gaza thank
you well we can now cross live to
Bethlehem and join our correspondent
there Shima Khalil uh shimer a much more
subdued Christmas this year
reini Bethlehem feels and looks very
very different Christmas is supposed to
be the height of the season of
celebrations here in Bethlehem the eyes
of the world would have been on this
place the birthplace of Jesus for
celebrations leading the world into uh
the marking of Christmas and yet it
looks nothing like its festive self I've
been here for days and I've been at the
at manger Square where the huge
Christmas tree is supposed to be where
it would be heaving with activity with
pilgrims and tourists celebrating
Christmas none of that is happening
instead yesterday at in the place where
the tree was supposed to be many uh
dozens of Palestinian children held a
flag a Palestinian flag and waved it
with a message of solidarity for gaza's
children the scouts were holding banners
saying we pray uh for Gaza Gaza is in
the heart and you do feel that these
images that come out of G AA including
of course from Al maazi where you what
with what you saw in Joe's report and
what you've been reporting they hit very
close to home here because many here um
also have family and friends trapped
inside Gaza I spoke to one young man
who's on the phone to his father and his
father is trapped in a church in the
east of Gaza City and his dad was
telling me there's just destruction all
around us and they're very reluctant to
move because he says that the roads
leading to areas in the South are
extremely dangerous but also he said
that many people who have moved to
supposedly safer areas um have been
killed and that's the complaint that you
hear even from people that made it out
of the razi they've been evacuated from
Gaza City to come to Central Gaza only
to be hit like they had last night shim
I wanted to ask you um as well about
reports that we're hearing that Egypt
has now put forward a new proposal for a
ceasefire we've been hearing in the last
week or so that talks have resumed and
then we haven't really heard much more
what more can you tell us about these
latest reports
shimer yeah this is another proposal
from from the Egyptians remember when
isma Hana was in Cairo last week there
was a bit of hope that the negotiations
could be underway s serious negotiations
would be underway they've hit a setback
when Hamas came out and said there will
be no deal to exchange hostages without
a ceasefire which is out of the question
for um the Israeli government this is a
three-phase proposal um which could see
um which could see weeks uh of separate
weeks uh of humanitarian pauses but
crucially negotiations on the initial uh
on on releasing the um all civilian
hostages in the first phase then uh
female soldiers in the second phase and
then um all the hostages ultimately in
exchange for several Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails and and and
crucially H the hope is and for a push
for these humanitarian pauses we've
heard uh reports from the Israeli media
of officials saying the cabinet the war
cabinet is going to meet later today to
discuss this an official was saying look
this is a first draft there are going to
be many other drafts until a decision is
made and we we've heard that several
times remember reini with the UN
resolution a as well but potentially
this could lead to some serious
negotiations but I think what doesn't
change is The Stance of both sides
remember Israel has suffered one of
biggest losses Soldier losses um in the
last 48 hours and Benjamin Netanyahu has
had to acknowledge this but said the war
is not going to stop this is going to be
a long War Hamas keeps firing Rockets H
in Israel this week sirens were sounding
near T aiv and unless that's those two
stances budge humanitarian Aid and that
ceasefire is not going to be possible
and I think this is where the biggest
the big challenge for Egypt and other
negotiations negotiators is going to be
difficult Christmas this year for so
many sha Khal reporting for us from
Bethlehem thank you very much",20231225

chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean last
night was launched from Iran Iran has
been accused of backing houthi rebels in
Yemen who've been attacking shipping in
the Red Sea in recent weeks the US says
it's also shot down four drones in the
same Waters the possibility of hostility
spreading further across the region will
concern many International leaders as
Rob Watson
reports could the Drone strike on this
tanker being escorted to a port in India
signal a dangerous new threat to
shipping in the region and an escalation
of Iran's involvement just a few days
ago a senior Iranian Commander
threatened to close the Mediterranean
and Straits of jalter so the prospect
has to be taken seriously but its
foreign minister claims escalation is
not in Iran's
interest for us Regional security is
very important we are not seeking to
expand the scope of war the solution to
the problem is not to establish a
so-called Coalition in the Red Sea but
to stop the Bloodshed of women children
and civilians in the Gaza Strip and the
West
Bank there have already been over 100
attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by
the Iranian banked houthis based in
Yemen the US accuses tan of supporting
and funding such attacks and is
establishing a coalition to patrol the
Red Sea to protect what it calls a
threat to global trade not just Israel's
the houthis aren't attacking just one
country they're really attacking the
International Community uh they they are
attacking the economic well-being and
prosperity of Nations around the
world the sophistication of houthi
attacks against shipping including this
extraordinary Airborne assault on a
vessel in the Red Sea filmed by the
attackers themselves is already having
an impact hundreds of ships have been
diverted from the area at extra cost to

accused Iran of launching the Drone that
damaged an oil tanker off the coast of
India the attack happened 320 km
Southwest of veraval and caused a fire
on board which was extinguished let's
speak live now to our
correspondent ambran Ethan who's in
Delhi for us and ambran the Iranians
saying they had nothing to do with this
but uh tell me the latest that you are
hearing
now what's happening in the Red Sea in
the past 48 Hours has really shaken the
commercial shipping operations now the
US Central Command has issued the latest
update listing out the number of
attempts made on tankers and other
commercial ships passing through the Red
Sea they say two anti-ship ballistic
missiles were fired by the huti rebels
uh from emen and they are regarded as
the proxies of Iran and none of the
ships were damaged and again four drones
were shot down by a us warship and two
other ships were hit one had a narrow
Miss and no Norwegian ship however
another Indian tank was hit by a drone
but not uh much damage or casualties now
we are talking about the attack on
Friday when India bound ship which one
of the British Maritime agencies said
Israeli Affiliated a tanker carrying oil
from Saudi Arabia to India came under
attack about 200 iCal miles off the
coast of Gujarat state in India that has
also shaken the confidence of the
industry now the US blames Iran saying
for the first time that are directly
involved in an attack but the Iranian
authorities they deny so it is still a
mystery who carried out no one has
admitted responsibility but what it
shows is that how one of the busiest
routs now has come under attack by these
Rebel groups or some some others that is
threatening the industry yes that's the
The Wider concern isn't it in terms of
what the authorities are saying what
what are the Indian authorities saying
about
this the Indian coast guard has given an
update on what happened to MV km Pluto
that was the tanker that was attacked
off the coast of India on Friday now
this ship was damaged it got fire but it
was extinguished it also took in some
water now a Coast Guard ship is
accompanying this tanker so it is likely
to reach the port at Mumbai tomorrow to
assess damage and to carry out any
repair work and then they will decide
the future course of action and in fact
the Indian coast c also deployed tonier
surveillance aircraft to make sure that
the ship doesn't have any other threat
in that particular area so it is a
concern for India which heavily relies
on oil and other supplies from the
Middle East so it's not only in the Red
Sea now it is spreading to other areas
but people might question how come a
drone far away from any other country
nearly 2,000 or th000 km away can hit a
Target whether it was launched from
another boat or a ship so that is a
question for defense experts to answer

wording the United Nations security
Council has passed a resolution on the
conflict in Gaza calling for the
unhindered delivery of humanitarian
assistance but stopping short of
supporting an immediate ceasefire
instead it urges the creation of the
conditions for a cessation of
hostilities 13 council members voted for
it with the US and Russia abstaining a
UN agency has warned that gaza's entire
population is at risk of starvation in a
moment will be reporting on the
situation on the ground in Gaza but
first to Washington and our
correspondent there John sudworth
John well the mere fact that there is an
agreement is for many people Rita a
success in itself diplomats ahead of the
vote today speaking of the dire
humanitarian need in Gaza and that
concern is certainly front and center of
this resolution but it is also
undoubtedly a compromise the US making
its position clear through days of
torturous negotiations that there was no
point demanding that Israel stop
fighting or that it give up its
insistence on screening and monitoring
the aid going across the Gaza border if
it has simply no intention of doing
either after the long drawn out
diplomacy the Drafting and redrafting
finally the Moment of
Truth the wide show of support from most
Security Council Members was no surprise
the resolution the UAE has put in blue
this morning morning responds to the
calls for a sustainable cessation of
hostilities and a massive scale up of
humanitarian Aid often in diplomacy the
challenge is meeting the moment in the
world we live in not in the world that
we want all eyes were on the US and
Russia in the end they both abstained
but it wasn't a veto and so the
resolution
passed on the ground its immediate
practical implications may be limited
the US did much to tone down the
language motivated by what it sees as
Israel's right to keep
fighting so the call for an immediate
ceasefire has gone replaced instead with
a call only for the conditions that
might eventually lead to
one and the insistence in earlier drafts
that the United Nations take control of
the delivery of Aid has also been struck
out the final version Now talks of
Consulting all relevant parties
as always the geopolitics were never far
from the
surface with Russia describing the us as
shameful for not calling for a ceasefire
the US in turn dismissed that claim
given Russia's actions in Ukraine and
then made clear it had lingering
concerns of its own while we are
encouraged that the council spoke out on
this humanitarian crisis we're deeply
disappointed a called actually that once
again the council was not able to
condemn hamas's horrific terrorist
attack on October
7th despite the differences though there
is now agreement on the scale of the
crisis in Gaza and the intent at least
to do more to address it John sudworth

Jerusalem let's go back to John sudworth
in Washington uh John if the UN
resolution as you said has little
immediate practical impact what does
happen
next well as so often in diplomacy Rita
points of high principle have
surrendered to real politic there is no
call for an immediate ceasefire the UN
has failed in its efforts to wrestle
control of Aid flows into Gaza away from
Israel so you know you might well ask
that question what is the point then of
this resolution of broad principle I
think in the end for those who say that
this has achieved something the
important thing isn't just the agreement
itself but the fact that it now has the
backing of really the only outside power
that has clout in this conflict Israel's
staunch al Ally the United States and of
course this resolution although Israel
may choose to ignore the letter of it
does have the force of international law
and the US can perhaps behind the scenes
now use this to pressure Israel some
observers will hope to do more to
minimize civilian casualties and to work
harder to increase those flows of Aid
into Gaza",20231222

Daily Global where we'll bring you the
top stories from around the world in the
past few hours the UN Security Council
has adopted a resolution on Gaza after
days of negotiations it doesn't call for
a ceasefire and leaves Israel in control
of monitoring Aid deliveries but the
United Arab Emirates which sponsored the
resolution says it can make a real
difference for Palestinian civilians the
United States and Russia were the only
two members of the security C Council to
abstain the United States ambassador to
the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield spoke
after the resolution was passed have
listen to what she had to
say it took many days and many many long
nights of negotiating to get this right
but today this Council provided a
glimmer of hope amongst a sea of
unimaginable suffering today this
Council called for Urgent steps to
immediately allow safe unhindered and
expanded humanitarian access and to
create the conditions for a sustainable
cessation of hostilities that was the US
ambassador to the UN while the UN
Secretary General Antonio gues also
spoke after the resolution was passed
and he says despite the Diplomatic
pressure nothing seems to be changing in
Gaza over the last weeks and days there
has been no significant change in the
way the war has been unfolding in Gaza
there is no effective protection of
civilians intense Israeli bombardment
and ground operations
continue more than 20,000 Palestinians
have reportedly been killed the vast
majority women and
children meanwhile ahas and other
Palestinian factions continue to fire
Rockets from Gaza into
Israel well the UK ambassador to the UN
emphasized how the resolution should
help aid suppliers to Gaza and today we
supported this resolution which will
streamline Aid checks so we can
massively scale up the humanitarian
response it demands the immediate and
unconditional release of
hostages and it calls for steps towards
a sustainable cessation of
hostilities and for the avoidance of
doubt we are clear that the resolution
is without prejudice to the rights and
obligations of parties under
International humanitarian
law that was the UK ambassador to the UN
well our un correspondent Neda toik is
in New York with more the United States
explained in the council that ultimately
why while they were happy that this was
stepping up humanitarian Aid they were
not happy that the council did not
include a condemnation of Hamas for the
October 7th attack and she said that is
what led them to eventually abstain now
it is worth noting that that the draft
was humanitarian in nature uh and those
on the council who have
discussed this resolution said there
must be a condemnation of all parties if
one is named and so ultimately
the United States while it it did say
that didn't use its veto to block this
draft and that came after just intense
intense negotiations really at the
highest level in capitals to try to
reach an agreement and as we heard from
the Secretary General today you know he
says there shouldn't be a judgment about
the aid and how much is getting in by
the number of trucks that are at the
borders Crossing into Gaza he said that
there is a real problem with the way is
Israel is conducting its military
operation again these kind of
international calls for a ceasefire are
growing so loudly and while the UAE did
kind of defend this resolution she did
acknowledge the Ambassador L nbe that it
is not perfect and that they will
continue to push for a ceasefire and
another the the language that was
changed in in order for this to to go
through refers to a ceasefire in terms
of creating conditions for a ceasefire
that's what this is that too vague to be
meaningful that's what a lot of critics
argue um you know we saw for example
real divides in the Arab group of
Nations Jordan Algeria you know members
taking their name off sponsoring this
resolution because they thought it was
just watered down too much that it
really made no impact they said it would
be better not to have a resolution at
all rather than to have this one but
again some saying given the Dynamics on
the ground given the United States is
still against a ceasefire it was better
to kind of work within the parameters
they could to get some stronger uh you
know put some a security Council
resolution that would give some push to
diplomacy to get more Aid in rather than
to have nothing so there is a bit of
disagreement about this resolution but
what we heard from a number of members
in the council was that Effectiveness
will be judged in the coming weeks on
how much it actually does change the
humanit humanitarian catastrophe in
Gaza that was our un correspondent Neda

the Middle East and the United Nations
security Council has again delayed a
vote on a resolution calling for a halt
to the fighting in Gaza it's the fourth
time it's been postponed this week it
has been delayed since Monday as member
states try to work out a draft that the
United States won't veto our United
Nations correspondent Neda torfi has the
latest from New York what I heard from
one Diplomat is that they've made more
progress today than they have all week
and that they are narrowing the gaps
what we have received is the latest
draft resolution and it is different in
key aspects from the last proposal now
instead of calling for a suspension of
hostilities the draft now calls for
Urgent steps to immediately allow safe
and unhindered humanitarian access with
creating conditions for a sustainable
cessation of hostilities so the wording
there toned down from the original draft
the resolution ution on the table now
also appoints a senior humanitarian and
reconstruction coordinator that will
then appoint a un mechanism to try to
speed up Aid into Gaza uh so it's all
quite a mouthful but these are the
proposals on the table this was made to
try to uh prevent a US veto to get the
United States on board with this
resolution that's Neda toik at the
United Nations well after the meeting
ended the UN ambassador to the UN Linda
Thomas Greenfield spoke to
reporters we do have that resolution now
we're ready to vote on it uh and uh it's
a resolution that will bring
humanitarian assistance to those in need
it will support uh
the uh the priority that EA pass in
ensuring that we put uh a a mechanism uh
um on the ground that will support
humanitarian
assistance um and we're ready to vote
for it that's the UN US ambassador at
the UN well let's cross to Joe floto who
is our Middle East bureau chief he's
live in Jerusalem for us Joe thank you
very much for joining us um let's talk
about this um resolution how significant
would it be if the UN signs up to
it look I think at the moment we're
seeing in uh New York uh diplomacy
meeting reality so what we've got here
uh are two sides who are uh violently
opposed to each other but are have very
different views on when the next
ceasefire should happen so Hamas and the
other Palestinian factions fighting in
Gaza have come out very publicly and in
conversation with uh Egyptian mediators
to say there will be no uh Paws no
negotiation for a transfer of hostages
uh unless the the the conflict finishes
unless the the ceasefire is permanent on
the Israeli side they say well we're not
going to agree to that because we are
fighting an enemy who inflicted a huge
amount of suffering and damage on our
country on October the 7th and continues
to fire Rockets into Israel the Israeli
Prime Minister says we won't stop until
Hamas is destroyed but Israel is open to
a longer ceasefire in exchange for
hostages but I have to be realistic here
I mean last night an Israeli senior
official told us that they're not
actually in a negotiation at the moment
although they are having useful talks
with mediators so the two sides are very
very far apart and in the middle well
we've got 2 and a half million people in
Gaza 1.9 million of them are uh
displaced from their homes and the UN is
reporting uh severe hunger uh and
disease spreading amongst those people
not to mention of course uh the deal is
climbing as the military operation
continues every single day and how much
Aid is at the moment getting in we know
quite a bit got in where there was the
pause in fighting but since that has
resumed are any trucks getting in dayto
day so trucks are going in uh they vary
dayto day uh how many go in sometimes it
can be up to 200 trucks a day and then
that flow goes down the UN is saying
look uh we need to speed this up and if
Israel were to open fully it it's Main
terminal with Gaza on the Israeli side
then that could be fulfilled uh
currently uh there is a a very slow
encumbersome uh operation to check every
single truckload of Aid and that is
controlled by Israel Israel says that's
necessary because it doesn't want
anything going to Hamas that would help
it prosecute its War uh and at the
moment there's not enough Aid going
through by anyone's assessment apart
from Israel Israel says there's plenty
of food still in Gaza the markets have
food and it's actually the un uh who
could speed up their supply of trucks
for inspection something that the UN
flatly Rejects and said that's not true
Joe floto in Jerusalem thank you very
much indeed well we can speak now to Sam
block who is director of emergency
response for World Central Kitchen in
Gaza which has been working to provide
meals for Citizens inside Gaza Sam
you're in Rafa which is in the south of
Gaza what is the situation like with you
where you
are so in Rafa uh we're working both in
Northern Gaza and in southern Gaza but
in in southern Gaza we've seen just an
incredible condensing of the population
uh the whole southern part of Gaza
normally has about
280,000 uh people living here and we we
now have uh well over a million so there
there is people absolutely everywhere uh
seeking some sense of of safety um we're
we're feeding as many of them as we can
we're currently U providing enough food
via our trucks coming across for at one
meal a day about 22% of the population
but that is obviously not even close to
enough um we're we're we're doing all
all that it is that we can we sending as
we have a lot of trucks in the pipeline
we've had about 400 trucks enter Gaza
already um and we have a lot uh waiting
on the Egyptians side uh to come in
there is the the the there is food on
the markets on the so to speak markets
lots of little Street vendors a lot of
which are reselling um uh humanitarian
food that's been donated it's kind of
become the informal economy you need one
thing you you you know sell or trade one
thing you receive but all the food uh
coming from within Gaza is is becoming
on very very short demand and while
there is food in those markets it's
three to four times what the average uh
cost would have been there's a a severe
uh scarcity in addition to
that some people may know there's been
very very little propane means for
people to cook food uh here in Rafa you
know Southern Gaza every possible every
tree you know every time you drive
anywhere every day you see less and less
trees so people are resting to anything
possible
um to create heat in order to be able to
cook fuel World Central Kitchen is
bringing in Alternatives we've designed
in engineering um alternative to propane
cooking cooking stoves and fuel sources
uh but it's still simply notal you
mentioned you're in the south of Gaza
what is the situation like in the North
is it is it much worse
there the reports are um
really really hard hard to handle uh I
will be going up to to to Gaza City
tomorrow uh especially even in the
hospitals you know we're getting reports
uh from the hospitals to where they they
would prefer water over medical
attention because that's what how
immediate the need is so we will be
taking food and water up there again
it's been trickling up it's very
challenging to get the food into Gaza
but into Southern Gaza but then to get
it up to even the hospitals and Northern
Gaza it's extremely challenging so we're
hoping to be able to push more up we
were able to push a lot up during the
last ceasefire we're definitely hoping
for the ceasefire to really get as much
as we possibly can to northern northern
Gaza and Gaza City are you hopeful of
that happening at any point in the near
future hopeful is a hopeful is a big
word um things are are changing here
daily so you really have to um you
really have to be addressing every every
situation from day to day moment to
moment and and being as ready as
possible we've you know have multiple
contingency plans every single day for
every action that we do so uh yes
hopeful but then also constant planning
and backup plans to do as much as we can
okay s block director of emergency
respons of world Central Kitchen in Gaza

had already lost one son I couldn't risk
losing
another what did my son do to die like

mistake in the rush to go we did didn't
even close our front door then we
started our journey through
hell there were Israeli soldiers
stationed in demolish buildings along
the road we didn't want to use our
phones to film as we were worried about
being
targeted we walked for hours and you
eventually would have to cross the
Israeli Army's
checkpoint we were nervous my children
kept asking what will the soldiers do to
us we came to a stop about a kilometer
from the checkpoint itself self joining
a long queue of people that stretched
across the entire width of the
road we spent more than 4 hours
waiting sometimes only taking one step
forward in half an
hour people were crying and there was no
room to sit
down my father fainted and we had to
hold him
up when we entered the checkpoint it
felt like Judgment Day I saw about 50
people people in total get detained all
men they were asked to strip to their
underwear and sit on the
[Music]
ground
[Music]
a few meters beyond the checkpoint I saw
four detainees in their underwear being
blindfolded beside a demolished building
there was a wall of sand the Blindfolded
men were taken to the Sand Hill by
soldiers and then took steps down out of
my vision then we heard gunfire I'm not
sure whether they were shot or not
further along the road I saw corpses and
rting body parts I saw about 10 buddies
on the ground they were covered in flies
and being eaten by birds giving off one
of the foulest smells I have ever
experienced I screamed at the top of my
lungs telling my children not to look I
told them to look at the sky and
continue
walking then an Israeli tank appeared it
was moving towards us at speed in our

over those
bodies

I was very comfortable with my life I
had a very beautiful house it was a pent
house on the beach had um very nice car
uh my kids were in a private school they
learn English and French it was a very
nice life and then the 7th of October
came it was 6:00 a.m. in the in the
morning I'm hearing a lot of noise
hearing a lot of rockets flying to
Israel in the first six hours there were
only Rockets from Hamas but then after
that the response started and the
rockets started flying from both sides
we took the kids the Escape bag and we
took the decision to move to my father's
in-law
house I got to the house and I'm looking
around and it's just just an empty
house burnt destroyed fully no
walls there's nothing in the house like
full destrction I didn't feel that much
of sadness I don't know
why but I think it's like any other
gazin now anything
materialistic just
worthless it was 3:00 a.m. in the
morning where we get a phone call from d
was a recorded message saying that for
your safety you need to leave the North
and head to the South as soon as
possible I was shocked I was in a shock
I'm running for my life I'm trying to
protect my family's life it was still so
dark bombing were
everywhere but we were like you know
what we're not going to take a chance to
stay for one more minute so we started
moving with our cars to the South to
friend house the 150 square M apartment
we were around seven families around 60
people it was just very very
difficult so every night when it gets
dark We Gather in a small Corner in the
house me my two daughters and my wife we
close the ears of our of our
kids and sometimes we get scared
ourselves so we leave our kids and we SC
we close our ears and we tell them to
put their hands on their ears because
it's very difficult and it's extremely
dark there's nothing that you can see so
you keep on holding your kids so that
they don't run
away and I got a call from the Canadian
embassy saying you know what you're able
to evacuate you your wife and your two
daughters but not your parents you're
you're you're wearing the life of your
daughters with the life of your parents
there's no way I'm leaving and I'm
leaving my parents behind and they're
old and they need
me but then something happened and it
was a sign for me that I had to leave so
there was bombing right beside us uh my
older daughter SOA was playing she has
diabetes uh her sugar liver was around
300 when she heard the boming she got so
scared so her sugar level dropped from
300 to 30 all of a sudden and that means
that she can get G aoma at any second
and that means which is worst that she
has to be
hospitalized and there's no hospitals
operating at that time they're all full
of wounded people full of dead people so
she can't really have a place to be
hospitalized
at and now I'm here to a certain extent
comfortable with my
family and that's where I get the

love about Canada one thing that there's
no

but surely I'm trying to get them out of
like the memory that they had for the

approved the release of his name and of
course the IDF has expressed our deepest
regret towards the families of those
Fallen Israeli hostages we are
investigating the matter we have already
issued uh lessons and directives for our
troops on the ground in order to
minimize the chances of this happening
again and of course we will continue to
operate relentlessly in order to defeat
Hamas despite this horrible and sad
event and we will not be deterred or
delayed and we will continue to fight
Hamas until it is defeated and until
security is returned to Southern Israel
I'm sure that the details around it will
be subject to to an inquiry is there any
further information you can give us as
to why they were mistaken for Hamas
Fighters were they in the vicinity of
Hamas Fighters were they dressed in a
Palestinian way was there any was there
any other explanation for why they were
shot and killed
yes uh one of them is well there's
actually two one relates to their
clothing they were dressed in civilian
clothing and probably in a similar
fashion to what we have seen Hamas
combatants Hamas Fighters or terrorists
that have been fighting on the ground
against Israeli troops all over the Gaza
Strip in sajia where this happened and
in other locations as well we've seen
Hamas Fighters with RPG grenade
launchers in their hands and AK-47s and
IEDs dressed in civilian clothes and
that adds complexity to the uh
situational awareness of our troops and
the second thing is that before and
after this tragic mistake occurred there
were clashes between Israeli troops in
the area and Hamas combatants and that
apparently was also part of the reasons
for this very sad mistake this
misidentification by Israeli soldiers
terms of the other three bodies that
were recovered the the way it was
reported was that special forces had
gone in and recovered them does that
suggest that Hamas is keeping hold of
these bodies and that they they had to
be taken back by force they weren't they
weren't dumped they were they were being
used as a as
leverage yes all of our
132 remaining hostages are being used as
leverage both those that are alive and
we know that many are still alive and
those that we presume are dead some we
know for sure were taken corpses of
soldiers that were taken when they were
already dead on October the 7th and many
We Fear are now dead because of various
things that happened Hamas abuse and
violence um and yes we know that Hamas
cynically holds on to each and every
Israeli that they have Dead or Alive
civilian or military woman or man and we
have 1777 women still left in Hamas
captivity women and children left in
Hamas captivity and as I said for the
last 70 days these 132 Israelis are now
in Hamas
captivity it's more than two months uh
and you're still not in control full
control of Northern Gaza um another
rocket came across the border today
there's been more intense fighting which
would suggest Hamas still has an ability
to control its troops there is a a
command and control
structure are you talking weeks or
months yes you are correct in what
you're saying Hama still has command and
control they still have the ability to
conduct some levels of operations less
so in the north but still more so in the
South we will continue to operate and
degrade their military capabilities
until they are totally disintegrated
that is our Focus all all over the Gaza
Strip and I wouldn't want to put a time
limit on our operations I will say that
it will we will operate as long as it
takes and we will fight as long as we
need to because we understand that our
Israeli civilians more than 100,000
Israeli civilians that have been forced
out of their homes back in the kibuts
that were assaulted on October the 7th
they have not yet gone back to their
homes and they will not go back to their
homes until it's safe and it will only
be safe after mass is dismantled and
after their Commander control and combat
capabilities are totally disintegrated
and that is what we will do in in
political terms there's a lot of talk at
the moment about some of the daylight
that's appearing between the Israeli
government and the way the the White
House wants this operation to run um
President Biden wants the IDF to
transition to a more targeted phase uh
phase of the operation but according to
us intelligence nearly half the
Munitions that Israel has used in Gaza
have been
unguided missiles otherwise known as
dumb bombs how can you assure people
you're taking the greatest care with
civilian life if you're dropping bombs
that cannot be
precise yeah that is not really accurate
part of what you're saying is accurate
part of it isn't and that report that
CNN report that uh was referencing us
intelligence Anonymous sources that um
didn't um State their names for their
claims but uh those claims aren't really
accurate because they do not take into
consideration addon kits that are added
to ordinary bombs in order to turn them
into what one what Layman usually call
Smart bombs or accurate bombs and they
are a very large part of the weapons
that we have been using um I think that
we will have an official explanation
hopefully shortly for that so-called
report where we will shed more light on
it but what I can say categorically and
I've been saying this we have been
saying this from the beginning of the
operation and we stand by it today as
well we distinguish between militant and
between combatant and non-combatant we
try to use the smallest available
weapons in order to achieve a military
objective and we strike only when there
is a clear military necessity to strike
those are the guidelines that we started
out with those are the guidelines that
we continue to to do today and I take
use a very sad another sad Israeli
example to shed some more light on how
what cautious we are in using um fires
there was a sad incident two days ago
two and a half days ago of 10 Israeli
soldiers that unfortunately were killed
in a Hamas Ambush inside the house um
and they're from the Golani Brigade and
they were killed in an ambush and uh
there were many claims inside Israel by
bereaved families and others who were
asking the IDF why don't you just carpet
bomb and and bomb everything there and
why do we have troops going into houses
and searching our response was that we
use military force were applicable and
according to the mission in this case it
was a search mission where our troops
went in in order to find and understand
what happened we could have bombed the
house from the beginning without going
in which would feed into those theories
that you just referenced but we didn't
we searched it on the ground because we
apply our Force according to the mission
and what needs to be
accomplished okay uh well that's some
context behind uh the operations
leftenant Colonel Jonathan conri is
always grateful for your time thank you
than you for having me let's speak to
hugoo who's in Jerusalem for us tonight
um can we just start very quickly by how
the families have reacted to this news
uh about the the three hostages killed
by the
IDF yeah Christian so we understand that
there's a March now in Tel Aviv and some
relatives and some families are now
marching uh to the headquarters uh of
the IDF the Israeli military I was in
Tel Aviv few days ago talking to some
relatives and Friends of these hostages
more than a 100 people who remain in
captivity in Gaza and uh obviously there
was you know always the risk that as the
Israeli military goes ahead with this
military offens
that some of the captives could be
killed by the Israeli Army I think what
makes this case more tragic is that this
wasn't an air strike that destroyed a
building and uh these captives were
killed they were shot dead by soldiers
on the ground who mistakenly identified
them as hostages so uh a tragic incident
in the words of the Israeli military uh
we had a statement from the Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
described this as an unbearable tragedy
and again he vowed to return all
hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza
even at the cost of uh their lives and
he described this as a sacred mission
for the Israeli military",20231215

the Middle East because Israel has said
it is opening the border crossing point
at Kem Shalom for more Aid to go into
the Gaza Strip the first time since the
outbreak of the war that Israel has
allowed supplies to enter Gaza from its
own territory it's a decision that's
been welcomed by the World Health
Organization the move was also supported
by the White House National Security
adviser Jake Sullivan who's visiting the
region Mr Sullivan has met today with
the Palestinian Authority president
Mahmud abas he called that Crossing
Point decision move a significant step
well our Middle East correspondent Hugo
Bea told me more about that opening of
the second crossing point and more about
those talks with Mahmud
abas an important uh announcement by the
Israeli authorities because this is
going to allow more humanitarian Aid to
be delivered to Gaza for days we've been
talking about uh the desperate situation
ation humanitarian situation in Gaza
with widespread shortages of basic
supplies also hospitals under a lot of
pressure with the health system on the
verge of collapse so now uh more uh
trucks carrying uh basic supplies will
be entering uh Gaza up until now all
trucks uh were entering uh the territory
uh through the rougher Crossing uh on
the border with Egypt and now Israel
saying that the Kem shalom crossing
point will also be open for uh the
delivery of humanitarian Aid and this
comes on the second day of the visit by
the US National Security advisor Jake
Sullivan he was in ramala in the
occupied West Bank he met the president
of the Palestinian Authority Mahmud
Abbas and yesterday he had meetings with
the Israeli leadership and I think the
message here from the Biden
Administration was that uh he was trying
to tell the Israeli military to change
you know tactics uh in Gaza and to move
to a phase that he described as more
targeted and precise uh attacks to
Target the Hamas leadership in Gaza this
obviously amid uh International pressure
on the Israelis as uh you know that have
been concerns about uh mounting civilian
casualties in Gaza and also the
worsening uh humanitarian situation and
fighting in Gaza continues and we
actually heard
the Iron Dome intercepting uh Rockets
here over the city Reports say that
three rockets were intercepted by the
country's uh military the first time
that Jerusalem came under attack uh in
several weeks so again it shows that uh
you know these groups continue to have
the capacity to launch uh Rockets uh at
Israel as this offensive this military
offensive continues in Gaza well that's
our correspondent uh there's been
reaction from the British foreign SEC
David Cameron welcoming Israel's
decision to allow the entry of Aid
through that Kem Shalom Crossing he said
very pleased to see Israel's decision to
open the crossing point it's a vital
step towards ensuring significantly more
life-saving Aid can reach the people of

Alin let's go back to developments in
the Israel Gaza war and Israel's bombing
of the Gaza Strip has continued unabated
in the lead up to a visit on Thursday by
America's national security advisor Jake
Sullivan well this was the scene in the
town of Rafa this morning the Hamas Ron
Health Ministry in Gaza says Israel's
early morning air strikes have killed at
least 19 people
us officials say Mr Sullivan's expected
to call for greater Precision in future
Israeli strikes on Hamas there's been
growing International criticism of
Israel Over the number of Civilian
casualties and at the UN General
Assembly earlier in the week there was
an overwhelming vote in favor of a
ceasefire while joining me to discuss
all of this a little further is Melanie
Ward she's the CEO of Medical Aid for
Palestinians thank you for joining us
here on BBC News Melanie you have have
contacts with people on the ground what
are you hearing about the humanitarian
needs at the
moment what I'm hearing from my staff on
the ground is that every day which
passes makes it more and more difficult
to sustain human life in Gaza that's
because of the systematic denial of food
water medicine and fuel to the civilian
population in in Gaza including to the
hospitals and it's because of Israel's
in indiscriminate bombing um which has
been killing so many civilians soon we
will approach the marker where 10,000
children will have been killed by the
bombardments from the air the horrific
truth is that Aid distribution has
largely stopped including in in the
south of Gaza with some limited
exceptions we just can't get in the
number of Aid trucks that are needed uh
myself Medical Aid for Palestinians we
have seven trucks that have been waiting
for days now to get in just haven't been
able to even when they do get in it's so
dangerous because of the ongoing bombing
staff are unable to get them to people
in need and this morning we're
particularly concerned about the
patients in Kamal adwan Hospital in the
north of Gaza in B Leia which two days
ago was surrounded by Israeli troops
where there were 65 patients including
12 children and we're hearing this
morning that hospital staff there are
unable even to prepare milk formula for
the babies there some of whom's two of
their mothers were shot dead by the
Israelis a couple of days ago so the
situation couldn't be more Grim we're
running out of words to use to describe
what is happening to civilians in Gaza I
wanted to ask you about the situation in
hospitals before you mentioned it
actually Melanie because I was talking
to a representative from UNICEF
yesterday who talked about how he's
visited hospitals that don't even have
clean water um by your estimations how
many hospitals in Gaza are able to
function even partially now there were
fewer than onethird of hospitals in Gaza
that are functioning now so that's fewer
than 12 even Primary Health Care Centers
have been taken out of action it's
completely impossible to save lives
anymore ambulances are not functioning
the civil defense which usually digs
people out of the rubble is unable to do
its job we just can't get supplies into
the hospitals that are needed so really
there are a very tiny number in the
south of Gaza that are still providing
emergency room services and as I said
more and more of the hospitals across
Gaza have been systematically dismantled
by the military action that's that's
taking place you know hospitals are
supposed to be a Haven under
international law they're supposed to be
protected and what we're seeing in this
horrific conflict is that they have
become battlefields themselves and for
the patients who are there it's
absolutely terrifying it's also
completely
unacceptable and we're unable to sustain
human life in in this situation you know
as I said we've got trucks of medical
supplies waiting to get it into Gaza now
when they do get in we can't even get
them to all of the hospitals in need
because the Israelis won't let aid
supplies across the front line there was
a convoy a couple of days ago that ran
to the north to try to take medical
supplies to some of the hospitals even
it came under Fire And there are
desperate people children women people
in intensive care who need to be kept
alive and we can't do that and from
Kamal Adan Hospital were also hearing
this morning that some of the patients
have started to die because medical
staff rounded up and detained by the
Israeli military and Melanie just
briefly before we let you go um is any
uh significant Aid Crossing uh from uh
the Rafa Crossing into Gaza from Egypt
tell me amounts of Aid are getting in
yesterday 100 trucks got in but to give
comparison on a normal day in Gaza
before this even started 500 trucks of
supplies were needed every day so it's a
drop in the ocean compared to what's
needed but the main point is that this
is not an accident there are hundreds of
trucks queued on the other side of the
Border waiting to get in and the Israeli
authorities won't allow them in so there
was Aid there waiting to reach the
people who are in desperate need who
were sleeping on the streets now in Rafa
who have fled including my own staff
from place to place to place because
Israel keeps telling everyone to move
somewhere else and then that place is
attacked so there are aid supplies
waiting to get to people but we are
unallowed to reach them at the moment
okay Melanie Ward the CEO of Medical Aid
for Palestinians thank you very much for
bringing us up to date on the situation
particularly in hospitals in
Gaza there's of course more on that

overwhelmingly for an immediate
humanitarian ceasefire in

called the vote an historic moment
Israel said a ceasefire would only
benefit Hamas to the detriment of gazans
though it's non-binding analysts say it
acts as a powerful measure of
international opinion 23 countries in
including the UK abstained Israel and
the United States are two of just 10
countries that voted against the
ceasefire President Biden earlier said
Israel was losing International support
because of what he called its
indiscriminate bombing of Gaza let's go
live to Jerusalem now and speak to our
correspondent yolan Nell good morning
yoland has there been any reaction there
to this so far this
morning I mean things already looked
very much like they were going in this
direction so we had a lot of strong
reaction in advance from um Israel's
Ambassador uh to the un uh from Israeli
officials um really insisting that you
know the world cannot tell Israel close
allies cannot tell Israel to go after
Hamas to dismantle it in Gaz on the one
hand and on the other hand call for a
ceasefire this has been the consistent
message from Israel in recent days but
it will be very aware that this is in
intense diplomatic pressure now and also
worrying for Israeli leaders to see uh
some of the the differing opinions that
are coming from uh the US its closest
Ally as well you know of course from the
very beginning the US President Joe
Biden he he arrived here soon after
those awful 7th of October attacks to
show solidarity with Israel um at the UN
Security Council it was Washington that
vetoed any attempt to get such a a
ceasefire resolution through just last
Friday Friday um but these remarks made
on the campaign Trail by uh President
Biden saying that um really Israel was
starting to lose International support
because of what he called indiscriminate
bombing that use of language um was very
strong and there's also been admission
from uh the Israeli Prime Minister there
have been differences of opinion we've
also had uh Mr Biden coming out saying
that Benjamin n Netanyahu must change
his Hardline government um and he must
ultimately accept Israel must ultimately
accept that it cannot say no he said to
an independent Palestinian state that is
something that hardliners in Israel's
government vehemently oppose okay thank
you so much Yan Nell in Jerusalem for us
well let's now talk to Jason Lee who is
country director at save the children in
occupied Palestinian territory Jason
thank you for being on the program um so
we were just discussing the outcome of
uh the United Nations uh latest
resolution there as it were but in terms
of what you're seeing and experiencing
on a day-to- byday basis in
Gaza they will not see a difference will
they fortunately no the situation is bad
and getting worse it is dire we have now
1.9 million people that's 85% of the
population that are homeless they're
displaced they have nowhere to sleep no
access to food to water to critical
health care that that they need and also
there are no sanitation facilities
available and half of them are children
the situation is getting worse every
single day every day that the world
Community does nothing nothing and sits
and waits the price is that children are
paying the price again this war is
disproportionately affecting
children the international pressure is
increasing on uh the Israelis but uh
prime minister Netanyahu says he will
continue with the military uh
campaign the thinking is they've got
weeks a window of weeks in order to
achieve what they trying to achieve but
I mean every day is such a long time
isn't it for for Gaza for the people who
are suffering
there children do not have weeks there
is no time it rained again last night
which means that there's so much
pressure on the camps that are set up
here the tents that there will be soon
overflooded there is no sanitation
facility the risk of a public health
outbreak chalera um we already seeing
jaund dislike symptoms appearing amongst
the population and especially with the
cold weather children are more
susceptible to pneumonia so children do
not have weeks yeah and and we
completely appreciate that so so what
talk us through what you're able to do
at save the children uh what Aid are you
able to get in who have you got on the
ground not enough we are not not able to
get enough Aid we are restricted by the
fact that the number of trucks coming in
is not sufficient to keep the 2.3
million people alive we do not have
enough Personnel humanit Personnel to
come in to actually reach those
populations in need and most of all we
do not have free movement throughout all
of the Gaza Strip there is not unfitted
access for humanitarians to do our job
we need to get to all areas of Gaza from
the north to canun to areas of the South
it is critical that we are allowed in my
own teams are displaced and
unfortunately on Monday night on Monday
morning sorry I lost one of my team
members his four children his wife and
30 members of his extended family

sorry to hear that that is so difficult

to tunnel and the head of the Israeli
Army is calling for the offensive in
Gaza to be stepped up amid signs he says
that Hamas is falling apart here in
jabalia in the north the battles are at
Close Quarters one local told the BBC
they've received no food or water for 5
days Israel is under growing
International pressure to spare gaza's
civilians other countries should also
understand that it is impossible on the
one hand to support the elimination of
Hamas and on the other hand to call for
an end to the war which will prevent the
elimination of Hamas after this group of
men and boys taken by Israeli forces 5
days ago were released they claimed they
were tortured among them Muhammad Mahmud
Salim held separately from his dad they
made asleep naked he said and kept
hitting us with their guns they hit me
when I asked where my dad was they they
hit us with wires the BBC has asked the
Israeli military for a
response new aerial shots show Palestine
Square previously a bustling spot of
Gaza City now under control of Israeli
forces marking the Jewish Hanukkah
holiday after two months of the most
intense ever war between Israel and the
Palestinians the scale of the suffering
and Devastation here is
unprecedented yolan Nell BBC News
Jerusalem we can just show you some live
shots now of Gaza itself this is the
view from Israel looking into Gaza and
you can see huge plumes of smoke there
on the skyline going up into the sky um
we've been watching these pictures for a
couple of hours now and there's been
constant uh plumes of smoke rising up
over Gaza today that's the live pictures
from a camera in Israel pointing towards
the Gaza Street our correspondent our
Gaza correspondent Rush Abu alif gave me
the latest on the situation inside
Gaza last night there was a very heavy
fighting inun not from the direction
that the Israelis have been trying to uh
you know move into the city center of
kanun but from another Direction in the
east of kanun they came from Bena
Village and they cut through Salah Road
and now they are advancing from another
Direction into kanun people were talking
about very heavy fighting overnight and
and this morning with also Israeli
artillery fire was Heavy in that area
the since the collapse of the
humanitarian Seas fire the Israeli Army
was pushing hard towards the city of
kanun kanun is the second biggest city
in the entire of Gaza Strip and it's the
place where about a million people came
this place from the north and they were
taking canun as as a shelter now they
have to to move farther west to the area
called Al maasi it's a very small area
not not designed to receive this number
of people there's no building or
infrastructure in it and also other
people were left to RAF RAF is a very
small town near the border with with
Egypt and people are now hundreds of
thousands of people are taking this very
tiny piece of land as a as a shelter and
the humanitarian situation is really
severe in the area with very little Aid
coming other two key
places where the Israeli Army is pushing
hard is the east of Gaza City
neighborhood another stronghold for
Hamas and in the north jab but last
night the focus of the operation and the
fighting the heavy fighting was
down we've been hearing from the UN
officials saying that Aid is really only
reaching a very small area of the
territory I mean what is in terms of the
movement of people how much are people
heeding those warnings and moving around
or some people just finding that they're
having to stay put despite the fighting
around
them yes I mean like in jabalia in the
north there was warning from October the
13th about over like a month ago for the
people to leave but because the the the
south is very crowded and people don't
know where to go and since the Israelis
are controlling the Main Street Sal Ro
and there is a checkpoint and fighting
according to Hamas local author in the
north there still about 100,000 people
in jabal refugee camp itself and that's
almost like 30% of the total number of
population who lives normally in javal
Camp is the biggest Camp about
250,000 people and according to like
local Authority and the UN about half
million people are still in Gaza City
and the North and since the this map of
that this divided Gaza into too many
looks were published by the Israeli Army
following the ceasefire about 80% of the
population don't have internet to
activate this QR code and know where to
go and how to go the the Israeli Army is
droing leaflets in the area but
sometimes they ask the people to go from
this corner to that corner and they
don't know they that they should stay in
the other corner where to go because
next day they might receive another
warning to leave this corner so very
complicated humanitarian situation in
guys Abu Al there now let's go live to
Jerusalem we can speak to our
correspondent yolan Nell and we've been
hearing these dire warnings haven't we
Yan from the aid agencies talking about
how people are starving and Aid really
isn't getting through to the people who
need it and then we've also as the
counter to that we're hearing from the
head of the Israeli Army talking about
how they need to step up their campaign
in
Gaza indeed and actually if you look at
what's been happening overnight it does
seem that there is an intensification of
fighting uh there's been smoke rising up
from the Horizon over the north of Gaza
and we've heard of Heavy bombardment
Across The Strip overnight then uh down
in Ken Unice the Israeli Army has given
more evacuation orders for places in the
center of that City seen as a stronghold
of Hamas telling them to flee um but
we're hearing that the fighting actually
now is is along the main road between
yunas and Rafa so already with hundreds
of thousands of people crammed down
close to the Egyptian border it's not
really possible for people to pass more
along that route and it's going to
complicate this Aid effort even more um
with with you know Aid agencies
increasingly complaining not just that
enough Aid is there's not enough Aid
getting into the Gaza Strip but also
that it's impossible really to
effectively distribute it inside Gaza
we've also had the US approving the
emergency sale of arms to Israel will
that make a significant impact
I mean certainly this is just being seen
as as more evidence of uh the strong us
support for Israel at this stage in the
operation it's been so important with um
calls mounting internationally for a
humanitarian ceasefire uh the US had to
use its veto power to prevent a
resolution being passed at the UN
Security Council on Friday night um so
we see Israel at this stage really
pushing forwards with its operation I
think it really want
in kenun to try to find the Hamas
leaders it believes are hiding there um
it's the head of Hamas in Gaza yaka
sinir is is from that City he's not been
found in the very extensive operations
that there have been um in in Gaza City
uh further north and now that the
pressure is on the Israelis really to
try to find those Hamas leaders they
believe may be hold up now in the South
and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu coming out overnight saying
defiantly Israel will continue in our
just War to eliminate Hamas what
happened with the negotiations in terms
of trying to reinstate the truth because
we know that the the Israelis withdrew
their people didn't they but are people
still carrying on those negotiations the
qataris like what what is happening on
that front to try and and reintroduce uh
the truth because you know so many
people in Israel will be wanting to know
about what the you know the issue with
the hostages weren't
they
of course and yes the cateres the
Egyptians uh with us involvement as well
are still working behind the scenes we
understand uh trying to get another deal
that could potentially bring hostages
out but at the moment uh all the
language from Israel it's very sort of
strong rhetoric about how uh they are
pushing forward with this stage of their
offensive last night in Tel Aviv we did
see large crowds Gathering once again um
it's making it sort of more solemn for
Israelis the fact that this is is the
the Jewish Hanukah holiday uh there are
many families who have hostages still
being held inside the Gaza Strip uh for
whom you know this is this is a really
difficult time um and 137 people still
believe to be held there and there are
calls from some section of Israeli
Society for the Israeli government to do
much more to bring those people home
thanks very much your land now for us
there in Jerusalem",20231210
bZJXMnX0aKE,Gaza: US faces criticism after blocking UN call for ceasefire - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza US faces criticism after blocking UN call for ceasefire - BBC News.jpg,"the US has faced Fierce criticism for
vetoing a United Nations security
Council draft resolution that called for
an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in
the Israel Gaza War the Palestinian
president Mahmud abas has uh released a
statement this morning saying that the
veto makes the US complicit in what he
describes as war crimes against
Palestinians it says that he condemns
the American position as a flagrant
violation of all humanitarian principles
and values and he holds the US
responsible for the Bloodshed of
Palestinian children women and elderly
people in the Gaza Strip while the US
Envoy said that such a ceasefire would
be dangerous and unrealistic every other
member of the 15 member Council backed
the resolution with the exception of the
UK which abstained Israel thanked the US
and said that a ceasefire would have
given Hamas which is classed as a terror
group by many Western governments a
chance to regroup our Middle East
correspondent Hugo bashet has this
report in Gaza there's no safe place
says the UN Secretary General the Health
Care system is collapsing hospitals have
become Battlegrounds and Palestinians
have no shelter and everything else
needed to survive he says this was the
scening hunis in the South yesterday in
the aftermath of an Israeli air strike
as the military pushes ahead with its
war against
Hamas hours later at the UN in New York
the Secretary General called for a
ceasefire and had this warning there is
a high risk of the total collapse of the
humanitarian support system in Gaza
which would have devastating
consequences we anticipate that would
result in a complete breakdown of public
order and increased pressure for Mass
displacement into
Egypt I fear the consequences could be
devastating for the security of the
region but the US which is veto power
ignored his calls and voted against it
our goal should not simply be to stop
the war for today it should be to end
the war forever break the cycle of
unceasing violence and build something
stronger in Gaza and across the Middle
East so that history does not keep
repeating itself Britain abstained in
the vote every other member of the
security Council back the ceasefire we
call for further and longer pauses to
get Aid to Palestinians and allow space
for further hostage
releases but we cannot vote in favor of
a resolution which does not condemn the
atrocities Hamas committed against
innocent Israeli civilians on the 7th of
October in Gaza the situation for
civilians grows more dire by the day the
world food program is warning of
widespread famine and says nine in 10
gin are not getting enough
food our life is extremely difficult
says hassanin another displaced Gaza
resident now in Rafa there's not even
water this is what we face every day he
says as the fighting continues more
people are being killed and the
suffering of survivors is getting worse
Israel says it is taking steps to
protect C in Gaza but the world is
asking is it
enough H BBC News
Jerusalem well it's been confirmed this
morning that one of the Israeli hostages
still remaining in Gaza has been killed
um this is a picture of Saha Baruch who
was from kibuts Barry I just want to
read to you uh what his community uh
have released as a statement just in the
last few hours this morning they say
it's with great sorrow and a broken
heart that we announced the murder of
sahab Baruch 25 years old he was
kidnapped from his home on the 7th of
October by Hamas terrorists and taken to
Gaza and murdered there we share they
say in the unbearable grief of his
parents Tammy and Ronnie his brother guy
and NIV uh his family and all of his
loved ones and it also goes on to say we
will demand the return of his body as
part of any hostage release deal we
won't stop until everyone is home that's
a statement from uh kibot bear
which is the kibot where Saha Baruch 25
years old lived and has been confirmed
to have been killed in Gaza well let's
get some more reaction to that vote at
the UN Security Council last night that
we've been uh discussing throughout the
morning I spoke a little earlier to Dr
Mustafa bouti he's president of the
political party the Palestine National
initiative and I asked him about that us
veto that had been used on calls for a
ceasefire the United States of America
and Britain did not support ceasefire
means they are participating in this
crime they are covering up the terrible
crime of genocide that is happening now
in Gaza and the terrible other crime of
of of ethnic cleansing that the Israelis
are conducting against the people and a
third war crime which is collective
punishment depriving people from every
possibility of having a normal lives I
heard you the the representative of
Britain saying that she wants to condemn
the killing of Israel is fine we don't
want any Israeli or Palestinians to be
killed but why is she saying that the
killing of 32 children should be
condemned while she's not saying that
the Israeli killing of
7,500 Palestinian children should also
be condemned that is a double standard
and what happened in the Security
Council is very dangerous it sends a
very negative message to the whole world
that from now on we don't live and the
the world is not living according to
international law it's important to say
that Israel strongly refutes those
claims of genocide and ethnic cleansing
in particular um I I wanted to ask you
about specifically you touched on it
there what the US and the UK were saying
at the UN Security Council they said
that a ceasefire Now does not provide a
lasting resolution to this what is your
suggested path forward to actually make
sure that Hamas does not not provide an
ongoing threat to Israel while also
protecting Palestinian civilians in
Gaza Hamas was reacting to what Israel
was doing I'm not justifying anything
but to to think that the world history
started no no let me finish Anna let me
finish it was it was it was the these
were massacres on that day I mean you're
saying they were reacting you're saying
you're not justifying it but it is
important to say that these brutal
attacks on isra civilians and we we
should make that you should allow me to
answer you can I answer you
please can I
answer I think what is happening yeah I
am quoting Mr goes the Secretary General
of the United Nations that nobody can
doubt is a good man he said things did
not happen from a vacuum we have been
oppressed by the Israeli Israeli
occupation since 50 6
years that's Dr Mustafa bouti president
of the Palestine National initiative I
also spoke earlier on to Assaf Sharif
who's a former Consul general of Israel
in New York uh he is in Tel Aviv um and
he explained a little more about uh his
perspective on the current situation in
Gaza the problem is that we see that
even during the ceasefire and on a daily
basis that the uh trucks of food and gas
and uh uh other humanitarian Aid that
are are getting in they are not going
going to the citizens since there are no
un people in inside Gaza and the
Israelis are not controlling who gets
the food we see that the leaders of
Hamas are taking the food and all this
Aid to their people so we can bring in
as much as that's not quite correct
though is it because you you said you
just just for for for accuracy though
you said that the the UN aren't inside
Gaza but onra the UN relief and works
agency are operating inside Gaza yes and
I feel sorry for them because every day
they are get the the one that are
getting in are being robbed the trucks
are being that there's a mob running
towards this uh uh trucks of food or
humanitarian Aid and then come a truck
with the five or six or seven people of
Hamas and they're just taking everything
this is the daily basis there are a lot
of videos and you see more and more
people in Gaza are desate civilians that
we're seeing in these videos AR they I
they're definitely without a doubt
suffering and we feel I personally feel
sorry for every innocent people in Gaza
definitely but what's the solution if we
bring more Hamas will have more and then
the situation will only continue if
we'll have a ceasefire now we try that
you know this is not the first operation
since Israel evacuated from Gaza in 2006
and every two years we have two or three
years we have an operation and after two
weeks the UN said let's do a ceasefire
and it continues and you know Kamas took
costes the Israeli people but they also
took hostages uh uh some of the the
innocent citizen in Gaza offers but if
we will not put an end to the regime of
the Kamas it will just continue for two
more years so we'll have it a two weeks
stop or two years stop but it will
continue we have to get rid of this
government and make sure that the
citizens of Israel and the citizens of
Gaza will not suffer from this
Administration well let's talk to uh
Steven Erlanger who's the chief
diplomatic correspondent in Europe for
the New York Times uh thank you for
joining us here on BBC News let's talk
about the the US position first of all
because they are of course Israel's main
political and military ally but there's
been a lot of criticism about that
position that they took at the UN
Security Council last night not a
surprising one um what is your
assessment of what what the US perhaps
wants to do
next well the US would like this over
with but the US also wants a mass taken
out of power in Gaza so the US has given
Israel time but the is ticking Israel
has urged um sorry the US has urged is
Israel very strongly to let more Aid
into Gaza uh the slaughter going on
hurts Israel's reputation it hurts the
United States reputation but for Hamas
to win it only needs to survive in power
and no one really wants that to happen
to be honest not the people of Gaza I
assure you cuz I've spent a lot of time
there not the Saudis not the jordanians
not the Palestinian Authority not Israel
not America but to defeat Hamas you have
to defeat them ceasefire would simply
stop the fighting and it would it would
leave Hamas in place that's the argument
that's the American argument so Biden is
giving Israel time but the time is not
unlimited and they have urged Israel
very openly including from vice
president to be much more careful about
civilian death at casualties to use uh
less bombs and smaller bombs uh to
really bring this to a halt but they're
not going to let a ceasefire stop it in
the
middle the US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin was speaking just the day before
yesterday and talking about the gap
between Israel's stated intent to
protect civilians but the the reality of
what was happening on the ground and the
fact that he he felt the need to say
that publicly does that suggest that he
doesn't think Israel is listening to
what he's saying either publicly or
privately I think that's an issue I mean
the Americans and Israelis are talking
every day almost um about all this but
Israel has its own national interests
and at some point is going to do what it
thinks it needs to do I mean it's
listening to the United States it's
listening to Britain it's listening to
Germany but it doesn't always agree it's
the same with the with the desired end
State the Americans want a two-state
solution they want the Palestinian
Authority to somehow take over power in
Gaza BB Netanyahu says no way but for
that to happen you need a new Israeli
government you need a new Palestinian
government and you need the hostilities
to end there's a long way to go I'm
afraid and Stephen for how long do you
think that that Israel will continue to
get partic particularly us backing when
you touched on this to to continue this
military operation as the number of
Palestinian deaths and and injuries
continues to climb that that there will
surely be some sort of of cut off date
for that backing won't there well it's
flexible but I I would think it's more a
matter of two weeks I don't think it'll
be much more than that I don't think
it'll be even another
month St eringer thank you uh for
joining us from the uh New York Times",20231209

agree a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza
has failed tonight as the US opposed the
proposal the UK abstained from the vote
this was the scene in New York earlier
despite 13 Nations voting for a
ceasefire the US veto means the
resolution failed to pass earlier the UN
Secretary General warned that the people
of Gaza are at Breaking Point Israel
says any ceasefire would cement hamas's
control of Gaza Hamas is designated a
terrorist organization by many countries
including the UK meanwhile more video
has emerged showing dozens of
Palestinian men detained by Israel the
footage verified by the BBC shows them
stripped to their underwear kneeling on
the ground and being guarded by Israeli
soldiers it's understood that some of
the men have since been released we'll
speak to our correspondent at the UN
shortly but first here's our
International editor Jeremy
boen
Gaza is at Breaking Point says the UN
almost 2 million people have been driven
from their homes by Israeli
forces in dear albala the mosque was
bombed with such force that the yaffa
hospital next door was put out of action
the US warned Israel again that it was
killing too many civilians targeted or
indiscriminate attacks on civilians are
a war crime Israel said it launched 450
strikes in the last 24
[Music]
hours it sent out these pictures of its
men assaulting Hamas inside a school
near Gaza
City another video released by Hamas
shows a dead hostage and what it said
was the bloody aftermath of a failed
Israeli raid to free
him at the UN in New York York the
Secretary General requested an immediate
ceasefire telling the security Council
that herass violations of the laws of
war did not excuse
Israel's there is a high risk of the
total collapse of the humanitarian
support system in Gaza which would have
devastating
consequences we anticipate that it would
result in a complete breakdown of public
order and increased pressure for Mass
displacement into Egypt
I fear the consequences could be
devastating for the security of the
entire
region but the US rejected his warnings
and vetoed the ceasefire resolution it
is giving Israel more time to destroy
Hamas our goal should not simply be to
stop the war for today it should be to
end the war forever break the cycle of
unceasing violence and build something
stronger in Gaza and across the Middle

last couple of hours our correspondent
Neda toori is there for us nedda this
was a rare bid by the Secretary General
to get a ceasefire resolution what's
been the reaction to the US
veto that's absolutely right Rita a rare
push there for the Secretary General to
get the security Council to demand an
immediate ceasefire by invoking article
99 of the UN Charter a power granted to
secretary generals but rarely used it
hasn't been used in decades but
nevertheless what we saw here at the UN
was a quick reaction to the secretary
General's call with 97 Nations
sponsoring a draft resolution calling
for a ceasefire but the United States
cutting a lonely figure and showing its
growing isolation by being the sole
member of the council to veto and block
that resolution from being passed now
the United States has accepted Israel's
argument that a ceasefire would only
help Hamas but much of the world
disagrees in fact 13 of the 15 members
voted in favor of this resolution
the UK abstained and they very much uh
these members who voted in favor of this
resolution echoed the secretary

of the way Israel is carrying out its
military offensive in Gaza the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said
there is a gap between promises to
protect civilians and what is happening
on the ground Israel maintains that it's
taking steps to minimize harm the un's
top Aid official has said there's no
longer any meaningful humanitarian
operation in southern Gaza but officials
say there are promising signs that an
Israeli border crossing Karem Shalom
could soon be open to improve the flow
of Aid it comes as new images appear to
show dozens of Palestinian men stripped
their underwear with their hands tied
behind their back being held by Israel
Defense Forces these images are at the
beginning of Jeremy Bowen's report a
warning you may find them
disturbing video emerged this afternoon
of Palestinian men taken for inter
interrogation BBC staff recognized the
town of bet lahia in Northern Gaza and
we've geolocated the video there too
Palestinian diplomats said these were
Savage images evoking Humanity's darkest
times the Israeli Army said only that
suspects were being
interrogated posts on social media said
the men had been Sheltering with their
families at a un school and that others
were killed during the Israeli raid in
this photo the men have been moved to
another location which we have not been
able to
verify one of the captives diar alh
halut is a journalist he was forced to
leave his disabled daughter according to
the newspaper he works for in London
earlier at Israel's parliament a
prominent government supporter told me
that only Israeli forces can control
Gaza not the independent Palestine the
Americans want I think that when we talk
about uh two-state Solutions we are
solutions we are um using three words
and three lies it's not two it's not a
state and it's definitely not a solution
so what's the answer an everlasting
occupation first occupation is not the
word you cannot be you cannot one cannot
occupy his own land Israel is not an
occupier in Israel because that's the
land of Israel so what about Gaza again
that's the land of Israel land of Israel
you cannot be occupying it we're not
occupying it from anyone
in Gaza civilians are lost in the rubble
of Israeli strikes so far the world is
not close to controlling the powerful
chaotic forces Unleashed by this war the
UN Secretary General saying
International Peace and security is in
Jeopardy is demanding an immediate
ceasefire a Palestinian leader told me
that the US and UK must not veto the
next ceasefire resolution the United
States of America and Britain now has
the key if they oppose a resolution
about immediate ceasefire they will not
be complicit only with this aggression
they will be a participant in these war
crimes they have to approve the
ceasefire immediately because what is at
stake is the life of 2.3 million people
now half of them are
children without a political solution
this conflict will go on when if Israel
declares victory in Gaza
the war will not have a neat ending two
opposing forces are at work here on the
one hand pressure for ceas fire on the
other the determination of the Americans
and the British to give Israel the time
it needs to achieve its objectives and
one Western Diplomat I talked to was
thinking about perhaps another month now
the UN Secretary General wants to hurry
that process up by putting pressure on
them them and also shaming them into
taking action sooner as gaza's food cues
get longer the UN says it cannot run a
Dependable humanitarian
operation with hungry people jumping
warehouse fences Israel says World Peace
requires gaza's Liberation from Hamas
and that will take Force Jeremy bow BBC
News
Jerusalem well earlier we mentioned that
the US Secretary of State Anthony BL
issued a new warning to Israel about a
gap between intent and results to
protect civilians in Gaza here's what he
had to
say um as we stand here almost a week
into this campaign in the the south
after the end of the humanitarian pause
it is imperative it remains imperative
that Israel put a premium on civilian
protection and there does remain a gap
between exactly what what I said when I
was there the intent to protect
civilians and the the actual results
that we're seeing on the
ground well we can go live now to our
Gaza correspondent RTI Abu Alo who's
currently in G in Istanbul sorry um
rushi just bring us up to date what are
we hearing about the fighting that's
been happening overnight in
Gaza yeah the fighting is been
intensified in two different area the
first one is in the north it's jab
refugee camp it's the biggest refugee
camp in in the entire of Gaza trip out
of eight camps jabalia is the biggest
about 250,000 people used to live in the
camp many of them or hundreds of
thousands of them will lift the the area
but according to the local Authority run
by Hamas there about 100,000 people are
still in the camp most of them now they
they they live in un and government
school they are taking the UN school as
as shelter the humanitarian situation is
really very serious in the north since
none of the aid that come from Egypt
into Gaza Strip is reaching the north
because the Israeli tanks we understand
from sources there are surrounding the
the camp from the four Direction the
access in and out of the camp is
completely shut all of the hospitals
inside the camp are out of service
except very small Clinic run by the
Palestinian red Cent and we just he from
a journalist who was one of the one of
the very few remaining inside the camp
he said that for about three hours there
was very heavy bombardment around the
camp and in the camp City Center another
video he shared in social media showing
a huge destruction in the amamos and a
building in the camp City Center also he
said that the Israeli tanks are are
firing gas and
smoke pumps inside the shelters where
thousands of of Palestinians are taking
the UN school as as shelters again the
communication with the northern Gaza is
almost unvisible and very few people who
still having Israeli sin cards are able
to send some of the picture but it's
very hard to verify some of the footage
that been seen and some of the
information are getting from the the
camp but it seems that the situation is
very in in jabalia camp this morning
also about four or five air strikes in
kanun hunis is the second biggest city
in the southern part of Gaza where also
the Israeli tanks are advancing towards
theunis City from East and from North we
understand that there was some movement
for the tanks on the northern part of of
kanun and also the the humanitarian
situation is also very difficult inun
with hundreds of thousands of people are
taking hunus as as a as a shelter they
back before the seire they were told by
the Israeli Army to leave their homes in
the north and go to kanun and now the
focus of the Israeli operation isn't so
very confusing for the people they don't
know where to go some of them they they
went to the west and some of them they
are now far south in in RAF City near
the border with Egypt thank you very
much rishy abalu our correspondent our
Gaza correspondent who's now in Istanbul
thank you for joining us well we can go
live to Jerusalem and our correspondent
there yoland now yoland thank you for
joining us um let's talk about the Karem
Shalom Crossing because Israel says it's
going to open this Crossing that it has
into the Gaza Strip just how significant
would this development
be
well it's really hope that this will
streamline uh the movement of aid from
Egypt into Gaza um where of course
people now are desperately short on on
basic supplies and what we've seen since
the breakdown of that truce one week ago
is really the number of lores dropping
from about 200 Lor loads of Aid going
into Gaza each day down to fewer than
100 and so the UN Egypt others have been
calling really for weeks uh for Israel
to open its Kem Shalom Crossing at least
for the screening um of goods to take
place the security checks which Israel
demands uh the Kem Shalom Crossing is
where prior to the war in Gaza most of
the supplies that went into the Gaza
Strip each day hundreds of lur loads of
supplies were going in and so it is
really customized for those inspections
to take place so we understand this
development is due to take effect uh
within days and it's something that
Washington has really uh been demanding
uh has been negotiating for for
weeks thank you very much that's our

have surrendered or if they have been
taken by the military Israel has not
said who the men are but it has
confirmed that its forces are making
arrests in Gaza the new images come as
tens of thousands of Palestinians are
streaming into Rafa City near the Gaza

trying to escape intense fighting
elsewhere the head of humanitarian
Affairs for the United Nations says
there is no longer any humanitarian
operation worthy of that name in the
south of Gaza from Jerusalem here our
International editor Jeremy Bowen a
warning you may find some of his images
upsetting video emerged this afternoon
of Palestinian men taken for
interrogation BBC staff recognized the
town of beia in Northern Gaza and we've
geolocated the video there too
Palestinian diplomats said these were
Savage images evoking Humanity's darkest
times the Israeli Army said only that
suspects were being
interrogated posts on social media said
the men had been Sheltering with their
families at a un school and that others
were killed during the Israeli raid in
this photo the men have been moved to
another location which we have not been
able to
verify one of the captives diar alh
halut is a journalist he was forced to
leave his disabled daughter according to
the newspaper he works for in London
earlier at Israel's parliament a
prominent government supporter told me
that only Israeli forces can control
Gaza not the independent Palestine the
Americans want I think that when we talk
about uh two-state Solutions we are
solution we are um using three words and
three lies it's not two it's not a state
and it's definitely not a solution so
what's the answer an everlasting
occupation first occupation is not the
word you cannot be you cannot one cannot
occupy its own land Israel is not an
occupier in Israel because that's the
land of Israel so what about Gaza again
that's the land of Israel land of Israel
you cannot be occupying it we're not
occupying it from anyone in Gaza
civilans are lost in the rubble of
Israeli strikes so far the world is not
close to controlling the powerful
chaotic forces Unleashed by this war the
UN Secretary General saying
International Peace and security is in
Jeopardy is demanding an immediate
ceasefire a Palestinian leader told me
that the US and UK must not veto the
next ceasefire resolution the United
States of America and Britain now has
the key if they oppose resolution about
immediate ceasefire they will not be
complicit only with this AG aggression
they will be a participant in these war
crimes they have to approve the
ceasefire immediately because what is at
stake is the life of 2.3 million people
now half of them are

this conflict will go on when if Israel
declares victory in Gaza the war will
not have a neat ending two opposing

and pressure forceas fire on the other
the determination of the Americans and
the British to give Israel the time it
needs to achieve its objectives and one
Western Diplomat I talked to was
thinking about perhaps another month now
the UN Secretary General wants to hurry
that process up by putting pressure on

Nova music festival in Israel are facing
significant mental health challenges two
months after the deadly Hamas attacks on
October the 7th more than 360 partygoers
were murdered there and another 40 were
taken hostage there's concern that the
scale of psychological support needed is
greater than the state can provide so
now trained volunteers are setting up
their own centers to offer that help
well our correspondent Anna Foster has
visited one region in the north of Tel
Aviv Their Eyes Were Hollow they they
didn't look alive they couldn't look at
us they could they would shake they
couldn't eat they couldn't drink the
evil that these people met is
incomprehensible and and I told them
early on as as dark the darkness you saw
we're going to bring the light we're
going to help you believe in yourselves
and in others again let me show you
exactly
what people come here for because
there's a whole section you can see on
these bean bags people they come out and
sometimes they talk or they can use it
as a quiet space if they want to there
are different workshops that people do
again they don't always need to be
talking about what happened to them that
day or what they feel sometimes it's
just a a way to focus on something to to
keep your hands busy or to keep your
brain busy and it's a place where people
can talk they can get therapy sessions
they can really
have an opportunity in this space
surrounded by people who went through
the same thing as them to to work
through some of the trauma of that day
I'm leor galb um I'm 24 from beta and uh
I survived the massacre that happened at
the an NOA
Festival um at
6:30 uh in the morning we started
hearing Rockets uh flying above our
heads started running towards the open
field
U we didn't know where we're going we
didn't know what's happening we just
heard automatic gunshots uh all around
us um and then we managed to uh get
inside Yuda and galit's car they had a
big car and they were also running away
from the massacre uh and they basically
saved us they got us to safety and
that's what happened to me and that's a
lot for anybody to go through and and so
you come here here and how does being
here help you process all of that it's
been a hard time for me listening to
music since the Nova festival and since
like it it's almost have been two months
uh and I only feel comfortable hearing
music with the concerts um and with the
the artists that come here and um I
really feel that the therapists are here
to help and to listen and to be here
with us itamar Cohen is a clinical
psychologist he lives in London but flew
here as soon as he could to help what
kind of stories are people telling you
about what they they saw and they lived
through that
day
um people
here
seen tremendous amount of
pain um some of them were extremely
close to not being here um really people
that been
chased that needed to run
through you know if you would say a
mindfield they didn't know where it
comes from and what about you how are
you because obviously these stories that
that you're hearing and I know this is
your job but they are really distressing
stories here all the therapists are
working together we have time to see
process to speak about the challenges to
bring ourself in our vulnerabilities our
fears so we have a space to to work that
through and and to strengthen each other
and that's that's quite a lot in these
times so it helps you as well oh

from Israel and Gaza the UN Secretary
General Antonio guz has warned countries
on the security Council that public
order in Gaza is likely to completely
break down because of Israeli
bombardment and the lack of essential
supplies Israel's foreign minister has
sharply criticized Mr ceras saying his
tenure is a danger to World Peace well
in the last 24 hours Israel has carried
out more heavy aerial bombardment across
Gaza in its fight against Hamas and the
fighting on the ground has intensified
in the South particularly around KH
yunice Israeli officials say the IDF has
surrounded the home of hamas's Chief
Yara Sina well let's cross live now to
Jerusalem and our correspondent yoland n
and yolan good to have you on this
morning Antonio Gua is there saying
there could be a collapse of public
audit Israel's foreign minister however
sharply criticizing that what is the
situation like on the ground and How
likely would you say is this
collapse well I mean certainly if we
look at the fighting that's been going
on first of all um the pictures this
morning you could see smoke was still
rising up uh from the north of the Gaza
Strip uh but according to one of the
Israel main Israeli newspapers here the
Israeli military is now considered that
it's got operational control of these
two areas um jabalia in the north and
Shia in the east of Gaza City which were
considered to Hamas strongholds they
have been the scene of most fighting in
the north uh the real attention has gone
to KH yunes the biggest city in the
south of the Gaza Strip that's where
we've had these very Fierce battles
going on we understand between Israeli
forces and Hamas fighters who are hold
up there um and Israeli forces saying
they're now encircling the house of
Yahya Sina the Hamas leader in Gaza I
mean that is mostly symbolically
significant um really because he and
other Hamas leaders who are thought
maybe to be in kenun I really thought to
be in underground tunnels hidden well
out of the way but we had Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming out
uh saying that this really showed a
determination it's only a matter of time
before we get him Mr Netanyahu said and
your land just while you're speaking
there viewers have been just seeing the
devastation in carun and young children
walking around looking injured a lot of
the focus today on the humanitarian
situation is Aid getting to those areas
where that fighting is
intensifying I mean that's a big
complaint o of the UN and we had the
un's aid Chief Martin Griffith coming
out saying that the situation in Gaza is
now apocalyptic and he was really
complaining that because people have
been crammed down they've been told to
evacuate even from Kanan unes of course
people originally told to move from the
north to the South for their safety now
people have fled into a small Corner um
in the very south of the Gaza Strip next
to the border with Egypt uh people are
living on the street sleeping rough
there aren't enough shelters to go
around and it's very difficult to um
both get AIDS delivered to them there um
but also Aid delivered them to other
parts of the Gaza Strip because of the
ongoing fighting because of road
closures as well um and so uh actually
Martin Griff is saying meaningful
humanitarian efforts and now virtually
impossible and youan just briefly before
we go um when it comes to Food Supplies
medical supplies as well there's been a
huge focus on the hospitals out there
trying to treat the wounded are we
hearing anything about how people are
managing to
survive I mean when I've spoken to
colleagues in the past day uh they've
told me about how they're surviving just
on uh pieces of bread how they're trying
to find little scraps of wood so that
they can light fires to try to heat some
food for their children even if it's
just po it it's a really miserable
situation and extremely difficult um and
I I think this is going to be the main
focus now in the coming days a lot of
international attention centered on this
absolutely yes and we'll be following
that very closely yoland Nell in

it described as aggressive actions
against Hamas and other armed groups in

can see that very young patients are
being treated on the floors ambulances
and private cars are also being used to
bring wounded people to the medical

has recently returned from Gaza he told
us what He himself had
witnessed hospitals is absolute War

floor children with multiple wounds the
burns Gareth you see on a little boy or
girl but the burns come with shrapnel uh
and then of course those people who who
are not um who have not not in hospitals
are are fleeing they're in panic you
know every time you turn a corner
there's a new suburb that has 5,000
people who' made a makeshift home they
they simply don't know where to go

territory along with Gaza which has been
occupied by Israel religious Jews
believe the land was given to them by
God and leaders of the settlers say they
are protecting themselves from the West
Bank our International editor Jeremy
Bowen sent this
report where the Judean desert tumbles
Down To The River Jordan lies a tiny
community of Palestinian bins it's
called Arab ilat and it looks
Timeless but the shock waves of the war
in Gaza have reached here changing lives
and threatening
them the village really just a family
compound lies a few minutes from an
illegal Outpost of Jewish settlers who
came calling a few nights
ago mesar 23-year-old son of one of
eight brothers here videoed what
happened the settlers accused them
falsely the family said off stealing
their goats one wearing a police jacket
loaded his assault rifle they thought
they were about to
die he was shooting at my Uncle so I ran
down there and confronted him we were
pushing each other and screaming head
to-head and I was filming him then
around 20 settlers
came now they said they had to trust God
as Israel's police and army protect the
settlers this time no one was killed
they know they'll be a next time before
Gaza two or three settlers with pistols
might steal sheep now it was more than
20 with assault rifles the settlers want
to force them out and this family
believes the Israeli government has
given them the weapons to do
it in three days of traveling through
the occupied West Bank Palestinians have
said consistently that since the war in
Gaza Jewish settlers are better armed
and much more
aggressive at susia South of Hebron
Soldiers checked us out one told an
Israeli colleague that he was a traitor
for visiting Palestinians they filmed us
but took much less interest in what had
happened a few miles down the
road the village of kbid Zuta had been
bulldozed activists said last night
Zan's 200 Palestinians left four weeks
ago after a barage of threats from armed
Jewish settlers the school was destroyed
Britain helped fund it the project was
called supporting Palestinians at risk
of forcible
transfer activists said settlers did it
to make sure the Palestinians would
never come
back someone drew Jewish stars of
David a settler leader cancelled an
interview the police said they were
waiting for a complaint in fact Zena's
Palestinians have petitioned Israel's
Supreme
Court we went to the village with a
former Israeli Special Forces soldier
who now campaigns against the occupation
they are demolishing Palestinian
Villages beating up Palestinian Farmers
stealing their all
they're trying to open a third front and
East Front against the Palestinians why
Palestinian West Bank why because they
want this without any Palestinian they
want the land without
Palestinians Palestinians see all this
and the rest of the settler violence on
the West Bank as
confirmation of their worst fears that
there are powerful elements inside
Israel in the government as well as the
settler movement who want them out and
who are are using the enormous crisis
surrounding the Gaza War as an
opportunity to further their
agenda south of heon Palestinian farmers
are plowing with the donkey because
local Jewish settlers have threatened to
steal or break their tractor if they use
it Arabs and Jews started fighting over
every grain of soil in a land both sides
believe should be theirs more than a
century ago here it's still comes down
to that in every Rocky
field and we can speak to Jeremy who's
in Jerusalem now at Jeremy in Gaza
itself more heavy bombing by Israel what
sort of reaction has there
been well I think um more fear and more
movement from Palestinians trying to get
away from all of that the Israelis are
saying that they're warning Palestinians
about what they're going to do giving
them a chance to get away way the UN is
very skeptical about whether the scheme
the Israelis are using is actually going
to work whether it's feasible at all the
Israelis appear to be trying to cut off
the city of hunis from the rest of the
Gaza Strip as the focus of the next
phase of their military operation a lot
of the Hamas leaders come from there and
they're hoping they might be able to get
closer to killing them if they can
really go in and clean the place out
however the Americans have said to them
again in the last few days that they
must not kill as many Palestinian
civilians as they have and have even
warned they might suffer a a strategic
defeat even if they get a tactical
Victory if that's what they do you know
I think at the moment uh depressingly
there is now this awful Rhythm daily
rhythm of War of the strikes of the
deaths of the UN saying it's struggling
to get the humanitarian Aid in that
people need and what we have to conclude
is that this is going to go on I think
for weeks months into next year",20231204

here and now we have to go back and get
my Sasha the rally was interrupted by
blaring Sirens warning of the risk of
incoming Rockets prime minister
Netanyahu spoke for the first time since
the end of the
ceasefire he insisted military pressure
was the only way to free the
captives we will continue the war until
we achieve all its goals and it's
impossible to achieve those goals
without the ground
operation from Israel's main Ally the
United States a clear message he cannot
repeat in the South what he did in the
north I have repeatedly made clear to
Israel's leaders that protecting
Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a
moral
responsibility and a strategic
imperative talks between Israel and
Hamas have collapsed the families of the
hostages hope for them to come home in
Gaza people hope their guns will once
again again fall
silent well earlier Mark regev who is
the senior adviser to the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the
BBC about what will happen to Gaza once
the Israeli government has eliminated
Hamas so it'll be in a better bit
situation because Hamas has been
controlling Gaza for 16 years and not
only that has has that been terrible and
horrific for the people of Israel but
that has been very sad for the people of
Gaza because what have has Kamas bought
the Gaza STP what have they bought the
Palestinians in Gaza over the last 16
years poverty Bloodshed misery surely
the people of Gaza deserve better than
this extremist uh regime Terror regime
that that doesn't give a hoot about the
wellbeing of the people of Gaza and is
happy to sacrifice the very last Gaza
and as long as they can advance their
very very extreme crazy
agenda well our Middle East
correspondent Hugo Basher is with me
here in Jerusalem and that is a really
important part of this whole story isn't
it Hugo what happens if and when Israel
managed to remove Hamas from Gaza what
happens the day after that oh exactly
and uh there have been discussions about
the Palestinian Authority which controls
uh the West Bank which is the other uh
Palestinian territory taking control of
the situation in Gaza so it is obviously
you know something that has been
discussed not only in Israel but also uh
by uh Israel's Partners uh The Americans
in in particular but I think now the
main concern is about what is happening
in Gaza right now as this Israeli
offensive continues we've been talking
about the humanitarian situation uh in
Gaza and how the situation has been
desperate for the population there
because there have been widespread
shortages of basic supplies humanitarian
agid the the agid that is being
delivered right now uh the UN Aid
agencies have been saying that it is
simply not enough to meet gaza's needs
and we've seen pictures of hospitals now
uh completely overwhelmed by the high
number of casualties following these
recent attacks having to operate with
very limited resources so yes there is a
lot of discussion about what is going to
happen after and if Hamas is removed
from power in Gaza but the situation
right now is very concerning let's talk
a little bit more about that Israeli
military operation because we've seen
twice now in the last few days both
Lloyd Austin the US defense secretary
and Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of
State who was here a few days ago saying
publicly that Israel needed to act
according to International humanitarian
law if they're saying these things in
public like that does it suggest that
they think that Israel is not listening
to what they're telling them behind the
scenes yeah I think it's very very
interesting to see there has been a
change uh in the tone from the
statements coming from senior American
officials uh the US uh defense secretary
uh said uh yesterday that it was a moral
responsibility to protect the civilian
population of Gaza essentially
suggesting that uh the ferocity of of
the attacks in Gaza could drive people
to support Hamas uh essentially saying
that it could be driving your you know
the population into your enemy's arms I
think those were his words and the US
vice president also saying that uh you
know Israel has the right to defend
itself but too many Palestinians have
already been killed in Gaza so again I
think the message has been very clear
here that Israel uh needs to do more to
protect the Palestinian population the
civilian population of Gaza as he goes
ahead with this offensive and that we uh
Israel should not repeat uh in the South
what he did in the north so uh Northern
Gaza was the main focus of the initial
phase of the Israeli offensive and we're
see now that um you know most of the
attacks or many of the attacks have been
focused in southern areas of the Gaza
Strip especially hunis which is a major
uh city in in the South hundreds of
thousands of of people have been
Sheltering in hunis after fleeing uh
Northern Gaza and this is where uh
members of the Hamas leadership are
believed to be hiding so it is a very
desperate situation for the population
there",20231203

their feet and dogs to assault them
Israel said he wasn't aware of those
claims and that Palestinians are legally
detained Israel was the target of the
Hamas attacks but the pain is also being
felt by
Palestinians and we can speak to Hugo
now from Jerusalem Hugo very good
morning to you uh this is a very
significant day isn't it because the
temporary ceasefire has finished it is
over what is happening on the
ground good morning Charlie so it is a
little bit after 8:00 in the morning
here and the Israeli military has
announced that it has resumed its uh
offensive against Hamas in Gaza and it
has accused Hamas of violating the terms
of that temporary ceasefire and shortly
before uh the pausing hostilities was
set to expire uh the Israeli military
said it had intercepted a rocket that
was launched from Gaza now reports uh
from the Hamas run interior Ministry
suggest that there have been multiple
areas of Gaza hit by Israeli air strikes
and uh the Israeli Army has confirmed
that Israeli fighter jets are now uh
striking targets across uh the territory
now uh we heard from a Palestinian
Source close to the negotiations that
talks continue for an extension uh of
this Cho even though fighting has
resumed in Gaza now obviously this deal
has uh led to the uh release of more
than a 100 hostages who have been held
in Gaza but more than 140 people remain
in captivity in Gaza so obviously the
Rel relatives and Friends of of those
hostages are following these
developments very closely and also there
are fears now that the humanitarian
situation in in Gaza could worsen um
amid shortages of basic supplies for
days we've been talking about uh the
humanitarian crisis there for the

military is said a temporary pause in
the fighting in Gaza will be extended
for a 7th day as International mediators
try to negotiate the release of more
hostages the truce was due to end an
hour ago at 7:00 local time however on
Wednesday the sixth day of the deal 16
hostages were freed from captivity in
Gaza they included two Russians 10
Israeli citizens and four Tha hos
who were all handed over to the Red
Cross their release was delayed by what
Hamas called logistical issues on
Wednesday 30 Palestinian women and
teenage boys were freed from Israeli
prisons in exchange for the
hostages this as US Secretary of State
Anthony blinken touched down in Tel Aviv
for more talks aimed at extending the
temperat trce and increasing
humanitarian Aid into Gaza here our
middle EAS correspondent Hugo
Bea the ceasefire in Gaza continues
Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend a
temporary pausing hostilities the news
came just minutes before the deal was
set to expire this morning last night 16
more hostages were freed by Hamas
including 13-year-old Gali and Amit 16
in return 30 Palestinians were released
from Israeli jails
but the latest swap was overshadowed by
a claim by Hamas that the youngest
hostage 10-month-old baby CFI his
brother Ariel and mother Shiri had been
killed by an Israeli air strike in Gaza
Israel says It's a cruel claim and that
it's investigating their father yarden
is still
missing Israel's war cabinet gathered
late last night US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin are arrived in t Aviv
for the third time since the war started
to discuss an extension to the truth and
more Aid to Gaza in the occupied West
Bank violence continued an 8-year-old
boy and a teenager aged 14 was shot dead
as the Israeli Army withdrew from a
military operation in janin refugee camp
the Army said it used missiles grenades
and explosives killing a senior
Commander for Islamic
Jihad in Gaza the humanitarian crisis
continues the UN says more aid needs to
get in and that disease is a real threat
the ceasefire continues for another day
but Palestinians wonder how long it will
last Hugo Bea reporting there he's in
Jerusalem for us I'll be speaking to him
shortly but first let's go live to
Southern Gaza to talk to Thomas White
who's director of uh
unrwa affair Affairs which for those who
are unaware is the United Nations relief
and works Agency for Palestinian
refugees thank you for being on the
program so I presume uh you were
relieved to hear today that we have
another another pause another 24 hours
in the pause of
hostilities well it's certainly uh good
news for the people of Gaza um it's
another day where there's a rest bite
from the fighting that's taken too many
lives uh and destroyed too many homes of
people here in Gaza so certainly
uh people are pleased that they have
another day of relative quiet here in
Gaza just talk us through the logistics
for you as an organization of course
you're appealing for donations for help
for the the huge need we're seeing on
our screens on a day-to-day basis you're
in Rafa based in Rafa what are the
challenges you're
facing well essentially unua and other
un agencies uh and humanitarian
organizations have been overwhelmed uh
by the sheer um scale of displacement
into Southern Gaza uh the infrastructure
the water infrastructure for example is
totally overwhelmed with the number of
people who are now in the South uh
there's just not enough places for
people to shelter uh in the unua schools
which have been set up as temporary
shelters for people we had plans that
they would accommodate about 1500 people
per shelter uh we're averaging over6
th000 people in our shelters in the
South uh as you can imagine uh the
ability of those uh buildings and our
staff to serve those people uh is just
very very difficult to give you an
example uh we're averaging um 125 people
using one toilet so basic things like
sanitation uh in these shelters are is
very difficult uh people are jammed into
very congested uh classrooms uh in the
evenings
and the reality is now where at one of
our schools uh We've now had an outbreak
of hepatitis A so we the the risk of
disease uh is very present uh in uh in
Gaza at the present time in terms of the
humanitarian Aid that's been able to
come into Gaza since uh the truce began
what difference has that
made there's been a moderate increase uh
of Aid into Gaza through the Rafa
Crossing um the pause has also enabled
us to get much needed humanitarian Aid
to communities who are still in the
north uh but the reality is it's not
even close to what we need and just to
give you an example I was at one of our
shelters in Han unus uh yesterday uh
people are are living off you know one
or two rounds of Arabic bread every day
and on every second or third day there
will be a food distribution which the
reality is it's you know for a family
it's a can of tuna or a can of cheese
and that's all that's coming in so you
know food insecurity um is a big problem
in the South not enough Aid is coming in
to support uh the overwhelming number of
people who are now uh seeking shelter in
Gaz in the south of Gaza okay for now
thank you Thomas White their director of
unrwa Affairs joining us live from Gaza
well let's go to Jerusalem now and speak
to our correspondent Hugo uh Bea so Hugo
uh we start a new day and once again the
truce continues which is uh the good
news for everybody waking up where you
are today and also in Gaza but the
question is what will happen today once
again a tense day ahead in terms of
Hostage uh prisoner
exchange exactly Sally and the news of
this uh extension was uh announced just
minutes uh before uh the ceasefire was
set to expire so I think it shows how
how difficult how complicated these
negotiations have been so the Israeli
Army says that this extension has been
agreed because of the efforts to secure
the release of more hostages being held
in Gaza 145 people are still in
captivity in Gaza 55 days after they
were abducted in Israel so uh
negotiations continue the US Secretary
of State Anthony blinkin is in Tel Aviv
uh he is going to have meetings and
talks uh about how to extend uh this
truths uh further and also about how to
guarantee the delivery of more Aid much
needed Aid to Gaza as a humanitarian
crisis in the territory continues and
the Israeli authorities uh have been
saying that the war against Hamas is not
over that they will resume uh the
Israeli offensive against Hamas once
this attempt temporary of pausing
hostilities is over but I think again
this shows how difficult these
negotiations have been and I think the
next phase of these talks is going to be
even more difficult because it is likely
to inv involve the first group of
Israeli military personnel who have been
abducted by Hamas so again the ceasefire
has been extended for another day but it
shows how complex the situation is yeah
and also the the the location of
hostages that are still held makes it
more complex as well Hamas talking about
logistical problems that they are facing
in terms of trying to meet the deadlines
for exchange uh it it'll be interesting
to see how today develops and those
families who are desperately waiting in
Israel for
news exactly so again 145 people are
still in captivity in Gaza and Hamas has
been saying that it is not holding all
of them and that they are having
difficulties in Loc ating uh those
hostages in identifying them so this
could be another obstacle uh before they
are released but again I think this uh
announcement today that the ceasefire
has been extended for another day is
going to be celebrated by the families
of those hostages the relatives of those
hostages waiting to see their loved ones
back yesterday we saw another group of
hostages being released 16 captives were
freed uh and returned to Israel and
again was saw uh uh 30 Palestinian
prisoners uh women and teenagers being
released from Israeli jails I think the
Israelis were expecting this kind of
mechanism uh to continue uh three
Palestinians being freed for every
Israeli hostage returned uh but again uh
it will be interesting uh to see how
these negotiations are going to un
unfold now that we it seems that we are
entering a much more difficult phase in
these negotiations okay Hugo for thank
you Hugo Bea in Jerusalem for us",20231130

to his head they tried and failed to
save Basel two bullet wounds in his
chest he's perfect in the school he's a
good boy he's kind I don't know he's

afternoon as Israel's Army withdrew from

camp the Army said it used missiles
grenades and explosives lives here
killing a senior Commander for Islamic
Jihad and arresting 17 other
people before 7th October they would
destroy everything inside the homes but
now they're tearing the whole house down
it's because they lost in Gaza so
they're retaliating against us this is
all about their failure in
Gaza I can see the destruction left by
the Israeli operation
here this is something people in the
camper used to but today it's the human
damage that people are really focused on
Israel said it used live fire to shoot
suspects hurling explosive devices at
them in Janine the UN says more than 50

noise from action a thank you very much
for joining us here on the BBC you've
been in touch with your teams in Gaza if
we can begin by finding out a little bit
more about what they're telling you
about the situation on the
ground thank you reie obviously a few
days now into a course there's a there's
a yeah there's a sense of improvement
just in terms of the the access for our
for our colleagues and for humanitarian
workers and and crucially for supplies
coming in through the Raffa Crossing
although they're still far below meeting
the levels of need that said you know
with the needs as high as they are and
particularly with the situation that
very little of that Aid is reaching the
north we continue to hear from our
colleagues about their concern for what
can be achieved and and for the needs
we're continuing to hear from our
colleagues that the hospitals that we
work with are still lacking fuel meaning
they can't run generators which is
impacting on their their basic abil to
Pro provide you know basic Medical
Services we're continuing to hear
concerns about the state of the water
system and the ab again the lack of fuel
to provide to to get pumps running and
that also many people of course around
Gaza particularly those who fled from
the north to the South are exposed and
living in very poor conditions and
lacking basic shelter I heard from a
colleague today talking about uh uh
seven families sharing one blanket for
the the for the night you know the the
levels of of need uh the the lack of
humanitarian Aid is is still quite
crucial no matter how hard we and one of
the uh concerns is Aid getting into the
north we've been talking to other Aid
agencies in the last few days who say
that has been one of the biggest
challenges and one of the greatest needs
in indeed the hospitals we work with up
in in the north I I didn't hear from
them today but as of yesterday they not
received any any fuel at all and and so
yeah yeah it for for them yes the
bombardment is has has stopped but the
pores has really not resulted in in much
Aid getting through to them them mle up
in the north and of course as well as
the hospitals there are still you a
large number of people living in the
north we're doing what we can in terms
of getting people whether it's in the
North or the South uh cash uh through
through our action A Partners on the
ground but obviously cash can only go so
far when there's not much to buy in the
shop and just very briefly Mike uh the
who talking about the danger of
infectious diseases because sanitation
conditions are obviously very poor as
well now yeah indeed this is this is
what we are hearing again from our
colleagues uh in the camps the number of
people using you know one or or two
latrines you know I think I heard
something like 700 people using two
latrines recently in one of the shelters
down the South so the risk of waterborne
or diarrhea diseases is incredibly high
and as I say sort of aggravated by the
fact that people are living in very poor
conditions in terms of shelter and the
cold I this is you know the challenge
for us very much at the moment is the
pause is helping it is getting things
through but when the pause is extended
on a day-by-day basis it's very hard for
us to scale up and plan properly okay
Mike noise from action a thank you very
much for bringing us up to date on the

part of the continued truce with Hamas
designated as a terrorist group in the

East correspondent Hugo
Bea the flight back to Freedom 11
hostages returned to Israel last night
after more than 50 days in Hamas capital
ity they included the three-year-old
twins Emma and Uli they were captured
with other relatives when Hamas set fire
to their home they were freed with their
mother shut on but their father is
believed to remain in Gaza also released
were brother and sister Ares and Sahar
Calderon their relatives spoke about his
relief as he waited to see them again
I'm finding that it's difficult to go
from a state of endless anxiety about
their fate to to a state of relief and
joy I believe it will take time this is
an exciting and heart feeling moment but
we also understand that is the beginning
of a difficult Rehabilitation process
for S and Aras who are still young and
have been through an unbearable
experience the choose between Israel and
Hamas allow the return of dozens of
hostages but dozens more are still in
captivity over 150 of our hostages men
women children babies who's taking care
of them who is holding a 10 months old
baby kir bivas I'll tell you ruthless
terrorists are holding him hostage in

likely to bring even more suffering for
Palestinians in Gaza Hugo basa BBC News
Jerusalem wel you speak life to Hugo now
on breakfast and Hugo so a two-day
extension to this truth now but what
else has to happen for that to be
extended
further yeah John that's a very good
question and I think the Biden
Administration that has been heavily
involved in these negotiations uh they
uh want this deal to be extended again
because they say that they want to see
everybody released we're talking about
170 hostages around 170 people who
remain in captivity in Gaza and I think
Hamas is saying that they're not holding
all those people so this could be uh an
obstacle in in guaranteeing the release
of all these captives and the youngest
hostage is a 10mon old baby so uh today
uh we're expecting to see 10 hostages
being released uh overnight the office
of the Israeli Prime Minister confirmed
that they had received a list uh with
the names of those people expected to be
released later today and for every
Israeli hostage freed three pois are
going to be released from Israeli jails
now obviously the extension of this
truth means that more Aid is getting
into Gaza uh the UN Chief Antonio garish

enough okay for now Hugo thank you very

launched its attack in what's been
described as Israel's largest
intelligence failure for 50 years but
analysis for the BBC reveals that Hamas
held multiple training exercises
planning the attacks in plain sight of
Israel over three years and posted the
evidence on social media so how did the
Israeli government miss it here's our
defense correspondent Jonathan
Beal BBC Arabic and BBC verify have been
analyzing evidence posted on the online
messaging service
telegram it shows that Hamas and Gaza
had been openly training for attacks
inside Israel for almost three years
these red dots show the sites from the
far north of the Gaza Strip to the very
south where training took place with
Hamas joined by other Palestinian
factions we've geolocated most of the
images of those training operations with
the four larger Dots here representing
major drills
which took place every year since 2020
each was codenamed strong pillar let's
look more closely at one training camp
less than a kilometer from the eras
Crossing with Israel this image posted
in December
2022 shows a mock Israeli town or
Village complete with a mock tank the
video shows Fighters practicing an
assault it appeared on the Hamas to
telegram Channel as well as one
belonging to a so-called joint operation
room with other Palestinian factions in
fact a propaganda videos which were
publicly accessible were posted to both
channels in another location on the 12th
of September less than a month before
the assault gunmen are practicing going
room to room shooting in what looks like
homes here in an exercise in 2021 the
gate was even painted yellow just like
the kutes that were attacked and in
December last year they were practicing
taking hostages as happened on October
the 7th we've also identified some of
the groups involved in the training
drills as well as Hass 10 different
factions were involved including
Palestinian Islamic Jihad and some
smaller groups six groups in total went
on to publish videos of their Fighters
participating in the October the 7th
Hamas LED assault and Hamas had given
warnings about plans to attack inside
Israel this was a press conference by
Iman noal a senior commander in the
military wing of hassia boasting in 2021
that Israel's border defenses wouldn't
protect it the videos posted of the
September drill code named strong pillar
4 even made the news and a discussion
program on Israel KH 11 television
station the presenter here announcing
that Hamas had simulated an attack on
Israel so with all of this happening in
plain sight how was it that Israeli
soldiers on the ground were taken by
surprise there's clear evidence for a
strategic intelligence failure you have
the data in front of you but you're not
doing anything with it you are feeling
safe behind a fence where you spent
billions of dollars on it you think the
technology that you've invested into
will keep you safe
we asked Israel's Defense Forces for
their response they said the IDF is
currently focused on eliminating the
threat from the terrorist organization
Hamas questions of this kind will be
looked into at a later stage they are
though questions that will haunt Israel
for years to come could the attack have
been anticipated potentially saving 1200
Israeli lives and a war now which is
already according to gaza's health
authority killed more than 14,000

has agreed it says with katar and Egypt
it doesn't obviously mention Israel it
says it has agreed with katar and Egypt
to extend the temporary humanitarian
truce for an additional 2 days under the
same conditions that were reached before
and as we were discussing you know katar
are very much the people who were
driving this you can see there that
tweet uh on X on your screen just now
the state of katar announces as part of
the ongoing mediation an agreement has
been reached to extend the humanitarian
truce for an additional two days in the
Gaza Strip This is Majed alansari who's
the official spokesperson for the qari
ministry of Foreign Affairs um as we
were saying Matthew we were discussing
this this just in the last 10 minutes or
so weren't we saying that you know it is
very much something that we we expected
because the momentum the the mood music
the messaging that was coming out from
parties like Egypt who also sit around
the table was strongly that the parties
were in favor of this happening we
reflected that that from the beginning
of this deal being put in place there
were Provisions that enabled it to
continue for a little bit longer there
was a longer a list of Palestinian
prisoners uh who would be eligible for
release um that was published then was
needed 150 names would have covered
those four days but they published the
names of 300 Israel had said that they
would be prepared to extend the
ceasefire for an extra 24 hours for
every additional 10 hostages who were
released now interestingly Matthew for
the first four days of this deal we saw
uh 13 hostages a day um what Israel had
offered for the extension was 10 a day
but it seems to they're talking about
the same conditions as previously so
that means we would expect to see over
those additional two days 13 Israeli
hostages freed each day in return for 39
Palestinian prisoners being held in
Israeli jails they do it on a 3:1 ratio
but we do now have that confirmation
from the qataris that that has been
agreed and that that ceasefire which
would have ended at the end of today at
the end of day four will now continue
for two further days making this a six
day day agreement in total Anna it is uh
well the weather is much poorer today
and there are fewer people in the Square
but I know you've been talking to
hostage families throughout the last
four days give me a sense of uh where
many of those people are because for
many they will have seen those scenes of
reunions be uplifted by that pleased for
those families but of course so many of
the families still awaiting the return
of their loved ones not on any so
far that's right and actually Matthew
that's that's a really pertinent
question because one thing that has been
common of all of the hostage families
that I've spoken to and and particularly
hostage families who knew that they have
male relatives who are waiting to be
released who were never going to be part
of this deal because this deal was only
ever going to involve women and children
and when you speak to th those people
who are waiting for male relatives they
were you know they were were really
pleased about the deal because they said
look any release in it opens the door to
something further if we can achieve
successful releases of hostages then
even though we know that our loved ones
are not part of this deal it shows that
it can be done it proves that there is
ground that can be worked on that
there's a foundation there for this to
be extended and I think this this
further two days of this deal um shows
that that you know they they were right
to have to have that level of Faith now
we're still looking at at a a relatively
small number um you know there was
originally around 240 hostages that were
being held of a a variety of different
nationalities so what this doesn't do is
is you know is is fully release all of
those hostages but but the family's
opinion is is a really important one and
and you're right to focus on that
Matthew because they've also become a
very close-knit group as well and in
fact the the joy and happiness that you
see from some of those families even
when the relatives that are being
released are not theirs because they've
met each other they've they've held
vigils together they've held protests
together they they've you know met these
new people become very close to them and
they feel that joy as well for their new
friends that they have have seen their
relatives released but I think for every
step along the way for every release it
offers a bit of Hope and and hostage
families will be feeling more of that
again tonight Anna Foster once again
there in Tel Aviv thanks very much we'll
be back to you in a short while",20231127

be driving some users towards
increasingly divisive posts about Israel
and Gaza that can shape public opinion
I've been told some MPS are receiving a
huge influx of messages including from
young people others are worried about
hate online let's start with Tik Tok
videos here from Israeli soldiers these
kinds of videos seem a bit more polished
trying to play into viral Trends
meanwhile videos from bloggers in Gaza
and pro Palestinian users at home seem
to trigger a more positive reaction from
Young users Tik toks using the hasht
iand with isra Israel have racked up
more than 240 million views over all
compared with more than 870 million
views for videos using the hash IAM with
pal
similar to other video based sites with
younger users one Israeli soldier called
Daniel makes Tik Tok videos like this
one with 2.1 million views but since
then his views have decreased
significantly Daniel has had support
criticism and anti-semitic abuse he told
me that I'm not taking personally the
hate reactions because first of all I
did nothing wrong second people around
the world are so dedicated to hating
Israel so it doesn't matter what is in
my content Pro Palestinian creators like
Ariana share their views from their
bedroom like she does in the US she
experienced criticism and islamophobic
hate at first but then that
changed people started following me they
started discovering me and so the
numbers started shooting up I have
received more engagement on Tik Tok I've
had multiple videos receive more than a
million
views both creators say their content
hasn't been sponsored questions remain
about whether the Israeli government or
Hamas who which is prescribed as a
terrorist group by the UK government is
involved in encouraging unofficial
content when users are pushed more
content confirming their views extreme
ideas can gain traction you can see here
how Tik Tok blocked the search term a
letter to America that's because on the
app several young users began to share
and praise parts of assama Bin Laden's
letter to America his justification for
the 9/11 attack without mentioning its
anti-semitic or homophobic content Tik
Tok said there were only a small number
of these videos which is since removed
and interest was Amplified on other
sides Tik Tok has also said our

Beyond Today its fourth and final day
the group which is regarded as a
terrorist organization by the UK and
other governments yesterday freed more
hostages who'd been held in Gaza
including 14 Israelis in exchange for
Palestinian prisoners President Biden
has said he wants to keep the deal going
Beyond today so that all captives can be
brought home and more Aid be sent to
Gaza from Jerusalem our Middle East
correspondent Hugo B
reports free again 14 Israeli hostages
released by Hamas head home after their
long or deal along with three foreign
Nationals among them were 15-year-old
dafina and Ella ilim eight who were
finally reunited with their mom Chen
Golding almog who was released along
with her three children and RI KY
released 51 days after being kidnapped
from a festival where he was working as
sound
crew he followed a weekend of happy
reunions aigel Aidan spent her fourth
birthday in captivity the Israeli
American was taken on October the 7th
after Hamas attacked and killed both of
her parents her family have spoken of
their relief at finally being
reunited it was wow couldn't believe
until I saw her I simply couldn't
believe it now I'm a bit more relieved
not relieved completely because there's
happiness mixed with missing Roy and
had and there was celebrations in the
occupied West Bank 2 39 Palestinian
prisoners in their teens were released
by Israel in exchange for the hostages
the green flag of Hamas seemed flying
among the
crowds very happy thank God for this joy
and we hope that all prisoners will be
released God willing relief for all
prisoners today marks the final day of
the temporary ceasefire deal between
Hamas and Israel so far 54 hostages and
117 Palestinian prisoners have been
freed and much needed Aid has been sent
into Gaza now attention turns to whether
this fragile truce could be
extended Hamas says he wants to see an
extension of the current pausing
fighting in Gaza this could increase the
number of hostages being freed President
Biden said the hostage release was the
result of intensive us diplomacy his
administration he said will be working
to extend the deal more is needed but
this deal is delivering life-saving
results critically needed Aid is going
in and hostages are coming out and this
still is structured so that it can be
extended to keep building on these
results that's my goal that's our goal
the Israeli Prime Minister reaffirmed
his determination to continue the
fighting once the temporary ceasefire
ends with about 180 people is still in
captivity in Gaza the painful weight of
their families
continues Dr Benjamin rad is a senior
fellow at the UCLA Burl Center for
international relations he gave us his
thought on the possibility of an
extension to the current truce I think
the public pressure within the Israeli
Society has come to uh show the
government show Netanyahu that the
primary desire of the Israeli public is
the release of the hostages before the
even the the the destruction or the
dismantling of hamas's fighting um
infrastructure and so that public
pressure has come to Bear very strongly
so we now see efforts by the government
not only to maintain the truce in the
agreement but also to offer a possible
extension of it in the days to come so
it seems very likely Israel has two
objectives number one one to return all
the hostages and number two to prevent
any hostage taking or attacks in the
future obviously the second goal cannot
be met until the first one is first
satisfied to make sure that those
hostages return but it is it remains a
primary objective of the government to
make sure that this cannot be repeated
which is why Netanyahu has reaffirmed
his um his position that the attacks or
the operation against Hamas will
continue as soon as the hostages have
all been released well with me now is
Muhammad from BBC Arabic Muhammad
welcome to you good to see you and what
else are you hearing about a possible
extension to this truce which we
understand Hamas is looking to extend uh
good morning Samantha yes indeed it's
more likely that this truce would be
extended all parties are happy that this
Truth uh would be extended uh Hamas
announced that the katar side and
President Biden said yesterday that he's
welcoming that and there are efforts
towards that bamin netan said he would
be happy to do that as uh as um in
exchange of each day of the truce 10
hostages would be release so it's more
likely that this troops would be
extended the people in Gaza are really
in dire need for for Aid they are
getting this Aid uh uh gradually but
they are in dire need for for fuel there
there is uh there are very little fuel
is going to uh Northern Gaza and this is
really uh needed uh for the for the you
know for the uh for the cars to work for
the rubbish to be cleared for the roads
to be opened for the communications to
be restored for every uh aspects of life
to be return back even the sewage there
is a sewage massive sewage problem that
the because of the motors are not
working the the sewage
water is everywhere so the fuel is
really needed the medical supply
is really needed for the hospital to
reopen the Indonesian Hospital in
Northern Gaza is partially out of
service to they want this hospital to
return back to work the hospitals in the
city of Gaza as well in a bad need to
work so all parties whether the
Americans the the the kataris the
Israelis and the Palestinians including
Hamas are really Keen for this truths to
be extended for all this offer to put
together uh towards a permanent uh
ceasefire maybe and what do we
understand about those people who are
returning home we saw hundreds of
thousands of garans move South as they
were told to do by the Israelis to try
and keep safe there are returning to the
North many of them in some cases they
don't have a home to return to what do
we understand about what could happen if
this truce isn't extended will they have
to return back south into temporary
accommodation uh actually we would see
what is the reaction uh would be but the
people of Gaza I saw pictures this
morning for Gaza for the markets of Gaza
people are acting as if the war is over
so the markets are open they are uh
buying their their stuff they are trying
to put fuel in their cars but where are
they getting things from to to sell H
part part of that is the the aid that's
coming to Gaza but this is really
question a good question question to ask
I I saw with my eyes markets are full
with vegetables fruits and other other
Goods in Gaza people are now the Israeli
forces stopped from from stopping people
from going north so they are returning
back uh to their destroyed homes to
collect their winter stuff from the
rubbles I saw a man with with a hammer
trying to get to a collapsing bedroom to
get some some clothes from from the the
collapsed bedroom he's using he's using
the the the wood of the cupboard to for
for fire afterwards but I want to say
something if you may may allow me
Samantha about about the the scenes of
exch exchange hostages as this is turned
to be a media war between Hamas and the
Palestinians we can see that the
Israelis are really Keen for for a
lowkey media appearance for the hostages
they are also Keen to to make the
Palestinians not celebrate so much uh
their their free ones especially in
Jerusalem there are there are TR Israeli
troops around their homes they are
telling them not to celebrate that
invited the neighbors to make
congratulations through balconies and
and and and and and windows on the
contrary we can see the Hamas when they
are freeing the hostages there is that
friendly bond between the hostages and
the Hamas fighters to the extent that
the social media in the world Arab world
is exploding of of humor about this and
also uh
and also the massive celebrations on the
West Bank regarding the freed prisoners

tonight that the temperary ceasefire
agreement between Israel and Hamas due
to end at midnight tomorrow could be
extended now the deal so far has led to
hostages being freed that were seized by
Hamas which is designated as a terrorist

exchange for Palestinian prisoners held
in Israeli jails and crucially an influx
of much needed Aid into Gaza well so far

released this evening and another group
expected to be freed sometime tomorrow a
number of other hostages from Thailand
Russia and the Philippines have also

stones in the West Bank they got a
hero's welcome the green flag of Hamas
now Flying
high in Gaza the truce is holding among
Ong the ruins more than 14,000
Palestinians have been killed according
to the Hamas Ron Health
Ministry many in the International
Community fear what's to come if
Israel's bombardment resumes orar and
BBC News Tel
Aviv Let's cross to Lucy Williamson who
is in East Jerusalem for us tonight Lucy
um there's the possibility that more
Palestinians could be released beyond
the end of the current deal if there is
an
extension yes and I think that will come
as welcome news to many people in the
West Bank and in East Jerusalem not just
because it means more Palestinian
prisoners released from Israeli jails
but also because of the sense of kinship
that many people feel with people in
Gaza and concern for the situation there
Israel has put restrictions on many of
the families who are receiving people
back from jail saying they shouldn't
hold celebrations they shouldn't talk to
the media but there's very little mood
for big celebrations as it is because
people have told us they do feel anger
and sadness at the situation in Gaza we
spoke to one mother in the West Bank
this week who was waiting for her son to
come off one of these uh coaches from
from the Israeli jail and she said she
felt conflicted about what Hamas had
done on the one hand she said it brought
her son back to her on the other hand it
caused the devastation in
Gaza indeed okay Lucy thank you Lucy
Williamson there uh in East Jerusalem
let's get a final word from all who's
here we heard Lucy there say of course
Palestinians on the West Bank uh and in
Gaza they're going to want an extension
and President Biden has made it clear
this evening that he would like to see
more hostages released and an extension
of the ceasefire what do you believe the
next few days could hold in relation to
all of this I think for the moment live
it suits everyone to extend there's
nothing firm there's nothing official
but we've had a series of statements
today that are all indicating the same
thing first of all Hamas said it would
like to extend the ceasefire and there
was a suggestion from a Palestinian
official who spoke to the BBC that this
could be an extension of 2 to 4 days
allowing for the release of another 20
to 40 Israeli hostages then we had
President Biden saying we would like to
see the deal extended this evening we
had the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu referring to the fact that the
deal allows for an extension and using a
phrase which translated means that would
be a blessed thing so the signals are
that this is something that all the
sides want we have to get through
tomorrow first and the release of the
final batch under the existing deal so
we're expecting another 13 or 14
tomorrow important to say c that
Netanyahu has also said after any deal
we will go back to war with full force
he's under pressure from the military
here not to let this pause drag on too
long they want to get back to the
battlefield the families of the hostages
want peace as long as possible indeed",20231126

their way home there had been fears
tonight's deal was off Hamas the group
designated as a terrorist organization
by the UK had accused Israel of rening
on the temporary ceasefire agreement by
not allowing enough Aid trucks into Gaza
that led to a delay of several hours in
the freeing of the hostages all this
after yesterday's release of 13 Israeli
captives in return for 39 Palestinian
prisoners our first report tonight is
from

aaran in t Aviv tonight streets thronged

destruction I dedicate this explosion to

[Applause]
two then he blows up a
[Applause]
building the Israeli Army has confirmed
to the BBC that these are its troops in
Gaza orar and BBC News Tel
Aviv AA we're hearing that uh the uh
second group of Israeli hostages has
arrived back here in Israel from Gaza
the delay of course a little bit earlier
this evening threatening to shut down
the whole deal tonight and that shows
the fragility of the deal between Israel
and
Hamas it does Clive we have confirmation
now that the group is back on Israeli
soil at 13 Israelis eight of them
children five of them women as well as
four Tha Nationals and this evening we
saw that delay of several hours caused
because Hamas said Israel had breached
the ceasefire agreement in several ways
which Israel denied now we had Qatar and
Egypt very quickly stepping in to
mediate remove what they call the
obstacles uh and the release went ahead
but after a few more hours of Anguish
for the families involved now we have
some detail tonight of those who have
been freed almost all are from a single
Community kibuts Berry which was near
the border with Gaza uh people may
remember it was one of the worst
affected communities around a 100 people
were killed there H and we do know that
one of those who has been released
tonight is the Irish Israeli hostage
Emily hand just 9 years old now people
may remember her father Thomas giving an
anguished interview when initially he
thought she had been killed and saying
in his grief that he was happy with that
rather than seeing her being a hostage
and tormented in Gaza he subsequently
found out she was alive and tonight she
is safe and well and back in Israel we
know that one other child has been
released a 12-year-old girl without her
mother who has been kept behind in Gaza
so once again tonight Clive the releases
are being welcomed but there is a sense
that this is bittersweet because many
Israeli hostages remain behind in Gaza
and it's unclear how long it will take
and indeed if it will be possible to get
the others home tomorrow another batch
are due to be released and one more
batch after that if the ceasefire holds
for the four days which it is initially
due to last
for all right all right we'll see what
happens Alla thank you all gear in
reporting for us there well a second
busload of Palestinian prisoners
released from Israeli jails has arrived
in the West Bank Town of betunia as part
of the deal agreed between Israel and

Tel Aviv on a significant day in the war
between Israel and Hamas a planned pors
in fighting in Gaza came into effect
early this morning a temporary ceasefire
lasting initially 4 days allowing some
hostages out as well as Aid into the
territory now these are some of the 13
Israeli hostages women and children who
were given their freedom in the last few
hours they made their way to Egypt
through the RAF Crossing in southern
Gaza and onto Israel one can only
imagine the scenes as they were finally
reunited with their loved ones within
the next few days a total of 50 Israeli
hostages are expected to be released as
part of the deal to continue the pause
in the fighting and in return over in
ramala in the West Bank 150 Palestinians
held by Israel will be released starting
today with 39 women and teenage AG boys
well this is the scene live in Gaza
tonight where the ceasefire seems to be
holding with much needed Aid arriving
throughout the day gaza's Hamas run
Health Ministry now says more than
14,000 people have been killed during
Israeli bombardments a military
offensive that began of course after
1,200 people were murdered and around
240 hostages were taken by Hamas 7 weeks
to go tomorrow Hamas is designated as a
terror organization by the UK government

but very happy for them really but we

to BBC News we're staying with that
breaking news things very fluid the
situation changing all of the time but
Israel the media says 13 hostages held
by Hamas in Gaza have been handed over
to the Red Cross these some of the
recent pictures they are thought now to
be in Egypt under that deal broken by
katar most of them we know are children
now from the Rafa border crossing with
Egypt ultimately they'll be taken to a
military Air Base in southern Israel
then onto an Israeli hospital and
ultimately reunited with their families
now as that is happening Thailand's
prime minister confirmed a little
earlier that 12 Thai hostages have also
been released today all of the men as
part of a separate deal with Hamas now
under the main deal 39 Palestinian
prisoners were also due to be released
from Israeli jails later in the day now
the Red Cross says it is for
facilitating the release and transfer of
both the hostages and prisoners and of
course there is now a 4-day pause in the
fighting it's 11 hours old but it is
holding and as a result convoys of Aid
trucks have already headed into Gaza
those are the key planks as we look
again at those pictures of those Red
Cross Vehicles just going through the
crossing point that happened about 20
minutes ago let's go back to Anna Foster
she's there in Tel Aviv and and it's
worth uh for anyone just joining us uh
you explaining where you are because so
many people gathered there just like
they have been for weeks uh just waiting
for this moment which will be such an
important moment for Israel after 7
weeks that's right Matthew this this
place this Square outside the uh Tel
Aviv Museum of Art is is known as
hostages Square now and this is a place
where many of the the hostages families
have come on on regular occasions they'd
come here for vigils they've come here
sometimes for for protests just a couple
of days ago I was talking to the the
mother of one of the hostages and and
they had come here to to hold a piano
concert in his honor he was a keen piano
player so this is really the Hub the
focal point uh for many of the hostages
families for many people across Israel
and that is why you've seen the crowds
building here uh you see the posters the
faces you know the names of these
hostages that are on on everything from
from stickers to posters just big you
know lit up Billboards around Tel Aviv
and around the country and people are
gathering here now waiting for
confirmation that those hostages have
been released now as we were saying an
Israeli Security Source has said that
those hostages are now in the hands of
Israeli Security Services but it appears
not yet actually physically inside
Israel because as we were saying they
pass out of Gaza into Egypt first of all
and then Israeli uh Security Services
will bring them eventually back into
Israel once again uh we also um have a
quote now one of the main Israeli news
channels Channel 13 is saying that the
uh the head of maggan David Odon which
is the Israeli Ambulance Service says
that 13 Israeli hostages are in good
condition and speaking because I think
that was a key part of this deal as well
and and in fact when we heard the
qataris announce it yesterday we brought
you that press conference here on BBC
News one of the questions that was asked
as as part of that press conference is
are of those hostages that are being
released those 13 are they alive are
they well because of course these are
are vital questions that you know people
don't necessarily know the answer to um
but the Israeli Ambulance Service MDA
says that the 13 Israeli hostages who
are being released today on on day one
of this 4-day deal are in good condition
and are speaking and I think the
choreography of what we see today is is
is important as well because this will
hopefully you know people here are
hoping that they will see this repeated
over the next 4 days this is sort of the
third part of what will happen today
started with the ceasefire we saw
additional trucks of humanitarian Aid
pass into Gaza The Next Step will be the
confirmation of the release of those
hostages you know we've seen and we see
those pictures again of those Red Cross
Jeeps coming out of Gaza through the
Rafa Crossing into Egypt you know all
very positive signs all small steps
along the way the next step I think will
be the official confirmation from Israel
uh that those hostages have been
returned home that they are back on
Israeli soil and then that will trigger
if you like the fourth part of this deal
which is the release of Palestinian uh
prisoners who are being held in Israeli
jails we've been watching as well those
live pictures of OFA prison in the West
Bank it's an Israeli detention center
and over the next 4 days 150 Palestinian
prisoners women and teenage boys in the
main are expected to be released from
there as part of this this deal a 2-hour
window was the suggestion uh certainly
in that press conference by the kataris
yesterday that after Israel confirmed
safe receipts of the hostages within two
hours they would then release the
Palestinian prisoners um the agreed
Palestinian prisoners that are being
held in OFA prison if that all goes to
plan Matthew then it should repeat for
the next 3 days and I think there are
hopes on all sides that that that could
potentially continue Israel has said
that for every 10 additional Israeli
hostages over and above the 50 that have
been agreed they are prepared to
continue to extend that ceasefire by 24
hours katav said that they hope that
that this could be a more permanent
truce I think depending on who you speak
to that might be
a that that might be a you know a big
ambition to have at the moment but
certainly this deal which has taken so
long to agree on so long to negotiate
it's further down the line than it's
been so far and and it it seems we are
close the international committee for
the Red Cross um has told the BBC that
eight of their staff traveling in four
icrc vehicles have transported hostages
across the border into Egypt as we've
been seeing there was a doctor as part
of the icrc team the hostages were
handed over by them to the Egyptian
authorities at the Rafa border crossing
um it seems according to uh sources told
the BBC see that Egypt have now handed
them on to Israeli security sources um
and the next stage will be the return of
those hostages actually back to Israel
to Israeli hospitals that are prepared
and ready to receive them and where the
families of those 13 are also waiting to
be reunited with
them",20231124

Israeli hostages will not now be
released until Friday at the earliest
the temporary ceasefire has been delayed
as well it was supposed to come into
effect at 10:00 tomorrow morning with
the first of 50 hostages released at
lunchtime but tonight Israel has said
that negotiations were continuing with
Hamas which is designated a terrorist
organization by the UK under the deal
they have been working on 50 of around
240 Israelis should be released from
Gaza around a dozen a day during a 4day
temporary ceasefire in return 150
Palestinian women and teenagers would be
released from Israeli prisoners prisons
our senior International correspondent
oliran reports and there are distressing
images from the
start a reminder of how all this began
on October 7th Hamas gun men storming
across the border from Gaza hunting
Israelis to kill or
capture around 240 were taken
hostage among them Sheree bias trying to
Shield her two little boys from the
horror all around
them 10-month-old cfir had just started
crawling Ariel who's four loves climbing
and Batman now they and their mother are
expected home in the coming days along
with dozens of other women and children
they don't know yet that Hamas killed
their
grandparents sher's cousin eat is caught
between hope and torment I don't know
what kind of children will come back to
us the trauma what they
saw
and until
I see them in my own eyes I don't
believe any lists of names and I don't
believe any news coming today from
anywhere I need to see them in my own
eyes I need to hold my cousin in my
arms but for many in Gaza just the
anguish of
goodbye Hassan haloa lost his niece
three brothers and his grandmother
relatives say they were killed by an
Israeli air strike on a residential
building Gaza is teeming with grief and
Desperation this was the struggle for a
few bottles of water the truce will
clear a path for hundreds of trucks
carrying food Fuel and medical
supplies
for now Gaza keeps burying its dead with
more than a hundred bodies in this Mass
grave the next few days may bring quiet
but Israel and Hamas have said that
after the truce the war will
resume or we have just heard a short
time ago that the hostages will not now
be released until Friday at the earliest
no temporary ceasefire until then either
what more can you tell us about this
delay
tonight well it's certainly a change
Sophie at the 11th Hour Israel was
gearing up for the release of hostages
as early as tomorrow morning now there
are conflicting reports here about what
has caused the setback as some claims
that Hamas hasn't actually ratified the
ceasefire agreement other reports that
it has not provided Israel with a list
of the hostages who were to be released
on the first day and that mechanism is
supposed to be part of the agreement now
a government Source has told me in the
last 10 minutes that they believe these
are relatively minor issues which need
to be ironed out and that they would be
ironed out tomorrow now that suggests
that things would be back on track on
Friday if that is the case but what we
can say for certain is that this will be
an awful blow to the families they've
been waiting almost 50 days hoping that
tomorrow was finally going to bring a
moment of Hope now back once again they
have to deal with uncertainty and I
think many of them will feel they will
only believe this deal is happening when
they see it",20231122

but now safe from

a few days respite from Israeli bombings
or gearan BBC News
Jerusalem so how close could we be to
hostages being released our security
correspondent Frank Gardner is with me
the White House is is sounding fairly
optimistic yeah they are I mean I've
spoken to a number of people involved
indirectly in this potential deal and
they are optimistic but we've been here
before and this is terrible for the
families who have had their hopes raised
and then dashed but I have to say that I
think we're probably closer than we've
ever been before we're talking here
about an arrangement that would see
around 50 to 70 hostages Israeli
hostages non-combatants so not the
soldiers who were captured but women
children civilians released in an
initial batch and in return there would
be a pause of say 6 hours a day for
about four days um for three to 5 days
and there would be fuel allowed into
Gaza now none of this is actually agreed
absolutely yet but what the parties are
saying is that the fundamental agreement
is in place what's been holding it up is
the logistics and the practicalities of
it what does that mean in practice well
the negotiations are taking place in
Doha in Qatar but it takes time to get
those messages back to the military
commanders in Gaza who of course are
fighting a war and they're underground
so they don't get immediate answers and
of course the longer this war goes on
the fewer of those military commanders
there are to actually answer it then
you've got to gather in the hostages who
are held in different places if you cast
your mind back to that horrific day on
October the 7th as soon as they got them
to Gaza they scattered them out to
different places to getting the back in
and getting the Red Cross to come in and
take them out it'll take time Frank

course there was a military failure and
mil and intelligence failure of the
military intelligence the Secret Service
intelligence but the
strategy was netan and netan
alone based on on my personal experience
but also on what netan said for years
there is one person who is in charge of
everything at the end of the day
he decides in order to protect his
status personally and to defend himself
against the legal process which is was
taking place already he needed to change
the judicial system and that's what he
was trying to do of course the
government was shaking and the
only basis of
support for him stable were the
Messianic groups so there was this
Alliance that was
based on
corruption and on the abuse of the
powers of the state and the resources of
the state to protect the personal status
of the Prime Minister and it also led to
a huge number of forces being withdrawn
from Gaza and taken to the West Bank
part of it was part of the part of of
the process part of the process was to
to to respond to their demands at the
expense of others and this was just one
aspect of it not the only one billions
and billions and billions of uh of uh
shekels uh were spent in order to buy
their support coming now to the future
of the West Bank and the future of Gaza
we saw prime minister Netanyahu a couple
of days ago say that he thinks there's
got to be an ongoing security
involvement B can speak as much as he
wants about taking control of all of
this this is nonsense he had a security
responsibility for
Gaza until the 7th of October what did
he do with it he completely failed I
mean this is not new we always had
security IR responsibility of course we
do we need to be inside Gaza in the
shift hospital or in kanun in order to
take control of security no we just had
to protect the Border in a more
effective manner which we didn't and so
after destroying Hamas we can return
immediately back into the international
border which is recognized by the
International Community which is not
even claimed by the Palestinians to be
theirs and then we also have to offer a
political Horizon and the only political
Horizon is a two State solution so had I
been the prime minister of Israel now
that what I would have done I would have
come to the Americans and Europeans and
say hey guys you send your intervention
Force into Gaza for a short period of
time they will
allow eventually the Palestinian
Authority to take over not from the
Israeli bayet but from the noninvolved
Western power that will try and help
rehabilitate start rehabilitate Gaza
this is the end game now of course you
would ask me will BB this government
make a statement that they are prepared
for a two-state
solution no way they're not going to do
it that's another reason why they have
to be kicked out today would that
solution for in the West Bank would that
involve the removal of many of the new
SS that have been built yes how would
that be achieved will be imposed by
strong
government and I think that it can be
done my proposal which by the way lies
on the table of Abu masin as of two
months ago
the plan that I have that I have
submitted to him that is broadly
speaking I think is acceptable to them
which they should have accepted 15 years
ago but they didn't have the vision and
the courage but anyway would you not
face an extremely dangerous backlash to
this violent backlash we will we will we
have to save the state of Israel would
it not risk destroying the state of
Israel maybe but I trust that the
overwhelming
majority of people in this country all
of the groups that make up the power the
strengths the sophistication the
progress the culture the achievements of
this country will be on this side
it will be a decisive process for what
Israel is all about but anything else
will be much worse because if we will
not pull out from the territories if we
will not separate from the Palestinians
we will not help them create their own
State independent state if they will not
be allowed to exercise their fundamental
right for
self-determination then Israel will
become a bational state that will
forever live with internal conflicts and
frictions and Terror and hatred and
whatnot and SE segregation and and
second class segregation second class
citizens which is what bang and smri and
the supporters want but we will not
allow it because we have a different
self image of who we are as human beings
and we'll never allow it",20231120

this way because this is the solution
but Israel's peace Camp has been
dwindling for
years since October 7th it is reeling
because of Vivan another war is underway
in Gaza something Vivian silver hoped
would not be
repeated the grief here is for a beloved
mother and grandmother but also for a
vision of a different
future well there are are growing
indications tonight Clive that a deal on
the release of Israel's hostages is
close still nothing official but we've
had positive comment today from Israel's
Ambassador in the United States from a
senior US National Security official and
critically from Qatar which has been
playing a central role in mediation
qatar's prime minister said today that
the negotiations had been up and down
but at this stage all that really
remained in terms of stumbling blocks
were logistical and practical issues now
we're expecting that a deal if and when
it comes will involve the release of a
few dozen Israeli women and children in
return Israel would release Palestinian
women and children from Israeli prisons
uh there would be a pause in the
fighting perhaps three days perhaps five
and that would allow desperately needed
humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza
because as you will remember the UN has
been warning that 2.2 million
Palestinians are in danger of starvation
now for the families waiting for news
tonight every night is an Agony worrying
that their loved ones could be killed by
Hamas or by Israel's own air strikes",20231119

to reporters in Doha about the prospect
of a deal to release some hostages it's
not really about you know a specific
thing that you know I can comment yes or
no about it but it's uh the challenges
that remains in in the negotiations are
very minor compared to the bigger CH
challenges they are more logistical they
are more practical and I believe that uh
with the willingness of both parties to
engage and to have this deal uh moving
we can we can reach there we are uh
we've been focused in the past four five
weeks now in in in these negotiations
we've been we tried every way all
possible ways in order to ensure uh uh
that civilians uh are released and we
treat all human beings are the same
civilians are civilians whether they are
from the Israeli side or the Palestinian
side
as as we mentioned in in in several
occasions uh our focus is to make sure
that there relas is happening safely and
there are also the humanitarian issues
of the Gaza STP to be addressed in in
that that was qatar's prime minister
there well I'm joined now in the studio
by our Middle East Sebastian user
Sebastian tell us more about what's been
said about a potential hostage deal what
we were hearing there from a prime
minister who also serves as their
foreign minister is more upbeat than
we've heard for several days in public
at least about what's going on and he's
saying that the challenges that remain
about trying to get this deal done and
this is only a partial deal remember
this is not a deal obviously for the
full number of hostages to be released
but that they are now they're logistical
they're practical details they're very
minor I mean in such a sensitive deal as
this even logistical and practical
details I would suggest could still be a
major BL block what he's saying I think
also the timing of it is interesting we
had a Washington Post article uh just uh
in the past 24 hours suggesting that a
deal is almost done uh that essentially
the um the way that it will be managed
would be 50 hostages for his women and
children would be released and in return
Israel would uh provide a 5day ceasefire
now in previous um leaks that we've had
about what a deal might be with the
Qatari Med iation this is Hamas Israel
and the us all very much involved in
this had been I think for a lesser
amount of time for the ceasefire 3 days
I think was a previous and also Hamas
had been demanding that there would be
an exchange of prisoners that Israel had
as well Palestinian women and
Palestinian children that doesn't seem
to be the case at the moment so I mean
he didn't say that it's imminent he
didn't say you know expect news of this
in the next day or two but I think you
know this all looks for choreography
looks even after white house uh denial
essentially saying that there's no deal
that's actually been done yet but
they're working towards it and the
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also in
a sense talking it down I think we are
inevitably moving towards this I think
everything kind of is merging to make
this seem the likeliest option within
the next days next weeks okay Sebastian
thank you very much",20231119

former US ambassador to Egypt Frank
wizner who served for many years in the
US state department Ambassador you're
very welcome to the program thank you
for being with us um
the splits in the United States over
what is happening in Gaza are starting
to come to the four uh you just heard
from the anra representative there
saying we can't get the aid to where it
is needed in Gaza uh from Tomorrow
onwards because we don't have the
fuel how difficult does this make it for
the White House particularly in terms of
its relations in the
region this is a terrible situation
however you look at it and from whatever
advantage point you begin the White
House is in a tight corner so is the
government of Israel so is uh the
population of Gaza we're all in a
terrible terrible fix and I can only
hope that the uh problem we're facing
right now will be somewhat alleviated
with the notion of a pause and Then
followed by the delivery of fuel and in
increased amounts of humanitarian Aid
but the stories that we're all listening
to are just horrific there's no question
about it and it impels everyone to
double down and do what's possible to
bring alleviation to this Dreadful
situation well I want to talk about that
because it seems the Biden
administration's strategy was to keep
the Israelis close hug them close
support them build up political Capital
so that they could restrain them when
the time was right but that's not paying
off is it the Israeli War cabinet has
certainly welcomed the support and now
is resisting the political pressure to
pause how problematic is that for the
president well you're speaking about a a
negotiation that is ongoing between
Washington and Jerusalem and I really
cannot tell you what exactly is
happening but I know what American
policy is and that is to bring
uh a situation this current terrible
situation to alleviate the suffering
that's underway to get the hostages out
to bring humanitarian assistance in to
pause the combat in order to enable this
and then to move on Beyond to a
different outcome that's American policy
where we're actually at any given moment
in our dialogue with the Israelis or
with with any party I I obviously I just
don't
know president Herzog the Israeli
president said in an interview with the
financial times today that Israel can't
leave a vacuum in Gaza after the war and
will need a very strong force to prevent
Hamas from
reemerging uh if we pull back he says
then who will take over President Biden
said again yesterday that a reoccupation
of Gaza would be a mistake what from
your perspective and you know the region
so well what from your perspective would
Gaza look like in the aftermath of a war
well this is of course the central next
question not the final one but what
takes over in Gaza if there is an end to
open
hostilities um and all I can tell you at
this stage is there are no easy answers
uh the Israelis should not stay in Hamas
would not be in a position to manage the
territory no no uh UN agency has the
strength to do that the Palestinian
Authority is too weak to take that on no
Coalition of Arab governments is going
to put themselves In Harm's Way without
a political context and step into the
Gaza nightmare so we don't know the
answer to your question it's a
profoundly important one at this stage
and with combat still in an intense
phase uh it's hard to answer that

also dropped over Northern Gaza weeks

Mark Maran thank you very much indeed
well we were going to actually uh be
live with you in that headline sequence
but we had to dash because there was a
rocket that was just fired uh just above
our heads and intercepted by Israel's
Iron Dome anti-missile system and there
was a siren that went out so we just had
to take cover there I'm not sure if you
can see but in the distance the very
large plume of smoke there where an air
strike has recently hit um a sign of
just how constant the threats are here

consistently denied the allegations of
the Israeli military uh President Biden
meanwhile has said that the uh us has
urged Israel to act in his words with
Incredible care as Israel's military
operation at alifa
continues one thing has been established
is that Hamas does have a headquarters
weapons material below this hospital and
I suspect
others well our correspondent Lucy
Williamson was taken inside alifa
hospital by the Israeli Defense Forces a
little earlier she joined us from
Jerusalem Israel is really coming under
pressure to prove why it carried out the
operation it's carrying out in Gaza and
driving into Gaza last night it was
clear just the scale of its military
operation there parts of the city looked
as if it had been hit by an earthquake
buildings completely decimated roads
churned up rows of Tanks moving through
the streets um so I think the scale of
the operation is clear but also Israel's
desire to try and show the world why
it's doing what it's doing it's still
very tense uh they took us right into
the heart of Gaza City into alifa
hospital that's been the scene at least
the streets around it have been the
scene of some of the fiercest fighting
over the past few days uh we had to go
in in darkness through a hole in one of
the perimeter walls and we were taken um
to one specific Department the MRI
department in the hospital we weren't
allowed to talk to other people not to
doctors not to patients we were shown uh
the the items that the IDF said they had
found there hidden amongst the medical
equipment but as you say um the real uh
the real proof that uh Israel is under
such Global scrutiny for is to provide
evidence of this network of tunnels
beneath the hospital that's something
they haven't found yet but they did say
that it's very early days there's a lot
of the hospital still to search and both
they and the US intelligence Community
believe those tunnels are there
we're in an Israeli military vehicle
inside the Gaza Strip now they're taking
us towards Gaza City this area we're
passing through an area where the ground
operation first began weeks ago now and
since then the Israeli Army has fought
its way methodically towards Gaza City
towards the gates of the shifa hospital
and that's where they taking us
now we're still being told to keep our
lights off
are we going this
way the Israeli Army has been really
searching through this Hospital you can
see they've had to force the door of the
MRI room here to get
inside they've been looking for evidence
of this being a Hamas base a place where
Hamas planned attacks and they say that
among the things they've uncovered are
more than a dozen kalashnikovs grenades
personal protective equipment some of it
with the the military Brigade insignia
on it you can see some of them here
hidden under these bags of medical
supplies we're also told that there have
been laptops found with some information
about the hostages they also found some
recent files that suggest this may have
been a Hamas operating base as recently
as a few days
ago well there's been a lot of pressure
on Israel for the humanitarian cost of
its operation in Gaza not least inside
the shifa hospital where doctors say
they're struggling to keep alive dozens
of vulnerable newborn babies without
enough electricity food or water but now
that Israel does have control of the
hospital and is carrying out the
searches it's also Under Pressure to
prove to give some evidence about why
it's actually
there Lucy Williamson with a rare
Glimpse inside alifa Hospital in Gaza
there well on this side of the border

killed three suspects involved in an
attack on a checkpoint in

developing situation at gaza's largest

hospital is still currently underway
Israel says the hospital conceals an
underground Command Center used by Hamas
which is designated as a terrorist
organization by the United Kingdom
United States and several other
countries it's the claim doctors there
deny meanwhile in the US the White House
and the Pentagon say they now have
intelligence that Hamas and Palestinian
Islamic Jihad are operating from tunnels
below hospitals including alifa and that
they're also storing weapons there it's
the first time they have backed up
Israel's claims to this extent despite
its new intelligence the US says
hospitals and patients must be protected
in a tweet the Israel Defense Forces
said we can confirm that incubators baby
food and medical supplies brought by IDF
tanks from Israel have successfully
reached the shifa hospital our Medical
Teams and arabic speaking soldiers are
on the ground to ensure that these
supplies reach those in need the Israeli
military said it its actions at alifa
are precise and targeted the Gaza Strip
has been under sieged by Israel Defense
Forces since Hamas launched its attacks
in Israel on the 7th of O October our
correspondent in Gaza Rishi Abu ALU has
spoken to an eyewitness at the hospital
I made another contact with eyewitness
inside the hospital he said he saw six
tanks within inside the hospital and
about 100 Israeli commanders soldiers
they St the main emergency department of
the hospital he said uh one person of
them was speaking in Arabic shouting at
the people don't move don't move and
then they entered the the hospital after
4 days of besieging the hospitals with
tanks from all around it and cutting AIS
in and out today the BBC was told by two
eyewitnesses inside that the Israeli
soldier are storming five buildings of
the hospitals the one of the witnesses
he just told the BBC that I saw six
tanks and about over 100 Israeli
Commandos unit entering the main
Department emergency room and they were
shouting in Arabic don't move don't move
he said there was some shooting around
and they they they fire a smoke pomp in
the outskirt of the of the hospital and
then they started to move
inside well thousands of people are
believe to be in the complex here's more
from our correspondent yanel who's in
Jerusalem
we're still relying on some eyewitness
accounts from inside the hospital uh
that tell us how in the dead of night
Israel forces entered um there were they
say uh six tanks that went through into
the front of the compound U more than
100 Commandos some of them masked who
were shouting in Arabic don't move don't
move as they entered the emergency
department um this account from an
eyewitness whose um report we can't
independently verify at the moment um
but you know it's very clear that
Israeli forces are on the premises
working there there was also um someone
from the Hamas ran Health Ministry who
was speaking a short time ago in another
television interview who said that
Israeli forces had gone down into the
basement of the hospital this of course
is where Israel has been saying
consistently that it believes that Hamas
has an underground uh tunnel complex
it's been using as well as some of the
buildings of the hospital um it says as
a kind of command and control center
that is denied by Hamas but also um by
the medics who work at the hospital um
yesterday interestingly the US for the
first time uh came out and said that it
had its own intelligent sources uh
corroborating those claims from the
Israelis uh we haven't seen any sort of
visual proof up to now um made public uh
that this is the case um but the White
House also said that hospitals and
patients must be protected Ed and we
think that within the shiffer hospital
right now there are accounts vary but
between 2 and 4,000 people uh the
biggest number are people who went there
originally uh to take shelter but there
are also of course doctors and and
patients who are being treated uh some
of them very vulnerable uh including
more than 30 premature babies who were
taken off of the uh out of incubators
because of the lack of power um and
that's been a big focus of intern
National concern with suggestions they
could be evacuated that haven't um
really come to any fruition Israel has
been saying consistently that it is
willing to allow staff and patients uh
to flee from the shiffer hospital in
recent days because this standoff has
been going on for some time uh but what
Palestinians have said is that Israeli
forces fired at some of those people um
who were leaving that it was too
dangerous also to move those most
vulnerable
patients well that was the BBC's your
land now in Jerusalem well for more on
this story let's go live now to Juliet
tumor director of communications for the
UN works and relief Agency for Palestine
uh refugees and uh Juliet I just want to
start by asking you what you make of
events happening at aifa
today we are watching with horor we're
watching these reports with absolute
horror uh medical facilities should be
protected at at all times but this is
yet another indication that no place is
safe and no place including civilian
infrastructure like hospitals like un
facilities have not they've not been
spared during this war and Julius I want
to ask you about uh something
specifically to do with the UN in Gaza
we're getting reports from Reuters news
agency that a source a humanitarian Aid
source has said Israel has given
approval for 24,000 lers of diesel fuel
to be used by trucks for un operations
in the Gaza Strip can you confirm this
no I cannot confirm this I like you saw
the Reuters report and uh I can confirm
that no fuel has come into Gaza to dat
perir the statement that we put out last
night we confirmed that no fuel has come
into Gaza since The War Began it's been
five weeks now and in fact we at anra
are on the verge of uh having a
significant reduction in our operations
and in some cases if we do not get fuel
um we will be forced to stop some of our
operations that are life saving so but
is there are there ongoing negotiations
is there a possibility that an
announcement could come soon allowing
you to get fuel into the Gaza Strip
there has been negotiations for many
many long weeks now about the issue of
fuel it is very simple fuel has been
used as a weapon of war in uh in in Gaza
people have been deprived of basic
Services due to the lack of fuel we at
anra have been calling to get an urgent
shipment of fuel for the past three
weeks and it has been falling on deaf
ears and this is obviously putting a lot
of pressure on us as the largest
humanitarian agency to do our work
without fuel we cannot work it's very
simple it's very very simple just tell
us about the humanitarian situation in
Gaza we know what's happening in the
north the ongoing fighting in the South
we hear it was a particularly rainy
night and it was quite difficult for a
lot of people there in Gaza
overnight yes look the rain is going to
make um really desperate situation far
worse um including for people who have
been displaced which is now more than
34s of the Gaza population they have
been forced to leave their homes 800,000
of those are in un shelters they are
overcrowded we do not not have fuel
again so we cannot provide things like
heating or clean water this is why it's
absolutely critical that fuel comes in
and it's not a one-off shipment by the
way there needs to be shipments of fuel
on a regular basis on a daily basis and
the amount that we need to run the
largest humanitarian operation in the
Gaza Strip",20231115

Mark Lucy thanks very much indeed yeah
we're coming to you from uh about 3 km
or so a mile and a half perhaps from
Gaza where the in intense fighting very
much continuing and the Israeli Defense
Forces have posted a video with their
what they say is that are their
achievements on the ground over the last
24 hours or so which uh includes seizing
government buildings inside uh Gaza and
uh the French news agency AFP says uh
that uh the Israeli military are now in
control of gaza's Parliament
and other Hamas institutions so that is
on the military offensive side meanwhile
actually on the ground inside Gaza in
terms of the suffering well the fighting
is very much continuing around alifa
hospital hospital is very much in the
the focus of the military offensive and
uh many of those who are suffering are
pregnant women now uh the UN says that
more than a third of all hospitals in
Gaza are out of operation uh around 160
children per day are expected to be born
even even though women inside Gaza are
of course deprived of safe delivery uh
with lacking basic options and basic
supplies in hospitals that are
increasingly overwhelmed by the fighting
our uh freelance journalist Maj Fati in
Gaza has worked alongside our
correspondent yogita lii in Jerusalem to
report on the plight of women giving

reserves could run out as soon as today
making it impossible to distribute Aid
to more than 2 million people in the
Gaza Strip this comes as the World
Health Organization warns that gaza's
biggest hospital has become nearly a
cemetery with bodies piled up inside and
outside US President Joe Biden has said
gaza's main hospital must be protected
appealing for Less intrusive mil action
by the Israeli Defense
Forces the UN says power outages at the
alifa hospital in Northern Gaza mean
that dozens of premature babies and 45
kidney dialysis patients can't be
treated the IDF says it's working to
transfer incubators well let's go live
now to Southern Israel and my colleague
Mark luren Mark what's the latest that
we know about the situation there at
alifa hospital
well I was just actually reading some
comments from the manager of the
hospital Katherine who has spoken to
Gaza Lifeline um a uh media Outlet
saying that the the the hospital is
empty of food Fuel and water uh that
seven of those premature babies that uh
our viewers will remember that we saw in
those heartbreaking photographs
yesterday who were out of incubators
because there's a lack of fuel have now
died and he was asked whether Israel had
made contact with them regarding the
transfer of incubators or the evacuation
of the babies and he said no we reached
out to them uh now this hospital has
been very much the center of not only
the fighting but but claim and counter
claim uh between the two sides I mean
the the Hamas run Health Ministry in
Gaza says that the hospital is now part
of what it calls The Circle of Death I
think what we're facing now is
increasing International pressure on
Israel to try to Halt the fighting
around the hospital I mean President
Biden has intervened over ID said that
he has called for Israel to have to make
less intrusive action around the
hospital he said the hospital should be
protected and rishy sunak the UK prime
minister has said that there should be
urgent and substantive pauses in the
fighting particularly around the
hospital so um the hospitals Israel says
conceal Hamas command centers it says
that it is targeting those Hamas control
centers underneath the hospital but of
course still inside the hospitals we are
seeing hundreds of patients trapped
there and dwindling reserves of oxygen
and and any Fuel That Remains and and
Mark how is Israeli government
responding to this International
pressure yesterday it was talking about
taking some fuel reserves to alifa
hospital and understand a minister has
said that the fighting might go on for
several more weeks before a ceasefire
could be looked
at well a spokesman for the foreign
minister here in Israel said that they
believe that he believes that Israel has
two to three weeks until the
international pressure really steps up
Israel is clearly aware that the clamor
for a ceasefire and a clamor for and the
outrage actually of the International
Community over the plight of of of of of
of the civilians inside Gaza is reaching
boiling point and that even uh Israel's
traditional allies in the west such as
the us such as France are pushing ever
harder for some kind of humanitarian
pause Israel's policy up until now has
always been that there will only be a
ceasefire until there's movement on the
hostages 240 hostages that were taken by
Hamas on the 7th of October we
understand that um that a some kind of
deal is nearing is in the offing to try
to release some hostages U uh that were
taken on the 7th of October in exchange
for uh Israel releasing Palestinian
children and women in its prisons here
possibly several dozen uh who could be
released as a as part of some kind of
exchange deal it has not yet been
finalized though and until there is some
kind of deal that we understand has kind
of reached you know some kind of
finalization I think that there will be
no sign of of of of any sort of
ceasefire but as part of that deal there
could be possibly a 5-day pause in the
fighting so so that is that that is what
where we are this morning in terms of
the of the Diplomatic to and fro in
terms of humanitarian pauses and and
hostage release but you know meanwhile
the suffering goes on I have to say
Catherine there has been severe rain
it's just been tipping down here this
morning you can imagine what it would be
like for the for the civilians who are
fleeing Northern Gaza you can imagine
what it would be like for for the bodies
that are being left to rot outside the
Sha Hospital uh as the as the rain uh as
the rain really really comes down this
morning and there's forecast of of more
thunderstorms to come today so the
situation on the ground is only going to
get worse as the weather as the weather
as the weather closes in thank you very
much that's the BBC's Mark low in there

state of hospitals in Gaza this map
shows hospitals in the Gaza Strip the UN
says 20 out of 36 are no longer working
the biggest alifer is not functioning at
all according to the World Health
Organization Al sher's head of surgery
has told the BBC that a third premature
newborn baby has died because of a lack
of power there are reports that gaza's
second biggest Hospital Al cuds has run
out of fuel it's now five weeks since
Hamas designated a terror organization
by the UK government killed more than
1,200 people in Israel and took more
than 200 hostage since then Hamas
officials say well over 11,000 people
have been killed in Israeli attacks on
Gaza well let's go live to Jerusalem now
and speak to our correspondent Tom
baitman good morning Tom another week be
begins just talk us through what's been
happening
overnight well what we have is this
really desperate situation at as shifer
Hospital you were hearing about the
World Health Organization talking about
a perilous and dire situation and that
is because of the fact that around the
hospital now now there is very Fierce
fighting they're talking about intense
bombardment and armed clashes and So
within the hospital on top of what has
been you know a very very uh an
extremely difficult humanitarian
situation for weeks now it is
effectively completely closed apart from
what the Israelis say are safe evacu
evacuation rootes out now Palestinians
say that it is simply not safe there are
dead bodies lining the route that people
have been shot at uh and people killed
when they um have tried to leave so it's
extremely perilous and in the middle of
all this this huge crisis with 36 now
premature babies taken out of the
Intensive neonatal intensive care unit
because it stopped functioning because
of the loss of power uh now being kept
in a uh cardiac surgery room without the
right equipment they're not in
incubators they can't be kept properly
warm they have Desperate needs and the
doctor there Dr Maran abusada telling
the BBC that he fears those babies will
die unless either the hospital gets fuel
to power incubators or there is a safe
uh evacuation for those babies but it
takes very specialized Medical equipment
to do that okay hence the call on the on
the part of the who for action on this
in the meantime there's been conflicting
reports coming through overnight uh
about the hostages uh prime minister uh
Benjamin netan who is speaking to the US
Network NBC saying that a
deal is is possible could come about and
yet we're getting reports from Reuters
via Reuters Hamas saying no they've
stopped talking because of the attacks
on Al
shifer well first of all when it comes
to the hostages we have had for weeks
speculation uh the sense that perhaps a
deal uh to release a large number of
hostages in exchange for a ceasefire and
possibly also the release of Palestinian
prisoners held by Israel those kinds of
uh discussions have been going on for a
long time and at various points um
people have said uh including leading
officials that something could be close
and then hasn't come to fruition so it's
hard to read too much into either what
Benjamin Netanyahu is saying or the um
these denials by um Hamas I mean my
sense talking to somebody uh over the
last week who's familiar with the
negotiations is that you know the
process is very intense it is certainly
happening um the one of the big problems
is actually around communication because
you have katar uh which hosts the
political offices of Hamas acting as
mediators um but certainly the isi media
it's being suggested it can take
anything up to 2 days for messages from
the Israelis and responses to come back
from um Hamas so it's clearly very very
difficult but it seems that that
possibility does remain on the horizon
of a possible uh release and potentially
um a large number but beyond knowing
that the discussions it seems have been
continuing up until this point I don't
think we can speculate much more okay
thank you for now Tom bitman in
Jerusalem for us well now let's bring
you a special report from our
International editor Jeremy Bowen who
assesses what could happen next in Gaza
and in
Israel the beds were full when mosab
soier was brought in wounded gaza's
Medics have to
improvise and a photo of premature
babies at chifa the main hospital in
Gaza swaddled to stay alive after their
incubators stopped working when the
power ran out all born in the cruelty of
War
war in the other Hamas Israel Wars it
would be time for a ceasefire by now and
back to the same uneasy status quo until
the next
explosion news teams can't cross into
Gaza so they come to stot the nearest
Israeli town to look in perhaps the
biggest question is what happens in Gaza
the day after who's going to be in
charge Israeli
occupi an international Force
Palestinians if so which
Palestinians This Time It's Different
the cost in lives from the Hamas attacks
to Israel's response has thrust the
conflict into unknown territory with
Israel on the attack prime minister
Netanyahu rejected America's day after
plan the US wants the Palestinian
Authority Rivals to Hamas to run Gaza
after the fighting and then a
Palestinian State alongside Israel
Netanyahu opposes Palestinian
Independence and wants Israel to control
security Danny atom once the Israeli spy
Chief said that's why the Prime Minister
snubbed Israel's most important Ally
Israel should not stay too long in the
Gaza Street one
secondly it will not be able to leave
the Gaza Strip unless all the abduct are
in our hands back in a peaceful
situation and we won we succeed Hamas we
won the war against Kamas now there is a
need to Define what does it mean exactly
to to to win I Define it as the collapse
of Hamas as a body as
organization ER losing
its ER a chain of
command Israelis are united behind their
army but not their prime
minister these demonstrators outside his
office in Jerusalem believe he is
pandering to the Hardline Jewish
nationalists who keep him in power
another big question for Israelis is the
future of their prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu he was a divisive figure
before the 7th of October and since then
a lot of Israelis have started to blame
him for for the security and
intelligence and Military
errors that allowed Hamas to attack with
such devastating
consequences there's anger that after
Hamas killed and abducted so many mostly
Israeli civilians military and
intelligence Chiefs accepted their share
of the blame and the Prime Minister did
not and pressure is growing for a
ceasefire in exchange for
hostages what is fighting Hamas okay of
course the the the Hamas needs to be
taken down okay but the question of how
to do it is also a significant question
and before I want to kill one single
terrorist I want each and every one of
these people home I want the
10-month-old baby
home I want that the 86-year-old home I
want that more than I want dead
terrorists once they're home we can
finish the job the pain and hatred
Unleashed since the 7th of October might
overwhelm all those who still believe in
peace not permanent
War almost every day in the West Bank
they bury more Palestinians killed in
Israeli raids this side of the occupied
Palestinian territories is becoming the
war's next
Battleground the only answer Western
leaders say is to revive the two-state
solution independent Palestine alongside
Israel a failed idea that survives only
as a slogan
Sab sidam an adviser to the Palestinian
president has heard it all before I
think it's empty it's meaningless if it
continues to be this way if you want to
do things don't just walk uh don't just
talk just you need to walk the talk and
you need to implement things if we
continue with this uh slogan earing
without any results whatsoever we're
getting
nowhere when this war started Joe Biden
warned Israel not to be blinded by r
as America was after the 9/11 attacks by
alqaeda now Israel's tactics are
alarming the Americans they reiterate
support for Israel but say too many
Palestinians have been killed by the war
machine they helped Israel
build inside Gaza Israeli military
sensors say we can't show the faces of
soldiers we filmed senior Western
diplomats firm Israeli allies told the
BBC that ending the war and dealing with
the aftermath will be difficult and
messy the wall between Jerusalem and the
West Bank is a monument to the death of
the last peace
process so what do we know well events
since the attacks of October the 7th
have shown that this conflict is not
something that Israel can manage and the
rest of the world can ignore there's
also the history of a century of
conflict between Arabs and Jews for
control of this land and that shows that
there's no military
solution so if the current Bloodshed
doesn't lead to a new and serious
attempt to make peace then there'll be
more Wars for more
Generations but War hardens hearts in
Gaza today in a brief pause thousands
more Palestinians fled the Israeli
offensive jery bow BBC News Jerusalem",20231113

Intensive Care Unit had been struck

bombardment from Israel overnight the
country has vowed to wipe out Hamas
thousands of Palestinian civilians have
been killed in the process some of the
big biggest fears remain for those who
sought shelter in gaza's hospitals
Israeli forces say they're clashing with
Hamas fighters who they claim are in
bases underneath the buildings the
Israelis say they're not targeting
hospitals or civilians one doctor in the
south of Gaza described what it was like
for his colleagues in the north at the
biggest Hospital in the territory the
situation hospital now are very critical
uh nothing happened like this before
there is direct uh targeting of the
hospital hospital buildings so our
colleagues there they barely communicate
with other with outside Community they
feeling that that like they are facing
death without any help and support the
Israeli military says today it will move
out more than 30 newborn babies from the

a few days ago doctors have said the
neonatal intensive care unit has stopped

7th Hamas took more than 200 hostages
during their attacks on the 7th of
October once again in the city of Tel
Aviv families of the kidnapped called on
the Israeli government to do more to try
to secure their release I came here to
to shout for my kidnapped parents which
are already 35 days not here with us
kidnapp in Gaza we don't know their
situation and we need them to be
released immediately back in Gaza the
hospitals overwhelmed with dire warnings
of what could happen next Nick beak BBC
News
Jerusalem and Nick joins us now from
Jerusalem Nick evacuating babies from
alifa is not going to be an easy task is
it good morning v no it won't be I mean
trying to move some of the youngest
patients from intensive care is a very
delicate process at the best of times
but we've got to remind ourselves that
this Hospital which is the biggest in
Gaza is right on the front line of the
fighting now the ashifa hospital has
seen Fierce clashes between Hamas and
Israel and so what they're trying to do
today is extremely difficult we haven't
got a huge amount of detail about what
will take place Israel says that it
wants to help in the evacuation of the
the babies who've been in the neonatal
unit which apparently has lost lost
electricity there are reports that
already two babies have died the BBC was
sent a photograph uh late last night
which appeared to show more than 20
babies who are wrapped up and have been
placed on a hospital bed and the the
Medics who sent the photo basically said
that these these babies desperately
needed oxygen and that they've been not
able to have that in the hours before
the photo was taken and they say this
illustrated The Urgency of the situation
speaking to people in the hospital was
difficult but last night we did get a
sense that it was not quite clear how
this operation would take place so
certainly we wait and of course lots of
other people wait to see what exactly
will happen this morning with this
attempted evacuation of these of these
babies it's reported 37 babies are there
and needed to be moved to safety of
course the the head of the hospital the
head of surgery says actually the
priority should be resuming power to the
unit where they were being cared for
that would be the best thing for these
young patients Nick thank you very much

TFmkYheXQb8,Israel-Gaza war summit in Saudi Arabia - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel-Gaza war summit in Saudi Arabia - BBC News.jpg,"same time Arab and Muslim leaders
they're Gathering today in Saudi Arabia
to discuss the Israel Gaza conflict
schedule Summits of the Arab League and
the organization of Islamic cooperation
have been merged in response to the
situation in Gaza well that's the scene
in Riad Let's Take You There live now
with our security correspondent Frank
Gardner who's there and Frank just talk
us through what we might expect to hear
from this Summit what will they want to
achieve
today right well this is an extra
ordinary event in the sense that I can't
think of a similar event that has
brought together 57 Muslim nations
together with the Arab League at a time
like this it's been called an emergency
Summit although one militant group in
Gaza has said well it's hardly an
emergency Summit if it's taking place 35
days into the war nevertheless they are
going to try to come up with a unified
response which the gist of which is
going to be a call for an immediate
ceasefire in Gaza and more humanitarian
Aid an end to Israeli occupation of
Palestinian territories but behind the
scenes what's really interesting is what
Arab ministers are telling me they don't
want to be quoted personally on it but
the stuff they're saying is really quite
worrying I think for the West which is
that they are accusing the West
specifically the United States but also
the UK of double standards of hypocrisy
they're saying you the West condemned
Russia for its killing of civilians in
Ukraine yet when it comes to Gaza that
condemnation is either muted or pretty
absent and interestingly the deputy
Secretary General of the Arab League has
given an interview to a Saudi newspaper
in which he says actually Russia and
China understand this region better than
the West does now he doesn't speak for
everybody here obviously but that's a
worrying Trend I think there is a
feeling of Despair that the West is not
doing enough to rein in what's going on
in Gaza this horrendous Rising death
toll of civilians um and don't forget
that the West has got a lot of bases
here the Americans have got military
bases in Kuwait in Oman in the Emirates
and so on but you speak to delegates
from those countries and they're really
quite embarrassed at The Stance of the
West on this they look most of the
countries coming here they're not
particularly fond of Hamas I mean Iran
is here they are the Iranian delegation
is here I've Just Seen president Ibrahim
RI walk past me a few minutes ago um and
that's unusual in itself for him to come
to Saudi Arabia but most of them are not
particularly fond of Hamas but all of
that is on the back burner compared to
the enormous anxiety and angst that
people are feeling at this Rising death
toll and there's something else which is
a concern that are on the streets and in
the cafes and in people's living rooms
there is a rising anger here in this Reg
region at this death toll at the fact
that the West seems to be incapable of
stopping the Carnage in Gaza and people
worry that that could get out of control
and lead to
radicalization and Frank many people
will know that organizations including
the UN have been trying to come to some
sort of consensus or agreement on what
its response would be to the conflict
between Israel and Gaza what hopes are
there that this Summit will be unified
aligned in issuing a respon that states
the position of the members there at
that
Summit well they're going to have to go
for the lowest common to nominator you
know the Iranians are going to want to
push further I think than the Saudis
will so they're not not everybody's
going to get exactly what they want so
president IIM RI the Iranian president a
few hours ago as he left Teran airport
he said this isn't a time for talking
this is a Time for Action that's not not
necessarily how um people in the
conservative governments in this region
feel because they are very worried about
escalation remember that Iran supports
what's known as proxy militias the
houthis in Yemen Hezbollah in Lebanon
various militias in Syria and Iraq those
are not supported by Saudi Arabia and
its Gulf Arab allies so there are
differences of opinions which is why I
think they're going to go for as I say
the lowest common denominator which is
to say stop stop the fighting have a
ceasefire immediately not just a
humanitarian Paws but a ceasefire get
more humanitarian Aid in and pursue a
long-term solution to the Palestinian
Israeli question they want to see an end
to Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territories they're saying otherwise
this is just going to go on in an
endless cycle of violence Frank as
always good to have you there thank you
that's Frank Gardner our security
correspondent live in Riad we'll be back

developments as far as that Summit is
concerned",20231111

medical facility that's the alifa
hospital has been forced to suspend
operations because it has run out of
fuel that comes amid reports of
intensified fighting close to a number
of hospitals in the territory overnight
the BBC has heard from a doctor at the

units had been hit separately though he
says because of fuel shortages two
patients who are on ventilators have
died one of them he says was a baby

Organization there are currently 130
babies on incubators in Gaza 45 of them
are believed to have been at the alifa

don't have water we don't have even the
food and and we are afraid the in the
middle of the night we don't we lost the
electricity to the main ICU and to the
newal ICU and our engineer during their
walk to the uh to maintain this issue

he got paralyzed we we don't we don't
want to have any uh outbreaks due to
this dead bodies who are outside the
main refrigerator it is not working more
because we don't have a fuel to run this
generator this is that issue
now well Israel's military has been
closing in on Northern Gaza the purple
areas on this map show the approximate
location of soldiers as fighting ramps
up in Gaza City well the international
charity msf Medan Frontier says that
unless there is a ceasefire alifa and
other hospitals will turn into
graveyards they say Israel has
repeatedly accused Hamas of using alifa
to conceal an underground Command Center
but Hospital staff have denied it
meanwhile in an interview with the BBC
the French President Emanuel macron has
called for Israel to stop killing babies
and women in Gaza Now France like the UK
has prescribed Hamas as a terror
organization with the details here's our
correspondent Nick
beak this was Israel's aerial attack on
Gaza overnight an unrelenting barrage
like most Knights over the past 5 weeks
Israeli forces have now surrounded Gaza
City's major hospitals where they say
Hamas have built headquarters
underground but thousands of patients
and those just trying to seek shelter
are stranded on what is now a Frontline
of the fighting The Red Cross says
hospitals in Gaza have reached a point
of no return France's president Emanuel
macron once again condemned Hamas but he
told the BBC that Israel a country he
called a partner and friend had no
justification for its continued bombing
of Gaza de
facto today civilians are
bombed de facto these babies the ladies
these old people are bombed and killed
there is no reason for that and no
legitimacy so we do urge Israel to stop
I just remind everybody international
law I call for a ceasefire and I will
urge them for a ceasefire for minute
against this fire in response the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said world leaders should be
condemning Hamas not Israel his
government said once again it was
targeting Hamas not
civilians meanwhile the families of
hostages taken by Hamas on October the
7th are desperate for their release Tom
hans's 8-year-old daughter Emily was
kidnapped he had this message for her Ro
waiting for her
um we know we're going we're going to
get you
back be strong every
day and uh wait we're coming to get you
we're coming to get you home we going to
bring you
home tens of thousands have been making
the journey South to what Israel tells
them is a safe place for their families
but it feels like nowhere in Gaza is
safe Nick beak BBC News
Jerusalem well a little while ago I
spoke to Nick beak who's in Jerusalem he
sent us this update the Israeli Defense
Forces have been holding uh a briefing
here today and journalists were able to
put to them some of the accounts that
are coming out out of the uh the alifa
hospital including the the very Vivid
account there we heard from the surgeon
and the Israeli position on this is that
Hamas has created the situation whereby
a hospital hital is in effect a
legitimate military Target so by that
the Israeli forces are saying that Hamas
has created this control and Command
Center Center underneath the hospital
from which it's directed operations and
has been planning atrocities on is
Israeli soil so that is what the
Israelis are saying they were also uh
really unwilling to be drawn on some of
the very Vivid accounts of what's been
happening in terms of civilians in the
in the crossfire the Israelis saying
that they've spent the last four weeks
trying to evacuate hospitals urging
people to move out of them but said that
Hamas has been holding patience and
other people basically as human Shields
and has been preventing them from
leaving saying that there have been
checkpoints that have been set up to
stop people moving out uh the the IDF
spokesperson though did concede that
there were thousands of people within
the courtyard of the Osa hospital so
that really gives you an indication of
just how perilous a state the the
civilians and other patients are who of
course moved to hospitals thinking
they'd be in one of the the safest
places in Gaza but as we've seen it
appears that no place within the
territory is
safe so our correspondent there Nick

2xvP4CWT0VA,French President Macron calls on Israel to stop killing Gaza's women and babies – BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\French President Macron calls on Israel to stop killing Gaza's women and babies – BBC News.jpg,"we've heard from the French President
saying that Israel must stop killing
babies and women in Gaza Emanuel macron
told the BBC in an exclusive interview
at the aliz palace that there was no
justification for the bombing saying
that a ceasefire would benefit Israel
while recognizing Israel's right to
protect itself he said we do urge them
to stop this bombing in Gaza he's been
speaking to the BBC's Europe editor Katy
Adler we've had weeks of Aid
organizations sounding the alarm about
Gaza and so you've now said that
humanitarian pauses in fighting aren't
enough and there needs to be worked
towards a ceasefire are you disappointed
that other world leaders aren't joining
you in that call like the us or the UK
no I hope they will and let's be clear I
mean I was one of the first leader to
call H prime minister and president of
Israel after the terrorist attack the
7th of October we clearly condemned this
terrorist attack and terrorist group and
Rec recognize the right of Israel to
protect itself and react but day one we
say that this reaction and the fight
against
terrorism because it is led by a
democracy should be compliant with
International rules all of war and and
humanitarian international
law and day after day what we saw is a
permanent bombing of civilians in Gaza
and I think
it's it's very important to say the
whole story but I I think this is the
only solution we have this is fire
because it's impossible to explain we
want to fight against
terrorism by killing innocent people
you've talked about the fight uh against
terrorism needing to be merciless is is
the word you Ed but not without rules
and you've just referred there to the
high loss of civilian life life in Gaza
do you think Israel is respecting those
rules the international rules that
you're referring to uh look in the very
first days it's clear that the emotion
The
Compassion um created a situation where
everybody was just close to Israel and
beging them and U sharing the pain and
we do share the pain and we do share the
willingness uh to got rid of terrorism
we we know what terrorism means in
France but I think there is no
justification precisely to attack
civilians what I would like just to
clarify with you are you saying that
Israel is guilty of breaking
International humanitarian
law potential war cries no I'm here look
I I think it's not the proper way to
approach the
question we do recognize their right to
protect
themselves and and one month after this
terrorist attack I think it would be not
the right way to deal with a a a partner
and friend just to say you will be
condemned and you are
guilty de
facto today civilians are
bombed de facto this babies ladies is
all people are bombed and killed there
is no reason for that and no legitimacy
so
we do urge Israel to stop I'm I'm not
here
to I'm not a
judge I'm a head of state I just remind
everybody international law I call for a
ceasefire and I will urge them for a
ceasefire for a minute against this
fire that was Emanuel macron well let's
bring in our panel Andrew fiser former
director of policy at the labor party
under jery Corbin and mo ay executive
director at the Georgetown Institute of
politics and public service interested
for you both for your reactions there to
what Emanuel macron had to say Andrew
I'll start with
you yeah uh look I think it's very
welcome that he's joined the majority of
world leaders we shouldn't forget who
are calling now for a ceasefire in this
conflict um and it leaves President
Biden and Richie sunak in the UK
increasingly isolated in not backing a
ceasefire we saw the UN you know over
120 countries uh backed a ceasefire only
a few I think 14 voted against the us
one of them um so this is really
important and in a significant shift and
look Emanuel macron is obviously a
diplomat ahead of state but the fact
that he's saying to Israel you have to
abide by international law is a clear
recognition that currently they're not
we've seen white phosphorus being used
in densely populated areas we've seen
the carpet bombing of Civilian areas um
you know we've seen a Siege imposed on a
civilian population um which all of
which are illegal under international
law it's very clear that Israel has not
acted within international law um in
this uh reaction to the terrible events
of the 7th of October so it's a
significant intervention from Emanuel
macron and I hope it has influence both
in the UK and in the US because at the
end of the day there is no military
solution to this it is going to require
a ceasefire and talks and a peaceful
settlement that the Palestinians and the
Israelis have been let down by their
leaders and by the international
Community for at least 30 years since
the last big serious attempt to try and
get there Mo with regards to the kind of
International Community do you think
other leaders will look at what Emanuel
macron had to say take on board those
comments and start to think they might
air theirs more
strongly uh perhaps I think a lot of the
world is still um
uh a lot of the world is really torn
they want to see Israel exercise its
right to self-defense they know that
Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization
and that it itself is uh acting against
the best interests of the people they
purport to represent Hamas itself is
working against the best interests of
the Palestinian people preventing many
of them from leaving uh using them as
human Shields and so you know I I think
a lot of the world is still trying to
Grapple with this I think people are
increasingly horrified by the scenes and
the images we are seeing of the
devastation in Gaza and of all of the
people who uh who died uh in as a result
of the military action I found it
interesting that the Israeli Ambassador
uh to the un uh used the opportunity to
attack the UN for accepting hamas's
propaganda some of it is propaganda and
i' take anything Hamas does with a with
a grain of salt but but at the same time
we are seeing these images for ourselves
we are seeing the devastation for
ourselves we know whatever the number is
too many civilians are being killed I'm
happy to see that the human that there's
now going to be a daily humanitarian
pause Israel seemed to be uh forced to
take that step by International pressure
the Biden Administration has been very
aggressive in pushing that but they do
need to take more steps in their
legitimate effort to eradicate Hamas uh
to protect the civilians and I'm not
sure they're doing that well right now",20231110

with the conflict between Israel and
Hamas President Biden has welcomed
Israel's decision to formalize brief
humanitarian pauses in the fighting in
Northern Gaza calling it a step in the
right direction the agreement came after
weeks of us pressure the Israeli defense
minister said the poses would not
interfere with with the with Israel's
military objectives meanwhile Health
officials in Gaza say they have been
Israeli air strikes on or close to
hospitals including the biggest in the
territory alifa the BBC has not been
able to verify the reports from the
Hamas run authorities but Israel's
military said earlier that its forces
were operating close to the shifa
hospital well let's speak to our Middle
East correspondent yolan Nell who's in
Jerusalem yoland what can you tell us
about these air strikes that Hamas run
authorities say happened close to to
hospitals in
Gaza well there's three hospitals in
Gaza City that are included in this
statement we also know that there has
been um other military action close to
the Indonesian Hospital which is further
north in the Gaza Strip um but in
particular if we look at the shiffer
hospital the biggest Hospital in the
whole of Gaza where of course there are
thousands of people who have been
Sheltering in the grounds as well as the
patients and the doctors who uh who
remain there um and are complaining that
they have you know very short on
supplies these are very difficult
circumstances in which they're operating
we know already that there has been
Fierce fighting very close to the
hospital in the past day the Israeli
military says it has been operating with
its Ground Forces backed up with air
support in that area um saying that that
is where Hamas had its military
headquarters and that there were in an
Intelligence Center there that was
important for the planning and the
execution of those deadly 7th of OCT
October attacks um now there are there
are videos that we're really not in too
much doubt about because they're from
several angles simultaneously inside
what is clearly um the shipper hospital
at night you can hear this sort of whiz
of a missile that hits in the courtyard
and then in one of the videos you see a
man um has been hit that he is covered
in blood in a later video you can see
there is a body on a stretcher with a
pool of blood next to it and uh what we
really don't know is you know what the
source of that missile fire was um I've
put in a call to the Israeli military
they said that they're checking if there
were any air strikes in that area
overnight and this is not the first time
that there have been attacks around the
Aliva hospital it's a point of interest
during this
conflict oh definitely and what we've
had from Israel in the past is they have
said quite clearly that they believe
that Hamas uses the shifer hospital
buildings within it and an underground
tunnel Network there um in order to act
as kind of command and control center it
is ultimately a focus of operations but
it's extremely complicated uh for the
Israelis that you have so many people
going there as they have done safely in
previous conflicts uh Sheltering there
that that has been of course a main
place to take the many many wounded in
uh in Gaza City to there's been intense
Israeli bombardment of Gaza City in
recent days and that has led to to more
patients being rushed into the shipper
hospital and the doctors and the staff
there uh deny that their premises are
used by
Hamas thank you very much yolan our
correspondent there in
Jerusalem Hamas ran Health Ministry says
that over 4,000 children have been
killed since the start of the war and

way universities have responded to the
conflict in the Middle East our
education correspondent Elaine Dunley
has been talking to students to hear
their
experiences we are seeing so much
intimidation so much hatred so much
abuse which Jewish students are get the
union of Jewish students they've been
inundated with incidents of
anti-Semitism there's been a significant
increase in Jewish students saying they
no longer feel safe at University there
are Jewish students reporting threats of
physical assault there are Jewish
students who are questioning whether
they should be outwardly displaying
their Jewish identity there are Jewish
students who are questioning whether
they should even be attending their
lectures on the phone there are images
and messages Jewish students have
received most are too graphic to show
it's calling for violence it saying
where should be violence towards
Israelis towards Jewish people and again
I can imagine these poor students who
are seeing these things these
postgraduate students are members of a

has replaced academic life fre free
palese they feel let down by the
university and say whilst they have been
offered mental health support the
conflict in Gaza has not had the same
response as other Wars uh when Russia
invaded Ukraine the University made a
clear and strong uh statement condemning
the Russian invasion of Ukraine
rightfully so it makes us wonder when
and why the university decides to act in
some cases of humanitarian crisis and
not in others in a statement the
University of Oxford says it's been
clear in calling for a peaceful solution
for the peoples of Israel and Palestine
universities play a critical role in
encouraging debate and freedom of speech
but with a conflict where words have
failed to describe the grimness or find
a solution managing discussions and
demos on campuses are difficult we want
to
recognize and ensure that the right for
All Views is is maintained and we create
a circumstance for those to be
articulated provided it's not violating
the law it's not inciting hatred when
people put our safe space at risk we
will act and I will do so not only to

half hour those new lines coming out
from the White House Israel agreeing to
4H hour military pauses in Northern Gaza
also information about two humanitarian
corridors to allow people to flee the
hostilities so let's head to Washington
let's talk to our state department
correspondent Barbara PL Usher and
Barbara tell us more then in terms of
what the Americans have been saying in
the last little
while what they have said is that
they've reached agreement with the
Israelis to have a 4-Hour pause every
day um in order to allow Palestinians in
Northern Gaza which is where the main
military operation is to flee safely to
the South and they Israel we have been
told would give a three-hour notice
every day when that pause would be uh
and the Palestinians if they wanted to
leave would be taking uh safe passage
corridors which reportedly have actually
been um operating for several days now
but now they would have um a cessation
of military operations um for them to
take those corridors safely to the South
so that's the that's the announcement um
they uh the White House is hoping to be
able to use such pauses to get more Aid
into Gaza um they're hoping to get up to
150 trucks daily of Aid that hasn't
happened yet and also ultimately um
perhaps to use pauses to um facilitate
the release of hostages now it was
reported uh previously that President
Biden had asked the Israeli Prime
Minister for a three-day pause uh in
order to facilitate hostage release but
also to get you know significant amounts
of Aid in um so he's just been asked if
that was indeed the case and he has said
yes in fact he asked Mr Netanyahu for
longer than a three-day pause and when
he was asked whether he was frustrated
with the Israeli Prime Minister he said
this has taken longer than I expected it
to um so you know read into that what
you like but this is definitely
something that the Americans have been
pushing uh relentlessly through the
president through their special Envoy on
the ground through the Secretary of
State to try to get uh not a ceasefire
uh but breaks in the fighting in order
to get Aid in and to help Palestinian
civilians get to Safe areas Barbara as
you were talking I know in the last few
minutes Joe Biden has talked to
reporters there at the White House
before heading off to the helicopter and
exactly as you were reporting there was
asked about that three-day pause for
Gaza and a pause much longer to try to
get hostages out so we will actually
play for viewers that clip here in just
a moment or two but quite clearly in
terms of the pressure from Washington on
Israel's prime minister it is
upping yeah I mean you have seen the
evolution of the the the rhetoric and
the pressure from uh from Washington
over the past month as the situation has
changed as the uh military operation has
led to the kill in of thousands of
Palestinians as the humanitarian crisis
has grown completely dire as the uh un
humanitarian officials said last week uh
there is no more life sustaining
functions in Gaza and so uh the
Americans while they support the Israeli
stance that there cannot be a ceasefire
at this point because they say that
would benefit Hamas allow it to regroup
they have really been pressing for a
break in the fighting in order to
address this dire situation to get a
significant amount of Aid in but also
again to try to get the hostages
released and there's been reports
floating around uh lately about perhaps
a deal in the making we can't confirm
that but those those talks are very
active so most definitely the pressure
for some kind of break in the fighting
longer than an hour or two which is what
Mr Netanyahu referred to in an interview
earlier this week long enough to
actually get something done uh has been
coming from the White House and from the
state department Barbara pleas user
there in Washington thanks very much for
that",20231109
FnxcXvv6lBM,What does the journey through the Gaza evacuation corridor look like? - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\What does the journey through the Gaza evacuation corridor look like - BBC News.jpg,"well as I mentioned we've also been
taking a closer look at the evacuation
Corridor south from the northern tip of
Gaza which has been opened once again
today and our reporter Merlin Thomas
from BBC verify has been looking at that
Corridor and what the journey South
entails Israel has been ordering
civilians in Northern Gaza to move South
for their safety as they continue their
offensive in the north but what does
that mean for civilians of Gaza well the
Gaza Strip is one of the most densely
populated areas on earth now there are
over a million people people living in
the northern part before this conflict
started and the Israeli military have
been telling people to move South using
this specific Road Salah it's one of the
two main arteries connecting the North
to the South and we've seen some of them
some of these people moving south as you
can see some of them are carrying White
Flags children men women carrying with
them all the possessions that they have
now this footage was filmed by the AFP
news agency on Monday they spoke to one
of those Guardians on the road about her
experience
it was so scary we saw tanks from both
sides we didn't see soldiers just tanks
we held our hands up and we kept walking
there were so many of us we were holding
White Flags it's true that we were
scared but finally we made it
through so how has the Israeli military
been telling them these are some of
those pictures of the mass drops of
leaflets now these white specks you can
see here are those leaflets dropping
down from the Israeli military onto the
ground and they had messages urging
locals to move to the South for their
own safety now they've also been posting
messages on X for example this one today
the Israeli military posted in Arabic
that the main road here for evacuation
the one we've just been talking about
would be open between 10: in the morning
and 4: in the afternoon local
time yesterday the Israeli military
posted a video on X showing the
civilians walking on salahadin road now
we've just paused this video here so so
you can see an Israeli tank in the
foreground we've managed to verify this
using the shape of the buildings and the
road composition as approximately 3 km
north of worthy Gaza the what the
Israelis consider to be the boundary
between the North and South of Gaza
we've also found this satellite imagery
taken yesterday showing some of the
stret of the road and if you look
closely you can see here the outlines of
people on the road moving down the road
down south but if you look elsewhere in
the image you can also see
the damage to the buildings and the
rubble and the debris that Spilled Out
onto the road and this is what those
people will have had to cross and
finally if you look here you can
actually spot an Israeli tank here too
right next to the road which these
people will have had to walk
past we've also been analyzing satellite
imagery captured on the 31st of October
and the 3rd of November and using both
of these we've been able to assess the
amount of damage on the road and the
buildings alongside it so every single
Dot here every single red dot here
represents damage of some kind to the
road whether that's craters on the road
to the tarmac of the road or buildings
damag close to the road we can't tell
exactly when this damage occurred but
let's take a closer look at these two
areas
here this one here you can see a crater
on the main road itself this is what
people will have had to
pass and this here you can see some
buildings here in the middle destroyed
and the debris that's scattered onto the
road that people again will have had to
cross
now we don't know how many people have
used this road to move to safety the UN
suggested that thousands have moved on
one single day but the question remains
as the fighting continues in the north
how many more desperate people will have
to make this
Choice Merlin Thomas from BBC verify
looking at that evacuation South and the
UN has estimated that one and a half
million people in Gaza are now displaced
well a little earlier I spoke to our
colleague rushi abalu our correspondent
inside Gaza he's in the southern part of
Gaza in Khan Unice and asked him whether
he had seen evidence of more people
moving south today thousands of people
arrived today since the opening hour was
a bit a little bit bigger from 9:00
until until 4:00 but this journey is
really miserable for the people I met a
couple of them today who arrived to this
Camp here in Naser Hospital people were
walking for about 3 4 kilometers because
there is no access for cars or any sort
of Transportation so the people have to
to walk I saw a father who's carrying
his son over his shoulder in In The Heat
Of The Sun uh which it's unusual weather
here in Gaza in in November and it's
really about 30 degree in Gaza but yes
People Under The Sun were walking
carrying their their kids there some of
their belongings if they can and they
made this journey into South why because
the fighting
in Gaza City is really intensified
taking very serious fight near the alotz
hospital in in Gaza it's this it's a t
Hawa area it's a neighborhood in the
southwest of Gaza as the tanks Advance
very close to the hospital and people
there very few people remain in the area
and communication is really hard but I
was talking to someone who flee this
morning and he said it was a real gun
battle in the in the area most of the
buildings around that neighborhood from
the beginning of the
Israeli attack on on Gaza following the
Hamas crossb attack this area was
heavily bombed from Air for days and now
it's been bombed from sea and from
artillery units in the ground the the
picture that I saw is really showing
hundreds of targets has been like
destroyed in this building this area is
considered you know the most of the
healthy people they live here it's it's
quite a new area that was built 25 years
ago most of the buildings are seven
story building like compound in the area
most of the building were hit either
completely flatten to the ground or hit
some of the great damage to some of the
building the fighting also intensified
near Beach camp Beach camp is the only
refugee camp in Gaza City with about 60
70,000 people live in that camp most of
them were left but people were still
there and people were many bodies are
under their houses according to health
ministry here fighting and that
direction is north west of Gaza it's all
around the coastal the coastal road
where all of the fighting is going on
but also the tanks are advancing from
another another position which is south
of the city so now most of the tanks are
surrounding significant part of the Gaza
City and they are advancing High
into the AL hospital where about 14,000
people are taking the hospital as
shelter as well as 100 patient yesterday
the hospital said that they can't move
people they can't move patient from the
hospital because there is no Road around

damaged",20231109

there's no food or drinking water for
the children and that Israel has bombed
the
bakeries
Israel says that 50,000 Palestinians
moved South in Gaza yesterday when it
promised safe
passage but during the day deadly
Israeli air strikes were reported across
the length of the strip the Hamas run
authorities now say that more than 10
and a half thousand people have been
killed the UN Secretary General says the
civilian death toll in Gaza shows
something is clearly wrong with Israeli
military operations but also Al that
Hamas is using people as human Shields
meanwhile the un's human rights
commissioner visiting the region is
accusing both Israel and Hamas of war
crimes after G7 top diplomats voiced
their concerns at a meeting in Japan
attention is also beginning to turn to
the post-war future the US Secretary of
State Anthony blinkin said there should
be a United Palestinian L government for
Gaza and the West Bank as a step towards
Palestinian
statehood uh it's also clear that Israel
cannot occupy Gaza um now the reality is
that there may be uh a need for some
transition period uh at the end of the
conflict but it is imperative that um
the Palestinian people uh be Central to
uh to governance uh in uh in Gaza and in
the West Bank as
well but for now this conflict rages on
Hamas be hugely outgunned but its
Guerilla tactics on the streets of Gaza
could keep the war with Israel going for
months to
come yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem well more on this the French
government is hosting a conference in
Paris to discuss ways of getting
humanitarian Aid to people in Gaza
delegations from several Arab nations
are attending but Israel will not be
represented and its main backer the
United States is only sending a lowlevel
team well let's go live now to Paris and
our correspondent Hugh scoffield Hugh
let's just start with the conference
itself what is France hoping to
achieve well it's hoping that this will
lead to some kind of breakthrough in
getting Aid into Gaza um they're
assembling some very iminent people you
know the head of unra the relief agency
is going to be talking um um the head of
the International Red Cross will be here
briefing delegates on the situation um
and the hope is that they with the
delegations will come up with creative
ideas about getting Aid in about
establishing establishing field
hospitals uh getting fuel down into the
Gaza Strip and so on I have to say
there's a huge degree of skepticism
though about about this uh conference
which was hastily organized um in the
last few days and and it's really just a
kind of adjunct to an existing peace
Forum which president macron um had been
planning which will discuss a lot of
other issues such as global warming and
uh uh um Ai and so on and this was sort
of tacked on to the beginning because of
the pressing problem of Gaza but I don't
think there's a huge expectation that
it's going to lead to anything par
particularly significant but it does
send perhaps a message to Israel and
Israel isn't sending a delegation to the
conference and the French government has
talked about not wanting to offend the
Israeli
government yeah we need to be quite
clear that the Israelis are not sending
dation but primarily because they
weren't invited and that's not intended
to snub the Israelis the the idea was
that this would be a a conference of
countries that are interested in getting
Aid into to uh Gaza donor countries and
Israel obviously does not count among
them so um there's no intention of snubs
in either direction um but what is the
case I think is that this does have a PO
itical Dimension um the French
government President Ma in particular
has been accused by some here in France
many here in France of adopting a kind
of Nee pro-israeli um reaction and of uh
in the initial aftermath of the October
the 7th attacks you know coming down
very very very too firmly on behalf on
the side of of Israel and all of this
and there is pressure certainly from the
foreign ministry here to redress the
balance some somewhat and show that you
know France also shares the concerns of
the Arab world of the South um more
largely um and their concerns about
humanitarian difficulties in Gaza so
that does address that and does send out
a message and does send out a message
about how the world increasingly is
hoping for some kind of humanitarian
pause in the fighting yes thank you very
much that's our correspondent in Paris
Hugh scoffield well as Hugh mentioned
there there has been some skepticism
about the conference including from Aid
organizations and human rights groups
and we can now talk to Sasha deshmuk
who's the chief executive of Amnesty
International UK here in London Sasha
thank you very much for joining us so
Amnesty International has issued a
statement ahead of this conference
saying the focus should be on calling
for a
ceasefire yes we've welcomed the
International Community focusing on the
humanitarian situation in Gaza at this
conference we have said that a ceasefire
we believe is an important step that can
mean that there can be a chance for the
delivery of sustained and effective Aid
in Gaza there can be a chance for the
burying of the Dead there can be a
chance for the treatment of the many
many people wounded and also critically
during a ceasefire there can be an
intensification of
negotiations trying to ensure the return
of hostages which of course must also be
a critical Focus but do you understand
Israel's position because you've been
calling for a ceasefire but the Israeli
government says any pause in fighting
would benefit Hamas and it has a
responsibility to protect its
citizens well all states have a
responsibility to self-defense um of
their citizens they actually have that
as a duty but that Duty can never be
undertaken by committing War crime and
as you've reported um many experts
including the United Nations
commissioner have spoken now about war
crimes that have been conducted both by
Hamas but also by the Israeli
authorities I believe that a ceasefire
is critical in this situation um I
believe that it does provide would
provide an opportunity not only for the
delivery of critical humanitarian Aid in
a sustained way but also provide a
critical opportunity for a focus on the
hostages as well of course that hostage
taking is a terrible crime as well many
people watching might be wondering what
happens next because the United States
most countries are either calling for a
ceasefire or a pause in fighting what
can what more can be
done well I think within a ceasefire as
well as the delivery of humanitarian Aid
as well as a focus on the return of the
hostages critically also there needs to
be a focus on human rights and the
journey to a longer term solution which
I believe needs to be based on human
rights within a ceasefire we also need
to see um investigators from the United
Nations uh commission for human rights
from organizations such as Amnesty
International as well as the
international criminal court be allowed
access be allowed to actually give the
world truth about what has been
happening the crimes committed by both
sides but critically also what does it
then mean for there to be a human rights
solution a human rights based Journey
out of this conflict I believe it's only
with a focus on human rights that we're
going to see the end of what has been a
decades long crisis and also focusing
particularly on Gaza we need to remember
that the current situation which within
which we're calling for a ceasefire is
also been an intensification of a
16-year long blockade of Gaza that
action in and of itself is been an
illegal action thank you very much
that's Sasha deshmuk chief executive of
Amnesty International UK thanks for
joining us well for the latest on the
conflict let's go live now to our
correspondent Mark Len who's in southern
Israel and Mark as we've been reporting
there were about 50,000 people who left
Northern Gaza yesterday and the Israeli
military saying it's going to open a key
highway for people to leave once again
today what do we know about the movement
of people and how they're managing to
get out of Northern
Gaza well there is this Main Highway as
you say Katherine the salalen road which
which goes from the northern tip of Gaza
down uh down to the South and that is
the road that the Israelis are trying to
encourage civilians to take in order to
flee the most intense uh military uh air
strikes in the north of Gaza and the
Israeli Defense Forces say that 50,000
took that road yesterday that is
considered higher numbers than have
taken it if if confirmed uh the the
previous days um and the Israeli Defense
Force say that they it could indeed be
reopened again today there's been no
official confirmation but the likelihood
is that it would be reopened as the
Israelis try to get the civilians to
flee South but remember there are still
tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of
thousands who are still in the north uh
as the Israeli Defense Forces push
further into Gaza City now um the
Israelis say that Hamas has lost control
of Northern Gaza uh there was they say
an intense 10-hour battle yesterday to
take control of a Hamas stronghold um
and the offensive in into Gaza City
pushes deeper meanwhile there is some um
possible good news on on on the on the
hostages uh with the um with reports
that the Qatari government is mediating
for the release potentially of 12
hostages including some Americans uh the
Americans believe that 10 US Nationals
are still being held under Hamas
captivity uh and we understand that
those talks are ongoing and Mark we've
been talking so far in the program about
a possible ceasefire or pause in the
fighting the United States other allies
other isra other other allies of Israel
are calling for the same are we seeing
any sign of that from the government
there well certainly not a ceasefire
that the the Benjamin Netanyahu is ruled
out if unless there is a full release of
the hostages and that's very un likely
to happen what we're talking about
really is humanitarian pauses and pauses
in the fighting and yesterday the
Israeli military announced for the first
time that there would be a 4-Hour pause
in three large neighborhoods of Gaza
City uh in order for food and water to
be um to be reached by the civilians uh
but residents there saying that there is
such a shortage of food and water that
they were unable to get very much during
those those pauses but that was the
first time that there had been
apparently an official announcement from
inside Gaza City um meanwhile uh the you
what what what appears to be happening
are kind of more localized stoppages uh
in in in some isolated places on the
ground I don't think we're necessarily
going to get an official announcement
from the Israeli government about a
humanitarian pause I think it's going to
be more localized stoppages for people
to be able to access Aid uh so far um uh
yesterday we are told that 86 trucks uh
crossed from Rafa in Egypt into Gaza
carrying aid but that is still just a
drop in the ocean in terms of the needs
on the ground thank you very much that's

zhBM23x-nhE,Special report:  Inside Gaza with Israeli forces - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Special report  Inside Gaza with Israeli forces - BBC News.jpg,"tonight Israel's military is claiming
Hamas has lost control of the north of
the territory after weeks of Relentless
Israeli bombing Jeremy Bowen has been
with the Israeli defense forces inside
the territory while the BBC retained
editorial control of his reports the
sections featuring the Israeli military
have been cleared by the
IDF like young soldiers in many wars
Israeli troops looked excited not
apprehensive as they made their final
preparations to join Israel's invasion
of the Gaza
Strip they're moving in as the war
approaches a critical point their
colleagues already inside the strip have
surrounded Gaza City these men might be
part of the next stage locating Hamas
tunnels and fighting Street by Street
Israel's primee Minister promised his
country a mighty Vengeance against Hamas
but with so much Firepower what one
question is Israel following Joe Biden's
advice not to be blinded by rage to
defend itself but also protect the lives
of Palestinian civilians we went into
Gaza with the Israeli Army on condition
we didn't reveal their positions video
shot after they took us through the Gap
in the fence into Gaza though not this
script had to be submitted to their
military census we got out of the back
of an armored vehicle and walked into or
Wasteland after a month of air strikes
and more than a week of tanks and troops
every building I saw was damaged or
destroyed they wanted to show us what
they said was a Hamas weapons Factory in
this wrecked structure this is a scuba
diving equipment that's uh meant to come
from from SE from their land to our
land and they made drones that Dro bombs
he said in this Workshop places like
this he said originated the 7th of
October attacks but upstairs was a
family apartment the soldiers said it
was more proof that Hamas used civilians
as human Shields building bombs
underneath a bedroom used by children
the officer said habas not Israel was
responsible for civilian deaths we know
intelligence we know what we hit we know
the targets they're
approved by the by our Command it's that
I wake up and my my objective is to to
ruin the the city I aim for enemy an
enemy only and I use all in my power to
hit the enemy only so judging by the the
destruction here the enemy was
everywhere you'd say yes
yes Israel's strategic equation measures
the destruction and death it's brought
to Palestinians in Gaza civilians as
well as Hamas against the pain of its
own people
and the importance of making them feel
safe
again The overriding Impressions I have
from being here is first of all the
level of force that Israel has brought
to bear on the Gaza Strip a vast amount
of military power in
addition the level of Destruction
massive destruction thousands of homes
gone Israel says military necessities
self-defense be's view was different she
said it was because of Israel's
bombardment because nowhere was safe
because there was no food or drinking
water for the children and because
Israel had bombed the
bakeries Israel said 50,000 Palestinians
moved South after it promised safe
passage Hamas released more videos of
its fight against Israel in Gaza
streets it claims victories but but it
is vastly
outgun hanas cannot win a toe-to-toe
fight with Israel but guilla tactics hit
and run might drag The War Out for
months and force the seiz fire more
Israeli tanks were moving forward as we
left the Gaza Strip this evening
Israel's Western allies support The
Invasion but America's reminders about
the laws of war and the pressure for
humanitarian pauses suggest even
Israel's closest allies are quizy about
this War's human
catastrophe Jeremy boen BBC news
Gaza Israel clearly tightening its grip
on the territory and we'll hear from
Jeremy uh with a little bit more in a
moment but a warning tonight from the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin
saying there should be no Israeli
occupation of Gaza when the current
conflict comes to an end he was speaking
after a meeting of G7 foreign ministers
in Japan and he called for the territory
and the West Bank here to be United
under the Palestinian
Authority it's also clear that Israel
cannot occupy Gaza um now the reality is
that there may be uh a need for some
transition period uh at the end of the
conflict but it is imperative that um
the Palestinian people uh be Central to
uh to governance uh in uh in G
and in the West Bank as well Anthony
blinkin speaking earlier today let's
return to Jeremy who's there now in
southern Israel but as we've seen has
been with Israeli forces inside Gaza
Jeremy I don't think there's anyone who
believes the Hamas are going to win this
war clearly the Americans are looking
towards the end game when the fighting
is over and that was a very clear
warning how do you think things could
pan out once the conflict comes to an
end
first of all don't forget Hamas probably
have a different definition of victory
to Israel if they can keep fighting as
far as they're concerned they won't be
beaten I think that once the fighting
stops through whatever means then
perhaps the really difficult part starts
because the Palestinians will still be
there the problem will still be there
who will run the territory the Israelis
have said Mr Netanyahu the prime
minister has said they want to retain
security control so that implies some
kind of Palestinian governance which
Palestinians would like to do that on
Israel's say so the Americans believe
the only way forward is to move towards
that old idea the old failed idea up to
now of a two-state solution in other
words independent Palestine alongside
Israel now this current Israeli
government is viscerally opposed to such
an o which would for example mean that
it would have to pull back settlers from
the West Bank where at the moment the
settlers it backs are pushing very hard
against the Palestinians and the
Palestinians say that they're running

live to you from Southern Israel just
close to the Gaza Strip we're about 3
kmers a mile or so away from Gaza where
the Israeli military offensive is
intensifying there has been a very
intense night again of uh Israeli
shelling and Israeli air strikes in Gaza
and focusing on Gaza City where Israel's
defense minister now says that the
Israeli troops are operating in the
heart of Gaza City which the minister
claims is the heart of
terrorism the area is one of the most
densely populated parts of the territory
and has frequently been hit by the
Israeli military in the last month it
says it is targeting Hamas which Israel
along with many other countries
considers to be a terrorist
organization in this bulletin we will
bring you the developments from right
across this region from here in Israel
from inside Gaza and from Lebanon as
well but we'll start this hour with the
latest developments from Middle East
correspondent your land
now flares hanging in gaza's night sky
are ominous warnings of incoming Israeli
fire but increasingly the Israeli Prime
Ministers being pressed for a pause in
fighting I did ask you for p yest
waiting this is a key moment Israeli
troops are now said to be in the heart
of Gaza City closing in on this
stronghold of Hamas ministers say
the destruction in Gaza is already
immense with entire neighborhoods
flattened and the civilian death toll is
rapidly mounting the World Health
Organization says an average of 160
children are killed here every day
nothing justifies the horror being
endured by the civilians in
Gaza people in Gaza are dying in their
thousands and those alive are suffering
from trauma disease lack of food and
water the level of death and suffering
is hard to
Fathom dozens were reportedly killed by
Israeli air strikes yesterday in the
southern gazen towns of hunis RAF
andal in hunis Dr aad Shakura at Nasa
hospital was on duty in the emergency
room when he was told that his two
children aged five and seven his mother
his brothers their wives and their
children were killed in a
strike what did these children do wrong
what crime did they commit to deserve
tons of bombs on their heads tons of
explosives on their
heads Israel says that it does what it
can to avoid civilian deaths in Gaza and
that it's acting to eliminate Hamas it
says it's destroying dozens of tunnel
shafts used by its
Fighters the Israeli Prime Minister
continues to reject international calls
for a ceasefire but now says he'll
consider tactical little pauses in
hostilities he added that Israel would
have overall security responsibility
indefinitely after the war's
over yesterday marked exactly one month
since the deadliest day in Israel's
history vigils took place for those
killed in Hames surprise crossborder
attacks and some 240 women men and
children
still being held
hostage I'm waiting and demanding they
do whatever it takes to bring everyone
home safely this is the time to do
things that have not been done before to
ensure their safe
return there's huge pain and anguish on
both sides in this war and there are
many more difficult days ahead yoland
Nell BBC News
Jerusalem
well it's been a very busy morning of
course uh on in this military offensive
that is now more than one month old
let's take a look at some of the uh most
recent developments President Biden said
he had asked the Israeli Prime Minister
uh to Benjamin Netanyahu for a pause in
the fighting potentially for three days
in order for progress on the hostages Mr
Netanyahu has said there will be no
ceasefire but he did raise the
possibility of what he called tactical
little pauses in hostilities
Israel's Minister for strategic Affairs
has said his country has no plans to
govern Gaza but will ensure it remains
demilitarized after the
conflict the number of deaths in Gaza
since the outbreak of hostilities has
risen to over 10,000 according to the
health Ministry there that is controlled
by Hamas with more than
2,700
missing and the World Health
Organization says that among the
casualties 160 children on average are
being killed each day in the war in Gaza
well while the military offensive grinds
on and the humanitarian suffering of
course intensifies foreign ministers
from the G7 the uh group of most
industrialized nations in the world have
been meeting in Japan they have just
issued a joint communic and the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has
also been speaking in the last few
minutes let's listen to what he's had to
say our first Focus here in Tokyo was
the crisis in the MD East uh yesterday
evening I had an opportunity to brief my
colleagues on my travel through the
region as well as extensive engagements
by President Biden and our entire
National Security
team uh the G7 ministers reaffirmed our
staunch support for Israel's right and
obligation to defend itself and seek to
ensure the attacks of October 7th can
never happen again in accordance with
International humanitarian
law we had in-depth discussions about
the steps that we are taking to address
urgent needs on the ground
we all agreed that humanitarian pauses
would Advance key objectives to protect
Palestinian civilians to increase the
sustained flow of humanitarian
assistance to allow our citizens and
foreign Nationals to exit and to
facilitate the release of
hostages I brief my colleagues about my
conversations with Israeli leaders on
pauses and on concrete steps to minimize
harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza
and to stop extremist violence in the
West
Bank the US Secretary of State speaking
there while Britain's foreign secretary
James cleverly is also at that meeting
in Tokyo he was asked about his reaction
to the current death toll in Gaza and
whether he believed that Israel's
military response was
proportionate well Israel was uh on the
receiving end of a brutal terrorist
attack and they have every right indeed
a responsibility to the people of Israel
to ensure that they are able to uh
protect themselves and uh we speak about
this military operation uh we get clear
assurances from Israel that they are
acting in accordance with humanitarian
law in order to protect themselves from
Attack what we of course want to see is
ultimately a peaceful two-state uh
solution and we of course always make
clear that any actions that Israel take
should be in pursuit of that ultimate
aim and they should avoid doing anything
which undermines that that will remain
the UK government's
position James cleverly there referring
to the two State solution that many will
believe is even more distant and perhaps
even Dead uh after this military
offensive it's long been uh seen to be
an unachievable goal Let's uh see
whether this current conflict
reinvigorates the idea of a long-term
political settlement of a two-state
solution uh Israel and a Palestinian
State well as well as the G7 ministers
who are there in Tokyo our own sha Khal
our BBC correspondent in Tokyo is there
and she's covering the G7 foreign
ministers meeting and she can join us
live now from Tokyo Shima uh just tell
us about the joint communic that's been
issued and what has come out in the last
few minutes from the G7 foreign
Minister's
meeting well I think the G7 foreign
ministers wanted to present a united
front not only on the Middle East
conflict which overshadowed events which
was at the heart and the center of the
discussions today but also on the
ongoing war in Ukraine and the security
concerns in the Indo Pacific
specifically China economic coion um the
tension between China and Taiwan and of
course um Russia's uh relationship with
pongyang and pyongyang's nuclear Arsenal
Ambitions remember this is a very
different landscape that the foreign
ministers are dealing with than the G7
leaders were dealing with when they met
in Hiroshima in May right now their
ultimate message is yes the conflict in
the Middle East is overshadowing events
but we continue um a message for Russia
really that they say they continue um to
be committed to sanctions on Russia and
for Ukraine's right to defend itself on
the Middle East again I think because
there were background differences in the
ceasefire um
or proposals for a ceasefire by some G7
countries Anthony blinkin was quite
clear that they are now United um on a
no Seas far essentially um still
supporting Israel for no Seas far but
calling for humanitarian poses I was
actually speaking to um the British
foreign secretary um James cleverly um
earlier and he said that essentially
they're pushing for um these
humanitarian pauses to to ensure the
safety of hostages to ensure the safety
um of multinationals um in Gaza and to
get Aid uh to those who needed the most
what we don't have uh mark from the g74
ministers communicate is detail where're
it's really lacking on detail on how
these pauses are going to be um are
going to be conducted when they're going
to be conducted especially as you
reported not very far from where you are
the bombardment continues and the
Israeli strikes continue uh on Gaza I
put it to um James cleverly as well uh
Benjamin netanyahu's remarks about
Israel continuing um or taking security
responsibility in Gaza and how that
could be reinterpreted as um reoccupying
Gaza and he said this again he agreed
with um Anthony blinkin there saying
this is a transition period it is
inevitable that the forces on the ground
will take charge of of security in Gaza
but ultimately what they're calling for
um is Palestinian leadership Palestinian
governance and as Anthony blinkin put it
a few minutes ago a joint Palestinian
governance in Gaza and ultimately in the
West
Bank okay sh in Tokyo thank you very
much indeed watching that G7 meeting in
Tokyo that may also be talking about
what comes next in the future of Gaza
once if and when Hamas is eliminated as
Israel aims now the other part of this
region where there is increasing concern
is Northern Israel and and Lebanon the
Border there between the two countries
where there has been increased uh
crossborder fire in recent days 16 uh
Lebanese uh Rockets were said to have
been fired against Israel in the last
couple of days and Israel responded
militarily with very heavy strikes and
Israel's prime minister has said that
Hezbollah is starting to take part in
this war but they would be making the
mistake of a lifetime if they did so
well uh hezbollah's Deputy leader uh the
deputy secretary of state as he's called
of of of Hezbollah shik Naim km has been
giving a very rare interview to the
BBC's Chief International correspondent
Ola Garin in which he has warned of the
real risk of a wider war in this region
in his words saying that uh the region
cannot bear much more of this Israeli uh
military offensive and AA spoke to him
in Lebanon and she began by asking him
about the likelihood of a wider regional
conflict if the aggression increases and
continues at this space very dangerous
and very serious developments could
occur in the region no one would be able
to stop the repercussions
for sure there is a danger of a wider
Regional War breaking
out how realistic do you think is that
danger now how close is that
danger the danger is
real because Israel is increasing its
aggression against civilians and killing
more women and
children is it possible for this to
continue and increase without bringing
real danger to the region
we know that Hezbollah has weapons that
can reach deep inside Israel but if you
were to use them Israel can respond with
air power and it has promised a response
of unimaginable magnitude and many
Lebanese could die are are you willing
to risk
that it's normal and natural and we are
ready to pay the price
but the question is can Israel pay the
price this is a question for Israel with
the crossborder attacks that you have
been carrying out over the past month
isn't there a risk of dragging Lebanon
into war even
unintentionally a war that Lebanon can't
afford and for which there appears to be
absolutely no support
here it's the right of any lianes to be
afraid of a war this is normal nobody
likes
War but who is responsible for this war
did we start it or did
Israel what's most important is that the
Israelis were the one who started this
aggression against Gaza in this hideous
way with respect Hamas started by
attacking Israel on the 7th of October
and killing more than 1,400 Israelis
most of whom were civilians women and
children so this round of warfare began
with Hamas not with
Israel what should the Palestinians do
to regain their freedom and their
land this operation was
inevitable and it was an act of
resistance and of Defense some would say
that the attacks on October 7th have
been a disaster for the Palestinian
cause because the result has been
massive destruction in Gaza the killing
of thousands of civilians including more
than 4,000 children haven't the attacks
actually
backfired I think what happened was a
great achievement for the Palestinian
resistance now the massacres committed
by Israel are mobilizing the
Palestinians more and more to cling to
their
land and they know there is no solution
accept continued
resistance but you say you consider the
attack a great success but 10,000
Palestinians have been killed since this
attack and who knows how many more will
die who killed the
Palestinians it was the crazy Israelis
would you intervene more militarily
would there be a stronger military
reaction from Hezbollah if Hamas is in
danger of being beaten in
Gaza this is a matter for the future and
what happens in the
battle it's something we do not talk
about in the
media but we have our plans for more
confrontation and resistance depending
on what the circumstances
require or agaran speaking to the deputy
leader of Hezbollah there about the real
risk of a wider Regional War",20231108

tonight from the defense minister that
his troops have now battled their way
into Gaza City thought to be the
stronghold of Hamas the fighting which
is Street to street is taking place just
a few kilometers off in the darkness
behind me across the border it's exactly
a month since Hamas killed 1,400 people
in coordinated attacks on Southern
Israel planned in Gaza and today
Israelis attended vigils lit candles and
held them minut silence in remembrance
of those who died well Israel's bombing
raids have intensified in recent days in
the city of Khan Unis in southern Gaza
dozens of Palestinians are reported to
have been killed and now the fighting is
said to be in the heart of Gaza City our
first report tonight is from Jeremy
boen Hass released video of their men
fighting in the streets of Gaza they
know they can't win a pitched battle so
they're using hit run tactics that will
intensify as Israel's tanks and troops
move deeper into Gaza City after an
Israeli striking hanun Southern Gaza
they were digging for survivors the town
is in the area Israel has told
Palestinians to go to stay safe but
nowhere safe Israel says this is
self-defense Palestinians call it
genocide Ahmed ayash had 27 members of
his family inside the house when it was
hit this is The Bravery of the So-Cal
Israel they show their might and power
against civilians babies inside kids
inside and elderly it is the mighty
Vengeance promised by Israel's prime
minister when Hass attacked a month
ago in Tel Aviv at the empty table set
for the hostages in Gaza friends and
families am mounting a 24-hour vigil the
national trauma Israel suffered a month
ago is not lessening in fact they're
reassessing everything not just
relations with the Palestinians but also
with Arab countries they thought they
were getting closer to and who are now
condemning everything they're doing in
Gaza and there's the issue of the safety
of Jews in places around the world where
the Palestinians get a lot of
support so even though Israel is more
secure than a month ago many more people
are out and about a real sense of threat
not just from Gaza remains Israel
insists that force not negotiations will
bring the hostages
back Shanny Luke's family hoped she was
a hostage until she was confirmed dead a
week ago friends filled her family home
with her portraits she was at the music
festival that was attacked we got this
horrible video that was shown all over a
friend of us sent it to us and he said I
I recognize Shani this is on on on the
truck on the pickup truck this is where
she was faed down yeah she was in a
weird position looks
unconscious Blood on the head and people
were the pickup was driving in inside
the Gaza Strip and people were shouting
and celebrating and spitting on her and
it was it was terrible and and we were
just in shock do you think Israel's
doing the right thing now I don't know
what the end will be because there are
really many civilians in innocent
civilians also there in in AA and they
they shouldn't suffer but U but there
needs to be something radical with the
terrorism be done because if not we will
be back in this in the next few years
they will get the weapons again and they
will train
again Israel's pounding of Gaza has not
stopped neither has its rage
diminished Jeremy bow BBC News in
southern Israel
well as we've been hearing Israel is
claiming to have reached the heart of
Gaza City tonight let's talk to Paul
Adams who's live in Jerusalem Paul this
potentially then is a significant moment
in this
conflict Clive I think we can say that
the battle for Gaza City has definitely
begun we have seen images in the last
day or two that show that the Israeli
military is all around the city they all
the way down the coast they've cut it
off from uh the Southern Gaza Strip so
their attention now is focusing ever
more closely on that very very built up
area of Gaza City and its nearby refugee
camps I think what they're going to do
is Mount operations from their positions
on the edge into Gaza City to tackle
what they regard as one of hamas's major
strongholds the problem for them is that
in many of the targets they have in mind
many many thousands of Palestinian
civilians are still clustered and the
Israelis argue that Hamas is using some
of those civilians as human Shields we
saw some people on the move today
thousands perhaps making their way South
along the road uh towards relative
safety but many many remain and that is
going to be a problem and then the
question is when the battle for Gaza
City is done where do the Israelis go
then indeed okay Paul thank you Paul
Adams their live in Jerusalem",20231107

window on the walls from outside we
started to hear sounds and people
talking in Arabs outside shouting
albar we smelled things burning we heard
things
breaking we were
terrified and after 2 hours Ohad my
husband decided to go outside the safe
room and to shut the door on us this was
the only way to show to close the door

to earn time maybe the Army will come to
save us so all of us were
screaming but the Army was not at the K
boots after a few minutes one of them
pointed us with his gun and told me I

went out of the safe
room we saw Ohad sitting outside
bleeding

told us to go with him with the the
terrorists I tried to save my save my
baby I put the baby on oh had I thought
they would let me leave her there but

16
um you said they were missing they're
not missing they were kidnapped from
their safe home from the place that they
live in from their
beds on a Saturday
morning uh you know try and imagine
anyone try and imagine your children
sleeping in their beds waking up to an
alarm which is scary enough as it is
when you're alone at home then realizing
there are terrorists walking freely
outside and that was a situation um
about um an hour after the attack
started we started getting text messages
from other members of the community we
live in a small communal Community
kibuts
um saying that there are terrorists
walking outside fre and whichever was
just describing and the shabab that you
were talking about earlier and
um uh the boys told me that they hear
gunshots outside and I started
reassuring them it's the Army coming to
to save them
um and at a certain point uh they were
on the phone to me about two hours after
this it's all started and they they
whispered to me on the phone yil my
youngest he was 12 uh said said there's
people coming in people who was
whispering there's people walking in the
house someone broke into the house so
they were there on their Terri they yeah
they were alone in the SoCal safe room
like adults in in the safe room they
were having to take these decisions
themselves yeah well I was there with
them on the phone um but yes and their
father was in a different safe room and
I was in a different safe room and their
father was shot and they called you know
um his father their father called them
to to us to uh to get some help I tried
uh to get some help uh sent to him but
uh it was in vain all the houses in the
were at the same situation at the time
and uh as I said I heard I heard them
saying someone's broken in and two
minutes later I they I heard people
speak on the phone I heard people
speaking in Arabic and the door went
open and the last thing I heard my
youngest boy saying to me on the phone a
month ago that was my last call from him
he was begging for them not to take him
he said I'm too young you can take me
please don't take me I'm too young and
they took him um and as I said they're
not missing they were kidnapped from
their home you said
um imagine what it's like I can't
actually I've got two children myself
and I I can't imagine I can't imagine
what that's like
um it's beyond imagination hadass five
members of your family were
taken um your mother 80 and your niece
were murdered so you know that and you
yet you you you haven't had time to
grieve really because your your children
sah and Aras and their father of are all
missing
kidnapped what what do you what what do
you want the Israeli government to do
because Mr Netanyahu thinks that Force
is the best answer and he thinks there
should not be a humanitarian pause I
wonder what you think of
that I think one thing I'm a man I'm a
mother I'm not a political I can't give
give Solutions I can't give my point of
view about the act the Army act I'm a
mom I can say one thing I want my
children
back it's the only thing I can say
7 of
October my family break apart it's a
black day it's a hell of a
day five members of my family been
kidnapped two of
them been murdered already my mom she
was 8 years old wonderful sweetheart
warm dear lady and my niece she was a
miracle girl with a autism special needs
girl they've been murdered as you said I
don't have the time even to gri I didn't
even went to the funeral because I have
to fight for the one who's still
alive for my two children a as 12 years
old sweet sensitive fragile boy young
boy and my daughter Saha beautiful 16
years old girl te teager girl and their
father I have to fight for them and I
want them
back Hadas we're just going to pause for
a second I'm just going to say goodbye
to our viewers around the world who are
watching but I want to continue with our
UK viewers who are who are still with us
um
renana how how how do you how I mean
you're here it's really important to say
this you come under your own own steam
the three of you not without not with
the is government not not anyone's
urging a private initiation of the
parents of the children we have 32
children who were kidnapped we uh sort
of collected the children from the lists
and made our own group and uh decided to
initiate a visit and to approach anyone
who can help us get the Children
released
immediately um you know we we just say
kids are out of the game they shouldn't
be waiting for a deal they shouldn't be
and we're here um on this private
initiation we came here to meet with uh
qatar's Ambassador uh in the UK hoping
he will enlist to the effort and he's
very um he's very obligated he's given
us the impression that Qatar is doing
whatever they can to help and I do
believe him uh he was very he was very
empathetic to us uh and he's a family
man and it's an unfair question to ask
you because you're suffering and you are
the victims here but but you'll be aware
as well that there are children on the
other side oh yeah lots of children as
well um do you have a view on on where
this goes
next the only thing I can say as a
mother and I you know I tell it
everywhere I go I used to tell my
children all the time that children
anywhere in the world are children
they're humans and they should be seen
as ones and I'm trying to give good
education to my children in regards to
looking at the people in Gaza and
especially the children in Gaza as
humans and I'm sort of hoping that
mothers on the other end of the fence
see me as such but I'm not sure anymore
I used to but I'm not sure anymore um I
want human left I don't know there so
much violence going on so much violence
going on but you know my heart goes out
to every child and every mother who
becomes a victim of this and I think
Hamas is holding two two million
hostages apart from our hostages which
are the Palestinians themselves and
among them the children so let us just
pause and have a children's time out get
our children out and get the Gaza
children out let's get them out of the
equation do you have a view on
how the media and and and the agenda in
the last couple of weeks has sort of
focused entirely on Gaza do do you have
any frustration concern that in some
ways the hostages in in the Israeli
government said the UN doesn't focus
enough on the hostage doesn't put enough
pressure on Hamas to release the
hostages do you do you have a view on
that we fight all the time and we say
this must be the main priority the main
goal to so to save the hostage to
release them
I
believe I believe they doing their best
you know they
doing they acting wisely and with with
good
judgment I have to believe that I want
to believe that okay again I'm not
politican I'm a woman I'm I'm a mom I'm
a
mother of course I'm
terrified our children are still in the
middle of the war
we don't know nothing about them no
information we don't know
nothing they been held in a tunels in a
deep underground they can't see the sky
and the Sun and you
know I'm sure they terrified it's one
month now it's 31 days already they far
from us this children never been far
from us more than three two
days if I'm terrified what about them
you know they they don't know when
they're going to see us again they they
separate from the parents they can you
imagine can you imagine your child just
been kidnapped from his bed with pajama
from his house from his safe
place without shoes and just in cruy and
messless way he been taken and it's very
sensitive children that already have
how
you anxiety attacks and the anxiety and
the they all anxiety because we are 20
years under bombs they very s sensitive
and fragile and
they you know we had a movie of my child
I can't see this movie the whole world
seen this movie I can't see it because
it's too painful to see that M how he's
been hold like this I just saw the
beginning and I you know I didn't want
to to watch it but I just saw his he was
so
helpless so helpless so
terrified and so confused you know been
Hing by big terrorist of
Hamas can you imagine your child in this
situation and then it they disappeared
from our life we don't know when we
going to see them again it's look like n
how you said like
forever forever yeah I just want to
welcome back our world viewers we're in
conversation with ranana Jacob sha yomi
and Hades Calderon three mothers who
have lost their children um kidnapped uh
currently in Gaza um we we've talked a
lot about what happened on the day I I I
just I just want to understand you've
talked a lot about your emotions but I
want to understand what happens when
these videos come out when some of the
hostages were released do do you take
Hope from that or or or does it in some
way twist the knife is it is it is it
worse because of those
videos well let's differentiate between
the videos that Kamas was sending us at
the beginning which was probably well
it's part of their
propaganda uh and it's very violent one
The Killing and the and what happened on
the day all of it including the video
that Hadas was talking about showing
showing little children being taken from
their homes I don't see them as great
Heroes by doing so but if that's the way
they perceive themselves that's fine if
you're talking about the uh hostages
released uh both of them are U the last
ones that were released from our
community and at least I was very um uh
very hopeful after their release um
because it it's you know it seems to me
that maybe there is some Humanity on the
other end and uh they saw elderly ladies
that uh needed Medical Care and and
decided to release them so maybe there
is hope after all you said that you're
not getting any information from the
Israeli government Mark reave is coming
on the program tonight what do I need to
ask
him I you know I don't expect them to
give me any information because any
information that would have been given
to me would probably put my children's
life at risk so even if they know
something they're not going to tell 200
or so families what's going on and what
they know or what they don't know so I I
understand it's a very complex situation
what I do want them to um to be
obligated to is to to get the children
out and I'm not sure this is first
priority I was going to ask you that do
you do you think the hostages are the
first priority or is it retribution is
it children not oh hostages in general
but children should not be prioritized
they should be first and they should be
out and they should be out now you know
no deals no negotiations just a timeout
for children get them out but we
understand the
motivation that is that the war cabinet
is following and we understand that the
the need and the desire for Retribution
but is that are the hostages as you say
being prioritized in that and is the
strategy right
it's not for me to say you know I'm not
um politician I'm not a strategic
consultant I'm not a general in the Army
I'm just a mother of two who are held
hostage and I think it's my government's
responsibility to get them out and since
they are children they should be
released no questions asked and that's
that should be agreed on both sides um
as I said children's time out on both
sides
listen we're we're out of time um but
I'm really grateful to all of you coming
in and and I'm sure the sympathies and
thoughts are there from all our viewers
who've been watching so um thank you for
coming in",20231107

deadly attacks on the 7th of October and
now the Israeli Prime Minister is also
giving his first clue as to what might
happen here after the war I think Israel
will
for an indefinite period will have the
overall uh security responsibility
because we've seen what happens when we
don't have it when we don't have that
security responsibility what we have is
the eruption of uh Hamas Terror on a
scale that we couldn't
imagine across Israel it's an unofficial
day of
mourning many joined a minute's
silence then singing the National Anthem
to remember the bloodiest day in their
country's history when some 1,400 people
were killed with 240 hostages still
missing in Gaza a table was laid out
their loved ones hoping these symbols
would get
attention we are so uh said and we can't
ER feel another feelings we can't smile
we
can everything that uh we are
so we lose our happiness because of this

Israel and the Palestinians the past
month has seen unprecedented suffering
and for now there's no end in sight
yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem well from Gaza our
correspondent Rush Abu Al says that
there were more deadly Israeli air
strikes overnight was a three deadliest
a strike inun more than 30 people were
killed
in all of these area is in the south
it's the area that Israel asked people
to flee here they said it's safe today
we are having more people coming from
Gaza City into the uh uh southern part
in fact they were walking about 5
kilometers because the road leads to uh
Gaza City was damaged it's called Salah
road which Israel advising people to
take to take into the South I have met
some people who were like walking very
long way to to make it because no access
to the road one month on is still Hamas
able to fire Rockets is still fighting
going on in eight different fronts in
Gaza especially in the Northwest and
Southwest of Gaza where Israel ground
operation is been expanding and the grip
around Gaza City is been tightening and
the humanitarian situation there is
really at the catastrophic of of hunger
I was talking to a father of nine people
there you know communication is very
hard but between time to time we catch
some someone there he said I have no
food I have no money and I have no water
there is no clean water because all of
the aid that coming from Egypt which is
very little according to the UN not
reaching those about half million people
who live in Gaza City and the north here
in the South situation isn't better it's
quieter a little bit less air strikes
but the struggle to find food and water
and the struggle for the hospital to
find medicine is also
continued that's our correspondent richy
alof in Gaza well I'm joined now by the
former Israeli Prime Minister ahud Elma
he led his country from 2006 to 2009 and
thanks very much for coming on the
program um can I first get your your
view on what's going on in Gaza at the
moment we've had this situation where
Israel has been telling people to leave
the north of the territory and they're
heading south and then the bombs are
dropping on the south as
well not really I think that what we are
trying to do really is precisely what
you have described you want to move the
people out of where the combat areas are
the headquarters of the Hamas
organization uh is in the center of town
in the north part and uh we want to be
able to reach out for the leaders of
Hamas and to their headquarters to the
bankers to the launching pads where they
shoot the missiles uh to civilian
centers in Israel and we want to
minimize the collateral damage to the
maximum possible we don't want we don't
fight civilians we don't want to
civilians we are not enemies of the
civilians non involved in Gaza we are
enemies of the Hamas and I subscribe
entirely to the announcement of the
British government and the American
government that voted in the United
Nations against the uh uh call for
ceasefire because they said Israel has a
right to reach out for Hamas and destroy
the Hamas organization that's what we're
trying to do you talk about the
collateral damage the number coming out
of Gaza is that 10,000 people have died
there in the last 4 weeks I mean what
should Israel be doing to make sure that
it isn't hitting civilians cuz clearly
that's not
working well two things number one while
I don't want to argue with the numbers I
must say that these numbers are numbers
that are blown out of any proportion by
the Hamas they they haven't been counted
they haven't been uh uh checked and I
can tell you that you can't deny that
civilians are dying in Gaza can you no
no so let let me let me continue I don't
deny and I say that we try to do every
possible effort to uh minimize the cial
damage to the maximum possible uh people
that are staying in the center of Gaza
people that are living in the
headquarters of the Hamas and in the
bankers where from they wag their Wars
against Israeli civilians are likely to
to be affected and we try to avoid it as
much as possible but uh when all the uh
Western countries including your prime
minister uh um Rishi sunak admirably I
have to say says that Israel has a right
to respond where exactly are we going to
respond if not in where the headquarters
of the uh Kamas are where the bunkers
are where the concentration of their
missiles and their uh other uh attacking
devices are that's where we have to act
and we try to avoid as much as we can I
know that unfortunately I can't deny no
it will be stupid and
irresponsible that there might be
collateral uninvolved people killed as a
result of the Israeli operation we try
to minimize it because our Target are
not isra civilians in Gaza unlike the
Hamas which were aiming at Israeli
civilians and they killed in their homes
and they butchered them and they
beheaded them and you know all all of
these terrible sides that were exposed
to the world uh by what they did I
suppose you talk about the support of
the International Community like from
the UK I suppose the concern for Israel
is that if the continued suffering cons
in Gaza continues to fill our screens
day in day out and as we hear the
numbers growing uh every day that the
the sympathy and the unequivocal support
could wne couldn't it for Israel
yeah yeah definitely I I'm fully aware
of that and in fact what I want to share
with you is my vision I know I don't
represent the government I don't speak
for the government I think you know very
well that I'm not entirely the supporter
of this Israeli government but I want to
present my vision for the end game of
this event we are fighting now in order
to destroy Hamas I think it's essential
that we'll make clear that we don't want
to stay in Gaza and that we are going to
pull out out from Gaza entirely when the
Battle Is Over however that's kind of
the opposite of what Mr Netanyahu has
been saying isn't it you have heard what
he said about being responsible for
security after this n said that Israel
is going to be responsible for security
Israel was responsible with the security
it's just that his government failed in
providing security for the people of
Israel but we we also found out that
Hamas has increased its military power
to the extent that it becomes a danger
to the entire stability of the Middle
East so we have to destroy Hamas and
this is something which is widely
supported and accepted by the British
government by the American government by
many other Europeans now what I want to
say is this we have to pull out I don't
care whether Natan agrees with me or not
I don't agree with him we have to pull
out from Gaza completely then what we
have to ask the Western countries is you
want us to pull out we want to pull out
no Arab country and no Arab Soldier will
come to Gaza on the bonetes of Israel so
there must be an intering period where
an international force will take over
Gaza for a short period of time to start
and rehabilitate Gaza and start and uh
reestablish and restore a civil
Administration in Gaza now I we did it
in the south of Lebanon in 2006 and it
worked to provide security and and
stability in Lebanon for the last 17
years is that a would you want a NATO
force then is that what you're saying in
Gaza we want to have an international
Force for a period of time that will
then be replaced by the forces of the
palestin authority now one thing more
which I think needs to be done today by
Israel today not tomorrow is that Israel
should present this end game plan and
add one essential think that Israel is
prepared to start immediate negotiations
with the Palestinian Authority at the
end of the
battle on the basis of a two-state
solution yes because that's what they
said the Palestinian Authority have said
that they only want to go back into to
Gaza if it is an independent Palestinian
State that's why I say that number one
there should be an international Force
for an interim period number two Israel
should announce today
that we have a political Vision we have
a political Horizon we are prepared to
start negotiations with the Palestinian
Authority to establish a Palestinian
State on a two-state solution now if
Israel will do it today and this is what
I propose that we will do and I think
it's essential that we will do then
there is a likelihood that the
International Community will be more
patient with the time needed for Israel
to first defeat Hamas complet and break
down its military power if we will not
provide a political Horizon then the
patience of the International Community
may disappear very close and we will
fail to achieve the goal that we set out
and that was supported by the
International Community however if we
will then move and say we are prepared
first we will pull out from Gaza
completely second we are prepared to
start political negotiations with the
Palestinian Authority on the basis of
two State
Solutions then there is a
horizon that can be supported by the
International Community and by the
moderate Arab countries they may not
necessarily spell it out explicitly
because of the divisions and the
sensitivities and of their populations
but I know based on my experience and my
acquaintance and my uh past uh uh
dealings with the Palestinian with the
Arab leaderships that deep down in their
heart the jordanians the Egyptians the
Emirates Bakin and of course the
Palestinians themselves are anxious that
Israel will achieve its goal and crash
the Kash Kash is threat not only to
Israel the question is I suppose what
would be left of GA what will be left of
Gaza afterwards though I mean we're
already hearing reports that half of all
homes have been destroyed in Gaza
already look a war is not a game and
unfortunately they started a war and
they killed 1500 Israeli civilians in
their homes and butchered them and
beheaded them and raped them and killed
babies of two years old and elderly
people of 85 years old and sometimes in
the course of these events there are
collateral uh damages and we talked
about it however Gaza is not going to
disappear Gaza is going to stay there
and the international effort which will
be made with the participation of many
countries at the presence of
international intervention force in Gaza
will be able to rebuild lots of uh what
has been damaged and also a momentum for
a political solution will be created
with a commitment by the state of Israel
which has to be made and here I made it
clear I don't speak for the Israeli
government because they don't don't
agree with it now but I hope that this
government will disappear soon and the
new government will be replaced that
will make a very explicit commitment
that we are prepared to negotiate a
two-state solution this is the only
possible direction for something that
offer a different future for all parties
involved and that's what I personally
support and I think that Lots uh of uh
people in the International Community
entirely agree with this approach
okay well thank you very much for taking
the time to talk to us appreciate
it there former Israeli Prime Minister",20231107

reeling from the horror of the 7th of

party ground became the scene of Mass
Slaughter when thousands of Hamas
Fighters broke out of Gaza and gunned
down

clue about what might happen here after

seen what happens when we don't have it
when we don't have that security
responsibility what we have is the
eruption of Hamas Terror on a scale that
we couldn't imagine but Israel's actions
are being watched around the region with
growing fears of this conflict spreading
last night Israel says it struck targets

Jerusalem well Tomaso Del longer is a

global efforts to put an end to the

such a in front of such a great uh
crisis every effort is welcome so it's
difficult to say it's enough I would say
that it's very positive to see all these
diplomatic efforts around the region but
also at International level but I also
believe that we need more efforts to
make sure that a continuous flow
humanitarian will enter in Gaza that we
have a safe space where to operate and
then we'll find a way to stop uh this uh

critical aspect though is seeing

Jerusalem well the heads of all major un
agencies have issued a rare joint
statement calling for an immediate
humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza after
last night saw some of the most intense
fighting since the War Began anra say
that the 88 people working for them have
been killed since the 7th of October the
highest number of un fatalities ever
recorded in a single conflict well let's
speak now to Juliet tumor anra director
of communications and obviously I'm so
sorry to hear about what's happened uh
to your colleagues in terms of the
ability of your people to work in Gaza
at the moment can you tell me about the
conditions they're working
under I don't I don't think we can hear
have line Sor sorry can you hear me now
yeah start again Juliet Sorry yes thanks
thanks I think it's only by a sheer
miracle that our staff on the ground in
Gaza the unsung heroes of the
humanitarian team in Gaza it's only by
miracle that they continue to push and
they continue to deliver assistance
under such harsh circumstances they
themselves have been displayed some more
than once they have lost loved ones and
obviously colleagues like you've said 88
colleagues of ours um they are
completely stretched as our resources
and supplies run out and the Israeli
government uh is not moving on these
calls for any kind of ceasefire even a
pause at the moment this I was just
talking to a spokesperson for the
government earlier saying unless the
hostages are released we won't consider
this pause that you're calling for it it
seems that they're not moving moving on
that right now look there should be a
ceas fire it's we're actually it's it's
it's far it's overdue it's overdo we're
too late it's been one month of Hell uh
nearly 10,000 people are reported killed
more than 4,000 children we lost 88
under our colleagues um the situation
goes from bad to worse by the minute our
shelters are overflowing they're
overflowing with people we are currently
hosting 700,000 people in our shelters
some people are being forced to sleep on
the on the floor because we ran out of
simple things like matrices so we got to
have the ceasefire we also have to have
this steady flow of humanitarian
supplies that come into Gaza since the
Convoy started on the 21st of October
what came in is only 6% of what Gaza
used to get every single day what when
we say it's a drop in the ocean we
really mean it it's a drop in the ocean
yeah on the issue of fuel and obviously
Israel has said that it doesn't want to
allow fuel into Gaza because it could
end up in the hands of Hamas what can
you say to Israel to convince them that
that that wouldn't be the
case Andra is asking for fuel we have
been asking for fuel for one month Gaza
has not received any fuel for one month
we he need it Andra needs it the
humanitarian the largest humanitarian
organization in Gaza needs fuel we need
it for our cars for our trucks for our
medical facilities how can you Ure how
can you ensure that that fuel if it was
allowed in to you how can you ensure
that it wouldn't end up in the hands of
Hamas it's coming to us it's coming to
be used in un marked cars and trucks
it's going to un marked facilities and
medical um medical centers it's coming
to Andra we will use it for humanitarian
purposes we Andra the largest
humanitarian agency in Gaza we saw um
yesterday this air drop by the
jordanians uh didn't we is that
something that could be possible uh for
other countries for other organizations
perhaps this airdrop of medical supplies
it went into the Jordanian field
Hospital didn't it inside
Gaza it's a last resort it's a very very
expensive operation to do air drops um
the UN rarely does it we've done it
recently in Syria in an area that was
under heavy heavy Siege we've done it
once in Iraq in one of the mountains in
the remote areas it's a last resort and
we don't think that it's actually
necessary in the context of Gaza because
there are plenty of other ways to get in
supplies including by Road well thank
you very much for talking to us I really
appreciate your time Juliet tumer there
from anra which is the the agent
focusing on Palestinian refugees thank
you let's go live to Southern Israel now
because we can speak to our
correspondent Mark Len and as you were
saying earlier a really intense night
and an intense morning Mark talk us
through what's been
happening yeah we've heard much of that
intense military activity Lucy from
where we are we're about 3 kmers about a
mile or so uh from the Gaza Strip and
all morning we've been hearing the the
frequent thud of outgoing Israeli
artillery on the ground from here but
also huge plumes of smoke billowing up
after the uh the air strikes that have
rained down on the Gaza Strip
particularly around Gaza City which has
now been completely encircled uh say say
the Israeli def Defense Forces as they
try to sever this the the Gaza Strip
into a northern part of the strip and a
southern part of the strip is Israeli
media are reporting that Gaza that the
Israeli troops could enter Gaza City
within 48 Hours uh once they get in
there will be more of course intense
Street to Street fighting they're
encountering we know mines and booby
traps on the streets and of course they
would face some of those deadly Hamas
tunnels it's estimated that Hamas has
dug up to about a thousand tunnels uh
sprawling underneath Gaza and Gaza City
very much thought to be the center of
that um so meanwhile the the the road
that that basically B that goes from the
north of Gaza to the south of Gaza the
main artery running through the strip
has been open today uh to try to
encourage some of the civilians that
were Sheltering in the north to take
that Road South but many of them are
still feel that it's still too unsafe to
take that that road and and we
understand that up to 400,000 civilians
could still be Sheltering in the north
of Gaza the north of the Gaza Strip and
meanwhile Mark the intense negotiations
continue and the Diplomatic front
Anthony blinkin uh finishing off his
tour of the area and and still pushing
to get a humanitarian pause agreed by
Israel to allow more Aid in but he
doesn't seem to have had any Joy on that
front yet has he
well well not overtly no I mean the
Israeli Prime Minister has said there
will be no humanitarian pause until
there is progress on the 240 or so
Israeli hostages that were seized by
Hamas more than four weeks ago now one
idea that has been moted by yosa Burell
the eu's foreign policy Chief this
morning is that potentially um if uh
Hamas were to allow uh the Red Cross the
icrc international commit Committee of
the Red Cross to access the hostages
then maybe could the quid pro quo could
be a humanitarian pause but at the
moment there is no sign of that being
being agreed to um Anthony blinken did
say as he was leaving Baghdad last night
before he went to Turkey today that uh
us and Israeli teams are working
together to try to address the pract
work through the practicalities of of a
humanitarian pause so even though
Netanyahu overtly and publicly is being
very rigid on this I suspect that behind
closed doors it is rather more nuanced
um because it is clear that uh you know
if Israel is going to get any make any
progress or any any Headway about the
release of these hostages uh it's not
going to come while the while the
bombardment continues okay thanks very
much Mark loen for us there in southern
Israel let's just show you some pictures

on all of those latest developments in
the next half hour but first we're going
to begin our cover
with this report from our Middle East
correspondent Yan
n the Relentless bombardment continues
the latest Israeli strikes in Northern
Gaza among the most intense so far and
once again phone and internet lines were
cut this was yesterday's aftermath
locals say dozens were killed sayed's
wife and daughters were wounded he
searches on for his
neighbors can anyone hear me in
he shouts there are
people this is part of Gaza where
civilians had been told to flee to
Israel's military says it's looking into
whether it was operating in the area at
the
time Israel's ground invasion is
advancing its military says it's now
divided the territory into two and that
it's doing what it can to avoid civilian
casualties for several hours Israeli
forces say they opened a route for
gazans to head south the relatively few
made the
journey on his latest stop in Turkey the
US Secretary of State is hearing calls
for an immediate ceasefire from around
the region Washington backs short pauses
in fighting everyone would welcome the
mara because again it could Advance
things that we're all trying to
accomplish including getting uh hostages
back including getting a lot more
assistance into Gaza including getting
people out of Gaza one of the more than
240 hostages being being held in Gaza is
84-year-old Elma Abraham her family
found this photo online where she's seen
being taken by her Mass her son worries
how she's coping without her
medication right now we are 4 weeks
after that four weeks and one day and
they still not
here and they should be here
yesterday not today yesterday I'm like
in a in some horror movie mov that I'm
stuck but yeah I still have
hope Israel says that without progress
on releasing the hostages it won't agree
to any pause in hostilities for now for
so many each day brings only more
suffering yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem so that's the latest from Gaza
itself we're also following developments
overnight further north on Israel's
border with Lebanon Lebanese State media
have reported that three children and
their grandmother were killed by an
Israeli military strike on a car near
the border itself the Israeli military
said it had targeted a vehicle
identified as suspected transport for
terrorists and was checking reports that
civilians had been inside Hezbollah said
it had fired multiple rockets at
Northern Israel in retaliation we're
live now to Lebanon and our News
correspondent Yugo Bacha so what's the
latest on those strikes
Ugo yeah Lua so I think this shows how
tense the situation HS here along the
Lebanon Israel border so this attack
happened last night again the Lebanese
authorities are saying that four
civilians were killed uh and they say
that this was uh after an Israeli strike
that targeted this car not really far
here from our positioning teer in
southern Lebanon and last night it has
po politician said that the group would
retaliate and I think the fear here is
that this could lead to an escalation of
these hostilities here between Hezbollah
uh the powerful Lebanese group and the
Israeli Army I think last week we had uh
the first speech by the leader of
Hezbollah Hassan nzala he did not
announce an escalation of of of those
attacks that have been carried out by
the group but he did leave the door open
for more attacks if uh depending on the
situation on the the ground and he did
say that Hezbollah could return to its
uh rule of Civilian for civilian in
other words if Lebanese civilians were
killed Israeli civilians would be
targeted so last night hasah said he had
retaliated he had launched uh a barrage
of missiles targeting uh positions in
Northern Israel and I think there is the
concern here that this latest attack
that resulted in these four civilians
being killed could lead to an escalation
of the violence here here and uh last
night the Lebanese caretaker prime
minister uh described this attack as a
crime and uh pictures of this car this
you know car that was destroyed after
this U attack uh were widely shared here
on social media on Lebanese television
so again tensions remain really high
along the Lebanon Israel border
obviously the US Secretary of State who
um secretary blinkin is on a tour at the
moment
really trying to calm things down how
significant would it be if Hezbollah
were to enter into this
conflict yeah so after that speech by
Hassan nazala I think there was some
optimism from American officials saying
that they believe that the conflict had
been uh contained uh in Gaza that there
was no sign that the situation here
could escalate and this could become
another front in the conflict but the
reality is that these attacks continue
they have been frequent they have been
happening uh in several locations along
the border so there's always the risk of
miscalculation there's always the risk
that uh a single incident could uh spark
a much more violent confrontation here
so I think that's the fear here hollah
has indicated that these attacks are
going to continue the Israeli
authorities say that they're going to
respond to every single attack coming
from groups uh operating here in
southern Lebanon and obviously I think
some still fear that this violence could
escalate and Lebanon could be dragged
into another conflict and uh if you're
aware of this but I I'll just bring this
to you and our viewers so via the
Reuters news agency we're hearing that
Britain's foreign officers said that
it's temporarily withdrawing some
Embassy staff from Lebanon um have there
been other moves by other
governments yeah we H had in the last
few weeks a number of countries
announcing that they would uh remove
some of their personnel they would uh
also uh they would telling their
citizens to leave the country uh as soon
as they can while commercial flights
were available uh some countries have
also told their citizens to not travel
to Lebanon so I think this is a
reflection of the situation here how
volatile the situation is along the
Lebanon Israel border as this conflict
between Israel and Hamas
continues as ever thank you very much
indeed thank you well we're going to
cross live now to uh Geneva and speak to
tamasa DEA longa who is the spokesperson
for the International Federation of the
Red Cross and red crescent societies
hello there and thank you for joining us
here on BBC News obviously this has or
rather on Sunday night we saw the third
comm's blackout by Israel on Gaza how
has that affected your
agency thanks a lot for me today and
thanks for the question uh yeah it
affected badly because we had for the
first time as you said Total Blackout of
communication with our teams in Gaza and
we're deeply worried about that and even
the other thing that is really
concerning is that the gazin the people
in the Gaza Street will not be able to
contact the Emergency Medical Services
so the ambulance service and this we
already saw in the other two times that
affected our operation and also the
ability of uh ambulances and healthare
workers to reach the people injured or
who need the medical
assistance obviously the Jordanian King
has announced that Medical Aid was
dropped into parts of Gaza I believe the
northern area of Gaza which has been
hard as hit by uh Israel's bombardments
um is there the likelihood that more of
that will take
place well I mean I I I have to say that
um any humanitarian Aid entity in Gaza
it's a positive it's a positive news but
the reality here is that there is not
there is not a continuous flow of
humanit enter in the Gaza Street first
is still a drop in the ocean very
important but still a drop in the ocean
and secondly that we we know at least
from our Hospital of alud in Gaza City
of the pales Cent is that mainly no
humanitarian Aid is entering in the
north and is a great concern all the
civilians in Gaza and all the Care
Facility in Gaza must receive much dity
humanitarian Aid such as medicine and
medical equipments for hospital but also
put the water for
civilians we understand there there have
been two reports of strikes uh on or
near some refugee camps within Gaza the
alour refugee camp and also magazi
refugee camp many of the injured were
then sent to the alifa hospital what can
you tell us about how these hospitals
are
coping well I can tell you that the
health system in Gaza in general is
really on the brink of collapse or
almost collapsed some Care Facility
already closed for lack of fuel or lack
of medicine and then the pressure on the
hospital the still are open is immense I
can tell you that our colleagues in Gaza
City in the auts hospital are telling us
a scene where there are patients
literally everywhere in corridors in the
Halles everywhere and Medicine are
really running out and um fuel is
running out so electricity and then
there is this confusion where people
know exactly what will happen next uh we
had in the last 48 hours different
shelling literally in front of our
hospital that created damages inside the
hospital like Windows broken but also
damages to Intensive Care Unit we can
call them collateral damages but for the
people who are in panic and for the
people who are uh in that hospital it
means really an horrible daily life and
this must
St obviously Israel have announced that
they've effectively split Gaza in two
now North and and South how is that
impacting on your operations and what is
your plan moving forward you're in the
main aloud's hospital is that correct
yes exactly and and then also pal is
running out ambulance service I I have
to say that it's a bit difficult to to
make an assessment at the moment because
the situation is volatile and it's
changing pretty fast what I can say is
that humanitarian teams ambulances heare
workers should have access and should
have a safe and an interet access in
every situation so I I do hope and I do
call on all the parties to make this
happen and to make sure that people who
need health support will get it no
matter if Gaza Strip is divided in two
or three or whatever is the next step

live from Jerusalem the exit of foreign
citizens from Gaza has been stopped at
least temporarily no one has used the
crossing so far today and we're hearing
that border authorities will not permit
foreign passport holders to cross into
Egypt until the injured people in gaza's
hospitals are allowed to travel through
Rafa hundreds of foreign citizens have
escaped Gaza through the Rafa Crossing
into Egypt in the past few
days well meanwhile while the Diplomatic
efforts to relieve the humanitarian
crisis in Gaza are stepping up once
again the US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin is in Aman meeting leaders from
Lebanon Qatar and from Jordan itself Mr
blinkin is pushing for pauses in the
fighting in Gaza the regional leaders
want an immediate ceasefire but the
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu insists there'll be no
temporary truce until all hostages who
are being held have been released while
in Gaza an official from the UN Agency
for Palestinian refugees G is warning
that there is less and less it can do to
protect people well the Hamas run Gaza
Health Ministry says
9,488 people have now been killed with
around 3,900 of them being children
around 1,400 Israelis were killed in the
Hamas attacks on the 7th of October the
health Ministry in Gaza also says at
least 12 people who were Sheltering in a
school were killed in an explosion there
on Friday night Hamas says the school
was bombed by Israel there's been no
comment yet from the Israel Defense
Forces while the UN Secretary General
and the World Health Organization have
both condemned Israel's attack on an
ambulance in Gaza on Friday the Israel
Defense Forces admitted striking the
ambulance but said that the vehicle was
being used by Hamas to transport
Fighters and the United States says it
believes the war between Israel and
Hamas is being contained and any broader
regional conflict has been deterred the
comments from the Pentagon follow the p
first public remarks from the leader of
the iranian-backed and lebanon-based
Hezbollah group who didn't commit his
thousands of Fighters to enter the
conflict well let's get the latest now
from our correspondent mark
loen four weeks on it's
unrelenting Israel has continued its
pounding of Gaza from the
ground and from the
air overnight it's says it killed what
it called Terror cells exiting some of
the many Hamas tunnels the target Israel
says is terrorists but civilians are
paying an Ever more disastrous price a
school in a refugee camp hit this
morning in what Palestinians say it was
an Israeli strike that killed at least
15 Israel hasn't commented most of these
pictures are too graphic to
show childhood innocence has been
destroyed too this boy says he w
witnessed three bombings here carrying
bodies with his own
hands hospitals and schools places of
Refuge no more Israel maintaining their
Hamas hideouts using civilians as human
Shields the roads are not safe the unra
schools which were used for any attack
in the past also as shelters are not
safe the self doesn't seem safe either
and the passage to the South wouldn't
seem safe
either as the war grinds on The American
Secretary of State arrived in Jordan
telling Regional leaders the US is
pushing for increased Aid despite
Israel's prime minister rejecting his
call for a humanitarian pause as Gaza
smolders so does Arab anger diplomacy
has failed to stop the
Bloodshed on the ground more foreign
passport holders have been leaving from
Gaza like 11-year-old Farah her American
passport a way out but her father left
behind my dad
told me to be safe and he hugged me and
he kissed my forehead because he's very
worried about
me and this is the devastation they
leave Gaza and its lives ripped apart
Israel hopes it will be Hamas itself
that will be flattened here but what
then well let's talk a little more about
that news that a hold has been put on
people with foreign passports leaving
Gaza through the Rafa Crossing into
Egypt let's speak to our BBC Arabic
correspondent Allah re and and Allah
what are we hearing about the situation
at Rafa has anybody crossed out of Gaza
into Egypt
today well um till this moment we've
been hearing that nobody um managed to
cross to the Egyptian side according to
uh Palestinian uh sources we have seen
uh the list that used to be issued um in
the past three days by the authorities
of Crossings in Gaza with around um 700
names including German British um and um
Egyptians for for the first time um all
of the all of these people hundreds of
them headed to the Border uh but the
gate didn't open uh according to sources
we talked to um from uh the crossings
authorities in the Palestinian side uh
there's some kind of um a condition they
are making it clear that they will not
allow the uh foreigners or dun Nationals
to cross to the Egyptian side till
there's some kind of coordination or
agreement about the safety of
transferring those uh injured severely
injured Palestinians to the Egyptian
side um this of course came after a day
uh when the Palestinian side or
Palestinian authorities accused the
Israeli um forces of um targeting uh a
convoy of ambulance uh ambulance in
front of alcha uh Hospital which killed
um around 15 uh in in this uh Convoy um
so far uh nobody crossed but we're still
watching if there will be some kind of
updates
there yeah it sounds like those
discussions are still going on doesn't
it those diplomatic negotiations do we
know what exactly is being asked for in
terms of the injured being allowed to
leave is it is it a certain number or do
we just not know that level of
detail well we don't know about the
criteria or the number the first day uh
in on Wednesday we heard that 81 will be
allowed to cross to Egypt or to be
transferred to Egyptian hospitals
according to Egyptian official numbers
only around 45 were allowed to Cross or
to be transferred to Egyptian um
hospitals we know that their identities
are checked uh and uh verified by the
security um Israeli security or Egyptian
Security to verify that they are not um
involved in the fighting they are uh
civilians um but we don't know about the
criteria why those but most of them uh
are severely injured um most of some of
them uh were children um
but you know um we don't know about the
criteria
itself all thank you allay correspondent
from BBC Arabic joining us there live
from Cairo uh We've also heard in the
last few hours that the Israeli military
uh opened one of gaza's two main
highways to allow traffic so people
could head south from the north of the
Gaza Strip this came in a social media
post written in Arabic saying that
traffic would be permitted between 1:
and 4:00 p.m. local time that's a window
that closes at the end of of this hour
the message said that Hamas leaders were
already protecting themselves and urged
civilians to do the same by heeding
instructions to move South away from the
fiercest of the fighting which is
happening in the north of the strip well
let's get the latest from Gaza our
correspondent rushi Abu alof is
there today Israel asked about half
million people who still living Gaza
City and the north to leave South here
to kanun the city is already overwhelmed
by about a million people who displaced
from their houses the reason the
fighting was intensified around the Gaza
City and it seems that the Israeli
operation is expanding and pushing the
people who still in Gaza to leave they
want the area to be evacuated ated
especially around the T Hawa area where
Al hospital is this morning there was an
a strike right in the front of the
hospital and they destroyed a building
causing big damage and big banic to
about 14,000 people who taking the
hospital as shelter Israel insisted they
should leave the director of the
hospital say we can't leave because most
of the road around the hospital were
destroyed and about 100 patient are
being treated inside eight of them were
connected to the life- saving machine
the biggest Israeli incursion so far is
in the north west of Gaza and they are
pushing hard towards Gaza City it seems
that the Israelis want to tighten the
siege around Gaza City itself and they
are pushing hard for the resident who
are still remain there to leave their
homes here to
kanun",20231104

Secretary of State returned hoping to
ease the pressure on gaza's
civilians good afternoon
everyone we
are absolutely
focused on getting hostages back and
getting them back to their families in
safety and we believe that among other
things uh a humanitarian pause could uh
help that effort but after their meeting
prime minister Netanyahu said there
would be no Seas fires until Hamas
released its
hostages in Beirut lebanon's Capital
supporters of the Iranian back militia
hisb rallied to hear their leader Hassan
nasrala repeat threats that the war
might
spread the concern he said is that this
front might tumble into a wider War it's
a real possibility and the enemy should
make every
allowance back in Gaza this is what's
left of magazi refugee camp it's in the
South where Israel is telling
Palestinian civilians to go to escape
danger but there are only bad options at
the moment for gaza's endangered people
and diplomats who want to stop this war
escalating Jeremy bone BBC News
Jerusalem as we heard there the leader
of Iranian backed Hezbollah in Lebanon
has broken his silence on the war our
senior International correspondent Ola
garan is in Beirut for us now and Ola
what's your assessment of what Hassan
nazrah had to
say well you know Rita we flew in here
this morning and there was a real sense
of many in the city holding their breath
a lot of the streets were quiet some
businesses were closed some of the
schools closed early and people here
wanted to know what Hassan azraa was
going to say but it wasn't only his
supporters here at a rally in Beirut
that were hanging on his every word it
was officials in Tel Aviv it was
officials in the white house because the
big concern has been would the
bloodletting of the past month produce a
wider regional conflict now in the event
we got a lot of fiery rhetoric uh from
the Hezbollah leader a lot of
denunciations of America and Israel we
did not get any kind of explicit allout
declaration of war against Israel he
said all options were on the table he
said the risk of a wider regional
conflict remained But he sounded almost
defensive when he was describing what
hasbullah has done so far it has been
carrying out crossborder attacks tying
up Israeli forces On the Border using
artillery using drones he said some
might say that's not significant but
actually it's really important we do
know that Hamas has been hoping for more
now reading between the lines today I
think the message to Hamas was more or
less you're on your own for now and the
uh the leader of Hezbollah was at pains
to stress that the operation the attacks
that were carried out on the 7th of
October in which 1,400 Israelis were
killed he said that was a 100%
Palestinian operation carried out in
great secrecy and that other Palestinian
factions didn't even know a let alone
allies like Hezbollah or Iran so the
message was this was the doing of Hamas
in Gaza",20231103

Southern
Israel well let's speak now to our
correspondent John donison who is in
Jerusalem John another update from the
IDF today they say they have Gaza City
encircled what's the latest on the
military
campaign well their ground operation is
clearly advancing they say yesterday
they said they were at the gates of Gaza
City today Benjamin Netanyahu said they
had passed into the outskirts of Gaza
City uh and today an Israeli military
spokesperson said they had Gaza
completely encircled um so the ground
operation is advancing they are facing
resistance uh we've seen 19 Israeli
soldiers uh now killed uh and it has to
be said that the area on the approach to
Gaza City is relatively open you know
there are small towns and Villages which
are maybe easier to move through once
you get to the densely builtup urban
area of Gaza City itself it's going to
be increasingly difficult and complex of
course and of course one of uh
Israel's objectives is to remove hamas's
military capabilities and their ability
to govern the other is of course to free
those hostages and carrying out that
ground offensive while trying to get
those hostages out alive um is not going
to be easy now we saw more people again
mostly foreign Nationals leaving Gaza
through the Rafa Crossing today is there
a sense that number is set to
increase well look the Egyptian
authorities had been saying that they
were going to try and get through about
500 people uh a day uh foreign uh
passport holders and a small number of
critically injured uh people I don't
think they've reached that number today
I think more than a hundred people have
managed to get out uh we know some
Americans uh passport holders were able
to leave a few at British passport
holders but there are more than 7,000
foreign Nationals in Gaza so it is going
to take a considerable amount of time uh
to get them all out and of course the
key thing is that is just a tiny
fraction of the what is it 2.2 million
or so people who live in Gaza the vast
majority of whom have no chance of
getting out and the US Secretary of
State Anthony blinkin is on his way
there he says us diplomacy can make a
difference how is his visit is it likely
to be
received well I think there will be some
us diplomacy in putting pressure on to
try and get uh the American citizens out
I think when he was here a few weeks ago
Mr blinken you know he really offered uh
Israel unconditional support they have
been urging Israel to try and limit the
number of Civilian casualties is and
America believes that Israel is trying
to do that but by the time Mr blinken
leaves this visit you know we're going
to be on the way to
10,000 people killed in Gaza according
to Palestinian Health officials in Gaza
and the UN also publishes those figures
so you know not all of those are
militants a lot of civilians are getting
caught up and you know I was speaking to
a British government Minister yesterday
and I said look when does Israel's
response to hamas's attack on October
the 7th become
disproportionate you know is it at
10,000 deaths in Gaza 20,000 100,000 he
didn't want to give an answer but I do
think as the number of people being
killed continues to rise uh the you know
uh countries like America uh European
countries are going to be under
increasing pressure I think to try and

EJJ7ybVbo4Y,Israel-Gaza: Civilians leave Gaza via Rafah crossing with Egypt - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel-Gaza Civilians leave Gaza via Rafah crossing with Egypt - BBC News.jpg,"for the first time since the war between
Israel and Hamas began people have been
allowed to leave the besieged territory
of Gaza they included dozens of injured
Palestinians and hundreds of foreign
Nationals they've left by the Rafa
Crossing on the border with Egypt and
the injured were treated at field
hospitals there the foreign office says
the first British Nationals have crossed
and that more will be taken out in
stages over the coming days people
who've been trapped in Gaza for weeks
began crossing the border from late
morning after the territory was closed
off by Israel when Hamas attacked it
over 3 weeks ago Hamas is classed as a
terrorist organization by the UK
government and in Northern Gaza there's
been another air strike on jabalia a day
after an Israeli attack caused heavy
casualties at the refugee camp there our
International editor Jeremy boen has
asked first report which contains
material that you may find
upsetting at last the gates of the Rafa
Crossing were opened some foreign
citizens were allowed to leave Gaza for
Egypt for the first time since Israel
imposed its
Siege convoys of Aid trucks are moving
into Gaza though not nearly as many as
the UN and Aid agency say
unnecessary ambulances went in for the
seriously
wounded in jabalia at the opposite end
of the Gaza Strip more Israeli raids
this time they said the target was a
command center the UN said gaza's
civilians were being starved traumatized
and bombed to
death on the other side of the Border
wire Israelis are still in shock over
the 7th of October
attacks this is kibutz narim directly
facing
Gaza for the first first time Adele Rema
was back to look and to grab a few
things her old hopes of peace with her
neighbors in Gaza Gone
Forever stopping anything like this
happening again is powering Israel's
determination to see this fight through
to the end Adele showed me the place
where her son-in-law saved her three
granddaughters all under the age of 10
so tell me what happened here that that
is their safe room and that is where he
shot the terrorists
as kibutz narim was under attack Hamas
radio messages were intercepted and the
Israeli Army gave us this
[Music]
excert
[Applause]
the fence has been fixed Israel's
security has not so there's no doubt
there was a lot of
complacency about the risks that Hamas
posed to Israel and after the war
there's going to be an inquiry but even
now the Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is under a lot of pressure
about his
responsibility for the security land es
that led to Hamas breaching the Border I
took my pistol that day Noam tibon a
retired Israeli General drove down from
Tel Aviv to rescue his son's family from
Hamas as the Hamas gunman surged forward
tibon's mission was successful he took a
rifle from a dead Israeli soldier and
with others fought his way
in I I saw one terrorist I pointed on
him I killed him I saw another one I
think I wound him or killed him so who
do you hold responsible for what
happened this is the biggest
failure in the history of the state of
Israel it was a military failure it was
an intelligence
failure and it was the failure of the
government but I think that the one that
really in charge and all the blame is on
him is prime minister Benjamin
nanyu this was the funeral of
20-year-old Lavi lipic killed in comb in
Gaza Israelis are behind their troops
but increasingly they want to know how
so much went wrong and the pressure on
the prime minister is going to
increase Jeremy Bo in BBC News in

says its forces have advanced deep into
the Gaza Strip the IDF said a joint
action of ground sea and air forces had
seen troops break through Hamas front
lines of Defense in the north of the
Gaza Strip and Israel forces were at the
gates of Gaza City the Palestinian red
presentant says overnight loud
explosions and shelling could be heard
in the city including close to Al's

hoping to leave Gaza today following
International efforts to open the Raffa
Crossing to Egypt Gaza border officials
said the crossing would continue to
operate some 7 and a half thousand
foreign passport holders would be able
to leave Gaza over about 2 weeks
Palestinians who've been wounded are
also expected to be taken to Egypt where
they'll be treated in a new field
Hospital our Middle East correspondent
yolan Nell has our first report which
contains material you may find upsetting
gazans call it their gateway to the
world finally yesterday the Rafa
Crossing opened for the first time in
more than 3 weeks some foreign citizens
were allowed to leave the war zone for
Egypt including some Britains though
details weren't given but many others
are still waiting so this is the third
time to came to the border and nothing
happened as they're told your name is
not there so I have to go back to the
school to the Shel call the shelter
waiting for the bom at the other end of
the Gaza Strip in jabalia more Israeli
strikes Hamas says nearly 200 people
were killed here in 2
days and across the region the
humanitarian crisis deepens the head of
the biggest UN agency in Gaza entered to
see for himself I was shock by the fact
that everyone there was asking for food
food was asking for water we I saw
almost every children trying to express
their way that they need to eat they
need to have
water but the war continues relentlessly
24/7 it's almost 4 weeks since Hamas
gunman stormed the border and killed
1,400 Israelis Hamas is designated as a
terrorist organization by the UK
government here the Israeli Army shows
what it says are the weapons used
against its citizens in the 7th of
October attacks pull out the safety

shut and uh it takes the temperature
inside the room to 3,000 de during the
explosion it burns incinerates
everything inside the room nothing comes
out siren warning of incoming Rockets
interrupted the event near Tel Aviv when
Hamas launched its attack a retired
Israeli General Noam tibon drove down
from from Tel Aviv to rescue his son's
family using a rifle from a dead Israeli
soldier he fought his way towards their
home this is the biggest
failure in the history of the state of
Israel it was a military failure it was
an intelligence
failure and it was a failure of the
government with both sides now preparing
for a long difficult war in Gaza those
who are making it out of Rafa are the
lucky few most are left to face the
fighting feeling nowhere is safe yoland
Nell BBC News
Jerusalem well let's speak now to Anna
Foster our correspondent who's in
southern Israel and the air strikes
continue and particularly um let's talk
about jabalia the refugee camp that we
were Hearing in Yul land's piece there
that there have been more strikes there
and the UN Human Rights a agency talking
about how this could am amount to war
crimes
so we had confirmation uh late yesterday
that there had been another Israeli
strike on jabalia uh and we'd seen two
the day before one on the refugee camp
area which is a lot of people packed
into a very small space and one on the
town now Israel say that they in those
three separate air strikes that they
destroyed uh Hamas command and control
infrastructure they say that they um
they killed at least one senior Hamas
Commander and and various Hamas cells um
the problem is of course that they are
working in these builtup civilian
neighborhoods now the Israel Defense
Forces told people living in Gaza to
move South particularly in the north of
Gaza because they said that would be the
focus of their operations that would be
the battlefield but for many people they
weren't able to to move South and for
those who did and found themselves
displaced with no homes here living in
tent Sheltering where they could in the
streets no food no water in this
desperate humanitarian situation we know
that many people chose to go back to the
north again and there have been
questions raised about whether or not
Israel should be targeting these
civilian areas now Israel says that
Hamas are using those civilians as human
Shields and therefore in order to try
and eradicate Hamas from Gaza which is
their state at aim after those attacks
on October the 7th they need to focus on
the command and control centers you know
the places where Hamas infrastructure is
both on the ground and buried underneath
it uh but the problem is when you think
of the size of Gaza how small it is a
lot of that is wrapped into civilian
areas and that is why we are seeing
after these strikes these numerous uh
civilian casualties often as well of
women and children and President Biden
has now said that there has to be a
pause in fighting to facilitate the
release of hostages at least uh but
Israel still pushing back on any idea of
pausing things isn't
it yeah Israel are very clear that that
this is a an existential fight for the
the security and and the existence of
the Israeli Nation you know they they
have been pointing to other countries
around the world and they say when there
have been similar barbaric attacks on
their soil then these countries these
countries push back um the problem is
with with Gaza as we've been reflecting
is that it is as we were saying a very
small very small place with a very dense
civilian population it's not a place
that people can choose to leave if you
think of of War zones in other parts of
the world often the civilian population
when War breaks out have the opportunity
to leave but of course in Gaza um access
in and out is controlled by Israel um so
the more than 2 million people who who
live there they can't actually leave
Gaza at all the best that they can do is
move to another part of the strip away
from the fighting and you were talking
there about the raff of Crossing you
know Yan's report we saw some people
starting to leave foreign passport
holders some people with duel
nationalities but as yoland was
reflecting there that is really only a
very very tiny fraction of the number of
people who are stuck inside Gaza during
this this ongoing at times constant
bombardment thanks very much Anna Foster
for us there in southern Israel let's go
live now to Aman and we can speak to
Toby frier spokesperson for Unice I
suppose that is the one positive that's
happened yesterday was this 400 people
able to leave Gaza and among that some
injured people and and this setting up
of a field Hospital in Egypt what can
you tell us about that
yeah I mean it's it's very hard to find
positives obviously at the moment but I
think you know UNICEF welcomes the you
know opening of the Border particularly
for Urgent uh medical cases and and
especially for children you know we
welcome that we've been supporting the
the government of Egypt providing some
medical supplies for that fied Hospital
close to the ra border crossing but what
we really need to see is obviously a
stop to to the killing of children and
the maming of children which continues
to go on and we've seen the the Carnage
recently in in jabalia um and and that's
really our number one goal is to keep
pushing for that immediate humanitarian
Seas far as the UN Secretary General
said UNICEF has said numerous times and
and we keep saying that day in day day
out because the new normal is really
horrific right now and can you tell us
how and who is deciding uh who gets to
leave who is it that's going in and
deciding which injured people are being
able to be taken to this field Hospital
in
Egypt well it's very difficult for me to
provide you know specifics on who's
coming in coming out uh but I think the
number one thing is that urgent cases
particularly children are able to go out
and get the critical medical support
that they need and the reason is the
medical facilities inside the Gaza Strip
are at such strain already you know
massively massive strain limited access
to medical supplies we heard from the
World Health Organization the cancer
hospital is is really uh you know you
running out of fuel almost shutting down
so it's a Breaking Point essentially
inside the Gaza Strip so any relief at
least for for very for injured civilians
injured children is is welcome I see
that msf Midtown s Frontier has got a
few people who left yesterday some of
their staff working there left yesterday
they're know they're regrouping and and
uh getting more people ready to go in if
they can get them in are you getting the
sense that Aid workers inside Gaza are
wanting to
leave well I mean you se you know in un
we have a rotation policy for
international staff members uh you know
to bring new people in when you can to
to to Fresh up new new uh individuals to
support the humanitarian response the
number one thing really is is as we say
is sort of around staying and delivering
because now the needs are so immense you
know across the Gaza Strip to do
whatever we can on the ground with our
staff in the area to provide that access
to lifesaving supplies you know medical
equipment water particularly and
sanitation hygiene kits Etc to get
particularly to the shelters that are so
densely populated right now and do you
know anything about how negotiations are
going in terms of uh the discuss
discussions about a possible pause to
allow the humanitarian Aid workers and
more Aid in uh do you get any insight
into that I mean obviously we've heard
from President Biden today talking about
how there has to be a pause he was
talking about it so that the the
hostages could be brought out or got out
somehow um but do you know how those
negotiations are going at
all well I mean we do advocacy with
whoever we can to get a pause to get a
humanitarian ceasefire uh that's the
number one thing right now because we
also need to scale up uh the life-saving
supplies that can get inside the Gaza
Strip so some Aid has been as we say you
know trickling in but it's nowhere near
enough I me you and secret General said
it's completely inadequate um and and
that's so absolutely vital that we can
scale up those numbers of trucks coming
in with with the life saving supplies
medical equipment water because the the
issue now is that children are being
killed injured every day but also
there's the threats of outbreaks of
diseases and other issues arising you
know staff members talk about their
children being forced to drink salty
water and suffering from dehydration
diarrhea Etc so it's it's Absol urgent
now that we scale up that that access
okay well thank you very much for
talking to us Toby fricker there from
UNICEF",20231102

among those we assume that were able to
make that Crossing today um the
statement is brief but it says the first
British Nationals have crossed the Raffa
border crossing from Gaza into Egypt we
know of course open for a very limited
time today to allow some of those that
are injured in Gaza to leave to get help
in Egypt but also foreign Nationals able
to now make that Crossing uh across the
border uh the statement goes on to say
we will continue to work with Partners
to ensure that the crossing is opened
again allowing vital Aid as we've
discussed into Gaza and for more foreign
Nationals to leave safely The Crossing
will be open they say for a controlled
and Tim limited period to allow specific
groups of foreign Nationals and
seriously wounded to leave so that is as
far as that Rafa border crossing is
concerned uh a development there the
first British Nationals have been among
those able to leave the territory but at
the same time of course those Hamas
attacks on Israel nearly 3 weeks ago has
left uh many families still without
answers as to what has happened to their
loved ones uh we Now understand that 14
Britains have been killed in those Hamas
attacks on Israel 3 weeks ago so now
putting a number on that at 14 Britain
who have been killed in those attacks
three are still missing so the we goes
on for the families of three Britain who
are still missing
but 14 now confirmed dead uh UK
authorities the statement reads will
work with Israeli authorities and others
to establish what happened to them so uh
some answers in safaris knowing the fate
of those 14 Britain but as yet no detail
about what happened to them and for the
other three who are still missing uh no
answers as yet so those two lines

the Rafa Crossing in southern Gaza where
the first ambulances carrying the
wounded from Gaza are entering Egypt
take a look at these these are pictures
showing these ambulances coming through
it's thought 88 injured Palestinians and
around 500 foreign Nationals will be
allowed out in the very first phase of
this movement out of Gaza into Egypt the
UK's foreign office says it understands
the Raffa Crossing will be open for
controlled and Tim limited periods to
allow specific groups of foreign
Nationals and the seriously wounded to
leave in the meantime Hamas says that
seven of the civilian hostages it took
from Southern Israel last month were
killed in Israeli air strikes on the
jabalia refugee camp in Gaza on Tuesday
it says three were foreign passport
holders Israel hasn't commented as yet
on the Hamas claim well meanwhile the
Israel Defense Forces have released this
footage of Warships with missile
capabilities in Red Sea which they say
are there to strengthen defense
efforts well for more on this developing
story Let's cross live now to our
correspondent in southern Israel Anna
Foster
Anna maram thank you it's been a a
morning where we heard really in the
early hours that the Rafa Crossing was
expected to open for around about 80
seriously injured Palestinians and
several hundred foreign passport holders
to actually pass out of Gaza into Egypt
through the raff of Crossing now it's
worth saying that this is something that
has been discussed more than once and
there hasn't been an evacuation of this
type so far in this more than three and
a half weeks of war the only people
we've really seen leave Gaza have been
four hostages who were released by Hamas
and one Israeli soldier who was said to
have been rescued in a in a mission
there a few days ago so we watched this
morning as crowds of people gathered on
the Garen side of the crossing and again
it it is a a slow and an often
painstaking process we saw the
ambulances lining up waiting to take
people and as is so often the case with
this it's such a fast moving story we
also had Communications that were lost
again in Gaza in the last few hours so
really trying to piece together how many
of those people were going to be able to
leave there is a list that has been
published and it was published and
finalized before now of foreign passport
holders whose names and nationalities
had been checked and they were told that
they would be allowed to leave we've
heard from the UK foreign Ministry just
in the last few hours that they believe
that that is going to happen in a staged
process over a number of days but
details are still really very thin at
all and what we're not seeing just yet
that's not to say it won't happen but
what we're not seeing just yet is large
numbers of people actually through that
Crossing on the other side now our
correspondent in Gaza rushia Abal is uh
on the uh the Gaza side um and we'll
hear from him and also as well these
live pictures to bring you from my
position here in southern Israel where
you can see these continuing strikes
over Gaza you can see smoke in the air
it is one reason why people are of
course trying to leave Gaza in numbers
and rushi Abu Alo H gave us the latest
from there from his side of the crossing
this
morning this is the Rafa Crossing around
400 500 people are waiting here to cross
this is the first people who have dual
nationalities and they are waiting for
the Egyptian to allow them to cross I
have the five officers uh passport
Control Officers who are inside now the
Palestinian side of the of the terminal
they said they will process first about
8 to8 injured people with serious
injuries they will process them first
and then they will start allowing
Nationals we understand from like local
Authority here that about 7,000 people
who are registered as dual National in
in Gaza and they will
be allowed to cross to the other side of
the border to the Egyptian side uh 500
beer day so this uh process is going to
be long and it will take time and uh but
until now in the place here in ra we
haven't seen like any police any Hamas
ran police controlling the area we
haven't noticed any problem yet the
crowd is still small and they
are relatively manageable they are
waiting in this whole here the terminal
is in this side so once the Egyptians
are approve call the Palestinian side
they will be Crossing into the other
side of the Border this is a very
significant development giving that the
crossing was closed totally closed like
since the beginning of of this war it
was open for like two days in the
beginning and after that Egypt shut the
crossing because they said Israel bombed
uh the this Hall we were able to see
some footage about the damage we
understand that the uh some heavy
machinery were
inside last week and about 10 days ago
they were fixing the the damage there
today is going to be a test for this
Corridor Egypt want to take as much
wounded people as possible
to help the the Palestinians getting
a treatment in Egypt because the
hospital in Gaza are overwhelmed by the
number of of casualties and the shortage
of fuel and Medicine",20231101

live in southern Israel and we've been
watching this morning crowds of people
gathering in southern Gaza at the Rafa
Crossing into Egypt after suggestions
that the first foreign passport holders
will be able to leave along with some
badly injured people let me show you
these pictures that you can see on your
screen now um we know that the call went
out just a few hours ago uh that people
were likely to be able to leave and
we're seeing you can see look the
cameras in those pictures the crowds of
people in that internal area at the
Crossing Point um potentially 500 or so
foreign passport holders will be able to
pass through the AFP news agency says
that that has already happened but if
you just look at these pictures here if
you imagine this crossing point which
has several stages and what it's hard to
tell right now is whether people are
moving internally on the Gaza side and
whether or not they have actually
crossed through into e Egypt it will
only really be when we see people
stepping foot onto Egyptian soil that we
know that those first Crossings have
finally happened uh so far of course
we've only seen a very small number of
hostages leave Gaza since the War Began
on October the 7th um but we believe now
that foreign passport holders on a
pre-approved list which has been
published for several days now may be
able to cross out along with people
who've been badly injured um we are also
hearing from our correspondent in Gaza
rushia bu that once again Communications
and internet services inside Gaza have
been cut this would be the second time
in a week this happened first of all on
Friday evening it causes of course huge
problems for the civilian community in
gazra means people can't contact each
other they can't reassure uh family
friends and loved ones that they're safe
but it also creates huge problems for
humanitarian organizations working
within Gaza as well it means they can't
contact their staff and it means that
people on the ground can't do simple
things like call for ambulances for
example or for Medical Aid um after
strikes um I've also got some pictures
to show you as well take a look at um
the Israel Defense Force pictures which
uh have been sent through as well uh
these are latest pictures from the
Israel Defense Forces of their military
operation in the north of the Gaza Strip
you can see there um this is a strike
from uh from yesterday afternoon and
evening in the jabalia area um you can
see um this is one of the uh this is one
of the things that uh that Israel has
been working on and in fact you can hear
in the background when you hear those
bangs and explosions in the background
where I am in southern Israel that is
the ongoing Israeli military operation
but they're showing and you've seen
there on your screen you can see the
pictures of Israeli tanks and Israeli
troops uh doing their work very much in
the north of Gaza there were two large
strikes yesterday that uh Israeli forces
said had killed a senior Hamas Commander
uh but also civilian casualties as well
let's go live first of all to Cairo in
Egypt where AID organizations we've been
reporting are poised to try and bring
more humanitarian Aid actually into Gaza
well Global empowerment mission is one
of those groups they've been active uh
in Ukraine during the Morocco earthquake
as well uh their founder Michael Capone
joins me now and Michael I know you are
waiting at the moment you've got Aid
just tell me a bit about about what more
you've got there what you have ready to
take into Gaza when you get the
chance thank you for having me so we got
here about three weeks ago we've been
setting up infrastructure while we're
waiting simultaneously on getting trucks
through the Rafa gate so what we did is
we set up a large Warehouse like we do
all over the world and right now we've
been purchasing a lot of local Aid food
and water and we have now uh five trucks
that are basically ready and we are
waiting for clearance right right now
the people are coming out from the Gaza
side and we're waiting to be able to go
in we're confident now based on all our
meetings with un with three governments
with everybody that you know by early
next week I think there's going to be or
earlier a very big inflow of uh Aid that
we'll be able to get inside and we have
really good local Partners inside Gaza
that have been working there for more
than a decade that are very trusted and
basically our role here is to collect
supplies from the whole world like we do
and amass it pze it sort it prepare it
and ship it over to through the Rafa
gate and into our partner Ana's hands
and then there they distribute at the
shelters that are housing a lot of
children a lot of women right now and to
give support and the other Missing Link
that's important is that there's because
of no gas uh inside Gaza right now even
our partners like you said they cannot
communicate amongst each other because
of communications and they also have no
gas to be able to even bring this to
other areas other than you know close to
the Rafa gate so that's going to need to
be worked out soon
too you you talked there and we've been
talking so much about the the complexity
of the political situation here because
in other areas around the world you
would be able to move all of that Aid in
very quickly what are you being told
about how long it might take to actually
transport all of that across into
Gaza well time we don't know but what we
have been given now is basically exact
standards how big the pallets should be
what they are what will be prioritized
how they're going to go through before
they go to the Rafa gate they go to
another area to be checked by the
Israeli government right to make sure
that it's not weapons and it's things of
you know basic necessities that are
needed so it it's a whole process um I I
do imagine I mean there's already about
700 trucks in line at the border right
now from all different kinds of
countries throughout the Middle East all
that stuff needs to be properly cleared
first before it goes in so those are the
procedures",20231101

Jeremy bone BBC News Southern
Israel we can Jo join Jeremy now in
southern Israel and Jeremy to your point
there there must be big big questions
tonight about Israel's
strategy yes big questions too about the
numbers of Palestinian civilians being
killed at the moment uh last night Mr
netan the Prime Minister said that the
world needed to decide which side it was
on it was a moral question he said about
right and about wrong and he said there
was a big difference between Hamas
killing civilians and what he said were
accidental deaths in a just War
referring to this kind of operation the
Americans are concerned enough I think
about Israel's conduct to remind them on
several and repeated occasions that they
need while they defend themselves to
observe the laws of war and of course
finally Palestinians reject everything
Israel says about uh the way that Israel
claims to try to uh preserve Palestinian
lives and Senior Palestinian officials
have used the word genocide to me to
describe their view of what Israel is
doing Jeremy many thanks as always

killed and many more injured in a blast
at the jabala refugee camp in Northern
Gaza well those figures come from the
hamran Gaza Health Ministry which also
says the camp came under Israeli fire we
yet to hear from the Israeli military
the BBC is still establishing the
details pictures from the scene as you
can see show people searching for
survivors and pulling bodies from the
rubble now Israel earlier said its
forces are striking Targets in all parts
of Gaza with Fierce battles being
reported with Hamas let me show you
these pictures from Israel's Defense
Forces showing their troops carrying out
ground operations the IDF says it is
encountered anti-tank missiles and
machine gun fire as they Advance into
Gaza the spokesman said it was hunting
commanders of Hamas and attacking
infrastructure meanwhile this video was
released by Hamas they say that the
people you can see surrounded by tanks
are in a firefight with Israeli soldiers
in Northern Gaza over the weekend the
Palestinian red crescent says the area
around the AL kuds Hospital in Gaza City
has again been under heavy bombardment
the health Ministry says more than 8 and
a half thousand people have been killed
in the past 3 weeks Israel says over
1,400 Israelis were killed in the Hamas
attacks on October the 7th well let's go
straight to our diplomatic C respondent
Paul Adams who's in Jerusalem and Paul
what more can you tell us about the
blast at the jabalia
camp well Matthew I think you've shown
some of the pictures they are pretty
shocking that crater is huge an
absolutely enormous hole surrounded by
vast quantities of rubble and then homes
and buildings around there that have
been obviously severely damaged either
in the course of this incident or
perhaps uh over over the course of the
last 3 weeks jabalia in case viewers are
wondering is the largest of the refugee
camps in the Gaza Strip home to around
115 120,000 people before uh this War
Began uh packed into an area of about 1
and A2 square kilometers it's not tents
it's it's buildings that have been there
for decades and tightly packed streets
and we think judging by the number of
people who are there looking in the
Rubble to try and find bodies and
survivors there are still hundreds maybe
thousands of people still in the area
despite days and days of Israeli
warnings for people to leave Northern
Gaza so it is likely that any air strike
on jabalia uh and this does appear to be
an air strike that kind of crater is
really only consistent with a large
munition dropped from the air then it is
almost inevitable that large numbers of
civilian Ians who have chosen uh to stay
in the north will have been caught up in
this that that figure of around 50 which
uh is the number counted by journalists
on the scene from aan France press that
appears to be a the minimum number of
people caught up in this obviously huge
explosion Paul you were mentioning some
of the geography of the Gaza Strip but
over the last week and more we've heard
from the Israelis urging people ordering
people to leave the north to go to the
south south of the W Gaza just tell us a
little more about where this Camp is
within that sort of geography north
south and this this line that the
Israelis have talked
about yeah so jabalia is north of Gaza
City so it's between Gaza City and uh
the the Border fence with Israel so it
is not far from the kind the areas where
Israeli forces have been pushing in on
the ground they're not there yet they
haven't reached those really densely
populated areas yet but they are
gradually pushing forward on a number of
areas in the north at the same time
we've seen the movement of Israeli
forces south of Gaza City closer to Wadi
Gaza uh in what looks like an attempt to
cut off Gaza City from the rest of the
Gaza Strip that would be entirely
consistent with the messaging that we've
been hearing from the Israelis really
since this War Began 3 weeks ago which
is to try and tell everybody to move
South of that line they the Israelis
feel that they are they have a lot that
they need to achieve in the ga the wider
Gaza City area that that is where many
Hamas Fighters will be located that is
where a lot of the uh bunkers and
tunnels that we've heard the Israelis
talking about a great deal in over the
past few weeks that's where all of that
is located
and so I think it is likely that as the
days go by more and more Focus will be
on this very very densely populated area
um what we don't know is how many people
civilians remain in in that area we do
know that there are thousands of people
Sheltering at shifa hospital where the
Israelis alleg that Hamas has bunkers
underneath we know of thousands of
people Sheltering at the aluts hospital
in another part of Gaza City and there
are un schools and medical facilities
dotted about this entire area where
people are still Sheltering so that it
is safe to assume that there are still
many many thousands of people who run
the risk of being trapped in Gaza at the
very moment when the Israelis turn their
attention to it on the
ground only this time yesterday or
around this time we heard Benjamin
Netanyahu absolutely adamant there would
been no ceasefire it's interesting just
in the last couple of hours the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has
said humanitarian pauses must be
considered in Gaza at he was talking to
a senate hearing but even that even a
pause looks really unlikely at the
moment doesn't
it I think it does and and actually a
pause will not even affect Gaza City at
all the Israelis have made it clear that
nothing that goes into Gaza no Aid that
goes into Gaza will go north of that Wy
Gaza line that for the Israelis is
absolutely essential they're happy for
Aid to go in to the South uh to the area
where many many hundreds of thousands of
people have fled and are now Sheltering
some of them in tents but even there the
aid that is managing to get across the
border from Egypt is just a tiny
fraction of what is needed we've heard
American officials and Israeli officials
talking in the last couple of days about
increasing the number of trucks that go
across the border up to around 100 that
would be a start but we haven't got to
that point yet we haven't seen that
number of trucks going in on any single
day and even if they were to get in it
would be pretty challenging for the aid
agencies to address the needs of those
people who are huddled in the South
desperately in need of assistance but as
for the North and anyone north of w Gaza
they are on their own",20231031

is in an imminent Public Health
catastrophe well let's get more now on
the situation on the ground in Gaza
we've been speaking to our correspondent
rushi Abu Alou last night there was like
a little Bose of air strikes here in
kenun but this morning about four air
strikes in different area resumed and we
have to remember that this area is
considered safe area but Israel keep
targeting places here in the South where
about 2third of the population now
moved from the north into the into the
South but the main focus of the Israeli
operation is in Gaza City and last night
it was intensified in the northwest of
Gaza Strip it's a place called Bia it's
near the coastal and near the Israeli
Border in the north there was very heavy
fighting in the area very few people who
are still
having are able to communicate we're
talking to local radios we managed to
talk to someone in jabalia Camp close to
the to the area and he he was talking
about how serious the air strikes there
and how massive the explosions in the
area they said the dust and the smoke
were making a real issue for the
civilians who are still living in the
area we are talking about 700,000 people
are still in the operation area in the
place where Israel has been bombing day
and night in in in that also in Gaza
City and there was also another a couple
of strikes around the alotz hospital
it's the hospital that Israel keep
insisting and calling the director to
leave he said it's impossible because
about 14,000 people are taking the
hospital as shelter and about 100
patient are being treated eight eight or
10 of them were connected to the life
saving machines we are getting report
today about another 30 trucks are
heading back to H Gaza from the Egyptian
side they said the process is very slow
the UN the largest U Aid agency is also
struggling to find trucks and fuel to
move the ER food and medicine that Egypt
has been sending into Gaza a large
amount of Aid are on the ground between
the two Crossings and the they they said
the the the the operation is very slow
and it needs to be more sufficient to
allow more more uh trucks into Gaza what
we have so far is 150 trucks in the last
10 days and what we need according to
the UN is 100 truck a minimum of 100
truck every
day uh that is rushi AB ALU our
correspondent who uh is as always
reporting for us from inside Gaza one of
the few correspondents in international
media who is able to report from inside
Gaza well the US says it's optimistic
the number of a trucks entering Gaza
will soon increase to around 100 a day
they're likely to come through the Rafa
border crossing with Egypt uh you can
see it there at the bottom of that map
well Rafa is uh as as I said a second
ago on the far left of this map of Gaza
uh well let's cross live now to Cairo in
Egypt where AID organizations are poised
to help uh there we can talk uh to one
of them Global empowerment Mission
who've been delivering Aid uh to the
area Michael Capone the founder joins me
now Michael it's good to talk to you
thanks for joining us here on the BBC
just tell me exactly uh what is there
and what part it has to play in the a to
Gaza yeah so we've been responding to
both sides of this absolute catastrophy
and uh right now what we're doing is
setting up long-term infrastructure uh
on the road from Cairo to El Rafa and we
set up uh
warehouses and we are amassing food from
all our partners and supplies medical
supplies all throughout the world and
then what's going to happen is as you
said earlier it looks like there'll be a
much uh better Flow by next week it's
absolutely needed that there's minimum
100 trucks that could go in you know per
day with the situation so what we're
doing here is just amassing everything
preparing everything sorting packing and
then our Logistics team along with you
know the help of all the different
clusters that we're involved with with
the UN is involved all the different
agencies um we have Partners on the
ground inside uh Gaza that have been
working there for over a decade they're
incredible aner and the mechanism is to
get it directly into their hands without
it you know having any issues right so
show me show me a little bit of what's
behind you show me a little bit of
what's in that warehouse Michael yeah so
right now there's just uh you can see
there's just four trucks that have
arrived so far this is you know this is
all brand new
operation uh by next week there'll be
racks up here this Warehouse will be
filled and uh you know we we respond in
Ukraine we send about 300 full-size semi
trucks to the front lines of Ukraine
every single month with Howard G Buffett
so you know we're very experienced in
this and in Frontline work and you just
have to build up the systems to be able
to do this this is a really long-term
thing this is even if the war was
completely over tomorrow the collateral
damage that's done right now is going to
be years and years of recovery Michael
tell me a little bit about how you make
sure that the that I see there gets into
uh the people's hands the people who
need it the
most yeah so you know right now there's
been a lot of great forward
Communications between all three
governments and I think there's going to
be a a much more secure green Corridor
by next week that's going to be able to
protect the aid um so far our partners
have been Distributing small amounts of
Aid uh that they've been purchasing with
funds from gem local loc Al believe it
or not there's still Farms that are
producing food out there and that's
what's been happening and they haven't
had any issues so far but you know this
is every single International Aid
organization that we are in
Communications with has never seen
something like this I mean that you have
agencies that have lost 80 employees
already in just two
weeks Michael it's so good to talk to
you thank you very much indeed uh for
not only the work you do but also taking
the time out of what I know is a busy
schedule to speak to us today on the BBC
thanks
again well of course uh that is not the
only Aid agency working uh towards
helping Palestinians in Gaza Let's cross
live now and speak to Julie Megan
country manager at Christian Aid Julie
good to talk to you thanks for joining
us and what is Christine a doing uh
right now uh to help with what's
happening well the very first thing that
we're calling for is an immediate and
permanent ceasefire not a pause but a
permanent ceasefire because that is the
only way to ensure safe and effective
humanitarian delivery across the Gaza
Strip we work through local partner
organizations so we're not waiting for
trucks to get in we've been able to send
um grants to Partners to be able to
respond where they are and those
responses are working communities are
themselves able to support themselves
where possible now that obviously relies
on local markets functioning and
unfortunately we are hearing more and
more that supplies are dwindling so even
if we can transfer grants people cannot
um get the supplies that they need some
of the things that we've been doing are
supporting medical relief Outreach so um
one of our organization one of our
partner organizations has been going to
some of the most affected areas um
oftentimes without fuel for their
vehicles they will use uh bicycles to
get there and provide first aid and and
dressings um for the injured um we're
also working with with um on shelter and
providing sa well spaces for people to
come together um in the South but of
course um you know without a full and
permanent ceasefire there will be no
proper humanitarian response there and
it is important as well to say at this
point that the population of Gaza are
overwhelmingly civilian they're being
punished for war crimes of their defacto
Authority who they voted in in 2006 and
who have they have not been allowed to
have another election since so the
humanitarian need is absolutely colossal
and we are doing everything we can to
work with local Partners on the ground
but the reality is that people are
hungry they are thirsty they are afraid
that they may starve they do not have
fuel and they do not have medical relief
we've heard harrowing reports of people
being treated children and adults being
treated without anesthetic people in
hospitals not able to clean bloody
sheets five children to a bed you know
this we cannot overstate the
humanitarian catastrophe that we're
seeing here and so there has to be an
immediate ceasefire for humanitarian
access to flow Julie let me ask you a
little bit about fuel because we know
it's difficult to get fuel into Gaza we
know that fuel is key not only for
driving people around but you know much
more importantly for things like
Hospital uh you know equipment
generators and a vital equipment to
desalinate uh seawater uh what part
have Christine a played in this or what
more can you tell us via your local
Consultants about Fuel and how it's
going to get into the into Gaza and how
important it is not one drop of fuel has
entered Gaza since the start of this and
as you say you cannot separate fuel from
food from water and from medical relief
so we uh you know partners are running
out of fuel we've had some amazing
stories of real Ingenuity and this is
where our community-based model really
works because communities themselves
have been able to somehow manage to get
generators to work using gas canisters
for example but of course these do not
last but really communities are finding
whatever they possibly can to try and
get um the power that they need some you
know of the centers that we've been
funding have solar panels and so they've
been able to circumvent the fuel prices
that way okay but also but they don't
have electricity um and they don't have
power I'm so sorry Julie we have run out
of time but it's been really important
to get Christie a onto the show I
appreciate your time thank you once
again thank you",20231031

correspondent Yulan Nell
reports
shrouded in darkness the Gaza Strip is
pummeled from the air by Israeli air
strikes with flares raining down to Mark
targets and by day the devastation and
the huge human cost is clear it was the
subject of a briefing given to the UN
Security Council last night according to
figures from the Palestinian Ministry of
Health some 40% of the more than 8,300
people killed in Gaza were children
the true cost of this latest escalation
will be measured in children's lives
those lost to the violence and those
forever changed by it more than 420
children are being killed or injured in
Gaza every day a number that should
shake each of us to our core more than 3
weeks after Israel endured its bloodiest
ever day of attacks it's been expanding
its military operation to obliterate
Hamas which controls Gaza Israeli tanks
are now slowly advancing and the Israeli
Prime Minister rejects any idea of a
truce calls for a ceasefire are calls
for Israel to surrender to Hamas to
surrender to terrorism to surrender to
barbarism that will not
happen overnight a glimmer of hope for
Israelis celebrating after a soldier
said to have been rescued by the Army in
Gaza was brought home some 238 hostages
Israelis and foreigners snatched on the
7th of October remain captive earlier
these three Israeli women had been shown
in a video put out by
herass when I saw the image of Danielle
on TV my heart almost
stopped my wife and I were on one hand
shocked but on the other hand we felt
reliefed that we saw her alive and that
we see her until today we didn't know
anything about
her entire neighbor neigh hoods in Gaza
are being rendered
unrecognizable this fifth war in 15
years is the most brutal yet and Beyond
the fighting conditions grow tougher by
the day Aid agencies saying that a small
increase in the supplies now getting in
isn't nearly enough yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem well there are reports a 100
Aid trucks will be allowed into Gaza in
the coming days but the unra
spokesperson Juliet tumer says it's a
fraction of the help that's needed the
trucks that have been coming into the
Gaza Strip by the way not every day are
far from enough um before the war Gaza
received 500 trucks including of
humanitarian Aid so what we're having
right now is really a trickle Trickle
and does not correspond at all to the
huge and increasing humanitarian needs
on the ground in Gaza and in terms of
the amount of people that you have in
Gaza it's many thousands isn't it people
that have worked for you over the years
um what are they telling you from on the
situation on the ground about how
they're
coping well every day our sadness
deepens with um confirmation that we
keep getting that another colleague is
yet gone um yesterday we lost Samir he
was with his family and uh he was killed
with his eight children and his wife 64
leagues of ours at Andra have now been
killed in just over 3 weeks in this war
in the Gaza Strip
64 gosh and are they are the are the
people who who remain there are they
able to carry on their work now I mean
we've been hearing some agencies having
to to really just give up because the
situation is so
dire no we have not given up we have not
we have 13,000 people who have been
working with us uh in the Gaza Strip we
are the largest an agency in the Gaza
Strip one of the oldest that have been
working in Gaza with the Palestinian
communities teachers doctors Engineers
um support staff counselors
psychologists you name it I mean it's a
it's a very um big presence for us at
Andra in in the Gaza Strip and we have
been working with the Palestinian
communities now many many of our staff
have been impacted themselves due to
this war many have become displaced many
have lost loved ones many have lost
their own homes um many of them are just
exhausted they have been living in un
shelters for weeks on end now many
however continue to be on the front
lines giving the very little assistance
that we have um being with the
communities that we serve and fulfilling
their humanitarian mandates when we say
these are unsung heroes we mean it Andra
staff in Gaza are our unsung heroes
and they are the glimmer of humanity as
we sink into our Darkest Hours Juliet
tumer there talking to me she's from the
UN agency which looks after Palestinian
refugees let's speak to Abdul Basir
Hassan our reporter from BBC Arabic in
Cairo and I was listening to a military
spokesperson for Israel talking to the
BBC in the last half hour saying that
there could be a hundred trucks of Aid
entering from Egypt into Gaza by the end
of this week how feel feasible is that
in your
opinion well sources at the Rafa
Crossing just told us minutes ago that
another 60 tracks have already passed
through the Egyptian gate the Egyptian
side of the uh Crossing into the Zone
which Israel decided to be the point
where inspections are taking place
loading and unloading the tracks which
and the change would be there these 60
uh are now uh uh together with another
like 30
5 are being still at this point didn't
move to Gaza from yester night yester
night 60 entered uh to that point only
26 of them later at the night bed to the
uh Enclave now at the point there are 94
tracks at the loading and loading uh and
unloading and inspection point which is
almost like uh 60 M away from Rafa
Crossing according to Egyptian sources
yes there are a there is a significant
rise in the number we have been talking
over the last days about uh 14 15 16 20
tracks to yesterday and today we are
talking about 60 and 60 today as well
this came in fact after a call between a
conversation between Egyptian president
and and US president uh Biden which he
said more tracks will be allowed in and
we have heard uh reports from yester
night that the state department spoke
about the possibility of busing fuel to
Gaza but no date was set for this for
for the fuel tracks to to bus on so far
we are talking about food medicine and
water mainly and uh there is an expected
uh trip today to uh to the Border by the
Egyptian prime minister something new
might happen there we don't know exactly
uh why he would be there but there is
also an important meeting here in Cairo
between Ana Chief Philip laini and the
Egyptian foreign Ministry there could be
like a talk about the uh needs of the uh
of the STP especially after the uh
complaints that whatever the number of
tracks busing on it wouldn't amount to
the uh bad needs of the uh uh besieged
strip uh so therefore we might expect
from today's meeting more numbers to be
divulged on what should be coming in the
next days that's interesting that
they're discussing the possibility of
taking fuel in because of course Israel
says that it it won't allow fuel to go
into Gaza because of the concern that it
could ends up in the hands of
Hamas and this is very important but
still we are talking about reports from
the US side no mention of this from the
Israeli side or even from the Egyptian
side or even from the international
organizations working in the STP or
either here on the Egyptian side they
are in bad need there were calls that
and warning that unless we they get Fel
as soon soon as they can the services
and utilities are using fuel might
collapse and the the services are
offering for the needy in Gaza Strip
might uh come to a standoff therefore
still food is an essential need for the
gazans and therefore we hopefully after
the uh Egyptian Israeli and could be the
US contacts over the last hours there
could be like a breakthrough soon so
therefore we are waiting for this
significant change if it happened okay
thank you very much Abdul Basir Hassan
our reporter there in Cairo let's talk
more about the military operation that's
underway and speak to Anna Foster our
correspondent in southern Israel and
Israel's military talking about how it's
hitting all areas of the Gaza Strip now
and saying that it's had a large amount
of exchanges on the ground with Hamas
can you give us an update of what's
happened overnight and this morning so
far
Anna that's right Lucy well the Israel
Defense Forces have said this morning
that they have struck more than 300
Hamas Target inside Gaza in the last 24
hours or so and you can see and hear
really the ferocity of the battle that
is going on there we're hearing constant
air strikes and and outgoing artillery
fire from here in Israel and the
pictures that the Israel Defense Forces
are releasing now show their infantry
troops uh deep in inside Gaza you know
they're they're on the ground at the
start of this they were going in and
coming out again but they very much dug
into their positions now uh we're seeing
tanks on the on the beaches of Gaza
there and we're seeing this this
increasing push from north to south of
the strip as they try to eradicate Hamas
you Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime
Minister has been very clear that uh
that this is a military operation that
will continue until Hamas is defeated
until Hamas has been either destroyed or
or forced out of Gaza altogether and you
see the continuing military operation
which which seems to be getting stronger
every day moving towards that eventual
end but it's also worth saying that that
because we're seeing and hearing so much
activity does not mean that this will be
over quickly we heard from the Israeli
home front command last night they said
this will take this will take weeks if
not months it is a a very slow uh slow
progress uh towards their eventual goal
of destroying Hamas and meanwhile the
humanitarian situation in uh Gaza
deteriorates we have been hearing uh
some positive news though in that the US
and Israel talking about how there may
be around a hundred TR trucks of Aid
entering into G are from Egypt by the
end of this week and we were just
hearing from our reporter in Cairo
talking about how maybe 60 trucks have
gone into the inspection Zone uh at the
border there so that would be a big
increase from what we've seen so far
wouldn't
it it would but they've said this before
and it hasn't come to fruition just yet
for the last several weeks there's been
a lot of highlevel diplomatic
conversations going on about how to
increase the number of trucks that go in
and you remember in the early days for
for several days days you know we we
heard that trucks will go in today
trucks will go in today and they didn't
now there is a lot of work going on
behind the scenes No Doubt a lot of high
level diplomatic talks pressure from the
likes of the US which is Israel's
biggest diplomatic and and military ally
um certainly that is something that is
being worked towards the Israel Defense
Forces have said in in several of their
briefings now that that is something
that is being worked towards but I think
until we actually see those trucks Laden
with Aid passing fully through the raff
of Crossing and into Gaza uh it's all
just words really rather than actions
and I think when you look at those those
images that we saw over the weekend of
increasingly desperate people in Gaz are
actually breaking into to a un Warehouse
you know they were kind of carrying away
these big bags of of Wheat and and boxes
of basic supplies like like sanitation
and hygiene kits it shows you how
difficult the situation is there is a
real need for much more humanitarian Aid
to be getting in there and I think
that's where you see the difference
between the conversations that are
happening the words and what is actually
you know what we're actually seeing
there on the ground let's talk a bit
about the hostages because we saw
yesterday this um release well the
Israelis managed to free uh an is
Israeli soldier and she's been reunited
with her family we also saw that video
uh of three hostages being held by Hamas
and really messages from the relatives
of these hostages for the Israeli troops
to keep these hostages at the Forefront
of their minds as they are uh going into
Gaza yeah you can see exactly why the
hostage families would be saying that
because when you see the intensity of
what is going on here in Gaza and and
people are looking at that and knowing
that their family members their loved
ones their friends are somewhere
somewhere inside that narrow strip being
held by Hamas and Hamas are being
pummeled as they are by Israel you can
see why the hostage families are really
concerned about their welfare and they
have been speaking uh with a joint voice
and very loudly calling for you know
ongoing dialogue with Israel's defense
minister yoav Galant with Benjamin
Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister the
families were also talking about some
sort of potential hostage swap that they
would support you know there are
thousands of Palestinians being held in
jails in Israel the hostage families are
talking about a swap and it was
something that uh when the leader of
Hamas in Gaza yaka sinoa spoke for the
first time a few days ago he also talked
about is it something that that Israel
will entertain the idea of I don't know
it's hard to say they've done prisoner
swaps before but I think what is is
crucial right now is is that ongoing
pressure that the hostage families are
are putting on the government and
particularly when as you quite rightly
say there we saw that that video of
three hostages being held inside Gaza
clearly speaking under duress from Hamas
it you know that part of this story that
thread of this story is is really
present right at the Forefront of of
Mines here in Israel all the time and
that is why you see that continuing
pressure uh from the families and and
from you know ordinary Israelis as well
for the government to do everything they
can to to get those those people
released and huge International pressure
on Israel to consider some sort of pause
or some sort of ceasefire in this but as
you were saying you know benjin
Netanyahu has been so strong in in his
rejection of that idea hasn't
he that's right the Israeli message is
clear they say that what happened on
October the 7th you the brutal and
merciless killing of of more than 1,400
people many of them Israelis but for all
kinds of different nationalities in
these Southern communities here like the
one I'm I'm speaking to you from now you
know he is he's very clear that that
that cannot cannot be acceptable and
that the source of those attacks which
is Hamas in Gaza needs to be eradicated
now the reason we see the likes of the
UN General Assembly the UN Security
Council at Israel's allies Around the
World perhaps asking for these
ceasefires or humanitarian pauses often
isn't because they are they are telling
Israel that it can't defend itself that
they're very clear that they support
Israel's right to self-defense it's the
presence of the civilian community in
Gaza which I think is is giving rise to
those requests more than two million
people live inside that very small strip
of land that you can see behind me more
than half of them have been told to
leave the North and move into the South
because the north is where the fiercest
of battles are happening so you now have
this this desperate displaced civilian
population many of them women and
children who are losing their lives who
are being killed in this ongoing
bombardment so that is why these
diplomatic talks are ongoing um about
the the civilian population about the
humanitarian the growing humanitarian
issues inside Gaza but equally that is
why Israel is is so clear from its part
that it will continue to do what it
needs to do to to defend itself and and
to ensure its future security",20231031
ZK-QAupOZqQ,Gold prices jump since start of Israel-Gaza war – BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gold prices jump since start of Israel-Gaza war – BBC News.jpg,"now let's uh focus on a warning that's
come from the World Bank of the
increased risks of price Rises across
the board if the conflict in the Middle
East escalates focusing on the
possibility for huge rises in the price
of oil to over $150 a barrel but also
looking at the price of gold long seen
as a safe haven investment in times of
upheaval the price of the precious metal
has risen by around 8% since the start
of the Israel Gaza war and according to
to a new report from the world gold
council is also being brought up by
central banks like never before John
Reed is Market strategist at the world
gold Council and he explained the
findings central banks have more than
doubled the amount of gold that they've
purchased really starting from the
middle of last year and and that's made
a major difference I think to the gold
market you know even before this
conflict lifted the gold price we've
seen um the US dollar really we've seen
interest rates really strong normally
that would put gold Under Pressure but
because of this enormous Central Bank
purchases we're within a few percentage
points of the all-time high in gold
which we saw both during coid and then
following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine and I presume you don't see this
trend changing or going in the opposite
direction anytime soon no I don't think
so we spent a lot of time talking to
central banks about what they're doing
in gold and why they're doing it helping
them understand the gold market and
there's number of factors that are
driving their purchases you know I I I
think there's a recognition from central
banks that inflation is going to be more
of a problem in the in the next decade
than it was in the in the past 10 years
I think geopolitics is playing a role
not just the Russian invasion of Ukraine
but I think concerns that we're entering
into a a more lively
geopolitical um Arena I I think as well
the the actions taken uh against the
Central Bank of Russia uh sanctioning
its reserves following the invasion of
Ukraine have really made Reserve
managers at central banks uh sit up and
take notice and I think that they they
see the sanctions resistant uh
quantities of gold as very attractive
and and finally I think there's there's
the belief that we're moving towards a
more multi-polar world where it's not
just the US dollar that is the reserve
currency of the world but in time
there'll be other Reserve currencies too
this rate of purchasing can continue we
think for years maybe even decades and
it just goes to show doesn't it that
that gold I mean once upon a time it was
very much out of fashion and our former
Chancellor Gordon Brown famously sold
off huge amounts of UK reserves which
now looks like a a huge mistake of
course it it just goes to show that gold
will always remain as the safe haven in
times of trouble won't you think I I
think so and I wouldn't be too quick to
blame Gordon Brown for his sales uh lots
of other central banks were selling gold
at the time as well but you're right um
gold is a perennial asset it's uh and
certainly over the last 10 years
following the global financial crisis
following the coid pandemic the Russian
invasion of Ukraine it's really
demonstrated its role uh in a portfolio
for central banks but also for investors

zl2Tvyl9bXs,Hamas releases video showing three women held hostage in Gaza - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hamas releases video showing three women held hostage in Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"hostage video BBC does not normally
broadcast hostage video and we're not
going to give the names of the three
individuals who were part of this
message but we have seen and heard and
translated what they had to say so let
us look at some of the details of what
is a distressing uh video to emerge
we're joined by our diplomatic
correspondent Paul Adams Paul what can
you tell us about this video it's really
hard to watch
three women we have confirmed their
identities but we are not as you say
going to name them at the
moment they are sitting in a white tiled
room on chairs dressed rather as the
hostages were the other day in what
appeared to be Palestinian
costumes and one of them speaks and she
speaks with real
Fury and she addresses her remarks to
Benjamin Netanyahu who Israel's prime
minister she says that they have been in
captivity for 23 days that suggests to
me that maybe this video was recorded
yesterday she also refers to a press
conference that the families of the
hostages had given the previous day that
we think was two days ago in which she
says we know there was supposed to be a
ceasefire you were supposed to let us
all go now yes there was a press
conference and yes clearly there's a lot
of talk about ceasefires but nothing
from the Israeli side nothing from prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu to suggest
that such a deal had actually been
struck so that to my way of thinking
suggests that that's what they've been
told happened they probably don't have
any access independent access to
information they are entirely dependent
on what their Hamas captors are telling
them they appear to be healthy they do
not appear to have been abused or
injured but the the woman who speaks is
extremely
emotional and she becomes almost
uncontrollably emotional at the end she
says that the Army was not there to
protect them on the 7th of October no
one arrived no one guarded us and we are
innocent
civilians she also says addressing her
remarks to Benjamin Netanyahu isn't in
isn't it enough to slaughter everyone
not enough Israeli civilians killed and
she just ends her remarks by saying let
us go back to our families now now now
it's really hard to watch it's very
distressing first of all for the
families uh when we're hoping they have
been told about this in as careful a way
as possible it would at least give them
a sign that their loved ones are alive
um and as you say that they look healthy
but it's also deeply deeply distressing
and the Israeli view on these videos and
what Hamas is doing with the hostages
prime minister Netanyahu has called it
psychological terrorism using them to
pursue their War
aims yes it's hard to dispute a
characterization like that this is not a
video
recorded you know out of free will this
is a a video recorded by three women who
have been held for 23 days in conditions
that we can only guess at we do have a
little insight courtesy of the other
hostages who were released who said they
were being generally well
treated once they got to the side not on
the way not on the way that Journey from
the places where they were taken to the
places where they were held was clearly
extremely traumatic and everything that
has happened to them for the last 3
weeks has been utterly traumatic so you
have to obviously take that into account
when you read these words these are the
words they may well reflect some of the
trauma and the anger that they
themselves feel feel but maybe they also
reflect some of the things that they
have been asked to say we just don't
know but the impact of this is going to
be huge it is going to add to the
pressure on Mr Netanyahu to do more to
get hostages out it is going to cause
yet another wave of trauma in this
country where wave upon wave of trauma
has already been crashing on on the
population you know this this story has
the has the ability to do do that to us
every few days and this is just going to
add to that and you know there you have
three three women begging begging their
government to bring them
home yes just deepening the trauma of so
many and it's not just the families and
loved ones with the hostages is there's
so many in this country who themselves
are torn about what has been happening
Benjamin Netanyahu met some of the
families he reassured them reassured the
nation that Israel has two priorities he
said destroying Hamas and bringing the
hostages home and his view was that this
this intensifying war the ground
operations would help he said the only
way to bring the hostages home is not
that ceasefire that the women were no
doubt told to say in that video given as
you say the so little knowledge but by
intensifying the pressure and indeed the
defense minister you have Galant made
exactly the same point that is the way
to force Hamas into some kind of deal it
was interesting when Mr Netanyahu spoke
at that press conference two days ago
and he did he listed those two
priorities and it was in that order
destroying Hamas and bringing the
hostages home clearly his main priority
still as far as we can make out is to
destroy Hamas the you know many many
people in this country are asking how
can you achieve both of those is that
even remotely possible and is it more
likely that the more military pressure
you bring to bear the more you send
troops into those
uh congested areas where the hostages
might be being held the more air strikes
are conducted over Gaza the more likely
it is that actually hostages will come
to harm and indeed another statement
from H Hamas was this morning in
response to the latest signs of the
Israelis moving in on the ground was
precisely that the more you do this the
more you're likely to harm hostages so
this is an awful awful psychological
game which the Caps are playing and they
are hoping still with so many cards in
their hands more than 200 people that
somehow this is going to have an an
impact on the Israeli government so far
we have seen no sign of that is there
something going on behind the scenes
maybe we know that many many actors
including the Gulf State of Qatar are
trying very very hard to orchestrate a
deal in which there could be a release
of hostages maybe in exchange for the
release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails but at the moment we have
no sign that any of that is is imminent
this is just going to add to the the
pressure and the Despair and once again
the trauma surrounding all of those
questions yes and that Friday night when
Israel expanded its ground operations it
came suddenly uh a diplomat briefed on
the negotiations through the Gulf State
of katar uh Express regrets saying we
were so close that but said there were
still some issues in dispute and of
course we know those are very big issues
one of them most of all that ceasefire
that the women in the video today talked
about and Paul just before we came on
air there were reports swirling again
that even now even though there had been
a fear that these talks would stop that
there are really crucial discour
discussions going on now as we speak in
Qatar focusing we believe just on the
civilians yes I I think there are
conversations going on everywhere there
was even uh talk of Hamas officials
being in Cairo the Egyptian Capital you
know again part of this complex web of
negotiations and discussions which
continues all the time and me it may
sound almost uh bizarre to to the to the
audience to think that a war could be
raging and conversations could still be
having indirectly between the the Waring
parties about the possible exchange of
prisoners but these things do happen
even in the midst of of wars and so we
couldn't we can't exclude the fact that
something of that kind may still emerge
and it may be that the Hamas people who
are holding those women maybe they
thought that such a thing was imminent
uh you know the truth of these
negotiations is being held by so few
people and it's only when the deal is
done that anyone gets to know I suppose
the one glimmer of hope that the
families can hold on to is the general
view that these hostages and they're
being held by Hamas also Islamic Jihad
and there were reports that they were in
the hands of of gazin who just went and
grabbed people is that they only matter
if they're alive yes they want to keep
them alive they want these bargaining
chips as terrible as it is to say to say
that and Paul you mentioned the details
of it was a a a white tiled room yeah
many eyes will be on these these videos
most of all their families to see for
signs that of distress of the health had
they lost weight how did they look did
they look stressed and the women had
different Expressions without going into
more details but was this in if it was
as widely believed in one of those deep
deep tunnels it was very
well pointed if you can use that word it
it didn't look like cave it wasn't a
cave it didn't look like the kind of
tunnels that we have seen evidence of in
the past it didn't look it didn't look
dank it didn't look Sandy it looked
clean tiled white uh so I'm sure many
many eyes will be pouring over that
trying to see any signs there were there
were no obvious signs really about the
kind of place they were being held gazer
is a is a small place as you know a very
small place but it's also very gested
place and there are many many places
where you could hide civilians and we
don't know you're right we don't know
who is holding who I suspect that by now
Hamas being the major uh group in Gaza
that if anyone if anyone has was
freelancing on this hostage taking
probably the hostages have been gathered
and maybe sort of held centrally but you
know we just don't know um
and could this be the Prelude to to to
any more hostage releases again it's
just impossible to know but it is also
just impossible to ignore so agonizing
so so agonizing one of the many very
tragic human dimensions of this very
very ugly intensifying War Paul Adams I
know you'll get more information for us
on this and all the other developing
stories today thank you very much for
joining us on BBC News and to confirm
again if you've just joined us in the
last hour aasa's military Wing has
released another video a hostage
video on it telegram Channel we are not
broadcasting the video it is not BBC
policy to usually broadcast the video
we're not giving the identities but
we've been discussing what the three
women one of the women who spokes had to
say we'll continue to try to get more
details not just about this video but
the impact on the families on Israelis
and most of all on those intense and
highly sensitive negotiations to bring
the hostages home let's take a look at
other the other top stories this hour

to process the horror of what
happened the security Chief took me on a

hit them hard the equation had to change

was not Israel's fault
we allowed them to come work in Israel
and we thought this would help the
Ordinary People of Gaza we thought a
good economy would bring some peace but

risks of a wider Middle East War remain
Jeremy boen BBC News in southern
Israel we're live now to speak to tamaso
DEA longa from the Red Cross joining us
from Geneva thank you and welcome to the
program um first off I wonder if you
could just confirm whether you've been
able to we have had that Communications
uh blackout for a time over the weekend
have you reestablished Communications
with your team on the
ground yeah good morning thanks for
having me today yes we established
communication uh yesterday early in the
morning around 4:00 a.m. hour time uh
but still is not a stable communication
and is still a challenge to talk with
teams uh uh in in the Gaza STP the most
worrying part of the communication
blackout was that people were not able
to reach the Emergency Medical Service
to call the ambulance so what we heard
from pales colleagues is that they
mainly they were mainly foll the noise
of bombardment to arrive in the area and
and try to find injured people which of
course is pretty risky and once they had
located those injured who needed your
help um what resources do you have to
hand they
adequate not at all I mean the resources
are absolutely limited and running out I
would say minute after minute I mean we
saw it in our Hospital the alud hospital
in Gaza City but also in the other
health facilities the the stories are um
telling us that shelves are empty
medical equipments are not anymore there
and then we don't have to forget the
stress on the medical personnel they are
working 24/7 in the the last more than
two weeks uh without any shift and also
being affected
themselves what can you tell us about
aluts
hospital aluts hospital is uh fully
crowded of patients injured and more
than 10,000 people who sought a refuge
in the hospital because they thought
that was the safest place where to stay
in Gaza City the situation of course is
out of control in the sense that it's a
it's a heal structure where people are
living in the corridors in the stairs
outside and inside plus 500 patients
that are receiving a life saving care
talking about intensive care units
babies in incubators people who need
oxygen and now the the the the issue are
mainly two one is the evacuation order
that arrived yesterday which we are
deeply concerned about because with this
situation there is no possibility to
evacuate patient
and then second lack of medical
equipment but also lack of fuel
electricity will run out soon and in
palest and colleagues already cut air
conditioning the lift and other part of
the of the of the building doesn't get
any more electricity to save a fuel but
of course this is a situation that
sooner or later will arrive at the end
and of course this is so what does the
Red Cross make of um Israel um saying
that there will need to be an evacuation
of Al cuds what's your position the
organization's position on that
warning well I mean we were clear
yesterday this is not possible this is
not possible hospitals must be protected
in any condition and no nurse no doctor
no patient should risk to die in a in a
bed of a hospital and then also this is
The Impossible dilemma that no doctor or
nurses should face leave the hospital to
seek safety but leaving their patients
behind or stay in the hospital are
risking their lives palesa and teams
said it clearly they will stay with
their patients uh tomasa obviously
you're in Geneva but I'm assuming you
speak to your volunteers and your staff
have they ever reported any intimidation
from um members of Hamas in
organizations or in buildings such as
hospitals have they encountered that to
my knowledge I never heard about these
stories so what is going to be your
position next in terms of um those
bombardments have come closer and closer
to um your hospital well aloud's
hospital and asifa Hospital what's going
to happen next what have you got in
place well I mean what we are doing of
course is calling on all the parties and
having a bilateral conversation with
different stakeholders to avoid that
hospitals will become a Target so to
protect as much as possible the hospital
and we are strengthening all our efforts
to get humanitarian Aid in from the
southern border
then of course we do hope that these two
I mean the combination between the two
so let's say diplomacy in closed door
condition and bringing humanitarian
inside the Gaza STP will help our
colleagues in the hospital and around
the Gaza strep now we understand that
there were some 33 36 possibly trucks
that were allowed into uh the Gaza Strip
there is the hope that there will be
more coming in 12 trucks I understand
were carrying medical supplies medican
on Frontier has said that they've sent
26 tons of medical supplies to Egypt
hoping to get those into Gaza how
closely do you coordinate with uh those
trucks coming
in well I mean the coordination is made
logistically Wise by the Egyptian
reccent on the Egyptian side and
Palestine reccent together with the UN
on the Palestine side the problem here
is that these tracks and this
humanitarian needs to enter 24/7 in the
Rafa border through the ra a border we
need to have a continuous flow of
humanitarian Aid 10 trucks a day 30
trucks another day are just drops in the
ocean and this is why we are really
calling on all the parties to make this
sustainable in the mid and long term but
also to create a safe humanitarian space
inside the Gaza Strip to do our work we
need safety and civilians need safety to
get the humanitarian Aid that they much
needed okay toas Del Longo of the Red

so-called second phase of the war
against Hamas across Gaza but

Israeli air strikes means the search for
survivors among ruined buildings and

futile
Israel says it now has troops commanders

Gaza and eliminating named Hamas leaders
who Israel says were responsible for the
atrocities of October the

Aid agencies say the needs of gaza's 2.1
million residents are critical it says
there are 600,000 internally displaced

north towards towns in the South where
resources are
scarce while Israel today played down
the scale of the crisis insisting that
food and water supplies were adequate
desperate families have even been
looting food storage facilities and un
warehouses in one week um we only had 80
trucks 8 Z trucks just above 80 right
that's when we say it's a drop in the
ocean or it's crumbs it's not a PR stunt
it's the truth because before the war
Gaza used to get 500 trucks every day so
in one week we had just over 80
trucks Israel has rejected some
international calls for a ceasefire to
allow the creation of an aid Corridor
but says it will allow some more regular
Aid in through the Raffa Crossing with
Egypt fuel will not be on the list as
Israel says it will be stolen by
Hamas Israel's prime minister maintains
that the military objectives of this war
are his number one priority but in
addition to those International concerns
there an important domestic audience too
worried about what increased military
activity in Gaza might actually
mean Mr Netanyahu met this weekend with
the families of the more than 220
hostages Israelis and foreigners still
being held captive by Hamas in Gaza he
promised to exhaust every possibility to
bring their loved ones
home and while many Israelis support the
government's military aims some of the
families say it's time to make a
deal there have been many conflicts
between Israel and Hamas in and around

very difficult in in Gaza since 24 hours
as Israel cut all of the communication

internet lines are not functioning in

really hard and difficult very few
people who are still having

people who close to uh to the Border
they still can communicate and between
time to time they uh post some uh on
social media they also some of the local
radio uh station are still functioning
and they they they were able to talk to
their correspondent in the north who
described what happened last night as
the biggest ever air strike that
targeted this area he said that it was
like an earthquake we understand that
the Indonesian hospital was struck with
an N Strike yesterday the hospital was
out of service for quite a long time
like a week ago the hospital was out of
service because no fuel and was
evacuated but today it was the main
building of the hospital was destroyed
also around chifa Hospital in Gaza City
there was a a lot of air strikes 10 15
air strikes according to people around
chifa hospital they are cutting most of
the roads towards that hospital
communication as I said is extremely
difficult we are unable to verify a lot
of reports about the the number of

our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams
and Paul just quickly first of all as we
shift phases according to Israel's
military your assessment of what we were
just listening
to well I think that note of urgency was
was very very marked wasn't it Matthew
uh this was I think the sternest
strongest most perhaps impassioned
warning from the Israelis that we have
seen so far and I think it's also the
first time
that they have said that when this is
over you can go back uh this is
obviously addressing the fears that many
many Palestinians have which is that if
they leave their homes they're never
going to go back to to them because the
homes won't be there all somehow they
will be driven uh further maybe even
South into Egypt so I think that was
quite a not noticeable addition to uh
his remarks uh as for how long this
latest operation is going to go on well
the defense minister has said the oper
operation will continue until further
notice and he has referred to the fact
that we have accomplished a phase in the
war so clearly the Israelis feel that
they are doing something slightly
different now uh whether this is
something that is going to continue in
the coming days or we we don't know or
whether they feel they have somehow
accomplished something we also don't
know that the attack by Hass was
unprecedented the response is
unprecedented but also the situ
with the hostages
unprecedented I think this is really
interesting Matthew the pressure the
sense of pressure on the government is
mounting day by day it's really really
palpable there's another demonstration
going on uh in Tel Aviv today as you've
already mentioned the uh relatives are
demanding uh to meet with the Prime
Minister and the defense minister that
meeting we believe is going to take
place later this evening and if I can
just read you for from a the statement
put out by a spokesperson for the
hostages and missing
families we are tired of slogans they
say our Lov ones time is running out and
they have been held in appalling
conditions underground in the dark for 3
weeks some wounded and every additional
hour could be a death sentence we expect
the Prime Minister and defense minister
to arrive with clear answers on how to
bring the hostages home that's those are
really strong words and I don't think
the Prime Minister can ignore that this
sense that both among Israelis but also
among a number of foreign governments
including the United States they they
really really want the Israeli
government to do whatever it takes to
bring hostages home and there are some
people with long experience of dealing
with Gaza who say we should be pausing
now we should stop the fighting now to
allow an opportunity to get the hostages
out that doesn't mean we won't return to
the fight uh eventually but just for now
that should be priority number one

expand their operation especially in
Gaza City and the north here in canun
also there was many air strikes
overnight with about 20 people killed
about 15 targets around this area and
around the middle camps people are
really worried since the Israel is
cutting all the
communication uh people can't
communicate with their relative with
their friends in Gaza City and the North
and people were really in panic I saw
people in the streets today less people
in the streets than yesterday people are
afraid of the next stage of the
operation they believe that cutting the
communication this is the first time
ever
since Hamas took over Gaza and four Wars
before uh we haven't seen Israel
completely cutting the communication
with Gaza uh the humanitarian situation
is also getting worse and wor
with Israel not allowing food and

struggling to find water here in the

fuel to run the generator and work in

are struggling the ambulance services is
almost shut down since the morning they
they say we don't know where to go and

Heavy bombardment around this hospital
this is Nas Hospital inhan units is the
hospital that is the only Medical Center
that's serving half of the population
now and it's in the edge of catastrophic
as the Director of the hospital just
told me that they have shut most of the
operations and only the operation room
and the life

situation with the shortage of fuel no
fuel coming to this hospital for for for

in one go and some of them were dead
some of them were severely when severely
injured so I was to this operation room
and I saw how they are struggling to
cope with the situation and no guarantee
for how long they can keep doing this
without without supplies and
fuel a correspondent in Gaza there Rashi
Abu aloof there's also been a blistering
R between Israel and the UN over
comments by its Chief Antonio gutterz
that the attacks by Hamas on October the
7th did not happen happen in a vacuum
Israel reacted with Fury saying it would
deny visas to top un officials and
calling on Mr guas to resign he spoke
today of being
misrepresented I spoke of the Grievances
of the Palestinian
people and in doing so I also clearly
stated and I quote that the Grievances
of the Palestinian people cannot justify
the appalling attacks by amas end
quote and this evening Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu made another
public address to the nation insisting a
ground Invasion will
happen we are reigning Hellfire on Hamas
we have already killed thousands of
terrorists and this is only the
beginning simultaneously we are
preparing for a ground Invasion I will
not elaborate on when how or how
many we can speak now to our
International editor Jer jemy boen who
is in southern Israel for us and Jeremy
what should we read into the timing of
this statement by Mr Netanyahu why say
this
now first and foremost I think it was
aimed at a domestic audience as you've
just seen it was in Israeli Prime Time
and he was speaking in Hebrew uh I think
that he was trying to reassert to people
that he's in control the one
if you like new thing sort of new thing
in it was the fact that he did say there
would be a ground Invasion because there
have been many delays people expected it
to have happened or started already uh
some people are even saying that Mr
Netanyahu is hesitant he has a
reputation for that and that he might
not even go through with it well he said
he's going to go through it through with
it and he used very strong language and
strong language as well at the United
Nations
uh the uh Israeli Ambassador there
condemned what the Secretary General was
saying and he didn't accept the clip
that the sentiment in the clip that you
played there that he said that he was
misrepresented that the uh the Israelis
effectively only took part of his
statement and criticized that and not
the other part of it and having read the
whole thing I think I tend to agree with
the Secretary General just looking at
that I think right now the Israelis do
not want any criticism and they've been
getting it from the UN not just from the
secretary Secretary General but from un
agencies and it's something they don't
want because their message is they are
respecting international law and the UN
is basically saying that they're not and
at a time when they are aware that the
legitimacy of what they're doing is
increasingly being questioned I think
that this means that they're going to
continue pushing back very hard one more
thing since Mr nety who's spoke there's
been an awful lot of shell noise coming
from Gaza which is about there's another
one there I could I don't if the
microphone picked it up which is about
10 kilm in that way it's really being
hammered tonight and it started
artillery and air strikes just about the

October 7th attack by Hamas on Israel
did not happen in a vacuum but that the
Palestinian people have been subjected
to 56 years of suffocating occupation he
also said that the grievances of the
Palestinian people cannot justify the
appalling attacks by Hamas and those
appalling attacks cannot justify the
collective punishment of the Palestinian
people the Palestinians are divided by
Israeli land walls and fences 3 million
Palestinians who live in the occupied
West Bank live with something that looks
more like a functional government it has
Ministries ambassadors posted throughout
the world and secular politics but the
Palestinian Authority hasn't held
election for more than 15 years and the
PA also seems unable to stop the
increasing encroachment of Israeli
settlements into Palestinian land in the
West Bank regarded as illegal in
international law though disputed by
Israel and so there's a collapse of
faith in the nearest thing the
Palestinians have to a legitimate State
and with it a collapse of faith in a
diplomatic solution to the conflict with
Israel so what next for the PA enter
prime minister Muhammad chatai likely to
succeed president abas an economist and
moderate he's a strong supporter of the
two State solution but now since the
Israel Gaza war broke out and there have
been deaths in the West Bank as well as
Gaza he is also in the midst of the
crisis Amir sat down with the Prime
Minister earlier today in
rala I call for immediate ceas fire and
uh I call for immediate session of all
what is happening in Gaza and an
immediate opening of a safe passages for
uh International Aid to get in and so
that we will be also able to treat the
injured there are more than 15,000
Palestinians injured who are waiting uh
for treatment no food supplies no
electricity supplies no water supplies
so the situation is extremely
catastrophic and that continuation of
this israelian bombardment will
obviously cause more lives to be lost
clearly for a ceasefire to happen Israel
needs some kind of victory such as the
release of all hostages do you call for
the release of all hostages look the
issue is not about Victory Israel is now
in the mood of Revenge so if Israel is
in the mood of achieving Victory it's
not going to get any Victory killing
innocent people does not really lead to
a victory Israel if Israel needs to be
victorious they have to sit down with
with the Palestinians and put together a
political track so this does not repeat
itself by all means I would like to see
hostages going home every hostage every
prisoner and that this only can come
through a peaceful negotiation a
peaceful measure a peaceful solution
that will put an end to all these
sufferings presumably in the same breath
as you would say indiscriminate violence
the killing of civilians is wrong you
would also say the same about the
October the 7th attack in the south of
is by Hamas I told you we should not
really look at October 7th only there
what about the West Bank 92 Palestinian
lives have been lost and 92 Palestinians
have been killed by settlers by the Army
and Palestinians here in the West Bank
they didn't initiate anything all
Palestinians are under attack if we look
at October 7th as a starting point then
we miss seeing the picture then we miss
seeing the macro picture we we lose the
context yes but the incidents on their
own are also important and just as we
you know the world condemns the killing
of civilians in the Gaza Strip doesn't
the world also condemn don't you also
condemn The Killing killings of Israeli
civilians I have seen of course
International leaders queuing to support
Israel I I I saw very few of them
condemning the killing of innocent
people in Gaza so therefore look my dear
friend by all means who wants to see in
people killed I'm sure nobody does so
therefore in the same way that we want
to save the lives of our kids our
children our women our our ELD we want
to save the lives of everybody so I
don't see the event as an isolated event
I see things in totality the issue is
Palestinian people the issue is
Palestinian cause the issue is the
sufferings of the Palestinian people and
I just do wonder if you recognize that
what happened to Hamas attack is not
only a tragedy for Israelis but it's a
tragedy for the Palestinian cause as
well because it's in the outside world
it's shifted how people regard the
Palestinian cause it's not uh I mean I
have seen
demonstrations in the Streets of London
in the streets of Berlin in the streets
of Paris in Washington Chicago
everywhere people are fed up with this
situation people they want an end to
this miserable situation I know of
course two wrongs don't make a virtue
but the situation is what is the virtue
The Virtue is actually that we reach a
solution that is the most important
thing I'd like to just go back to last
week and the terrible explosion Blast at
the alahi hospital in
Gaza the US Israel some media
organizations have said they believe
that or you know they have proof that it
was um a misfired Palestinian rocket
others feel differently I wonder do you
feel like you have a duty to say to your
people let's wait to understand the
facts and you know let's let's listen to
what the truth might be about that
particular blast we know what the truth
is Islamic Jihad does not have the
technical capacity in one single missile
to kill 500 people that is not the case
only Israel that has the military
capabilities to do that and if you want
to buy the story of the other side of
the Israelis look Israel has been
spreading so many lies I am not
defending any situation I am saying that
we have to get facts right I am saying
that we have to avoid fake news there's
different opinions and that suggests
that you know as a Palestinian Authority
as a as a leadership you have to say we
don't know we you know that rage we must
listen you to tell me what to say you
want to you are suggesting to me and
answer I'm not going to answer the way
you want my dear friend I am not
defending any situation I am saying that
we have to get facts right is not this
sort of creating you uncertainty about
who did it is just simply not to allow
people to reach the truth the truth is
that Israel did it is it revealing a
crisis in the political leadership here
because it is encouraging people towards
more violence you can't completely
protect the the safety of your Civ
Millions you know we haven't had
elections in the West Bank in 16 years
this is a
crisis the question is how do you get
out of the crisis there is an
opportunity today that while Israel is
also in a
crisis and that we are in difficult
times that there is a need to sit down
and in the conflict so out of this
crisis one has to make an opportunity
and I think there is an opportunity the
problem is that there is no leadership
on the side of the Israelis who are
ready to sit down with us and settle the
account and settle the problem and end
of occupation and give the Palestinians
their rights my dear friend the
Palestinians have been in struggle the
Palestinians have been fighting in every
means and ways for the last 100 years it
is time for these people to enjoy their
right it is time for these people to
live with dignity it is time for these
people to live in a sever and viable
contiguous state of Palestine on the
borders of 6 67 with Jerusalem as its
capital and the right of refugees to go
back to their homes otherwise the
conflict will continue the Palestinians
are not going to surrender if Hamas was
brought down in Gaza would the
Palestinian Authority accept the
invitation to try and form some form of
government
there we're not waiting for an
invitation by
anybody the Palestinian Authority palesa
leadership will not go to Gaza on an
Israeli military tank to your audience
the Palestinians live under military
occupation that should end and therefore
any solution any thinking of the day
after does not solve the Gaza problem
alone does not solve the West Bank
problem alone it has to solve the
Palestinian
problem the Palestinian prime minister
we joining me now from Tel Aviv is Alan
leevy the spokes person for the Israeli
government thank you very much for
joining us if I can just uh find out
from you what is the position tonight
about the ground offensive are we close
to it are we not close to it what's
happening uh thank you for having me on
the show Kirsty first before I answer
that I would like to respond and say I
was truly appalled to listen to that
interview with the Palestinian prime
minister now he was questioned three
times pressed no fewer than three times
by your reporter whether he would
condemn the October 7th Massacre the
worst terror attack in world history
since 9911 brutally murdered 1,400
people and three times he refused to
condemn that attack in fact he said that
the Palestinian struggle against Israel
has been going on for a hundred years 25
years before the state of Israel was
even established and long before the 67
56 I think 56 years was the what was the
number of years said 100 he said 100
years he said 100 years but but I'm
going to go on and ask you a little bit
later uh about whether or not there's
going to be a position where anyone will
sit down with each other future but I
just want to get up to speed on what is
happening now why is there a hold up in
the ground
Invasion Israel is United now around a
single goal and that goal is total
Victory against Hamas in response to the
October 7th Massacre now when the next
stage of the Israeli operation is going
to continue I'm not going to speculate
on the movement of the troops that's
going to happen in accordance with our
operational needs but the response to
the October 7th Massacre that brutal
murder of 1,400 people whole families
burned in their homes children who are
cuffed families that were shot dead
tortured mutilated the response is going
to be the the total defeat of the terror
organization that conducted that but I
wonder if I wonder if the hostages I
wonder if the hostages are a factor or
not because when we have done interviews
it seems that that when the ground
Invasion starts if the hostages are
there so be it they may lose their lives
is that true Israeli Society at the
moment is sick with worry about the fate
of the hostages over 220 innocent men
women children who are being held
hostage by Hamas one of them is Ohad
this is Ohad he's 9 years old yesterday
was his ninth birthday he's the hostage
of Hamas two weeks ago he was visiting
his grandparents on the kibuts of NE o
when Hamas death squads invaded in the
morning they brutally murdered his uncle
and they took him together with his
grandparents Abraham and ruy both aged
78 and with his mother Karen into
captivity as hostages into the Gaza
Strip here he is with his parents his
father AI is sick with worry he doesn't
know whether Hamas stole his son's
glasses whether he saw dead bodies he
says he's taking sleeping pills every
night to try to sleep and he wakes up in
the morning and he feels guilty that he
wasn't thinking about them this is this
this is it is the most terrible conflict
and you you highlighted the plight of
that little boy but the truth and there
is no excuse but the truth is but the
truth is that no matter what children
everywhere are suffering children are
suffering in Gaza as well this is this
is this is a terrible situation
where and you would you would accept can
I just can I just ask you this that you
would accept that the children in Gaza
who have died and have been wounded by
the Israelis air strikes did not deserve
to die you accept that the humanitarian
suffering that we're seeing in response
to hamas's decision to declare war
against Israel on October 7th is truly
heartbreaking and I wish we weren't in
this situation and no one were getting
hurt this isn't a war that Israel
started it's not a war that Israel
wanted it's not a war that Israel even
expected off but what happens but what
happens is there was no Aid in today now
that affects children as well you need
to put fuel in so that the aquafers can
provide fresh water water is a human
right so how so therefore how does it
how does it help pure cause to make sure
that children don't get the medicine
never mind adults but ordinary
Palestinian is that children don't get
the medicine they need that children
don't get food that children don't get
water is that any way in a sense to
conduct this
conflict so let's set the record
straight first of all Aid is entering
the Gaza through the border with Egypt
not there was a consignment of trucks
and we're hopeful that will continue but
since you mentioned fuel it's important
to know that Hamas holds 500,000 lers of
fuel in the Gaza Strip right now I don't
know whether that includes the 24,000
lers of fuel that it stole from onra
from the the United Nations just a few
days ago but there is plenty of fuel in
the Gaza Strip the problem of course is
that the terror regime that controls the
Gaza Strip that conducted the October
7th Massacre is choosing to hog that
fuel in order to conduct order to
continue its war against Israel the fuel
is there fuel there plenty of it we're
very short time I want to ask you one
very uh short actually final question
what the Palestinian prime minister said
was that there's no leadership in Israel
ready to sit down is there a chance of
peace and peace talks between the
Palestinians and the
Israelis pery I very much hope that one
day we will be able to have peace in
this land but for now we have to destroy
Hamas we have to defeat the terror
organization that perpetrated the
October 7th Massacre because Israel
cannot go back to the conditions on the
sixth of October on the 7th of October
that cannot happen that would leave
Hamas free to Butcher and behead and
burn again thank you no way Israel can
afford that thank you much",20231025

humanitarian pause in the fighting
between Israel and Hamas so that
adequate Aid can be let into Gaza Israel
has allowed food and water and Medicine
into the territory but isn't allowing
fuel supplies over fears they'll end up
in the hands of Hamas the US Secretary
of State Anthony blinkin has proposed a
temporary law in
hostilities the war between Israel and
Hamas is having repercussions in every
corner of this volatile region our
Middle East correspondent yolan Nell
reports the slow trickle of Aid just
eight lores carrying water food and
Medicine made their way into Gaza last
night but what's not getting in is fuel
hospitals are struggling here Medics use
their phones to light the way as a
patient arrives as there's no fuel for
generators and they're overwhelmed by
casualties
Israel has banned fuel from entering the
territory saying Hamas designated as a
terrorist group by many Western
governments including the UK may use it
for military
purposes the UN agency which looks after
Palestinian refugees has warned it could
stop its operation in Gaza as soon as
tonight without
it if we do not get more fuel into Gaza
we as unra thear largest Aid agency in
Gaza will not be able to carry out any
humanitarian
operations with plenty of Aid building
up in Egypt there's frustration about
the sluggish relief effort this is one
of the wh truck loaded with the needed
urg urgent needs for patient inside Gaza
there is a trauma kits there is a
medicine and drugs there is a disposable
which is much needed now for the to
treat patient and to manage casuality
inside Gaza this baby was rescued by an
emergency cesarian after yesterday's
bombing inen Yunis its mom naen abua is
fighting for her life her husband a un
worker was killed and another five
family
members there's been a big jump in the
death toll with official Palestinian
figures showing many hundreds killed in
the past 24
hours at the UN the Secretary General
anonio gues said the bombardment and
blockade of Gaza violated international
law as did the use of civilians as human
Shields by Hamas I'm deeply concerned
about the clear violations of
international humanitarian law that we
are witnessing in
Gaza let me be clear no party to an
armed conflict is above International
humanitarian
law but diplomatic efforts continue now
international calls amounting for
humanitarian pors in fighting with the
US proposing a temporary lull in
hostilities short of a formal
ceasefire and while Israel's war with
Hamas is Raging there are other fronts
heating up thousands of troops are now
gathering on Israel's northern border
with Lebanon and there were strikes in
neighboring Syria overnight it adds to
the fears that what's happening in Gaza
will create wider Regional turmoil
yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem and Let's cross live now to
your land who's in Jerusalem your land
as you mentioned there the Israeli
government is pushing back against cause
for a pause or a ceasefire in this
conflict but how are people there in
Israel reacting to these calls from the
International
Community I mean this is all uh being
covered extensively in the Israeli media
as you would imagine um but really it's
the Israeli military that has sort of
been uh leading the the efforts here and
been talking about how Hamas in the past
has diverted fuel um that has uh gone to
the uh to the UN for its own military
infrastructure um so when it comes to a
pause in hostilities so that uh Aid can
get in in particular fuel um people are
saying well you know this is something
that Hamas has a responsibility here um
I mean it's very interesting because the
last few days there have been constant
questions about when a ground Invasion
uh might begin it does seem that the US
is putting pressure on Israel to hold
off on that at the moment and has now
come out with this new line about a sort
of temporary lull not a a full-on
ceasefire in order for Aid to get into
the people who really need it and and
How likely do you think that is because
over the last few weeks we've seen a lot
of support especially from Western
governments the United States the UK for
Israel's position but now there seems to
be a difference when it comes to the
humanitarian situation that's unfolding
right now in Gaza so what is the Israeli
government likely to do
now I mean certainly what we're seeing
is a lot of international pressure on
Israel it has ruled out itself uh any
idea of a a ceasefire in recent days but
maybe this new language um of a of a
temporary lull which the US Secretary
Anthony blinkin sort of made clear um
would be just in order for for AIDS to
get in to meet responsibilities for
civilians I mean there's been a lot of
uh diplomatic talk in the past 24 hours
about uh obligations under an
international law with when it comes to
protecting civilians saying that both
Hamas is hiding behind them using them
as human Shields but also this very
intense Israeli bombardment that is
seeing a really very high uh civilian uh
death toll according to the the local
Health authorities in Gaza more than 700
people killed in one day yesterday and
that was the biggest jump we've seen so
far in the death toll and these are just
really you know shocking images that are
going out the people are looking at all
around uh the world of of children who
are being killed in Gaza in particular
um the the the widespread destruction
that is taking place and yes calls are
growing internationally for
just some end to the hostilities even if
it's a temporary end others have been
calling Russia and the Arab countries
for a full on ceasefire but just to have
some kind of lull to let the aid in
there and just to explain um for our
viewers what's happening there at the
rougher Crossing so this is the only
open essentially open uh border into
Gaza uh on the border between Gaza and
Egypt but Israel does have a lot of
oversight in terms of what can get in
and out
that's correct so I mean yes this is the
only Crossing which is not operated by
Israel and Israel has said until its
hostages um come out of Gaza more than
200 people who are being held by Hamas
it will not open its Crossings again so
Egypt is the only option for now there
is plenty and plenty of Aid that has
been building up inside Egypt flown in
from around the world but huge sort of
disappointment and surp at how slow that
Aid is coming into Gaza um just eight
Lor loads yesterday and it was expected
that there would be a bigger Convoy even
then it's still a fraction of what used
to go into Gaza on a daily basis just to
meet people's ordinary um daily needs so
what the mechanism we haven't really got
full details of the um oversight that
Israel has but we know that there are
extremely stringent Security checks um
on everything that's going in and we've
seen uh prior to the rav cross in
opening uh several times Israel actually
bombed the area in air strikes around
the Raffa Crossing so it's made it very
clear that it can stop supplies going in
if it doesn't have those Security checks
carried out and um your land this is
shaping up to be a critical next few
hours according to the UN and Aid
agencies saying that they might have to
Hal their operations in Gaza because of
a lack of fuel what are we hearing about
the situation in guys are now as this
deadline the central deadline
approaches yeah I mean there have been
warnings for days about how fuel
supplies were dwindling and what's
actually happened is unrea it's the UN
Agency for Palestinian refugees and
because most of the 2.3 million people
living in Gaza are classed as refugees
so um has for a long time been
supporting them it has the biggest
footprint of any of the UN agencies in
the Gaza Strip so it's now been leading
um humanitarian operations and it's has
been going to its own fuel reserves what
it had uh and and working its way
through them sending small amounts
around to hospitals trying to keep
things going in their generators as much
as possible but now it's saying that
that fuel is completely completely uh
going to run out that means no fuel for
the the hospitals which is of course a
huge problem as we've been hearing but
also fuel is essential for other things
they're saying just to kind of have fuel
for the cars so that they can have their
their un workers get from place to place
in the Gaza Strip and then also fuel
could be used if it came in to run the
water desalination plants it could be
used to pump away sewage this is
something extremely important um with so
many people living in very overcrowded
uh conditions that can easily become um
unsanitary so really fuel is important
to so many operations but Israel remains
extremely concerned that any fuel that
would go in would go to Hamas and it's
been saying Hamas still has supplies ask
Hamas for fuel to power the hospitals

number of people injured I have seen
people treated in the corridor of the
hospitals people are treated in the
courtyard of the hospital because today
was one of the deadliest attack done by
Israel by Israel so far this hospital is
among like the three four Hospital in
the South it's the area where Israel
asked 1.2 million people in the north to
flee but this is the biggest one and
it's it's been struggling without
without fuel to run the main generator
in the hospital and also they said they
have to councel all of
nonessential operation and they are only
treating people with life saving
injury uh correspondent Rashi Abu Alou
reporting that from Gaza well Jeremy is
with me um Jeremy as we heard earlier
the UN at pains to be evenhanded in
criticizing both sides Israel and Hamas
but that doesn't make the Israeli
government's life any easier I think it
makes them really really angry that
they're getting any criticism at all
they are absolutely infuriated and
totally reject any suggestion that there
could be any equivalence in what's going
on uh Israelis are always very aware
Israeli politicians generals leaders
that when they start a military
operation if you like two clock start
ticking the first clock is how long they
need to get to fulfill their military
objectives and in this case they're
talking about sometimes perhaps months
not weeks the other clock is how long it
takes before the United Nations and
their friends as well as their enemies
demand a cease fire and I think that
What's Happening Here is because so many
people are being killed that the worst
um the largest number of Israelis killed
in a single day in the history of their
state and since then more than 5,000
Palestinians killed in Gaza in just a
couple of weeks uh I think because of
that that diplomatic clock has gone into
hyperdrive and so people in the UN are
saying we've got to have a cease fire
there's got to be a way of getting
humanitarian Aid in safely and people
have to stop dying the Israelis on the
other hand are saying they have barely
started the ground operation hasn't
started yet now what normally happens
what is happening right now is that the
Americans cover them their diplomatic
backs and also Britain's helping the
French helping French president macron
was was here as well but I think this
pressure will continue to mount because
of those scenes coming out of Gaza and I
think the Israelis will not be put off
by that though they are aware that if
you like the legitimacy of their
operation will ultimately be affected by
the numbers of people being killed but
don't forget all the estimates are that
if the Israeli army goes in on the
ground to Gaza and the Prime Minister Mr
Netanyahu was saying again today to
soldiers that
the next phase is coming and you will be
the
spearhead if that happens there will be
many more pal Palestinian casualties so
I think there there going to be a lot
more anger at the United Nations and
other places and I think the Americans
are going to be protecting them vetoing
resolutions they've already vetoed one
that they see as uh as detrimental to
Israel's interest but it's interesting
that right from the outset President Joe
Biden has been saying yes Israel has the
right to defend itself but it has to do
it within the framework of international
humanitarian law and tonight no less a
person the UN Secretary General is
saying that that is being violated",20231024

diplomacy that's ongoing well right now
actually in the past week we have seen a
number of world leaders head to Israel
uh to offer support and try to
deescalate the crisis today it was
Emanuel macron of France France here he
is as you can see next to Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu he expressed
solidarity with Israel says the first
objective of the war should be to free
all hostages and he says it was Israel's
duty to fight against Hamas but he
warned against enlarging the conflict
let's take a listen I consider that this
is an International Coalition in order
to fight against these terrorist groups
that we have to
build I REM I just reminded my people in
my language what we discussed about
fight against terrorism humanitarian
action rules to be respected but as well
political process and obviously I warned
against an escalation and I want esbah
and some other regimes not to be part of
what's
happening I know how committed you are
let me Express once again my solidarity
my
friendship and the fact that France
stands with you so International
diplomacy in Israel also in New York too
a meeting of the UN Security Council is
under away un Secretary General Antonio
gues condemned the Hamas attacks and
said he was deeply concerned about what
he described as a clear violations of
international humanitarian law in Gaza
he said even War has rules and that the
Hamas attack on October 7th did not take
place in a vacuum nothing can justify
the deliberate killing injuring and
kidnapping of civilians or the launching
of rockets against civilian
targets all hostages must be treated
humanely and released immediately and
without
conditions it is important to also
recognize the attacks by amas did not
happen in a
vacuum the Palestinian people have been
subjected to 56 years of suffocating
occupation well the Israeli foreign
minister was not impressed with the
secretary uh General's comments take a
listen these kids witness orror which
cannot be described by
word Mr Secretary General
in what world do you
live definitely this is not our
world this is a terrorist of
Hamas what he said in there in Arabs he
telling to
his mother and
fathers that he's proud that he has
blood of 10 Jewish that he
murdered what monster they gave a birth
to Secretary General this is the world
that we live foreign minister Eli Cohen
there and in the last hour we have heard
that he has also cancelled a planned
meeting with Secretary General gues that
was scheduled for this evening we also
heard uh from the top Palestinian
Authority Diplomat the ongoing massacres
being deliberately and systematically
and savagely perpetrated by Israel the
occupying power against the Palestinian
civilian population under its illegal
occupation Must Be Stopped the security
Council has a duty to stop them the
International Community is obliged under
international law to stop them it is our
Collective human duty to to stop them
now continued failure at this council is
inexcusable and let's take you live to
New York to show you that uh the meeting
is still ongoing we are keeping our eyes
and ears across it whilst we do that
let's speak to Lieutenant General Mark
schz former US security coordinator for
Israel and the Palestinian Authority uh
who is now with the Rand Corporation an
American nonprofit or organization thank
you very much for coming on the
program thank you Lois it's good to be
with you can I just get your reaction
first of all just to the uh diplomacy
and the words we've heard from around
that table this
afternoon well I I think there are two
realities um certainly the reality that
uh you know from October 7th and what
the uh families of the victims of that
horrific terrorist attack and the
subsequent kidnapping of 200 Israelis
that are still being held by Hamas but
there's also the reality of the
Palestinian people and um I think it's
accurate and important to highlight uh
what is happening inside of Gaza uh
specifically with you know the impact of
the ongoing uh air and addiction
campaign for Preparation uh for the
ground offensive and as important but
not spoken a lot about are the ongoing
confrontations that are occurring
between the Israeli security forces and
the West Bank settlers provocations by
settlers in the West Bank and the
violence that's ensued over the course
of uh you know certainly well before
October 7th but in Earnest now since uh
the October 7th terrorist attack and and
I want to bring in the role of the US
here what in your eyes is the role what
what is it in practice in relation to
its uh strong Allied relationship with
Israel and what do you think it to be
trying to
do well
certainly as we know they're our
strongest Ally in the region and we're
giving unequivocal support to uh the
Israeli government certainly to the
military to include the recent
deployment of not only the two carrier
strike groups but also senior military
advisers to share our lessons uh that we
experienced in Iraq uh both in the initi
found as in Fusia and then subsequent to
the liberation of mosul from from Isis
so very important but also what we're
doing to emphasize the importance of
alleviating the humanitarian suffering
that's ongoing um in Gaza as well as
West Bank you know not welln but the US
has historically been the largest single
donor to support the Palestinian people
from both humanitarian assistance as
well as um security assistance in the
West Bank so I think it's important that
we continue to emphasize the rules of
law as it comes to uh Warfare but also
to do all we can in you know speaking
with Israel certainly but also the
broader International Community to
alleviate the humanitarian suffering
that's occurring in Gaza specifically
and there have been reports in Us Media
that the Biden Administration has been
urging Israel to delay any ground
incursion into Gaza more time for
hostage negotiations is the presumption
do you think that is happening or ought
to be
happening I I I there's certainly
dialogue occurring um while there's
ongoing discussions and negotiations and
we've seen you've just reported the
release now of four um hostages two
American and two Israeli and ideally
there will there will be many more um in
the coming days so I I do think while
dialogue ongoing it's important that um
the ground offensive is not does not
commence because once that occurs I
believe any type of dialogue with Hamas
with respect to releasing of the
hostages will cease um I think also
what's occurring behind the scenes is
the discussion of the Strategic
objective uh Beyond just
eliminating the Hamas military
capability and it's and the political
cap you know political structure of H
also what what is Gaza going to like in
the Palestinians subsequent to this land
uh okay will take place liutenant

much for your time we are right out of

Xslg6RFtA3g,UN agency warns Gaza operation could end tomorrow without more fuel – BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\UN agency warns Gaza operation could end tomorrow without more fuel – BBC News.jpg,"straight away to tomara arifi who's the
spokesperson for Ana who of course are
working there on the ground in Gaza
thank you so much for being here on the
program and the Secretary General
referencing the amount of your staff
that are being lost in this conflict and
those numbers continue to go up 35 now
in
total yes uh the Secretary General set
the bar I think for where we all stand
as humanitarians with a very very urgent
call for a humanitarian ceasefire and
for the application of international
humanitarian law that is particularly
relevant to my colleagues at unra the
fact that unra the largest UN agency in
Gaza has already lost 35 Staff members
women and men doctors Engineers nurses
you name it it
is devastating it is shocking and it is
appalling so we stand behind the UN
secretary General's call for a respect
for all civilians those who have nothing
to do with this conflict including Aid
workers including my own colleagues at
Ana now your agency spoke to the BBC
only a couple of hours ago issued a
warning today about how much longer you
can keep going what are you saying be
very clear about what that warning is
the warning is if we do not get more
fuel into Gaza we as unra the largest
Aid agency in Gaza will not be able to
carry out any humanitarian operations
and that is because we need the fuels
for our trucks that uh that whole
conversation about convoys coming in
from Rafa we need fuel so so that our
trucks can pick up that Aid we need fuel
for our water desalination PL so that
people can have access to clean water
hospitals need fuel for life-saving
machines without which people can die so
fuel is a top urgency my colleagues in
Gaza have confirmed that we have enough
fuel for about two to three days after
that we will not be able to work neither
will the bakeries that need fuel
electricity neither will the water
salination plant or the life-saving
machines and hospitals just just be very
clear because one of your colleagues
said you had enough fuel to last till
tomorrow night is that what you're
saying and also just tell me the
consequences if you get no more fuel the
consequences if you have to Halt
operations if we get no fuel we cannot
work and people can die people can die
because there will will no longer be
electricity in hospitals for life-saving
machines people will no longer have
access to bread that is almost the only
thing people are eating now and that is
because Ona and the world food program
have been Distributing wheat flour to
bakeries in those bakeries in order to
make bread we need electricity and water
for the wheat the water we get it
through a water desalination plant that
works through a generator that is
powered with the fuel so if we don't get
the fuel there's no water there is no
baking Bakery and there is no machines
in hospitals and there will be no trucks
to pick up the humanitarian supplies
from the borders let me put to you what
Israel their army spokesman has said
that Hamas is stockpiling fuel can you
understand the reasons why fuel is not
being allowed in to you and others that
that are being actually given and
articulated no I cannot understand it as
a representative of a humanitarian
agency we are not responsible for what a
party at war is doing we are responsible
for enabling our own humanitarian
operations and therefore it is not okay
to not allow the UN and the larger
humanitarian Community to have access to
something as basic as fuel for our cars
so so tell me what conditions are like
in the UN hospitals in the UN schools
which are being used as shelters and
which parts of the Gaza Strip are
currently where AID is needed the most
the North or the
South Aid is needed everywhere people
are displaced everywhere there was a
huge wave of displacement about a week
ago from the north of the strip to the
south of the strip so there is
overcrowding in unaa shelters in the
south of the strip up to 600,000 people
are now living in around 150 unest
schools for a bit of visuals these are
regular schools and all of a sudden two
three four thousand people live day and
night in these schools with very little
access to water living in very
unsanitary conditions a few hundred
people sharing one toilet very little
water for showering very little food so
the conditions are extremely dire the UN
Secret General said that they're they're
growing more dire by the hour over the
last week or 10 days your agency has
made multiple warnings exactly as you
are doing today in terms of people
listening what is your sense of it is
there frustration do you think that
anyone is actually listening to any of
these
warnings there's a lot of frustration
about having to negotiate for two weeks
for very small restricted convoys of
much needed humanitarian supplies to go
in we can choose to hail the
Breakthrough to celebrate the break the
Breakthrough and the entry of 20 trucks
on the first day three days ago to Gaza
and then 14 and then another 20 we can
also go back and say to the
International Community and those who
have influence and say before this
conflict up to 500 truck went into Gaza
every day loaded with supplies aund of
these trucks were humanitarian
assistance 45 of these trucks every day
were loaded with fuel I I've only got 30
seconds left so really briefly if you
could can you imagine what it is going
to be like on the ground if you have to
halt your operations and if there is a
ground offensive less than 30 seconds it
is going to be hell on
Earth well tomorrow thank you than you
so much for joining us here on BBC News
with that assessment and responding to
what we just heard from the UN Secretary
General as that meeting convenes in New
York",20231024
1ps-nFB_k1A,Israel-Gaza: Two more hostages released by Hamas - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel-Gaza Two more hostages released by Hamas - BBC News.jpg,"across Gaza there's widespread
destruction as Israel's military has
continued to pound targets from the air
it says it's preparing unrelenting
attacks to dismantle Hamas but most of
the more than 5,000 Palestinians who've
been killed are
civilians the United Nations says 20
lores of Aid entered via the Rafa
Crossing yesterday with food water and
medicine but no desperately needed fuel
to power hospitals and pump water it's
estimated that 1.4 million people are
homeless including the Abasi family who
are originally from Blackpool speaking
here at the Rafa Crossing we had to run
from our house in the middle of the
night and many buildings near us have
been bombed and that and one night we
had to run to the hospital because um we
we heard the noise in the street and we
thought the house across from us was
going to get bombed and now we're just
here today waiting for the raff
acrossing to open
inshallah the release of two more
Israeli hostages the third and fourth
four in 3 days gives just a glimmer of
hope that International mediators can
achieve more yoland Nell BBC News
Jerusalem well for more on developments
in the region let's go live now to our
correspondent Hugo Bacha who's in
southern Lebanon and Hugo we have the
French President Emmanuel macron
arriving in Tel Aviv this morning visits
like this do send a message to actors
who might want to get involved in this
conflict I'm speaking about Hezbollah in
southern Lebanon where you are what kind
of a message does it send to to
Hezbollah yeah Katherine so I think a
number of Western officials have warned
hollah and also Iran which backs groups
across the region uh against any kind of
escalation in this conflict so I'm here
in southern Lebanon near the Lebanese
Israeli borders so a lot of attention
has been on this uh part of the region
because of these crossb border attacks
that have been happening uh between
Hezbollah and Palestinian factions here
in Lebanon and the Israeli Army and I
think again perhaps we're going to hear
a message from the French President
later today warning uh different players
groups countries in the region against
any kind of escalation and it's
interesting that yesterday again
American officials raise their concerns
about the possibility of an escalation
of violence across the region uh Kirby
the White House National Security
spokesman said that the Biden
Administration was deeply concerned
about the potential for any significant
escalation of attacks in recent days and
uh we've been talking about Hezbollah in
the last few days but it's very
interesting and very important to say
that there have been a number of
incidents across the middle east in
recent days uh in Syria in Iraq um basis
housing uh American soldiers have been
uh targeting
in drones in drone and Rocket attacks
and uh and I think the suspicion here
and the accusation actually that was
made yesterday by Mr Kirby is that Iran
is encouraging those groups and actively
facilitating uh some of those attacks so
the concern uh obviously is that uh
there could be an escalation in those
attacks being carried out by groups all
across the region and hug go over the
weekend Israel carried out one of its
biggest air strikes on Southern Lebanon
since this conflict began where do
things stand at the moment in terms of
the crossb skirmishes we've been seeing
where you
are so the last week saw uh an
intensification of those uh attacks and
the situation is obviously very tense
here yesterday we visited some Villages
along the border uh many residents have
left uh one of those Villages was
completely deserted so that gives you a
sense of how concerned
people are on this side of the border
and yesterday I think we had a figure of
19,000 residents whove left that was a
figure that was released by The
International Organization for migration
so uh many residents are fleeing uh some
of those border Villages many people
still remember the devastation brought
by the 2006 war between Hezbollah and
Israel so again I think many fear that
history might be repeating itself thank
you very much that's our correspondent
in southern Lebanon Hugo Bacha well
let's go live now to Anna Foster who's
in Northern Israel and Anna over the
last few days you've been speaking to
families who have hostages members of
their family who are held hostage in
Gaza what has been the reaction to the
release of yoked and nit last
night that's right Katherine I think
what you see here in Israel is a a
strong grouping of those families who
have have lost loved ones who saw them
taken away to to Gaza more than 200 we
know hostages of different nationalities
many of them Israeli are still being
held in Gaza um I think every time there
is a a hostage Rel uh release there is
hope yesterday there was a lot of talk
about whether or not there was going to
be a larger hostage release um there
were discussions about whether as many
as 50 hostages could be released by
Hamas now that was never confirmed
confirmed it was always something that
was being um discussed in the background
and and speculated on and of course when
those moments happen you know the
families they hope Beyond hope don't
they that their their loved ones who
they haven't heard from for more than
two weeks now uh might be among those
groups but it seems to be happening
still in very limited numbers we know
there's a lot of diplomatic work
happening behind the scenes to try and
ensure those hostage releases uh we know
that from hamas's point of view it
serves them to to keep hostages because
that is one of the things that could
continue a delay of a possible uh
Israeli ground offensive you know the
concern that hostages may be killed or
injured in that but in terms of the
families you know they are having an
enormously difficult time at the moment
there is very little information that is
coming out about uh the missing and you
know as every day goes on I mean one
family that I I'd um spent some time
with you know it was their their
daughter's funeral their 18-year-old
daughter was shot dead by Hamas during
those attacks and they had bury her just
a couple of days ago and her father
who's been taken hostage was not there
for that moment that was so difficult
for the whole family um and there are
stories many many stories like that I
think that's what people are focusing a
lot on right now and Anna with each
hostage release that we've seen very few
four of them in the past week it does
put a spotlight on the other 200 people
who are being held in Gaza and the
pressure has been put towards the
government in Israel to make sure that
those more than 200 people remain safe
during any kind of operation what have
we been hearing from the Israeli
government about how they're going to
handle this delicate
situation well the Israeli government
say that they are supporting the
families of these hostages but of course
you know the the military operation that
they are looking at carrying out the
fact that there are hostages inside Gaza
they don't know the locations of those
hostages there is every chance that they
would have been split into different
places es we know that there are tunnels
underneath Gaza that are used by Hamas
it's possible that they are holding
people underground or or you know in
buildings where they may be storing
weapons there are so many factors to be
taken into account and doubtless the
Israeli military when they are making
their plans for the next stage will be
considering all of those things and then
simultaneously you have you know the
Diplomatic discussions that are going on
the Israeli government but also the
Americans the US government have been
getting involved in these negotiations
and cut as well a big diplomatic player
in the Middle East region have also been
involved in those talks you know some of
um hamas's senior leadership are based
in qat so that has been a big part of
what's going on as well you know the The
Diplomatic work on one side and on the
other side those considerations about
how a potential ground offensive could
happen when there are still as you
rightly say so many hostages more than
200 being held inside Gaza",20231024

from an elderly Israeli woman released
overnight from captivity in Gaza by
Hamas that's 16 days after having been
abducted from her home in a kibutz in
southern Israel close to the border with
Gaza yed liit says that a doctor
attended to her during her time in
captivity she said the hostages that she
was with were given medicine and she was
she said that after her capture once
inside Gaza she was taken into a network
of tunnels underneath the Gaza Strip she
described them as looking like a spider

her account my mom is telling the
horrific stories she's saying that many
many people a swarm of people came
through the fence the defense cost 2 and
a half billion shekels and it didn't
help even a little bit my mom is saying
that she was taken on a back of of a
motorbik with her body uh with her legs
on one side and her head on another side
that she was taken through the plowed
Fields with a man in front on one side
and a man behind her and that while she
was do being taken she was hit by a

into a large are Hall about 25 hostages
were gathered and after two or three
hours those hostages five of them she
among them were taken into a separate

conflict to stop it from spreading to
The Wider region the French President
Emmanuel maon has become the latest
world leader to to visit Israel first in
a show of strong solidarity speaking
alongside his Israeli counterpart Isaac
Herzog he said the first objective of
Israel's war in Gaza should be to secure
the release of all the hostages
president Manon added that it was
Israel's duty to fight against Hamas
without enlarging the conflict he's due
to visit the Palestinian president
Mahmud abas in the occupied West Bank
later today if I'm here with my my
delegation it's indeed first to express
our support and solidarity and share
your
pain what happened 7th of
October is an hour full terrorist attack
against your people your
nation it's right
and it was an immense shock for the
whole planet especially in
France I'm here to express our
solidarity today and
tomorrow and that was Emanuel maon
speaking earlier alongside Israel's
president Isaac Herzog Mr maon is
currently meeting Israel's prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh and this
is part of a two visit to the region
what can he achieve in this time we live
now to fris Joseph shishan A former
French diplomat and consultant at the
Strategic advisory firm Flint Global
thank you very much for uh for joining
us today of course we've we've just been
hearing from one of the elderly Israeli
hostages who uh they were both released
overnight and we've been hearing about
uh this particular hostages yov liit how
should was taken into the Gaza Strip and
how she was treated there Emanuel maon
says releasing all of the hostages has
to be a top priority for Israel
today yes I mean this is one of the key
objectives of em macon's visit to the
region alongside showing unequivocal and
ambiguous support to to Israel and the
right to Israel to defend itself um and
also at the same time avoiding or trying
to Avid working towards avoiding
escalation of the conflict for in the
waterer region um while protecting the
human humanitarian situation in in in in
in Palestine in Gaza in particular so
it's a very delicate balancing exercise
that the president has to do while um
visiting the region um and I think there
are 24 French people that have been
killed in the attack two weeks ago um
and also um around I mean seven people
perhaps who have been taken hostage
while French national French Israeli
dual Nationals um so so this is going to
be an important focus of the present
visit
indeed and also dual Nationals amongst
the uh civilian population inside Gaza
we've seen um many Gaza civilians
holding foreign passports uh in the in
the air um and obviously appealing to uh
their governments to to try and help
them amongst those fronts but as you say
Emanuel M has a very delicate Balancing
Act here he wants to stop the conflict
spreading in the wide region but Express
strong solidarity for Israel but also
explain concern about Palestinian
civilians and what we've been hearing is
anger amongst Palestinians and in The
Wider Middle East at countries Western
countries like France accusing them of
hypocrisy of not caring enough about
Palestinian uh civilians in this case uh
emphasizing Israel's right to defend
itself whereas they say and this was
said again at the Europeans at a at a
peace Summit in Cairo they're accusing
the west of hypocrisy um in its attitude
with uh towards ukrainians when Russia
invaded
there I think the president has been
very clear about the humanitarian
situation and the need to uh to protect
civilians within the Gaza Strip that has
been a constant message of the French
government of the French President um so
um you know there was a time at the
start of the crisis where you know
strong support and unequivocal support
for Israel was was necessary given the
scale of the attack and the shock that
it represented in uh in many if not all
Western and European countries in
particular um and I think the purpose of
the trip uh of the president to the
region is really to deliver that message
message extremely strongly while um uh
make taking steps and and you know also
conveying the message that respecting
humanitarian law international human
humanitarian is also an very important
if not um decisive element of the crisis
um to to work towards um a resolution at
some point I think this is also what the
the Pres trip is about to start um a
discussion not just with Israeli by the
way because the president as we say is
going to meet mmud Abbas as well and
he's going to talk to Arab leaders as
well in the next couple of days um so
this is going to be a long conflict and
I think the president is sort of
positioning France as a key intell in
the region to prepare the ground for the
resolution of the conf conflict but this
is going to take time and this is going
to also require coordination among
Western countries and the EU as as we
speak is is also trying to coordinate a
coherent position um for the conflict
going
forward but it it is although it's not
doing very well I mean there's
disagreement amongst the EU 27 countries
about their exact uh position here we
did see France um release a statement
alongside the United States Canada Italy
Germany and the UK so there are attempts
at working together in diplomatic terms
but this also hits home for France
directly doesn't it I mean France is
home to the biggest Jewish community in
Europe and the biggest Muslim Community
in Europe and France is is worried about
the conflict coming
home yes indeed absolutely and that also
explains partly why the president is of
waiting have waited has waited a few
days before uh going into into Israel
there was there was some issues
internally domestically that need needed
to be addressed and we've seen the
terror attacks in north of France
shortly after um the attack in Israel
that that really shocked the country um
and um and the president was very much
focused on on that for for a few days um
and we continue to be focused on that
you know to protect the the security
because there is a clear sense that the
the um the crisis in the Middle East is
having a political impact in Western
countries that has always been the case
but you're right specifically in France
there is a a specific situation here
which means that this particular
conflict has huge ramifications for for
France both socially and politically and
we have seen also um the crisis within
the leftwing Coalition um in France
because of the positioning of some some
political leaders so the the conflict is
starting to also you know affect the
political landscape as a whole and and
the balancing exercise that I was
talking about for Israel also applies to
France and the president um is is also
aiming at at you know preserving
stability and Security in France",20231024

we've been uh reporting two further
hostages have reportedly been released
this evening that's according to Hamas
uh those individuals uh we have not uh
at the moment received any uh
independent verification on that but
those details have been coming through
in the last hour 90 minutes or so I'm
we're going to talk now with someone who
has extensive experience in trying to
negotiate for the release of hostages
from Gaza Albert Matan he is a
co-founder of the conflict mediation
group forward thinking thank you very
much for coming on the
program thank you for the invitation so
since we uh we invited you this
developing news in the last 90 minutes
as I mention two more hostages released
according to Hamas we await uh
independent verification of that whilst
we do what's your reaction to it well I
think it's a good sign and it's exactly
a week go today I was in DOA and I
conveyed through channels the desire to
release all of the civilan hostages and
without any preconditions so I hopeful
hopefully this could be the beginning
but it takes two two Tango as to say if
I can put it that way um you know that
without the willingness on both sides to
secure the safe Passage of all the
civilian hostages I think people will be
in
danger okay can you take us as it were
into the room where it's happening
behind the curtain what what we received
in in in from the social media account
uh the Hamas statement they talked about
Qatar Egypt
mediation what what does that mean
what's going on well it it means
messages are passed um there's never
direct engagement between
um Israeli officials and Hamas officials
they don't meet together they have
always used intermediaries to pass
messages and it's a longterm usually
long term because usually there uh quid
proquo you know what do we get for this
who do we get and so forth in this
particular case I understand I think it
was the the operatives who went into
Israel committed the atrocities and I
think it's inexcusable The Taking
indiscriminately of civilians um that
they they made a mistake and the way I
would see it is that Hamas are Keen to
hand back all the civilian hostages now
I stress civilian as opposed to the
military okay that's that's an important
distinction you mentioned quid
proquo would it be your understanding
that the
uh four people released if if we do get
confirmation of the latest two that
there will be something in place then
and and what what could that be well
leis from the conversations I had in DOA
I I think the the fact they civilians
there were to be no conditions they were
going to be handed back as soon as
conditions um allowed for the safety
because you wouldn't keep 200 or it
won't be 200 it'll be I don't know how
many civilians but you would not keep
them all in the same place so it's a
question of how do you move such numbers
around Gaza do you release them 2 by two
or whatever I would hope not I would
hope that we could have a ceasefire that
we could create conditions in which a
process of exchange could take place and
I say that should take place in these
circumstances without any conditions
interesting you've made the distinction
civilian and not what therefore is the
process and protocol around non civilian
hostages well the practice of taking
soldiers and I'm explaining it not
endorsing it not justifying it but the
practice of capturing Israeli soldiers
was simply to use those young people as
leverage to release Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails currently
before this um outbreak um of cycle of
violence you might say renewal of that
cycle um there were about
4,000 um is
Palestinian um prisoners in Israeli
jails now some of those were convicted
some were on the the detention without
trial and the capture of a soldier was a
precious commodity if I can put it that
way a bargaining chip in which you would
get these cases reviewed I think the
answer to it for me would have been for
Israel to after the Shalit deal to have
introduced a review system of all cases
and have had an independent review of
all the convicted Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jail so that there could be
some hope of people being released at
present there's no hope for many of
them murnan absolutely fascinating to
get your behind the scenes expertise
thank you very much for coming on the
program thank you leas and let's hope
the news tonight is the beginning of
something that will be ongoing and all
of those hostages will be returned to
their families Oliver mcturner thank
you I just want to bring you an update
to this uh in the last few minutes CBS
News which is the BBC's media partner in
uh the US then are reporting uh the two
hostages are being released by Hamas an
Israeli government official has
confirmed to CBS News uh the names of
the two as well so uh just to outline
exactly how the process of verification
and Confirmation in these kind of
situations works we had initially the
statement on social media by Hamas
through Hamas uh media channels uh which
we then take and clearly investigate we
don't take that on its own uh the way
that media organizations work around the
world and BBC included is you have
Partnerships with different with other
uh media organizations ours in the US is
CBS news they have spoken to an Israel
government official uh confirming to CBS
News uh the names of the hostages and in
terms of how this plays out last week
when we had the first two uh um hostages
being released released uh after the CBS
News confirmation BBC did independently
uh confirm a pretty short time after
that too uh right let's take a look at
another post that's just come up on uh
social media you can see from the
icrc let's see what they saying about it
we facilitated the release of two more
hostages transporting them out of Gaza
this evening our role as a neutral
intermediary makes this work possible
and we are ready to facilitate any
further release we hope that they will
soon be back with their loved ones and
to re reiterate what happened the last
time last week with two hostages was a
similar uh process and it wasn't until
uh that they were confirmed safe on
Israeli territory that we then heard
from uh officials and authorities in
Israel confirming things like uh name
and status of the two hostages so we
will wait and see if and when uh that
happens but clearly more confirmation
coming through that two two Israeli
hostages uh have been released by Hamas
we're going to keep across all those
details for you and when of course the
BBC established our own independent
verification we'll bring that to you as
well",20231023

Palestinian Authority have condemned
Israel for what they called the
collective punishment of civilians in
Gaza they've been speaking at a peace
Summit in Cairo now in the last hour the
UK's foreign secretary James cleverly
condemned the actions of Hamas but said
he's spoken to the Israeli government
about its duty to act in accordance with
international law I am sure we all share
the revoltion at hamas's murderous acts
of terrorism the targeting of the uh
civilians the murdering of children the
desecration of dead bodies and I'm sure
we are all distressed by the plight of
Palestinian civilians in Gaza whose
lives have been made harder more painful
and more dangerous because of the brutal
attacks by Hamas on the 7th of
October and we all mourn the Dead
both Israeli and
Palestinian James cleverly there well
we've also heard from Palestinian
president Mahmud Abbas he's the head of
the Palestinian Authority which has
control over areas of the occupied West
Bank but not the Hamas ran Gaza Strip
now he used his opening remarks to say
that Palestinians will not be forced off
their land
and we warn against any attempts to
displace our people in Gaza Beyond its
borders we also warn against any
evictions of Palestinians from their
homes or displacement from Jerusalem or
the West
Bank we will not accept displacement we
will remain steadfast on our land no
matter the
challenges the UN Secretary General
Antonio guz described the scene out the
Rafa Crossing as a human catastrophe
after his visit on
Friday a 20 TR vo of the Egyptian red
crescent is moving today and I want to
express my deep gratitude to Egypt for
the central role Egypt is playing in
this
regard but the people of Gaza need a
commitment for much much more a
continuous delivery of Aid to Gaza at
the scale that is needed and we are
working nonstop with all parties that
are relevant to make it
happen excellencies let's be clear
the Grievances of the Palestinian people
are legitimate and
long we cannot and must not ignore the
wider context for these tragic events
the long-standing conflict and 56 years
of occupation with no end in
sight but nothing can justify the
reprehensible assault by Hamas that
aoriz the terrorized Israeli
civilians and those abhorent attacks can
never justify by the collective
punishment of the Palestinian
people institutional humanitarian law
including the Geneva conventions must be
upheld and that includes protecting
civilians and not attacking hospitals
schools and un premises that are
currently Sheltering half a million
people excellencies our near-term goals
must be clear immediate and restricted
and sustained humanitarian aid for B
civilians in
Gaza immediate and unconditional release
of all
hostages and immediate and dedicated
efforts to prevent the spread of
violence which is increasing the risk of
spillover to advance all these efforts I
appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire
now excellencies our sustained
Collective efforts and resources have
never been needed more as we focus on
ending the Bloodshed we cannot lose
sight of the only realistic foundation
for a true peace and stability a
two-state
solution Israelis must see their
legitimate needs for security
materialized and Palestinians must see
their legitimate aspirations for an
independent state realized in line with
with United Nations resolutions
international law and previous
agreements the time has come for
action action to end this godol God awul
Nightmare and action to build a future
worthy of the dreams of the children of
Palestine Israel the region and our
world
shukran Egyptian president Abdul Fat Al
CI told leaders at that Summit that the
aim is to end the humanitarian disaster
in the Gaza Strip and revive a path to
peace between Israel and the
Palestinians we warn against any
attempts to displace our people in Gaza
Beyond its borders we also warn against
any evictions of Palestinians from their
homes or displacement from Jerusalem or
the West
Bank we will not accept displacement we
will remain steadfast on our land no
matter the
challenges well for more on all of this
let's go live to our BBC Arabic reporter
Abdul Bas Hassan who is in Cairo at that
conference for us thanks very much for
joining us just bringing us up to date
on the latest uh with what's happening
where you
are yes the participants are in a break
now for almost half an hour expectedly
they would issue a final statement uh
after this uh break uh which mainly May
feature According to some experts who
have been following this event in Cairo
a call for an immediate ceasefire number
one number two protecting the civilian I
from both sides number three of course
the uh opening and increasing the span
of the operation of extending Aid
humanitarian assistance and food water
fuel and other supplies uh uh to Gaza uh
almost like an hour ago uh some Western
uh foreign ministers have talked in uh
the session uh they raised an among what
they said that Israel has the ref the
right to defend itself but the
international laws in this regard should
be respected this is their call others
have promised more uh supplies and more
uh funds for supplying Palestinians with
needs especially Norway and Canada uh of
course the main call still is an
immediate seiz fire and uh some some of
this who spoke minutes ago have called
for the International Community
represented in the security Council to
reconsider it stand some of them blamed
the failure or what they called failure
by the UN Security Council to try to
find a solution an immediate solution
for the current conflict and the others
of course said or demanded that the
roots of the issue should be addressed
in a wider consideration of the needs
demands and uh the conditions of both
sides uh there are calls that or remarks
including destruction wouldn't bring or
would not bring uh Prosperity therefore
they considered both sides are losers
and therefore the uh call for a
permanent solution markedly by the
establishment of Palestinian State
remained a a major call here and of
course uh a call for immediate release
for hostages but still the uh uh demand
for supplies for Gaza is rising here um
Abdul Bas one thing that struck me is
that this conference that you are at
doesn't have representatives from Israel
Iran or the US so how much progress can
be made when everyone isn't actually
around that
table let's consider the fact that some
countries especially the United the
Europeans said they don't expect a lot
from the uh conference but at least it
is the first political consensus here
for a group of leaders a group of head
of state to discuss this issue after 15
days the US is represented by and and
someone said it is the lowest
representation by its Char Affairs in
Egypt while of course some other
European countries are represented by
their head their Prime Ministers
including uh uh uh Italy and uh uh
therefore the what's expected here today
is just a common ground on what should
be done now immediately and of course
waiting for more inter from the United
the UN Security Council okay for the
moment Abdul bassir Hassan who is live
at that Summit in Cairo for us thank you
very much",20231021

the Rafa Crossing between Egypt and the
Gaza Strip has just opened as you can
see the first trucks loaded with food
water and medicines desperately needed
by civilians inside Gaza are able to
start Crossing it's unclear how long
that Crossing will remain open Israel
had agreed to let the first 20 trucks
through uh but all sides have imposed
conditions on those deliveries Israel
sealed its borders with Gaza so that
means the rougher Crossing between Egypt
and Gaza is the only way right now to
let in vital aid supplies one other big
question is whether foreign passport
holders and duel Nationals at least 600
of whom are American according to the US
state department may be allowed out
through that
Crossing Tamara arfi from anra from the
United Nations organization gave us this
update from her team on the ground in
Gaza very tragic 17 of my un colleagues
were killed in the last two weeks I
would like to remind that unra has
13,000 staff in Gaza most of them almost
all of them minus a few are themselves
gazans from Gaza they for most are
Sheltering in unra schools and unra
shelters and where they are they are
doing all they can so for instance we
have Mobile Medical Teams doing the
rounds in about 90 shelters in the
middle and South regions of Gaza also
bread has continued to arrive to
different shelters thanks to cooperation
with the world food program but as Gaza
is running out of clean water people
have been drinking water that is not fit
for human consumption and this also
causes a huge risk for our ability and
the wfp's ability and the bakery's
ability to continue making bread if
there is no clean water our call has
been very clear clean water has to go
into Gaza fuel must go into Gaza to be
able to nourish the water desalination
plants of unra and UNICEF so that we and
civilians have access to clean drinking
water basic medical supplies we're
talking about paracetamol antibiotics
and Insulin have to go in this is why
when we speak about the Convoy getting
ready to go into Gaza our call is that
this should not be a one-off as welcome
as it is it should be a continuous
unimpeded and safe access of Aid convoys
and Personnel into the entire strip
North middle and South not just the
South and that was Tamara alfi from the
United Nations organization anra uh the
key Aid agency uh on the ground inside
the Gaza Strip talking about the need
for Aid uh as we've been saying already
in the last hour the border crossing
between Egypt and the Gaza Strip has
opened to allow the first trucks of much
needed uh Aid allowed in the
practicalities of which we will
hopefully be finding out as we go along
there's been a tweet in the last moments
from the UK foreign secretary James
cleverly who's been uh moving around the
region in recent days he says uh on the
subject of the trucks going into the
Gaza Strip This Aid is a Lifeline he
says for those who are suffering but it
cannot be a oneoff the UK continues to
push for humanitarian access uh to Gaza
and we will be bringing you up to date
of course uh this morning with those a
trucks going in",20231021

of tonight's hostage
releases Natalie ranan and her mother
Judith flanked by Israeli soldiers
emerged into Israel after negotiations
led by Kat they' come from Chicago to
visit family in Israel when they were
taken by Hamas their release said the
International Red Cross was a sliver of
Hope yes when President Biden was here
earlier this week the release of the
hostage
was one of his
priorities Anthony blinken the US
Secretary of State went to Kata which
also hosts a Hamas office Kat's
connections were crucial good afternoon
everyone uh about an hour ago uh two
American citizens held by Hamas since
October 7th uh were
released uh these two Americans are now
safely in the hands of Israeli
authorities in Israel the Urgent work to
free every single American to free all
other hostages continues as does our
work to secure the safe passage out of
Gaza for the Americans who are trapped
there in Tel Aviv while the negotiations
were happening families and friends of
the more than 200 people taken as
hostages by herass were holding a
vigil 20 of the missing Israel says are
under
18 the people here will be hoping that
now the principle of doing deals is
established more might be
possible the photos are going up on the
wall of the defense
Ministry the presence of hostages in
Gaza puts pressure on Israel's generals
and politicians as Hamas must have
intended in a small country the hostage
crisis draws in many
families daily life here is on hold the
war dominates everything Israelis are
united behind their flag and their army
and in their contempt and hatred for
Hamas they are not United about their
prime minister benjam Netanyahu a highly
divisive figure whose opponents believe
neglected their
event but it started when one man avai
broet in the black T-shirt came here on
his own
his wife and three small children were
taken from a bordic kots by Hamas if
you're sitting on your couch now look
down at your son playing right next to
you you know you know what's right you
know we we're that he's in the right
place you know my kids have done nothing
wrong my you know we yal and which are 4
and a half 8 and 10 just celebrated her
birthday she still got cake in the
fridge so you know we all know what the
right thing is to do where they should
be where my wife should be
so you know it's pretty easy pretty easy
choice to make just you know bring them
home to
me Israelis and plenty of others
including President Joe Biden say this
is their equivalent of the attacks on
America by Al-Qaeda on September the
11th 2001 and for Israelis this is
not a trauma you can get used
to every day they're learning more about
these people about the missing about the
dead and that sadness and anger
underpins the resolve of the government
to hit back to get their people bring
them home and to destroy
Hamas pain is universal after an Israeli
raid in Karam on the West Bank five
children were among 13 Palestinian dead
an Israeli soldier was killed as well at
the Mory Palestinian family said goodbye
to the boys aged from 11 to 15
bystanders who were killed by a drone
strike Palestinians on the West Bank
held protests after the noon
prayer the uneasy unpleasant but mostly
predictable Rhythm of the conflict has
gone the only certain to ah head is more
pain and Jeremy is here with me um
fantastic news for the families of these
two hostages but one wanders in a wider
context how significant it is that they
have been released well the
International Red Cross who were part of
the process called it a sliver of Hope a
sliver because there more than 200
people there um I think there is a
principle established now that Hamas
will do a deal and so I think those
hostage families I was speaking to today
in Tel Aviv will will be delighted to
hear that and they'll be thinking well
maybe we might be next one question why
choose Americans first well the
Americans have been pushing but also I
think President Biden has been trying to
be a bit of a moderating influence on
the level of force the Israelis use
perhaps Hamas think that that's
significant too and maybe he might do
more of that and there's another thing
and that is that the whole purpose of
taking hostages for Hamas was to have
lever over the Israelis a few years ago
the Israelis exchanged more than a
thousand Palestinian prisoners for one
hostage they've exchanged they've
exchanged as well other prisoners for
bodies so they must think well if we got
that many for one what could we do with
200 indeed okay Jeremy thank you Jeremy
Bowen there well we're going to get more
from our North America editor now Sarah
Smith who's live in Washington Sarah the
two hostages released they our American
citizens as we've been hearing and
tonight we're wondering what the White
House has been saying about all
this well President Biden has put out a
statement saying he is Overjoyed at the
release of these two Americans and he
has in fact spoken directly to their
family here in the United States as well
and he has mentioned working around the
clock to try and secure the release of
all the American hostages there has
clearly been a lot of activity and this
bit of good news does come at the end of
a week of extraordinary diplomatic focus
on the Middle East from America we had
that dramatic trip to Israel from
President Biden on Wednesday and an
unusual live televised address from the
White House last night and I think it is
really important and interesting to note
as Jeremy was alluding to there that
every time we hear from President Biden
and he talks about Israel's right to
defend itself he also always mentions
the need to respect the laws of war and
do everything possible to try to avoid
civilian deaths and casualties when
Israel comes to respond so while the
president is obviously wanting to show
his solidarity with the state of Israel
he appears at the same time to be trying
to contain their reaction and in doing
so try to stop this conflict from
spreading Beyond where it is already at
and that is pretty clearly just as much
of a priority for America as condemning
hamas's attacks and working to secure
the release of all the other hostages
that are still in Gaza",20231020

Crossing between Egypt and the Gaza
Strip where more than a 100 trucks
including the initial Convoy of 20 are
waiting for the green light to drive
into Gaza Mr gutes pleaded for them to
be allowed to move to the other side
here's some of what he said so these
trucks are not just
trucks they are a
Lifeline they are the difference between
life and death for so many people in
Gaza and to see them stuck here makes me
be very clear what we need is to make
them
move to make them move to the other side
of this wall to make them move as sque
quickly as possible and as many as
possible recently it was announced by
Israel and by the United States that
humanitarian Aid would be allowed to
enter
Gaza and I know that there is also an
agreement between Egypt and Israel to
make it
possible but these announcements were
made with some conditions this must be a
sustained effort we are not looking for
a one Convoy to come we are looking for
convoys to be authorized in a meaningful
numbers
of trucks to go every
day Aid agencies have described the
situation inside Gaza as Beyond
catastrophic hospitals are running out
of medicine and fuel for their
generators
Food Supplies are very low and some
people have only dirty water to drink
more than a million civilians have been
displaced some who had been unable to
find shelter in the South are now
returning to the devastated North Hamas
Health officials say
3,800 people have been killed in
continuing bombing Egypt says it has
opened its side of the crossing but
Israel said the timing of the delivery
was yet to be determined it's thought
only 20 trucks will initially be
permitted to cross humanitarian workers

televised speech following his visit to
Israel earlier this week he used the
address to draw a link between the
conflict in Ukraine and Israel and urged
Congress to do more to deliver Aid to
both Nations let's have a listen to what
President Biden has been saying you know
history has taught us that when
terrorists don't pay a price for their
Terror when dictators don't pay a price
for their aggression they cause more
chaos and death and more destruction
they keep going and the cost and the
threats to America and the world keep
Rising if we walk away from Ukraine if
we turn our backs on Israel it's just
not worth it that's why tomorrow I'm
going to send to Congress an urgent
budget request to fund America's
national security needs to support our
critical Partners including Israel and
Ukraine let's talk to our chief
International correspondent Le duat now
who is in Israel fors in southern Israel
wel welcome to you Le what's your
assessment of Joe Biden's televised
address we saw him there in Israel just
a couple of days ago now appealing to
Congress for More Money More aid for the
country well in a very divided America
in a very divided Congress uh opinions
are very divided there are some who
don't like uh the way that he is linking
Ukraine and Israel there are some on
both sides of the house who don't want
some much Aid going to Israel there
there before this crisis erupted there
was criticism among leading Republicans
that too much Aid was going to Ukraine
but Joe Biden has tried to take the
moral High Ground you'll remember that
when he first came to office he wanted
to divide the world into Democrats and
autocrats Democratic societies and
authoritarian societies and now he is
building on this message comparing Hamas
to Vladimir Putin and saying that the
United States had a responsibility um as
a democratic country as a as a world
leader that he personally also believes
that America has to take the lead he did
make an effort to say that of course
that the United States of America was
standing right behind Israel he also
spoke about the suffering of the
Palestinians and how Aid needed to get
into Gaza and his concern that this
could spread across the region so he
tried to address many audiences not all
of them will be happy but this is how we
beli in this rather historic live
broadcast from from the from the White
House from the Oval Office the setting
was was important the timing was
important the consequences will be
important yeah Le he also urged Israel
leaders to learn from us mistakes after
the biggest terror attack on their
country 911 and not to rush into
something that could have unintended
consequences as you stand there today on
the southern Israel border waiting to
see what happens whether or not there
will be a ground offensive which is is
expected isn't it by Israeli troops into
Gaza what's your assessment what's
coming out of the Israeli military and
the Israeli government about
that well I think for for today the what
everyone is waiting to see happen today
because it is also dependent on
decisions of the Israeli military and
the Israeli politicians is will that
Rafa Crossing at the border with Egypt
the only way in and out of Gaza where
more than 100 lores packed with food and
uh food and water in medicine have been
waiting and waiting for days to get in
we hear that Egyptians are gathering on
that side of the Border waiting there
protesting until that desperately needed
Aid gets in not only the eyes of the
world on that Crossing even the world's
top Diplomat Antonio goeres the
Secretary General is heading down to the
Rafa Crossing to be seen to be
emphasizing just how crucial it is that
a gets into Gaza not just those 20
trucks that President Joe Biden said he
had secured an agreement for it seemed
to be a kind of a test case to ensure it
could be done safely to ensure it didn't
get diverted to Hamas but we are still
waiting the gazans are still waiting all
of the aid agencies are still waiting to
see whether that Crossing opens today
and right now the crossing itself is
open but it's not open to the aid trucks
there'll be a lot of of waiting to see
whether this this firstep takes place
absolutely and we'll of course be
updating our viewers should there be any
developments at that ruffer Crossing

from Gaza say that several people
including children have been killed or
wounded in an air strike on a house in
the southern town of KH Unis these are
some of the pictures from the hospital
nearby with what appears to be un
workers among the injured well
Palestinian Health officials said the
death toll had risen to more than
3,800 Palestinians in total diplomatic
meetings to try to secure aid for
Palestinians are continuing with the
King of Jordan meeting Egypt's President
in Cairo both countries have played
significant mediation roles in previous
conflicts well coming up this hour we'll
hear from a UN Agency on the ground
we'll also hear from a British man who's
lost family members in Gaza and from the
families desperately trying to trace
loved ones seized by Hamas first though
we start with this report from WEA
Davis what on the heels of yesterday's
visit by Joe Biden a UK military flight
today brought rashis sunak to Tel Aviv
the Prime Minister here to meet Israeli
leaders and British Israeli victims of
the brutal violence of 12 days
ago on the well traveled road to
Jerusalem Mr sunak trip is a symbolic
show of solidarity after one of the
worst events in modern Israeli history
rak's visit here and that of world
leaders before and afterwards is to show
Israel that its allies have its back
there may well be some calls for
restraint but what happens next is
perhaps inevitable and they won't try to
persuade Israel otherwise Israel's
military buildup on the border with Gaza
continues when they go in is perhaps yet
to be decided but with the avowed
intention of completely destroying Hamas
those who've seen this before say this
time will be different the two previous
uh ground campaigns in 2014 and 2009
both lasted for about 18 days and then
the Israeli forces which were there on
the ground left this this time it's
going to be a heck of a lot longer than
18 days and nobody is going to say
whether it's say weeks months perhaps
even years until Israel has reached that
uh objective eradicating Hamas
leadership and Military capabilities in
Gaza so that is really the main
difference now for now Israel continues
to hit targets inside Gaza from the air
confirming it had hit hundreds of Hamas
infrastructure sites
but say Palestinian officials there have
also been numerous civilian casualties
many of them
children gaza's humanitarian situation
is dire and like President Biden before
him Rashi sunak impressed on Israeli
leaders the importance of allowing
limited Aid into Gaza through the border
with Egypt something Israel has agreed
to and which should begin by the end of
the
week compared to its Reliance on the
United States for support and military
aid Israel's relationship with the UK is
much less important but at times of such
crisis these moments are significant I'm
proud to stand here with you in Israel's
Darkest Hour as your friend we will
stand with you in solidarity we will
stand with your people and we also want
you to win this is not merely our battle
it's the battle of the entire civilized
world it's the Battle of uh Israel it's
the battle of the moderate Arab
countries it's the Battle of uh Western
Civilization the battle of the Free
World the battle for the future Israel
says it cannot allow its friends or The
Wider world to forget what happened on
October the 7th when 1300 people were
murdered and on the day of Rishi Sak's
visit British Israeli yonni Rapaport was
the latest victim to be identified
murdered in the attack on kibot ber the
lifetime man united fan leaves behind
two young children G Davis BBC News jus
Jerusalem we talk to our correspondent
Tom bitman these are the pictures live
from Gaza another huge plume of smoke
there on the skyline so let's bring in
Tom bitman has been across all of
today's developments Tom your assessment
of that visit from Rishi sunak the day
after the American
president well it was meant to show a
very strong uh signal of solidarity by
Mr tunak and the British government for
for the Israeli leader uh at this
particular moment but I thought what was
interesting was that whereas we were
hearing uh towards the end of last week
uh really only that message from the UK
government um I think what we've seen
which was triggered largely by a tour by
the US Secor State Anthony blinkin of
around eight Arab capitals this rapid
shuttle diplomacy at the end of last
week in which he kept adding new venues
and dates and then coming back to Israel
that's where we saw some of the
messaging from the Western Powers start
to shift a bit and we've heard much more
Focus about the need to get humanitarian
Aid into Gaza and a bit more of an
emphasis too which we heard from Rishi
sunak about the need for Israel to
operate within the boundaries of
international law um because clearly
what they are worried about here is the
way that this has the potential to
escalate and spread to The Wider region
and remember that many many millions of
people across the rest of this region
have been seeing those pictures coming
from Gaza with this huge civilian um
death toll and that is creating uh it's
making the temperature rise and so I
think you know what we were hearing from
Mr Biden yesterday and Mr sunak a bit
today uh was the need to sort of show
that they are urging some sort of
restraint to the Israelis remember we
haven't even had of course that ground
Invasion begin yet it's still expected
and I think one of the the really one of
the only practical ways they can try and
do that at the moment is is to try and
alleviate some of the desperation in
Gaza by getting that Rafa Crossing open
with Egypt so that uh messaging that you
know the deal that was done between Mr
Biden and the Israelis yesterday that
they'll try to open get Rafa opened
tomorrow which will allow in 20 Aid
trucks of uh food water and Medicine not
fuel though and that is really um
crucial and although having said all of
that what we're hearing now from Aid
groups and the UN is that really not
that is just it will help but it's not
going to be anywhere near Enough Tom a
twin thought uh just a supplementary on
where You' finished what have Israel
said about where that Aid may go are
there any limitations and in terms of
the military buildup where are
we in terms of where the aid goes I mean
the Israelis have said that there should
be a designated uh Aid point a supply
point for the uh Aid which is on the
coastal side of the Gaza Strip but we we
really don't know much about the
logistics at the moment I mean all we've
heard we heard from uh an Egyptian
official saying that they are working at
the moment to repair the roads after the
damage from the Israeli bombing um close
to the crossing the the part of the road
that runs between the Egyptian side of
the Border onto the sort of liaison
Point Rafa with the um Palestinian side
so they're working on that um but beyond
that what exactly will happen to the
AIDS we simply don't know I mean one of
the things the Israelis had been saying
is uh that and one of the reasons they
don't want fuel is they have said that
if there's any sense that supplies are
being exploited or stolen by Hamas
they'll they'll stop it um so these are
really going to be really sensitive
discussions between all of the parties
involved as to the buildup to war we're
not really any further in terms of what
we know than we were I think at the
beginning of this week quite honestly I
mean the you know the buildup around on
the perimeter of the Gaza Strip of
Israeli forces has been absolutely huge
the biggest cool up of military
reservists in half a century of 360,000
people it is all a massive operation it
feels to me that while we've had this
week which has almost felt like a slight
pause while um International diplomacy
is ramped up you know President Biden
yesterday we had Olaf Schultz uh the
German Chancellor there may be more
European leaders coming um this week it
feels like it would be unlike that a
grand Invasion would be launched during
that but of course we simply don't know
these are unprecedented and extremely
volatile um times uh but you know
clearly they have been and they've been
saying since the weekend the Israelis
militarily they're ready to
go Tom bitman there in Jerusalem thanks
very much",20231019

VRwespR3ZK8,UK PM Rishi Sunak arrives in Israel as strikes continue on Gaza - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\UK PM Rishi Sunak arrives in Israel as strikes continue on Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"British prime minister Rishi sunak has
landed in Tel Aviv starting a two-day
visit to the Middle East Mr sunak is
expected to meet his Israeli
counterparts Benjamin Netanyahu and
Israeli president Isaac Herzog for what
he said on his arrival here he hoped
would be productive meetings this after
urging Regional leaders to avoid further
dangerous escalation we'll be speaking
in a bit to our chief International
correspondent Lee ducet about what Mr
sunak hopes to achieve here in Gaza
meanwhile Egypt has agreed to let
humanitarian supplies in via the Rafa
Crossing an initial Convoy of around 20
trucks of Aid are expected to enter Gaza
after a deal announced by President
Biden but none of this is likely to
happen until
Friday announcing the agreement the US
president warns that the aid convoys
would be stopped if any supplies were
confiscated by Hamas which governs Gaza
and is labeled a terrorist organization
by the UK and the
us we can bring you live pictures now of
Gaza it is around 10:00 now in the
morning there Israel's military says it
hit hundreds of sites in Gaza over the
last 24 hours including in the south of
the Gaza Strip in the last half hour it
says it's been targeting herass
infrastructure with the latest here's
our correspondent weira Davis
as trucks carrying Aid queue on the
Egyptian side of gaza's Southern border
the UN and international Aid agencies
have become increasingly alarmed at the
unfolding humanitarian crisis on a visit
to Israel that lasted barely a day while
reaffirming his steadfast support Joe
Biden also pressed the case for aid for
gaza's 2 and a half million Palestinian
citizens many of whom are struggling to
get access to food water and medical
supplies then on the plane home the
president told reporters that a deal had
been reached Egypt had agreed to let an
initial 20 trucks in through the Rafa
Crossing this has been a very
uh blunt negotiation I've had and uh so
we want to get as many of the trucks out
as possible there's I guess 150 or
something there not all of them will go
the first trch if there's a second trch
see how it goes the aid will be
delivered under un supervision with the
president saying it might not arrive
until Friday there was also a warning
that it will stop if any is taken by
Hamas which had been one of Israel's
main
concerns we've said and the Americans
have said there have to be safeguards in
place to make sure that Aid goes to the
people it's supposed to go to now Hamas
are the only people in Gaza with guns
and it's not like if they come to an oil
Taker and say come here there's much
that you can do about it but there have
to be Arrangements in place to make sure
that that doesn't happen both Israeli
and Palestinian officials are still
blaming each other for a huge explosion
at a Gaza hospital that killed almost
500 people President Biden had earlier
said he believed Israel's version of
events as the dead were buried the blame
game continued and tensions rise ahead
of what many assume is an inevitable
Israeli ground invasion of
Gaza and with almost 200 hostages held
by Hamas inside Gaza there are concerns
that direct Israeli action might
jeopardize their safety their families
will have taken some comfort after
President Biden said he'd also discussed
their plight saying he could not reveal
details but there was no higher priority
than that safe return there will be more
diplomatic visits in coming days
including rishy sunx today supporting
Israel's right to self-defense but also
urging restrain with civilian
populations when as expected Israeli
Ground Forces do go into Gaza W Davis
BBC News
Jerusalem from Gaza now we turn to
Israel's northern border with Lebanon
there have been further crossborder
exchanges of fire between Israeli forces
and hisb militants in southern Lebanon
the Israeli military said rockets and
anti-tank missiles had been fired into
to Israel from Southern Lebanon it said
it responded then with tank fire and a
drone strike Hezbollah is backed by Iran
it said two of its Fighters were killed
on Wednesday and another was wounded
these border skirmishes have raised
concerns in Israel that it could face a
two-front war we can cross live live now
to our correspondent Anna Foster who's
on the Israel Lebanon boundary Anna good
morning to you
how how does it feel where you where you
are at the moment because we talk about
crossborder skirmishes we're still
talking about uh exchanges of fire of
course between uh Israel's Mighty
military and Hezbollah which uh has a
huge Arsenal itself that militia in
southern Lebanon so the potential there
for escalation is huge and that's what
both sides are thinking at the moment
right
yeah you're absolutely right and that is
why there is so much concern when you
compare the the size of heesa the number
of Fighters it has the amount of
Firepower it has um to its allies Hamas
down in the south hezar is a huge threat
on this northern border and that is why
Israel have moved so many of their
troops so many armored vehicles and
tanks and you see them when you travel
along this border as I've been doing for
for several days now what you see is
empty communities you see towns and
Villages within 2 km of the Border that
have been evacuated almost completely
evacuated there are just soldiers there
now and some local security teams at you
see right along the roads where uh
Israel have have really done what they
can with their military to shore up this
border and it's also worth saying as
well you know it's interesting the point
you make that this is this is always a
tense place it has been for years but
while we're talking about what's going
on this in the South around Gaza we see
those constant rocket attacks from Hamas
and similarly we've seen the Israeli air
strikes it doesn't normally happen like
this on this border yes it's tense but
you don't normally see these constant
exchanges of fire you don't normally see
these these engagements like this and
this is a a really worrying upturn and I
think that's why you're seeing so much
International diplomacy focusing on this
border Joe Biden when he was uh he was
here yesterday the US president he said
very very clearly very explicitly in his
press conference to any uh hostile actor
or state that is planning to attack
Israel don't don't don't that's why they
put aircraft carriers in the Eastern
Mediterranean that's why the UK foreign
secretary James cleverly is coming in
parallel with that visit from the
British prime minister Rishi sunak but
he will go to Qatar turkey and Egypt and
and his mission is very clear as well it
is to try and stop this conflict
conflict spreading and becoming a a
regional
War absolutely anab as you say while
Israel has um emptied out places where
Israelis are living close to that border
with Lebanon it is moving more troops up
to that border to what extent do you
think we are in a situation where
Hezbollah feels it needs to be seen to
be doing something because of that tense
situation in Gaza those pictures seen
around the world of the suffering of
Palestinian civilians bringing uh people
out into the street in protest across
the Arab world including into Lebanon
and Israel feels it needs to to be seen
to be firing back and to what extent are
we really on the edge of a possible
escalation difficult to say with
certainty Anna of course but the sense
where you
[Applause]
are yeah it is it's a really key Point
Catcher And I think there are two two
things at play here one is these
constant exchanges of fire across the
border because they are to an extent
limited they tend not to to to focus on
on civilian infrastructure they tend to
focus on Military posts that they are
they describe it as sort of the the
agreed Rules of Engagement on the
northern border as it were the problem
will be if something goes wrong if there
are a large number of Civ civilian
casualties on one side or another a
misstep almost and and that could risk
inflaming tensions the other as you
rightly say is at what point does Iran
essentially because Hezbollah is backed
by Iran and Iran are the ones who really
will will make the decisions about what
Hezbollah does but but you're right to
say what could that trigger be now I
think the main thing that has been
discussed is this Israeli ground
operation into Gaza which we've been
talking about for for well over a week
now which hasn't happened yet but I
think a lot of people might see that as
the trigger point I think the explosion
at the hospital in Gaza again I know
there was a lot of concern the day
before yesterday when that happened
because people thought will that be the
inflammatory moment but the rhetoric
that we are hearing from Iran and and
what we're seeing you in terms of what
they're doing the Iranian foreign min
has been touring the region he's been in
Beirut talking to hezbollah's leadership
um they've been on social media saying
the time for political Solutions is
running out um that they cannot stand by
and and watch Palestinians in Gaza be
treated this way um and I think that is
why there is there is so much tension
that you know the I think the accepted
belief that that a big moment could
again be something that that that I say
forces I mean it doesn't Force but in in
their minds it would force Hezbollah
Force Iran to get involved in this
conflict and and that is what is causing
so much worry
here absolutely Anna we can't
overemphasize can we how much the sense
here uh and across the Middle East is
that we are in a very perilous situation
uh where escalation could be round the
corner and we will be looking at all the
Diplomatic efforts a bit later in our
program for now thank you very much Anna
Foster on the Israel Lebanon border and
we can now turn to uh the Israel Gaza
border um we can join Le ducet uh right
on the border there uh in southern
Israel Le we were just talking to you
Anna there about tensions in the north
of course in the south things remain
tense at this very heightened sense uh
ever since militants from the Gaza Strip
crossed over into Southern Israel uh
killing 1,400 people taking 200 hostages
into to Gaza where they remain now and
Israel's military saying they've
continued striking Gaza overnight into
this morning as
well yes Israel's uh there's been no let
up in Israel's military operations heavy
bombardment overnight people living in
Gaza have spoken of the non-stop
bombardment since the beginning of this
crisis living under the attacks night
and day there were reports this morning
uh that people living in
residential blocks were told to leave
and that those blocks were destroyed and
so more families are on the streets now
looking for shelter yesterday the United
Nations expressed concern that there was
still bombardment in the south of the
Gaza Strip which is where Israel had
ordered more than a million Palestinians
to flee flee from their homes in the
north for their safety and protection um
Israel said but they're coming under
bombardment too but I think this morning
Kya so many gin will be hoping against
hope that that news that President Joe
Biden has secured an agreement from
Israel and Egypt to get the first Convoy
of trucks some 20 trucks in all coming
through that Raffa Crossing bringing
some of that desperately needed Aid 20
trucks is not enough but at least it is
a beginning and that is what they'll be
hoping as they struggle to find shelter
water food and at this in these
hours um as you say the the the idea is
to let uh water uh food and medicines
into the Gaza Strip so needed as as the
UN does keep emphasizing Israel though
involved you know in in brokering that
agreement to allow in the a trucks says
fuel is not allowed into the strip the
concern says Israel is that fuel could
be diverted by Hamas inside Gaza how
needed is fuel it's needed sort of for
uh pumping water right and water to
salination as
well yes it was striking that when the
United Nations the spokesperson for the
un's relief and works agency unra which
is the main agency helping Palestinians
um in in other pal in the other
Palestinian territory in the occupied
West Bank but also in the Gaza Strip
when they listed the Urgent needs uh
life-saving needs of the people of Gaza
uh she emphasized that it was fuel that
was Des really needed yes to pump the
water our our viewers may remember that
some days ago uh during a phone call
between prime minister Netanyahu and
President Joe Biden who was then in
Washington it was announced that there
was an agreement that water could go
into the southern uh Gaza Strip but then
the next day we were told by the United
Nations that the pumps only worked for 3
hours which not enough for the more than
a million gazin desperate uh water in
the of of the Gaza Strip and of course
you do need as you mentioned electricity
to be able to to to pump the water
supplies and that's needed in the north
of Gaza too so many families uh couldn't
leave wouldn't leave and there's
hospitals in the north as well so much
is needed and so much is needed
now um Lee finally how does this work
practically a much needed Aid if it
starts coming in the US said not to
expect those Aid convoys uh to start
entering the Gaza Strip till um earliest
tomorrow Friday and is then brought to
people uh inside Gaza what about their
safety though because Israel is
continuing its air strikes of course
there's renewed talk about a possible
ground offensive Israel is still saying
it wants to destroy Hamas in the Gaza
Strip so how to separate the civilians H
and keep them safe while these military
activities
continue
given what has happened so far what
we've heard from the Egyptians so far it
seems clear Egypt won't open the Rafa
Crossing unless it has guarantees that
Israel will not bomb it the rougher
crossing the only way in and out of the
Gaza Strip um has been bombed at least
four times since this crisis erupted
Egypt has said it needs to keep its
staff Manning that passage safe earlier
air strikes by Israel destroyed some of
the buildings so today they're going to
begin the work first of all in this
extraordinary moment there's the very
ordinary details of road safety
President Biden said there are potholes
in the access roads so his team is on
the ground they're working with some
repair teams they're going to try to fix
the roads so that's the first element of
safety making it sure the trucks can
safely reach the crossing then there is
the issue of being absolutely sure
there's an iron CL clad guarantee that
that first Convoy we understand 20
trucks won't come under Israeli fire one
once it enters Gaza uh we haven't got
all the details but we would expect that
Palestinian Health officials civil
servants the United Nations other Aid
agencies will quickly become involved in
trying to distribute that Aid because as
we've been reporting Israel has made it
absolutely clear as did Joe Biden if any
of that Aid is diverted by Hamas it will
stop but as you know K it must be very
difficult to distinguish who is Hamas
and who is not everyone has been uh
seeking shelter but certainly it doesn't
want it to go to the the military Wing
isin Al kassam um and we should also
emphasize that Israel has said that it
will allow Aid only through that
Crossing that no Aid will enter from
Israel until all of the captives nearly
200 captives Israeli non-israeli 30
nationalities were told come home
free Le duet on the Israel Gaza border
thank you very much indeed that was our
special International corres respondent
Lee duet talking about the conundrum of
how to get much needed Aid into Gaza",20231019

died Israel says it wasn't responsible
blaming a misfiring rocket from a
Palestinian group President Biden today
agreed saying the evidence he's seen
appears to show Israel was not to blame
but many in the Arab world aren't
convinced and there have been protests
by thousands of people right across the
Middle East well in a moment our
correspondent rushi Abu Alo reports from
the scene of the hospital blast but
first is Jeremy Bowen on President
Biden's crucial diplomatic Mission a
warning his report contains some very
distressing
images a car park outside the alaki
hospital became a killing
ground the arguments about who
responsible come too late for the people
whose lives ended
here even with their bodies taken away
the clean up this morning also meant
collecting small pieces of
Flesh
God have mercy he said they were
civilians and Muhammad Al Safari a
neighbor can't unsee children with legs
blown off and the bodies he helped
carry they all he said thought they'd be
safe near a
hospital early this morning at the
defense Ministry in Tel Aviv the
military presented data it said proved
Israel did not attack the hospital
instead they said it was a
malfunctioning rocket fired by
Palestinian Islamic
Jihad the trajectory analysis from the
barriage of rockets confirms that the
Rockets were fired close proximity to
the
hospital according to our intelligence
Hamas checked the reports understood it
was an Islamic Jihad
rocket that had misfired and decided to
launch a global media campaign to hide
what really
happened they went as far as inflating
the numbers of
casualties coming to Tel Aviv was a
gamble for President Biden he wanted to
ease gaza's humanitarian catastrophe
while supporting Israel's war effort

with Israel's leader Benjamin
nety

out of Israel today on a whirlwind 8
hour trip a trip that's been
overshadowed by last night's blast at a
hospital in Gaza Israel maintains it
wasn't responsible but not everyone
agrees Hamas Palestinian authorities and
other Arab Nations have blamed Israel
for the explosion which has triggered
protests across the Middle East
meanwhile Britain's foreign office is
advising its citizens against all travel
to Lebanon due to the risks associated
with the conflict between Israel and the
occupied Palestinian territories now to
discuss all of this with me tonight our
panel is Tom peek a political sketch

renia a democratic and policy strategist
and former top campaign Aid to Hillary
[Music]
Clinton good evening the US President
Joe Biden has today pledged solidarity
with Israel during a world wind 8-hour
visit but his trip was overshadowed by
last night's blast at a hospital in Gaza
which the gazan health Ministry says
killed 471 people its inflamed tensions
and sparked protests across the region
Israel's maintained it was not
responsible saying the blast was caused
by a rocket misfired by the Palestinian
militant group Islamic Jihad today
President Joe Biden agreed with Israel's
leader saying it appears that the blast
was done by the other team but Hamas
Palestinian authorities and other Arab
Nations have blamed Israel for the
explosion which has triggered protests
across the Middle East the BBC is trying
to verify the claims from both sides
well after the two leaders had talks Mr
Netanyahu called Mr Biden a true friend
saying that he commends his deeply
moving decision to visit Israel during
the war well following the president's V
visit Israel said it will not thwart the
delivery of food water and medicine from
Egypt for civilians in Gaza as long as
this Aid does not reach Hamas for days
people there have been fleeing their
homes to escape Israeli strikes which
palestinia authorities in Gaza say have
killed more than 3,400 People Israel
says it's targeting members of Hamas a
group designated as a terror
organization by the UK government all of
this follows the deaths of around 1,400
people in attacks by Hamas on Southern
Israel 11 days ago well let's begin this
hours of coverage with this report from
our International editor Jeremy Bowen on
President Biden's crucial diplomatic
Mission a warning that there are some
graphic details in his
report a car park outside the alaki
hospital became a killing
ground the arguments about who's
responsible come too late for the people
whose lives ended
here even with their bodies Tak away the
clean up this morning also meant
collecting small pieces of
civilians and Muhammad Al Safi a
neighbor can't unsee children with legs
blown off and the bodies he helped
carry they all he said thought they'd be
safe near a
hospital early this morning at the
defense Ministry in Tel Aviv the
military presented data it said proved
Israel did not attack the hospital
instead they said it was a
malfunctioning rocket fired by
Palestinian Islamic
Jihad the trajectory analysis from the
barriage of rockets confirms that the
Rockets were fired close proximity to
the
hospital according to our intelligence
Hamas checked the reports understood it
was an Islamic Jihad
rocket that had misfired and decided to
launch a global media campaign to hide
what really
happened they went as far as inflating
the numbers of
casualties coming to Tel Aviv was a
gamble for President Biden he wanted to
ease gaza's humanitarian catastrophe
while supporting Israel's war effort
perhaps an impossible Circle to square
with Israel's leader Benjamin
Netanyahu but a deal emerged from their
meeting food water and medicine but no
fuel from Egypt to Gaza for Israel more
military aid and agreement that they
didn't hit the hospital and based on
what I've seen it appears as though it
was done by the other team not not you I
wanted to personally come and make that
clear
thank you for having me and uh I'm
looking forward to having a thorough
discussion about where everybody goes
from here the president won't change the
minds of those who insist Israel attack
the hospital Joe Biden's presence here
will only deepen the conviction among
Palestinians and millions of other Arabs
that America isn't just on Israel's side
but that it's also complicit in

including killing

Israel President Biden dreamt of
transforming the Middle East the
Americans were negotiating with Saudi
Arabia and Israel to try to get the two
countries to recognize each other that
is not on the agenda
anymore in Arab capitals there have been
protests against Israel this was
Beirut
and this is SAR in Yemen so far the
shouting has spread but not the fighting
keeping it that way will be a
challenge Jeremy Bowen BBC News
Israel well joining me now from
Washington DC is Asher Castlebury
Hernandez a former US state department
senior advisor to the Bureau of NE
Eastern Affairs welcome to the context
Asher if you were advising President
Biden you have told him to make this
trip yes I would have um I think it's
imperative that President Biden shows
that he is committed to uh achieving
Regional peace and security uh I think
it's very important that he's also
showing that he's in support of the
security of the state of Israel as well
as ensuring that um the message is um
important that everybody knows this is
all about uh innocent civilians and
protecting innocent civilians and making
sure that they receive humanitarian
assistance so his leadership or his
presence in the region definitely is
going to resonate and it's important
that he is there so clearly there's been
a breakthrough we we think when it comes
to getting aid from Egypt into Gaza
remains to be seen whether and when that
actually happens but there's certainly
been a promise now from Israel on that
but can the president's visit really
deescalate what is by all accounts a
situation that seems to be escalating by
the hour
his presence will be able to ensure that
uh again that the state of Israel along
with key Partners uh are receiving
enough support uh that are receiving
ensuring that that he has a good outlook
of the operational environment and that
he can make the best decisions as far as
how to move forward with regards to
peace and security so I think it it does
resonate I think it you know interaction
with our partners in person especially
about the hostage Affairs issue is
definitely going to be helpful in terms
of being a game changer as we are
dealing with a very complex operational
security environment but the problem is
there wasn't interaction in person with
with other key leaders in that part of
the world uh including from the
Palestinian Authority other countries
like Jordan um so it wasn't really the
the overwhelming kind of uh consolidator
visit that the president was hoping for
because he only really met Israeli
leaders that is true but uh but the good
thing about it is that he has his
secretary state along with other senior
officials that are able to uh cover down
with those interactions like secretary
blinkin to ensure that that the
humanitarian assistance uh mission is is
being completed as well as that the
hostage Affairs uh uh issue is also
being effectively coordinated so um we
know that because it's such a comp Lex
uh evolving issue that you know it
realistically it does it is very
difficult for the president to be able
to meet everyone or all the key Partners
what would you say is President Biden's
next step in this
now uh I think it's it's it's it's uh
extremely important that President Biden
uh works and looks very closely at the
hostage Affairs issue uh ensuring that
those innocent people whether Israeli
palestini as well
Americans uh are are you know we're able
to get them back protected provide
humanitarian assistance I think that's
the highest priority right now um and
then work you know very closely with the
Israeli Defense Force ensuring that that
happens so I think the hosage Affairs uh
um situation is extremely important it's
the number one priority in ensuring that
uh we are not detrimentally impacted or
a lot more this issue does not
exacerbate more in terms of especially
when it comes to Americans as far as uh
making sure that these Americans are
returned back so definitely the priority
right now I think there's concern for
everyone uh no matter what their
nationality do stay with us Asher let's
bring in our panel Tom peek a political
sketch writer for the independent and
Amanda renia a democratic and policy
strategist and of course a former top
campaign Aid to Hillary Clinton um
Amanda what do you make of the president
visit it didn't go according to plan
let's be blunt about
it listen this is a President Who
consistently in his presidency goes to
the front lines looks people in the eye
builds the kinds of relationships and
understanding of what is happening by
being there and so that has been
consistent with his presidency of course
this is way more complicated and I think
it was even more important to be on the
ground to establish those relationships
to listen to what is happening he has
folks on the ground that are going to
stay there who have been there who can
really give him the information he needs
I do think as this relationship moves
forward it is going to be important for
President Biden to keep um Israel that
relationship accountable to making sure
it gets we get Aid into the ga into Gaza
it's also going to be really important
for him to continue to reach out to
those other partners that he was not
able to talk to in this time which is
also exactly who he is he doesn't give
up picking up the phone to build
relationships and that's going to be
incredibly important right now as we
move forward in these next several days
weeks months Tom let's bring you in
we're hearing that British prime
minister Rishi sunak is going to be
traveling to Israel next um so there's a
lot of world leaders who want to go
there but what difference do you think
Mr sunak is going to
make well there's not really very much
difference any world leader could make
and rich richy sunak is not the
president of the United States of
America the point of this there are
there are no good outcomes so when you
judge whether or not someone's visit has
been successful or unsuccessful it has
the context has to be that there there
are no good outcomes it's very hard for
these things to be construed in anyway
as a success the point of Israel's uh if
you like Western allies going to visit
them there are two purposes one is to
show solidarity with a country that was
a victim of an appalling appalling
terrorist terrorist attack and the other
purpose is to try and contain that
country's Rage which which is exactly
what President Biden said in the clip
that you've shown to to get it to act to
get it to pursue Justice ra rather than
Vengeance because if they don't do that
then it the risks of escalation are
enormous I suspect that if you are
Netanyahu who is the trying to be the
voice of the average Israeli you are
more answerable to that sense of
visceral rage that your population are
feeling than you are to a pressure put
upon you by world leaders ERS to act in
a measured way you just have to hope
that they win but precisely the amount
of influence someone like rishy sunak
can wield in that situation I think it's
quite minimal but there are plenty of
them which there's there's Biden there's
tunak um Ola Schulz has already been
hasn't he you have to hope to see more
of this and then slowly slowly slowly
you can try and persuade Israel to
respond in a more measured fashion but
it won't be easy Asher we heard from
President Biden warning that Israel
shouldn't act with raage
cautioning about what he described as
mistakes which the US made after 911
what did you make about that warning
shot from President
Biden well uh when you look at the
security environment it tells you a lot
about the information flow or the
information environment and the reaction
and I think that was a good move of what
he said because we does not want the bad
reaction to subsequently happen because
it makes the operational environment a
lot more complex and dangerous so I
think that's his commanderin-chief style
of ensuring that he sends those signals
or communicates effectively to everyone
around the world that look there's
information running around uh and this
is the accuracy that uh the the verocity
of what is going on and it's very
important that we we react accordingly
and not be too uh um uh you know
reactive in terms of of inflaming uh
danger to others and just destabilizing
Iz in the operational environment",20231018
clqHa1PP0TQ,What does Gaza hospital blast evidence show? - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\What does Gaza hospital blast evidence show - BBC News.jpg,"in the last hour President Biden has
been speaking at the end of that visit
to Israel and he warned Israel to learn
from America's mistakes after 9/11 and
not to act in
Rage Justice must be
done but I caution this while you feel
that rage don't be consumed by it after
9/11 we were enraged in the United
States while we sought Justice and got
Justice we also made mistakes
well as well as those passages aimed and
directed at Israel and of course he
referenced those attacks of 11 days ago
he said it was the worst loss of life
since the Holocaust he then went on to
speak about the Palestinians inside Gaza
and he said the Palestinians were
suffering greatly because of the
fighting we mourn the loss of innocent
Palestinian lives like the entire world
I was outraged and saddened by the
enormous loss of life yesterday in the
hospital in Gaza
based on the information we've seen to
date it appears as a result of an aant
rocket fired by a terrorist group in
Gaza the United States unequivocally
stands for the protection of civilian
life during conflict and I grieve I
truly grieve for the families who were
killed or wounded by this tragedy that
was Joe Biden in the last 60 minutes so
what are we able to actually establish
with any certainty about the attack on
the hospital will our diplomatic
correspondent car line Hy has been
working working with our colleagues at
BBC
verify ever since the explosion happened
last night at around 700 p.m. local time
the BBC verified team has been analyzing
all the images and video that have
emerged you can see where the hospital
is located within Gaza City and this
footage shows what appears to be the
courtyard car park of the hospital in
Flames we've been able to establish that
that's what it is from the shape of the
buildings now the AL jazer television
station was broadcasting live from Gaza
at the time you can see a series of
bright lights in the air we don't know
exactly what these are the Israeli Army
says there was a failed rocket launch by
the Palestinian militant group Islamic
Jihad then you can see a Flash and
that's followed shortly afterwards by a
big
Fireball our verification teams have
looked at these images and can tell from
the roofs and from other Skyline details
illuminated by the Flames that it was in
the main Courtyard of the
hospital next they've been looking at
daylight images taken this morning here
you can see quite a lot of fire damage
to the cars but most of the buildings
surrounding it are still mostly intact
and standing and there's actually a
relatively small crater now we've shown
these images to a number of weapons
experts and while they couldn't come to
a firm conclusion several of them told
us that if the explosion had been caused
by the type of bomb normally used by
Israeli forces the crater would have
been bigger and there would have been
more damage to the
buildings one way of trying to establish
what hit this hospital is by studying
bomb or missile fragments at the scene
but our team on the ground and the team
here haven't seen any now look at this
image we found from last night of two
men searching through the crater we
showed you earlier the logo on their
vest is from the Palestinian police from
the explosive Ordinance Department we
don't know what if anything they
recovered the Islamic Jihad movement put
out a statement today saying the
explosion was caused by Israeli aerial
bombing and claiming that they have the
remnants of the explosive head but they
haven't yet provided any evidence of
this what's not in dispute is that there
were a very large number of casualties
according to Palestinian officials
mostly we think of people who've been
Sheltering in the hospital from Israeli
air strikes sleeping on the grass here
to establish the exact truth of what
caused them you'd need an independent
investigation but that's not going to
happen in what is an active war zone",20231018
Rbjd1tdL7xc,UN agency warns of impending 'health disaster' in Gaza - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\UN agency warns of impending 'health disaster' in Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"now let's return to what we've heard in
the last couple of hours because
President Biden talking to reporters
before he left Israel but after his
talks with Mr Biden Benjamin netanyahu's
office said Israel will not allow any
Aid into Gaza from its territory until
the hostages are returned but it will
not block Aid going in from Egypt well
the UN agency Ana is on the ground in
the Gaza Strip his director of
communications Juliet tumor talked to me
earlier about Aid that is desperately
needed but also her reaction to the
events at that Gaza Hospital in the last
24
hours attack on the hospital was
horrendous our un Secretary General um
condemn it last night right after it it
happened uh civilians should be
protected civilians are not safe
anywhere in Gaza no place is safe in
Gaza few hours before that um one of our
schools an Andra School in fact that is
a Sheltering displaced family was also
hit during during Israeli air strikes
and um and bombardment um the loss of
life continues the loss of Civilian
lives lives continue and that has got to
stop this is why it's absolutely
critical that there is a ceasefire right
away so that
civilians are protected so that we don't
continue to lose civilians totally
unnecessarily like we have been for the
past 11
days we were just listening to the US
president he said he had tough questions
and conversations with the Israelis in
those meetings when you heard him say
that the people of Gaza need food water
power and they're asking for
humanitarian assistance to be allowed in
you must be heartened by that are you
hearing anything on the ground about
practically how and when that might
happen not just yet not just yet The
Siege on the Gaza Strip continues for
the 11th day and The Siege on the Gaza
Strip must be lifted so that Andra is
able to bring in much needed
humanitarian supplies not just Andra all
other humanitarian agencies who work in
Gaza we would like to ask for The Siege
to be lifted we're urging we're urging
for The Siege to be lifted so that we
can bring in much needed supplies
including fuel so that water runs back
into Gaza two million people two million
people do not have water in Gaza and
they're resorting to unsafe drinking
water we're going to have a health
disaster soon in Gaza if we do not have
our humanitarian supplies go into Gaza
for people who need need it most the
president was making the point that
perhaps inspections would have to be
done there On the Border in terms of
stuff crossing the borders he said none
of it must go to Hamas in your view and
in your experience are those things that
can be sorted out relatively quickly or
are those things that take quite a lot
of
time well when it comes to anra we will
bring in the supplies ourselves our own
un unra teams on the ground will
distribute it to those in need we have
been doing this for many many years
these are un staff they are accountable
to serve the communities in need and
they will ensure that that assistance
will get to people who need it most to
civilians who need it most well that was
latest from The Honorable spokesman as
uh President Biden has said that Israel
has agreed to humanitarian assistance
beginning to move in from Egypt into
Gaza so that is a significant glimpse of
progress",20231018
TnYmGynEkds,Lebanon protesters outside US embassy in Beirut after Gaza hospital blast  - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Lebanon protesters outside US embassy in Beirut after Gaza hospital blast  - BBC News.jpg,"we're bringing you now the latest
pictures from the Lebanese Capital
Beirut there were protests late into the
night outside the US Embassy and more
protests today you can see there in
those pictures the anger boiling over on
the street Security Forces trying to
contain the crowds using tear gas and
water cannons to push people back anger
boiling over in Lebanon there were also
protests yesterday outside the Israeli
Embassy in the Jordanian Capital Aman
protest in Libya protest in the Iranian
Capital tan outside the British and the
French embassies there is no Israeli or
American embassy of course in the
Iranian Capital but let's now focus on
the situation in Lebanon because there
has been heightened concern from the
very beginning of this crisis that that
could be a second front in this war and
there have been clashes along that
border border of Northern Israel with
Lebanon with hisbah militants Allied to
Iran firing Rockets across the border
Israel firing into Lebanon let's bring
in our Middle East correspondent Lena
sjab Lena you have been following this
very closely from the start what has
changed in the mood in Lebanon after
last night's devastating explosion at
the Al Ali
Hospital uh you know le as you mentioned
the tension has been uh mounting since
the start of the attack and since the
start of the 7 October incident uh but
yesterday was completely different uh
everyone many countries including the US
and France and other countries have been
you know sending messages to Lebanon not
to get involved in this war but Iran was
saying that you know it it you know
other fronts could open at any moment
and the attack on the uh hospital
yesterday raised a lot of anger not only
in Lebanon but in the Arab streets as as
you mentioned there were lots of
protests marching towards the um
American Embassy here in in in Beirut
just as as I'm talking to you a protest
passing near uh my home I can see I saw
flags of hisbah flags of you know the
Palestinian uh the Palestinian flags
were raising people are angry and the a
few minutes ago also we've heard the
foreign minister here um you know in a
meeting in in in um in Saudi Arabia
saying that the situation the escalation
uh you know reached a point where its
consequences could spill over in the
whole region in a you know in an
uncontrollable way hisbah this morning
also said that there should be a
response and that's not acceptable
condemning the attack on the hospital
the problem here Le in this region and
especially in Lebanon with the presence
of hisbah and its hostility towards
Israel everything is it it could happen
at any moment at any um you
know
resp who has been with us in
Beirut reporting on the situation in the
Lebanese
Capital
which have
been Lena uh I don't know if you can
hear me or not this is Mariam in the
London studio um I think we've lost
lease I want to continue talking to you
Lena because of course we're seeing
these incredible pictures of the US
Embassy in Beirut the outside of the
embassy and there just the the reaction
the visceral reaction from so many as
you said just after the news of that
explosion came in uh you talk about the
issues that could potentially spill over
what could that spill over potentially
look like do you
think it's really unpredictable and it's
really worrying I mean it's been
worrying the past 10 days uh because of
you know people here especially in
Lebanon remember very well the one
monthlong war in 2006 that
destroyed the infrastructure in in
Lebanon and this time Israelis said that
if hisbah would launch an attack against
Israeli um you know territories or
involve in a war against Israel it's
going the price is going to be very high
many people have been really wary about
this and you know expressed fear of
getting Lebanon involved but the problem
problem is the anger in the street the
Ang youth the protest that we're seeing
everywhere in b as I was mentioning it
was just passing next to my home you
know a few minutes ago before with the
hisbah flags and the Palestinian Flags
it's really hard to control or you know
expect what their reaction is going to
be the Iranians have been warning hisbah
warned we don't know what and when if
and if they
will be and what is the response that is
going to trigger everyone is calling for
people to come down and not to involve
in war but this is the region of the
unpredictable and after the anger of the
um the hospital attack things could go
out of hand Lena it feels to me like the
hospital attack was very much kind of a
catalyst for these protests it feels to
me that even if tomorrow uh we were
presented irrefutable evidence of you
know the the the Hospital exposure not
being the fault of the Israelis these
protests would still happen they'd still
carry on it feels this goes beyond that
it transcends what happened last
night the issue is if I don't know if
you can hear me I don't know if you can
still hear me but the issue here in the
Arab world we can Lina we can yes the
issue in the Arab world and in the Arab
street is that who can they believe who
is going to provide the evidence is
there an independent country who can
investigate and provide the evidence now
we're only hearing what the uh Israeli
government is saying and the Americans
immediately backed uh that narrative
most people in the streets here uh they
express concern that the international
media is just buying what the Israeli
government and the American government
is providing as uh the narrative over
the hospital um incident so you know uh
we have to wait and see but they need
independent institutions to verify who
who carried out the attack before making
decisions on their responses the history
of this conflict in how it is seen in
the Arab world that the whole
International Community superpowers are
biased to the Israeli narrative that's
why there is lack of confidence lack of
trust with the International Community
here in the streets of the Arab world
and especially in Lebanon we're going to
stay with these pictures Lena and I
think we're going to stay with you I
want to ask you another thing I've been
reading about the US us warning
Americans not to travel to Lebanon after
the these incidents in Beirut and the US
Embassy uh Lebanon itself of course has
its own problems its own economic Strife
if understatement really uh what kind of
impact is all of this having on Lebanon
itself as a as a country as a nation to
see scenes like this in its
capital it is really concerned uh
raising concerns among the Lebanese I've
been having calls from friends from
relatives everyone is reassessing
whether to stay uh or to leave we've
heard some reports that you know some of
the DI diplomatic missions here called
on a non-permanent residents to leave
the country and that's all signs of
concerns for the coming days and and and
and weeks probably and this is a country
that is already uh suffering immensely
from economic collapse and you know
financial crisis and lying in poverty
but this is also a situation that is
fueling a lot of anger that people are
forgetting about about their economic
issues and thinking about what they see
as Injustice in treating the
Palestinians and this is a country that
has like a core support for the
Palestinian cause for the Palestinian
civilians basically and seeing these
images of the hospital coming out people
forget about their own their own pain
and their own worry and they want to see
Justice they want to see a fair um you
know uh outcome for for this situation
as you were discussing before that we
have to to wait for an investigation to
see who carried out this attack on the
hospital but for people in Lebanon and
in the Arab world they need transparency
they need to know that there is an
independent uh institution or a country
to carry out the investigation and not
the United States backing U the Israeli
narrative on this situation and Lena as
we see these incredible pictures of uh
the uh US Embassy in Beirut and
protesters outside it uh
I just wanted to ask you I've been
reading also about the fact that it's
not just the US em Embassy that has been
uh targeted by protests protesters also
broke out in the at the French Embassy
as
well well the anger is targeted towards
all the countries that are are seen here
in the streets as as biased to to Israel
I mean the French government even banned
protests that are pro Palestinian and
this is unprecedented in a democratic
country that supports freedom of spe
speech so imagine the reflection of uh
these kind of decisions and these kind
of stances here in the Arab world when
they see fellow uh you know Palestinians
that they support and they feel uh
wholeheartedly to their Agony uh they
being attacked and you know the whole
world is still supporting an Israeli uh
um narrative and Israeli stance don't
forget that you know people follow
closely what happens around the world
and they've seen The Stance of the US
the EU and other government to Russia's
uh committing similar attacks on Ukraine
while there it was condemned but here it
is declared as self-defense and that's
only fueling anger and feeling among the
Arab street that the whole world don't

on the people of this nation has left a
deep deep wound more than 1,300 innocent
Israelis killed including at least 31
American citizens by the terrorist group
Hamas hundreds hundreds of young people
at a music festival the festival was for
peace for peace gunned down as they ran
for their
lives scores of Innocents from infant to
elderly grandpar parents Israelis and
Americans taken hostage children
slaughtered babies slaughtered entire
families
massacred rape beheadings bodies burned
alive Hamas committed atrocities that
recall the worst ravages of Isis
unleashing pure unadulterated evil upon
the
world there's no rationalizing it no
excusing it period the brutality we saw
would have cut deep anywhere in the
world but it cuts deeper here in
Israel October 7th which was sacred was
sacred Jewish holiday became the
deadliest day for the Jewish people
since the
Holocaust it has brought to the surface
painful memories and scars left by
Millennia of anti-Semitism and the
genocide of the Jewish
people the world watched then it knew
and the world did
nothing we will not stand by and do
nothing
again not today not tomorrow not ever to
those who are living in limbo waiting
desperately to learn the fate of a loved
one especially to families of the
hostages you're not
alone we're working with Partners
throughout the region pursuing every
Avenue to bring home those who are being
held captive by
Hamas I can't speak publicly about all
the details but let me assure you for me
as the American president there's no
higher priority than the release and
safe return of all these
hostages to those who are grieving a
child a parent a spouse a sibling a
friend I know you feel like there's that
black hole in the middle of your chest
you feel like you're being sucked into
it the survivor's remorse the anger the
questions of faith in your soul starting
at staring at that empty chair sitting
shiva the first Sabbath without them
there the everyday things and small
things that you miss the most the scent
when you open the closet door the
morning coffee you shared together the
bend of his smile the perfect pitch of
her laugh the giggle of your little boy
the
baby for those who have lost loved ones
this is what I know they'll never be
truly
gone there's something that's never
fully lost your love for them
and their love for you and I promise you
you'll be walking along some days and
say what would she or he want me to do
you smile when you pass a place that
reminds you of them that's when you know
when a smile comes to your lips before a
tear to your eye that's who you know
you're going to fully make
it that's what will give you the
fortitude to find light in the darkest
hours when terrorists believe they could
bring down bring you down bend your will
break your resolve but they never did
and they never
will instead we saw incredible stories
of heroism and courage Israelis taking
care of one another neighbors forming
watch groups protect their
kibuts opening their homes to shelter
survivors retired soldiers running into
danger once again civilian Medics flying
across rescue flying rescue missions and
off-duty Medics at the music Festival
caring for the wounded before coming
victim before becoming a victim himself
volunteers retrieving bodies of the dead
so families could bury their loved ones
in accordance with Jewish
tradition reservist leaving behind their
families their honeymoons their studies
abroad without hesitation and so much
more the state of Israel is born to be a
safe place for the Jewish people of the
world that's why I was
born long said if Israel didn't exist
we'd have to invent
it while it may not feel that way today
Israel must again be a safe place for
the Jewish people and I promise you
we're going to do everything in our
power to make sure that it will
be 75 years ago just 11 minutes after
its founding President Harry S Truman in
the United States of America became the
first nation to rec recognize
Israel we've stood by your side ever
since we're going to Stand By Your Side
now my Administration been in close
touch with your leadership from the
first moments of this attack we're going
to make sure we have what you have what
you need to protect your people to
defend your nation for decades we've
ensured Israel's qualitative military
Edge and later this week I'm going to
ask the United States Congress for
unprecedented support package for
Israel's defense we're going to keep
Iron Dome fully supplied so we can
continue standing Sentinel over Israeli
Skies saving Israeli lives we moved US
military assets to the region including
positioning the USS Ford carrier strike
group in the Eastern Mediterranean with
the ussi and now are on the way to deter
to defer further aggression against
Israel and to prevent this conflict from
spreading the world will know that is
Israel is Israel is stronger than ever
and my message to any state or any other
hostile actor thinking about attacking
Israel Remains the Same as it was a week
ago don't don't
don't since his terrorist ATT terrorist
attack took place we've seen it
described as Israel's
9/11 though for a nation the size of
Israel was like 15
91s the scale may be different but I'm
sure those Horrors have tapped into so
some kind of Primal feeling in Israel
just like it didn't felt in the United
States shock pain rage an all consuming
rage I understand the many Americans
understand you can't look at what has
happened here to your mothers your
fathers your
grandparents Sons daughters children
even babies and not scream out for
justice
Justice must be
done but I caution this while you feel
that rage don't be consumed by it after
9/11 we were enraged in the United
States while we sought Justice and God
Justice we also made
mistakes I'm the first US president to
visit Israel in time of
war I've made wartime decisions I know
the choices are never clear or easy for
the leadership
there's always cost but it requires
being deliberate it requires asking very
hard
questions it requires clarity about the
objectives and an honest assessment
about whether the path you're on will
achieve those
objectives the vast majority of
Palestinians are not
Hamas Hamas does not represent the
Palestinian people hamash uses innocence
innocent families in Gaza as human
Shields putting their command centers
their weapons their Communications
tunnels in residential
areas Palestinian people are suffering
greatly as well we mourn the loss of
innocent Palestinian lives like the
entire world I was outraged and saddened
by the enormous loss of life yesterday
in the hospital in
Gaza based on the information we've seen
to date it appears a result of an errant
rocket fired by a terrorist group in
Gaza United States equivocally stands
for the protection of civilian life
during conflict and I grieve I truly
grieve for the families who were killed
or wounded by this
tragedy people of Gaza need food water
medicine shelter today I ask these R
cabinet I met with for some time this
morning to agree to the delivery of
life-saving humanitarian assistance to
civilians in Gaza based on the
understanding that there will be
inspections that the aid should go to
civilians not to a
Israel agreed the humanitarian
assistance can begin to move from Egypt
to Gaza let me be clear if amas diverts
or steals the assistance they will have
demonstrated once again that they have
no concern for the welfare of the
Palestinian people and it will
end as a practical matter it will it
will stop the International Community
from being able to provide this
Aid we're working in close cooperation
with the government of Egypt the United
Nations and its agencies like the world
program and other partners in the region
to get trucks moving across the border
as soon as
possible separately I ask Israel that
the global Community demand that the
International Red Cross be able to visit
hostages I just demanded that the United
States fully a just demand that the
United States fully
supports today I'm also announcing $100
million in new US funding for
humanitarian assist assistance in both
Gaza and the West Bank this money will
support more than 1 million displaced
and conflict affected Palestinians
including emergency needs in
Gaza you are a Jewish State you are a
Jewish state which you're also a
democracy like the United States you
don't live by the rules of terrorists
you live by the rule of law when
conflicts flare you live by the law of
Wars what sets us apart from the
terrorist as we believe in the
fundamental Dignity of every human life
Israeli Palestinian Arab Jew Muslim
Christian everyone you can't give up
what makes you who you
are if you give that up then the
terrorists win and we can never let them
win you know Israel is a
miracle a Triumph of faith and resolve
and resilience over impossible pain and
loss
think about October 7th the Jewish
holiday where you read about the death
of
Moses a tragic story of a profound loss
to an entire
nation a death that could have left
helpless hopelessness in the hearts of
the entire of entire
nation but though Moses died his memory
his message his lessons have lived on
for generations of the Jewish people as
well as many others just as the memory
of your loved ones will live on as well
after reading the story of moses' death
those who observe the holiday began
reading the Torah from the very
beginning the story of
creation reminds us of two things first
that when we get knocked down we get
back up again and we begin a new and
second when we're faced with tragedy and
loss we must go back to the beginning to
remember who we are we are all human
beings created in the image of God we
with dignity humanity and
purpose in the darkness to be the light
unto the world is what we're about you
inspire hope and light for so many
around the
world that's what the terrorists seek to
destroy that's what they seek to
destroy because they live in darkness
but not you not
Israel nations of conscience like the
United States and Israel are not
measured solely by the example or power
we're measured by the power of our
example that's why as hard as it is must
keep pursuing peace must keep pursuing a
path so that Israel and the Palestinian
people can both live safely in Security
in dignity and in
peace for me that means a two-state
solution must keep working for Israel's
greater integration with his neighbors
these attacks have only strengthen my
commitment and determination and my will
to get that done I'm here to tell you
the terrorist will not win Freedom will
win so let me end where I
began Israel You're Not Alone the United
States stands with
you I told the story before and I'll
tell it again of my first meeting with
an Israeli Prime Minister 50 years ago
as a young Senator I was sitting across
from gold of May a at her desk in her
office and she had a guy named guy who
later became prime minister sitting next
to me just before the 1973 yam kapor
war and she flipped the maps up and down
telling me how bad things were and how
terrible they were all of a sudden she
looked at me and she said would you like
a
photograph I looked at her she got up
from her desk and walked out into that
hallway I think it's Marble forign
walked out the hallway we walked down
there were a bunch of photographers
standing in front of us we're standing
shoulder toosh shoulder without her
looking at me she said to me knowing I'd
hear her why do you look so worried
Senator
Biden and I said worried like of course
I'm worried and she looked at me and she
didn't look she said we don't worry
Senator we Israelis have a secret
weapon we have nowhere else to
go well today I say to all of Israel the
United St isn't going anywhere either
we're going to stand with you we'll walk
beside you in those dark days and we'll
walk beside you in the good days to come
and they will
come as you say in Hebrew which I'm not
going to attempt to do because I'm such
a terrible linguist I'll say in
English the people of Israel live the
people of Israel live Israel will be
safe secure Jewish and Democratic state
today tomorrow and
forever may God protect all those who
work for
peace God save those who are still In
Harm's Way thank you very much",20231018

attack on the hospital across the region
our correspondent John donison has
more Fury in the West Bank in rala
youths battled with Palestinian Security
Forces who responded with tear gas and
sound grenades as reports of the
hospital strike came in from Gaza
thousands took to the streets in protest
there's anger directed at Israel but
also at president Mahmud Abbas and his
Palestinian Authority which many
perceive as weak and lacking
legitimacy Mr abass announced he was
canceling a meeting with President Biden
in Jordan and was flying
home there were Mass protests there this
evening too and clashes outside the
Israeli Embassy in
Aman during the foundation of Israel
when it occupied this area they are
breaching International humanitarian law
Geneva agreement is obvious in this
regard medical centers or hospitals
should not be
touched in Turkey also thousands rallied
against Israel as the war in Gaza
escalates it's a dangerous moment for
The Wider region John donison BBC
News well for more on this I'm now
joined by my colleague from BBC Arabic
SED shahata sahid we're still yet to
know who was behind the attack or what
caused it exactly but what more are you
hearing from the ground there in Gaza
City there is like two stories or two
side of the story uh the Arab on both
formal informal levels the street
Ordinary People on social media and the
officials like President of Egypt the
King Abdullah Jordan and all of these
like uh officials all of them condemning
Israel and saying Israel is behind the
attack and uh some of them like Hamas
called it like a war crime or describe
it as a war crime on the other side
Israel uh saying it's uh uh the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad behind that
misfire rocket so there is two side of
the story and it still need to be
verified who who done that but the
problem is the outcome of it at least
500 people died according to the
minister of HS uh in Gaza so it's
disastrous and situation there is bad
because it shelter the hospital like
other facilities shelters the people
coming from the north because Gaza Strip
is very small so to move their density
is very high so it was considered as a
safe place but now people are suspicious
and they start thinking where can we go
so it's a problematic and put pressure
on politician to find a solution as soon
as you can or sooner than than the later
uh because the russion are is is immense
and say it was already a difficult
humanitarian situ situation for people
in Gaza hospitals struggling uh to find
medicine to treat patients what kind of
help is getting to the people affected
by this blast at the hospital is little
help because according to the World
Health Organization the saying even some
like health health facilities was uh
were targeted by air strikes and some of
the medical staff killed in addition to
that there is uh no food or the shortage
of food and all the hope of to find a
solution if like uh President Biden
maybe find a solution to open a
humanitarian humanitarian Corridor
through Rafa because there's many trucks
of Aid Waiting On the Border needing the
approval of Israel to go through I think
it's it's urgently needed because people
dying uh they they face like difficulty
in finding food or water they queuing
and some of them like came on social
media saying like even we are going to
go back to the north again because we
can't find food we can't find even
safety which we uh took the hardship to
go there from the uh from North to the
sou so now we should go back home at
least we have like some stuff to to live
on in our in our home yeah",20231018
HKszVaKhUko,Israel says Gaza hospital blast was caused by Palestinian rockets - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel says Gaza hospital blast was caused by Palestinian rockets - BBC News.jpg,"you're watching continued coverage of
the conflict between Israel and Gaza and
at the moment we're listening into a
press conference by the spokesperson of
the Israel Defense Forces his putting
forward
his his evidence that Israel was not
behind an explosion at a hospital in
Gaza City let's go back and listen
that's that's the logic and about the
next stages of the war I will not talk
about here of the next stages of the war
see Jeremy
B thank you very much General uh do you
think that the governments of do you
think that the governments uh that
condemned Israel last night will believe
your explanation I'm referring to Jordan
Egypt Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates think all all of the countries
that you mentioned uh are watching the
BBC carefully and and uh looking
carefully what the BBC said and I hope
after our uh uh in our our aftermath
that shows it was cross checked and we
took the time because we didn't want to
be non-reliable and we didn't want us to
infect with our credibility I hope the
BBC will now share this investigation
and those countries will listen to the
BBC and we will also share United States
a more uh intimate and also United
Kingdom a more intimate review so the BB
BBC can show it and those countries
those Arab countries that you mentioned
which is very important for Israel of
course from the Abra Accords and other
countries who also would be threatened
by Hamas Isis ideology should understand
our war what Kamas Isis did on the
massacre on Saturday is not nothing to
do with
Islam people killed babies people killed
families women were raped women were
raped
people were beheaded this is against
Islam this is against Islam any Arab
country will show me a fatwa that goes
with Islam this is against Islam Hamas
is Isis it's not it's not a it's not a
one Terror activity it's a scale
Massacre of the governs of the Gaza City
of Gaza which is Hamas Hamas made a
scale Massacre which is a govern it's
the Sovereign it's a sovereign Massacre
this is why Hamas Isis we must fight
it I just follow up on that um I mean
you you you're essentially saying that
the these Arab governments watch the BBC
and made up their minds uh they came out
with their statements long before I
filed so I mean I'm I'm impressed you
think we have so much plout in the world
but to be honest they have their own
sources of information which is why they
moved those statements came from the
highest level foreign minister and the
public I guess in in the first time
because people feel empathy uh with
hearing that someone bombed in hospital
or when they see people are dying so
they go out and do uh statements and
it's okay and I'm not blaming of course
they being emotional I say I think and
it and it sounds reasonable but now
after evidence being shown and I think
it it serves Hamas Hamas is a is a
terror like Isis it's media and sword
he wants to go to the media he wants to
be viral that creates a viral imagery so
after the conversation you heard when
they say it's Islamic Jihad he said okay
now we're going to take the benefit out
of it and we're going to show the world
and and they know it's going to be viral
so I'm not blaming anybody to showing it
I'm just trying to now fix it because we
were blamed before that that when we're
to speed and and to that we we're asking
are you credible we're taking the time
to be credible sometime the
speed defects
it Kesley New York
Times thanks Admiral um I have some
technical questions in your footage That
You released last night uh some of that
footage was uh uh filmed by alzer our
team assessed that uh footage and uh at
least one of the Munitions appears to be
traveling a different direction the one
that you assess in your map it's it's
traveling uh northwesterly not
northeasterly as your map
suggests uh second of all did you fire
did the IDF fire any Iron Dome
interceptors or artillery Munitions at
6:59 p.m. um uh from Israel into Gaza uh
thirdly can you share the intercepted
audio of the Hamas members that you um
just played I think that would be
important for our assessment um
questions I know but we haven't got much
time uh Hospital officials said that
smaller strikes targeted the hospital on
Saturday and that they were warned by
phone by Israeli officials to vacate the
hospital do you have any uh response to
that um and finally is there any
evidence of secondary
explosions okay
let's start with the first thing Iron
Dome we do not intercept inside Gaza
okay Iron Dome we do not intercept
inside Gaza this is not an iron D issue
Iron Dome is used for preventing the
Rockets to being hit in Israel that's
the first question second question those
uh uh independent videos which we showed
of the failure that you mentioned are
not only the force element of the check
it's not we didn't base our effects on
those independent videos it's extra uh
so I hear what the New York Times says
and it's extra uh and the uh the reports
that you mentioned about telling the the
hospital to be evacuate earlier days
before I will check it I do not know the
answer I want to give you an answer
which is uncorrect and you asked about
the secondary uh explosion in the in the
parking lot what again what we see here
in the picture and this is which this is
the the most important thing aerial
munition doesn't look like that aerial
munition of Israel would have caused
intact to the
walls it would have caused the
crater okay and it makes completely
logic as much as we know that most of
this damage was done due to the
propellent existence not just the
Warhead because of the short range
because the launches
failed so fire after land yeah because
those those Rockets should have been
gone far away to Israel so you have a
large existence of propellant Sky News
deorah
H thank you very much um question please
uh you said that you believe that the um
the number of casualties has been
inflated can you give an assessment of
what you believe um that number of dead
and wounded to be um and secondly
regardless how um how credible the
evidence is that you show that this uh
explosion was not caused by an Israeli
munition your enemies are going to still
blame Israel and it's the fact that many
Palestinian civilians have been killed
since this um military operation began
are you losing the information war and
given how important that is is there a a
potential to maybe change Tac this is
you said this is going to to be
officials said it's going to be a long
War are you not losing it by using so
much military power on Gaza while the
rans there
okay we'll try to answer the second
question before that because I think
it's it's important the information war
is a hard War it's a hard enemy to
win because this enemy has built his
logic very very wisely using the
population as a human shield Hamas
pictured himself in the world as a
charity organization donating money for
the poor for the poor gazen of Hamas
while we see all the money that came to
Hamas most of it goes to tunnels goes to
this scale massacred operation all the
donations from many countries in the
world including Europe secondly we've SE
we've seen and also unra had verified it
that Hamas is
stealing gasoline food and also we found
in Israel during the massacre the kits
of the uh medical kits were unra kits
used by the the terrorists we are
fighting something that is hard to
explain he's using the donation that you
sent he's using the unra uh possessions
that are meant to go to this the poor
Gaz and those poor Palestinians that
were hijacked by Kamas and he's using it
he took all the gazoline that could have
helped for
desination inside the Gaza for 6 days it
could have gone gas for hospitals he
took it to his own infrastructure
military infrastructure military the
terror infrastructures that needs this
gas this is who we fighting against this
is who we fighting against and we have
to win this information war with
evidence not with false
uncredible uh uh uh statements we have
to win it with evidence we have no other
way we must stay moral we must play
Accord the international law we have no
other way otherwise we won't be a
Democrat liberal Country and this is
what we're fighting it's a Democrat
liberal country
fighting any Hamas Isis controlled gazan
area with Innocent civilians
Palestinians that is using them as a
human shield that is the event that is
the event we're fighting we have to
fight we cannot live next to our borders
with Hamas Isis governs that will
threaten our civilians and do Massacre
where you rape women beheaded the bodies
kidnap babies do you understand that
while we speak babies are being held in
Gaza women young girls that went to a
music festival of being held in
Gaza dead bodies are being held Gaza old
people old people some of them were in
the Holocaust are held now in
Gaza how come you take old people how
come you take babies how do you kidnap
this kind of more than almost 200 people
have been
kidnapped how do you do this some of
them are
foreigners this is what we're fighting
and now they're going to show videos of
those hijacks they want to terrorize the
family we will not be terrorized we we
have our values we know what we're
fighting for we know what we fighting
for
we fighting for our country we fighting
to be with our values a moral country
that is a Democrat liberal Jewish
country this is who we are going to stay
here like
that Israeli hostages babies in Gaza and
yet you're still struggling with the
information War because Palestinian
civilians are being killed in Israeli
bombardment but isn't it time to is
there another way that's what I'm asking
and can you just answer that question
about your assessment on the casualties
please you say it was inflated the
casualties is inflation we understand
from intelligence and I will not we will
share it with the
government uh and I don't want to say
the numbers here and
uh This Is Not Another Round in
Gaza this is not that it's something
else we understand that the mask have
fallen down we are living next to Isis
governing Hamas State we cannot we
cannot live like that in the world it's
it's a world problem not just Israel
problem it's a world problem this can
shift away exactly like Isis it can
shift away to Arab countries and it can
shift away everywhere I I would say
cynically that that the G should ask
mamad Salah Maran Isa why why is it
happening to them and if other countries
in the world can make Kamas surrender
with no no conditions and bring all
hijacks back to Israel show us the way
you do that show us the way you do that
and we will do that we understand we
have no other way to fight that the way
we're fighting and the
times I and S has already been passed on
to the Americans and to other Western
allies were the Americans involved in
the examination deing process and did
they at any point provide you with the
satellite footage that they have of the
no we used only our systems Manel and we
will provide all this information today
uh to the Americans and not just the
Americans and did you get any any know
corroboration from any other source
outside it and the independent video we
are credible with our information with
our intelligence with our system there
are the intelligence is credible all
along the intelligence community in the
in the world with the five eyes Etc this
this would be very very credible
information that any country will rely
on and of course our footage eory the
Air Force way to review things is very
very credible in the world and it those
things will show credible to any liberal
democracy Washington Post
Shir hi so thank you for this um I have
a technical question about the
intelligence you got uh he said it there
were people speaking who said the rocket
was launched from New York d
so how far were those two locations
that's one um number two is what is the
rationale of calling the South the safe
Zone if there are still some off there
to what extent it's in North with
Central Target right now and the south
at what point you know how what is the
difference between North and South in
the campaign number two and number three
um you are absolutely right that money
has been funneled from
social uh organizations to military ones
um but is it you know is Israel's goal
to take up Hamas completely does that
mean only military leaders does that
mean people who are involved in soci
program uh how how extensive is that and
if that is everyone does that not just
mean that Hamas is there really a
difference between Hamas and Gaza in
that and we start with the last question
I think it's the most important one
there is a completely different
between the Gaz and Palestinians and
Hamas as a
sovereign it wasn't like that all Years
everybody knows that it's a completely
different thing and and most of the Gaz
and Palestinians are not Kamas as a
sovereign military and politically but
we must take the Sovereign the Govern
down that's for your first question then
you asked about in the beginning in the
about the intelligence we understand
there is a cemetery nearby the alali
mahani hospital and they probably fired
for from the cemetery as they mentioned
theel in the conversation and they also
refer to an Islamic Jihad failure which
they were are using as a propaganda
against Israel and if you can remind me
the other question you asked
um yeah the the the logic of of
considering the sou Hamas is still there
you're right that Hamas is all along
Gaza but most of US military
infrastructure governing infrastructure
are in Gaza City and his area this is
why we asking to go south to W Gaza okay
and that is uh it's not for it's until
we finish what we need to finish in uh
this area where it has governing and
Military and terrorizing from this area
of Gaza City and its peripheral to
Israel but yes we we will attack in all
Gaza by intelligence and we will Attack
by in international law and before that
will be based on intelligence and which
we will try always to minimize the
casualties of civilians as Patrick
yes uh this very serious incident just
occur in the hospital do you think it
will delay or prevent you to launch a
ground operation inside Gaza if it's
actually what you're
planning this is a very serious incident
because the civilians were casual this
is why we take it seriously this is why
we took our time to be credible again
this is why we took our time to be
credible and we didn't jump into
statements so we take it very very
seriously and I think the world should
hold up Islamic Jihad and everybody
knows who's funding Islamic Jihad
Islamic Jihad is 100% funded by Iran the
Rockets of Islamic Jihad are funded by
Iran I repeat it Iran funds Hamas but it
does 100% for Islamic Jihad Islamic
Jihad caused the casualties in the
hospital in Al maani Hospital the
casualties are by Islamic Jihad the
rocket is being funded or delivered from
Iran Iran caused this death in alali
madani hospital in the end of the day",20231018
cSATDbrezNs,US President Joe Biden to travel to Israel - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US President Joe Biden to travel to Israel - BBC News.jpg,"well President Biden is due to arrive in
the region tomorrow he's expected to
meet the Israeli Prime Minister then
he'll travel to Aman Jordan's capital to
meet other key Regional leaders but the
Palestinian president Mahmud abas has
tonight cancelled after the Gaza blast
and Rishi sunak may also travel to the
Middle East in the coming days let's
talk to our North America editor Sarah
Smith who's on the line Sarah um
President Biden's plane I think was
already in the air uh uh while this
explosion and this blast took place how
does that change the dynamic of the
conversations he was going to have with
regional leaders
here it's made the situation much more
complicated now president B he's
actually due to leave the white house
any minute now and we'll be setting off
very shortly an Air Force One heading
for Tel Aviv and I mean this is an
extraordinary trip which was a very high
Stak scamble even before the news came
in of this Hospital bombing it's a visit
with two purposes really and both of
those two-fold missions got considerably
more difficult today firstly he wants to
go there to demonstrate what he calls
his Ironclad commitment to Israel and to
its right to defend itself now that is a
position that Joe Biden has had for well
over 50 years now but it is a position
that is much much more uncomfortable to
defend tonight than it was even just
this morning the other thing he wants to
try to achieve is to get Israel to ow
emergency humanitarian Aid into Gaza and
to put in place some kind of measures to
try to protect innocent civilian lives
that just looks a lot more difficult now
as well because you've got the American
president flying into a situation where
the Hamas leader says it's the fault of
the US that this Hospital bombing has
happened because America gives Israel
cover for its aggression he says as you
were reporting the Palestinian president
uh Mahmud abbas's can cancelled his
meeting with Joe Biden and then at the
same time Israel are going to ask him
for over $1 billion worth of emergency
military aid so he is arriving in a
situation that was already complex and
it is now considerably more volatile
before he even touches
down indeed okay Sarah thank you we're
going to go back to Jeremy Bowen now in
southern Israel uh Jeremy we're just
hearing from Sarah Smith um in
Washington about how all this
complicates the task that Joe Biden had
in trying to broker some kind of deal to
get Aid into Gaza um the magnitude of
this uh tragedy tonight how does that
complicate things on the ground do you
think when it comes to that part of what
he was trying to
do I think it's immensely complex I
think that anyway it was a gamble as
Sarah said had the President coming over
here normally presidents get on their
planes and turn up to sign agreements
when the agreements have already been
negotiated when they know what they're
going into Joe Biden didn't really know
what he was coming into and the
Americans weren't sure because the fast
moving uh nature of what was happening
before the attack on the hospital now by
this morning by the time he lands
assuming he goes ahead and takes off
well it's going to be even more complex
in Lebanon that calling hisbah are
calling for a day of Rage there will be
more demonstrations elsewhere those
countries which the Americans regard as
allies are condemning Israel uh and
there's and as for this business about
who actually did it maybe the Americans
will say that they have satellite
information maybe they're watching
what's going on with their you know very
advanced technology I mean one thing I
would say
was that it was judging by the video
that was posted and by the the level of
casualties and judging also by the fact
that the whole building appears to have
been destroyed it was a very powerful
missile now one thing will that will
have to be established in any
investigation even a really quick one
over the next 12 or 24 hours is whether
Palestinian Islamic Jihad who was
specifically mentioned by the Israelis
which is the number two group in uh
armed group in Gaza whether they had
missiles which had that much power in
them the missiles that have been hitting
here in ashalon cause pretty much minor
damage so these are questions which I
can't answer but which need to be
answered to get some clarity on this
because you know the sides are way way
apart and what's really significant I
think is that levels of hatred uh are
growing really
exponentially among people who are
involved in all of this and uh one
mission for President Biden when he
decided to come here was to try to stop
the whole thing escalating stop the
whole thing spreading and as he's even
preparing to get on his plane the risks
of that happening have increased
marketly Jeremy thank you Jeremy Bo in
there live in southern Israel President
Biden preparing to make what will be an
even more difficult Journey here to the
region uh than was the case a few hours
ago",20231017

Palestinians in the Israel Gaza War so
far hundreds are dead after a blast at a
hospital chaos and horror at the scene
much of the building has been
destroyed a panic to treat the injured
thousands of people were Sheltering at
the hospital having fled Israel's
bombing campaign
targeting
Hamas they thought they were safe now
gazans once again count the cost of this
war Israel denies it was responsible
blaming Palestinian Islamic Jihad Jordan
Egypt the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia condemn what they say was an
Israeli
attack the Missile hit the hospital
not long after
dark Allah you can hear the
impact the explosion destroyed Al akley
hospital it was already damaged from a
smaller attack at the weekend the
building was
flattened very soon video was posted
from Gaza of bodies laid out near the
ruins of the
hospital so many dead and the size of
the explosion
together looked to be having a profound
impact on what was already the most
dangerous crisis in the Middle East in a
[Music]
generation the wounded were taken across
Gaza City to shifa
hospital the Israeli Army's First
Response said hospitals were highly
sensitive and not targets of its
military and urged caution about what it
called the UN verified claims of a
terrorist
[Music]
organization that statement will not be
believed by Palestinians and by millions
of others in the Middle East who see
these
images the wounded and the dying pouring
into shifa from alaki arrived at a
hospital already overwhelmed by
thousands of casualties from Israeli a
strikes it was already struggling to
treat patients after Israel Cut Off fuel
water food and deliveries of medical
supplies Jordan and Egypt condemned
Israel for a dangerous
escalation Jordan said the International
Community should pressure Israel to stop
its attacks to prevent what it called
wide cycles of
violence as Fury and fear gripped
Palestinians Israel denied that it was
responsible we would not deliberately
Target a hospital now my information
that I have just received from the
highest Authority because I asked about
this I know you would ask me about this
is that all indications are that this
was not Israeli ordinance but this was
rather a Hamas rocket that fell short
now I want to explain this from past
conflicts with the terrorists in Gaza we
know that on average about 33% of the
rockets that they shoot at us fall short
and land in
Gaza pictures posted on social media
show many children among the casualties
in Gaza so many people needed treatment
that the corridors of shifa Hospital
were packed the destruction of alaki
hospital is also spreading fear among
the hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians who fled to gaza's Southern
border with Egypt after Israel told them
to leave their homes there's 8, people
here at night it's usually rockus it's
loud people are you know running kids
are running around tonight there is
silence absolute silence you can't hear
a thing the people are just in absolute
shock about what's happened it's really
really shocking and and I just don't
know what to say I have no
words anger spilled onto the streets in
the Occupy West Bank the other part of
the Palestinian territories that's
separated from Gaza by
Israel since Hamas attacked out of Gaza
on the 7th of October there had been
fears that mass casualties caused by
Israel's response could ignite West Bank
towns that have been the center of
unrest for well over a
year the young men on the streets and
Palestinian armed groups in the West
Bank will not believe Israel denials the
latest from Israel's prime minister
blaming what he called barbaric
terrorists for the
attack the attack is a seismic event in
a war that might spread elsewhere in the
Middle East there are reports that the
Palestinian president has canceled a
meeting with the US president who's due
in Israel tomorrow morning on a mission
that was aimed at easing the plight of
Palestinian civilians and who will now
walk into an even deeper crisis let's
just pick up with Jeremy boen our
International editor um if we can and I
just want to make the point Jeremy that
obviously this is a shocking event
tonight that we've all seen both sides
um are putting forward competing claims
about who is responsible trying to get
at the truth of this is going to be very
difficult
indeed yeah it will do uh will be Clive
and of course more than anything it's an
appalling tragedy for the hundreds of
people who were killed the thousands who
were injured their families in a place
where civilians are already going
through uh a terrible ordeal now in
terms of the different assertions that
are being made uh Israel very quickly
denied it had anything to do with it
even more
quickly Arab countries blamed Israel it
wasn't just Hamas blaming Israel it was
uh Egypt and Jordan who have peace
treaties with Israel it was the United
Arab Emirates which normalized relations
with Israel under the Abraham Accords it
was Saudi Arabia who until all this
started was talking to the Americans
about normalizing relations with Israel
so that already is a sea change in the
the
the complexities of politics in the
Middle East and I think that the way
that this is going already the sheer
volume of casualties on top of all the
other people in all the other people all
the other civilians in Gaza who've been
killed I think that is
enormously dangerous and inflammatory
and I think as well that uh the
consequences of this could be very
serious",20231017

coming into us from Gaza following
reports of an Israeli air strike on a
hospital in central Gaza these are
pictures we understand of another
hospital in Gaza where patients from
that strike on another hospital are
being brought to the health Ministry in
Gaza is reporting that there have been
500 casualties in that Israeli air
strike uh we don't have those figures
verified but they are reporting that 300
people have been
killed just want to show you those still
images as well that we've had
in and this is pictures that we've had
which have been verified of this
Hospital the Al Ali Hospital in the
center of the Gaza Strip following that
air strike well let's talk to our
correspondent John Don and who is
following all the developments in Gaza
John welcome to you little information
coming into us just bring us up to date
on what we do know about these reports
of a strike on this
Hospital well look certainly at this
stage it looks to be one of the most
deadly attacks of this conflict so far
it's very difficult to get an accurate
picture of the numbers at this stage
this is
the uh Hospital run by the Baptist
Church it's right in the center of uh
Gaza City close to the main Square uh
we've seen the first images coming in uh
showing buildings on fire and as you say
in terms of numbers we've got the civil
defense Authority in Gaza talking about
300 people being killed and the health
Ministry saying 500 but I should say at
this stage uh it's difficult really for
anyone to know but we're getting images
of the injured being uh rushed to
hospital in Gaza other hospitals I mean
you have to remember that at this time
there will have been hundreds if not
thousands of people displaced from their
homes Sheltering in this Hospital uh
thinking it was a safe place we have
contacted the Israeli Defense Force uh
for comment but we've not heard back yet
and just give us a sense of the
geography you said it's in central Gaza
and you described it as being run by the
Baptist Church so this would have been
very well known um a location as a
hospital
yeah absolutely certainly everyone in
Gaza would have known uh where it was
it's actually not that far from the BBC
office in Gaza I've walk past it at many
times when I was working there uh and
it's uh you know there's not a large
Christian population in Gaza but this
was run by uh the Baptist Church so
every hospital uh in Gaza at the moment
is not just a place where they're
treating thousands of casualties it's
also a place where people are seeking
shelter we've seen the pictures from
shifa hospital also in Gaza City where
you got thousands of people camped out
in the hospital and in the hospital
grounds and we think it will have been
the same there yeah and just looking uh
for any kind of reaction from Israel and
as you mentioned no response as yet do
you think we can expect one fairly
soon well they're going to be being
asked uh what happened uh was this a
mistake were they targeting someone or
something specific uh in that hospital
or below that hospital uh they're going
to be at being asked because of course
we've got uh Joe Biden arriving tomorrow
and the Americans have been urging uh
Israel to limit the number of Civilian
casualties and if Joe Biden arrives here
tomorrow morning and we're getting
confirmation that we've got people
having been killed in their hundreds in
a hospital uh in in an apparent Israeli
air strike
then um that presumably is not going to
go down very well yeah and give us a
sense of I mean how many people may
possibly have been there I know it's
impossible for you to say exactly but
given that so many people have been
displaced and they have been moving to
places of what they think is safety like
hospitals like
schools yeah I mean look we know that
about 600,000 people have uh moved South
after that warning from Israel to
evacuate their homes uh last week but
there are lots of people who can't move
or didn't want to move you know the
injured the vulnerable uh people in
hospital they can't move so a lot of
people have been uh just heading to
anywhere they think is uh relatively
safe though that that could be schools
it could be un facilities it could be
hospitals we know that we've also heard
this evening uh that a un school has
been hit in the center of Gaza City six
people killed there including some un
staff and the United Nations body there
in Gaza calling that uh strike
outrageous we've got people just packed
into anywhere they think might be safe
apparently in the south of Gaza near
Rafa you've got 8,000 PE people packed
into a warehouse with very very limited
facilities so people are going anywhere
that they think was safe but a hospital
not even a hospital is a safe place yeah
John Hamas of uh released a statement
calling the attack on the hospital in
the Gaza Strip a war crime it said the
hospital was housing hundreds of sick
and wounded and P people forcibly
displaced from their homes as a result
of other strikes the statement says
hundreds of victims are still under the
rubble um obviously we just have their
words at the moment we are waiting for
any kind of response from Israel who
have just said that they will look into
it",20231017
la9nJn1juLw,Your Questions Answered: Why is Biden going to Israel? – BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Your Questions Answered Why is Biden going to Israel – BBC News.jpg,"hello and welcome to your questions
answered on BBC News we call it yqa for
short uh we've been looking at what
you're searching for on the BBC website
about the Israel Gaza war and so for the
next few minutes we'll try and get you
some answers with our team of
correspondents so with me to answer some
of them our security correspondent Frank
Gardner and our Middle East analyst
Sebastian user nice to see you both
thank you for being here also joining us
our Middle East correspondent Tom bakan
who is in Jerusalem welcome to you too
as well Tom Frank let me start with you
because one of the most obvious
questions right now and we've had this
news confirmed that President Biden will
travel to um Israel why is he going what
can he do there this is incredibly
unusual it normally takes weeks if not
months of planning for a US president to
make an official visit like this the
Secret Service will deploy first weeks
in advance searching everywhere that
he's going to be with sniffer dogss
wrecking the route that he's going to
take for Air Force One to come in at
this critical Time Shows just how
seriously and how concerned the White
House is about this war spinning out of
out of control the US has two concerns
one is the fact that there are clearly a
huge amount of Civilian casualties that
these are not so-called surgical strikes
an awful expression but you know they
understand Israel's need to respond to
the atrocities that were committed in
southern Israel on on October the 7th
but they want Israel to show a bit of
restraint which it doesn't appear to be
showing much of at the moment and the
second is they're deeply worried about
it spinning out of control about it
sucking in drawing in other countries
notably Iran and its proxy force hasb in
southern Lebanon yeah let's talk to Tom
bman who's in Jerusalem and and Tom I
wonder how this will be viewed there um
how will this visit go down in
Jerusalem well it's going to be uh
absolutely critical for Benjamin
Netanyahu this visit because remember
actually before this uh crisis and War
Began Benjamin Netanyahu was in serious
political trouble this country had had
unprecedented uh protests for nearly a
year against his Hardline Ultra
nationalist government now in the course
of that Benjamin Netanyahu hadn't had an
invite to the White House as uh since he
was elected late last year and for
Israeli Prime Minister that was becoming
deeply embarrassing for him it was
leading to
lots of questions because Joe Biden was
uh basic basically pretty angry about
the uh Ultra nationalist makeup of
Benjamin netanyahu's government he
didn't like it he certainly didn't want
to reward Mr Netanyahu with a visit to
the White House so politically this is
really important in terms of sort of
bolstering what we now have is an
emergency wartime government in Israel
opposition figures have come in and this
is the most visible signal you can get
that Mr Biden is absolutely backing the
state of Israel
uh in a time of what they see as
historic crisis so it really matters and
as Frank was talking about those two
absolutely key objectives it's also a
signal to Iran you know we've heard the
rhetoric absolutely ratcheting up in the
last 24 hours from the Iranians talking
about the potential for you know a clear
escalation trying to deter an Israeli
ground Invasion uh into Gaza so this is
about security uh Global Security and
it's about the uh political support for
Israel at the moment Tom stay with us um
a few more questions to ask you uh over
the coming minutes but let me bring in
Sebastian at this point and and and Tom
raised the point there didn't it it's
this idea of you know um unconditional
support unequivocal support um does that
embolden Israel and and and I guess is
there a point when that starts to run
out that unconditional support I mean
emboldening Israel is one way of looking
I think uh in terms of the influence
that the US has on Israel I mean this
blows hot and cold to some extent I mean
what is true that whatever the nature of
a US Government whatever temporary
fallouts they may have within Israel as
as Tom was saying that as President
Biden has had with Netanyahu over the
past few months when it comes down to it
America stands 100% with Israel I mean
it sees Israel as essentially almost a
projection of itself in the Middle East
the only democracy in the Middle East as
they always like to say a sping the
values that the US Prides itself on uh
and is a key Ally regionally in all the
conflicts and and and and and problems
but that there are there conditions as
such I mean what the US has wanted to do
is to portray itself also as a
relatively evenhanded mediator between
Israel and the Palestinians in order
despite the slight hiccup when President
Trump was in power but over the past few
decades the two State solution at the
moment there's no real momentum in that
process whatsoever hasn't been for some
years but there's been talk about that
again all around from the US and beyond
that this could be an opportunity when
the war is over to look at that because
we've seen the abyss and this might be
the only way out of it so in terms of
conditionality there I mean the US has
criticized Israel most regularly about
the settlements the settlements I mean
clearly are seen internationally as the
biggest obstacle to any kind of peace to
any kind of setting up of of of two
states the way they've developed over
the past 20 years has meant that more
and more of a territory that would have
been Palestinian is now going to be more
and more difficult if there ever is a
resolution on that to actually hand it
over to remove the settlers so there
have been a lot of fallouts over that
and there's been more criticism over
that under the Biden Administration
certainly than we heard under President
Trump back more to what we are used to
but as I say when it comes down to it
and as Frank was saying there I mean
this is both about what President Biden
wants to achieve in the way this
conflict is is going but also wants to
make a huge gesture of solidarity with
the Israeli people um Frank on the other
side of this conflict is Hamas um and
interesting that warning coming from
Iran this morning saying that uh Israel
will not be allowed to act in the Gaza
Strip without consequences warn of
preemptive action they say in the coming
hours why is Iran such a backer of
Hamas um well both are dedicated to the
destruction of the state of Israel they
don't think that Israel should exist
even within its pre-1967 borders just to
be clear the Palestinian Authority which
rules in the West Bank out of
rala does believe in a two-state
solution is prepared to live side by
side with an Israeli State um Iran has
um funded supported trained armed
equipped a number of proxies around the
Middle East the most famous of being
Hezbollah in Lebanon which is not only a
military force but a political force it
is the strongest element the strongest
force in Lebanon if Iran and Hezbollah
decided the time was right then if
hasola was to unleash its arsenal of
missiles and Rockets on Israel then
Israel would find itself fighting a war
on two fronts in the south in Gaza and
in the North in Lebanon and these this
Arsenal is substantial Hezbollah are
probably better trained better equipped
better armed than Hamas the Israel
fought a war with them in 2006 I helped
cover out of Jerusalem and the Israelis
thought that they could win that war
just from the air and they couldn't they
went in on the ground with their maava
tanks and they got ambushed really
severely by hasbalah hasbalah really
gave them a bloody nose nobody won that
war it was unfinished business so that
would be a very serious blow um it's not
clear that hasbalah want to actually go
to war with them right now that's
exactly the the the the thing at the
moment that the skirmishes that are
happening on the border are remaining
within the sort of Rules of Engagement
between isra and HB hasb clearly wants
to send a signal but they're getting
more intense every single day I mean we
just had a few hours ago four people
trying to get across to plant an
explosive were killed by the Israelis
but they haven't said it wasb because
there's Palestinian factions at work
there as well and the one thing to say
about Hezbollah as you say there a huge
power within the leban state and they
look to that as well they're not just
looking towards Israel and what Iran
says they also have to think of
themselves as a rational player Within
Lebanese context which in a sense Reigns
them in a little more than say Hamas who
essentially own your answerable to
themselves don't forget that you've got
two US Navy um aircraft carrier strike
groups cruising just offshore in the
Eastern Mediterranean as a warning to
Iran and Syria possibly don't get
involved this is not your fight stay out
of it so that if Hezbollah did get
involved there is a risk that I think
that this would bring in the US Navy who
would start using their missiles and
their massive strike force of aircraft
to Target Hezbollah and which would
internationalize this whole conflict
yeah and that is really is the challenge
and when we get a sense of who are those
supporters around the world just just
bring us as a reminders Frank if you
will who is supporting Israel right now
well primarily Israel uh sorry primarily
the United States as its closest Ally
but also most western Nations have given
it rhetorical support um often mixed
with humanitarian aid for the
Palestinians so Britain for example is
giving $10 million of aid but is
politically supporting Israel because of
the the sheer barbarity and extent of
that attack on October the 7th that
Saturday morning um you know the the
similarities with Isis but that said
Western countries are now getting very
concerned about the appalling death toll
and the casualties and the misery
inflicted in Gaza by Israeli air strikes
and the blockade I I remind you people
are watching your questions answer these
are the questions that people are
submitting online there's much more
detail on all of these stories on BBC
News online bbc.com
newws and let's talk and let me bring
back in Tom who's in Jerusalem and um
Tom let's talk about what happens next
one of the questions that's being asked
a lot online is has Israel ever lost a
war and that could be a significant
question going
forward well it's quite a hard question
to answer that because there are those
who would say inside and outside of
Israel that in a sense Israel always
feels itself War ever ever since its
foundation in
1948 uh as a new Jewish state in this
wider Arab region there have been many
Arab Israeli Wars State on state between
Arab neighbors and the Israelis and also
since 1967 Israel's occupation of the
Palestinian territory so those
Palestinians have lived under occupation
they will say they feel like this is a
sort of ongoing war and in a sense the
internally the front lines of that sort
of move around it's never uh
particularly
calm but in terms of traditional War I
mean Frank mentioned uh 2006 where
Hezbollah claimed a victory um you know
you had uh after uh Israel had withdrawn
from Southern Lebanon in 2000 and
elements of that from right back to 1982
uh Israel's invasion of uh Lebanon and
driving the PLO yasa arafat's PLO out of
Beirut elements of that were deeply
unpopular among um Israelis but I think
probably the most sort of qualified
military failure that's always seen
historically by Israelis is the 1973 yum
kipor War now this was when uh the
Egyptians and the syrians launched a
sneak attack and in some senses you know
this was 50 years ago this month it's
had this huge resonance with the Hamas
uh attack and the atrocities of this
week which were so unexpected on a sort
of historical level many people have
thought back to what happened uh in the
yapor War of 1973 although again that
was states that was armies against
armies it didn't have this same sense of
you know civilians being the uh rather
the very sort of atrocious Target of
much of this um but that's often seen as
a big failure by Israel a failure of
intelligence although they drove back
the Egyptians and the syrians and retook
the territories that they had already
occupied in the Goan Heights and the sin
it led in effect years later to a a
peace treaty and a territorial with
retreat by the Israelis Tom really good
to have you there thank you uh and
Sebastian let me ask you this quickly um
it seems maybe perhaps to talk about
people just visiting the region perhaps
on holiday but it's important is it safe
is the question that people are
searching for online can they visit the
region maybe to Egypt for example or to
other countries that are near Israel and
Gaza um I mean I think to Egypt and what
you're not going to see and and as was
essentially being explained by Tom there
you you're not going to see Arab states
themselves involved in a direct walk
with Israel over this and Egypt Jordan
you know the countries that are nearest
they're safe but you are going to be in
a very fevered frenzy time there's going
to be lots of protests there's going to
be you know unrest on the streets
definitely which will build as this goes
on so in major cities you'd have to
think carefully about whether you wanted
to be there Lebanon I mean from my
friends from people there I mean people
are leaving Lebanon like nobody's
business strangely enough they were
talking about this several weeks before
this happened they were saying we're
expecting something big to happen don't
come to Lebanon this year and people are
not going uh Sebastian Frank really good
to have you both with us and thank you
of course to Tom bman who was in
Jerusalem for us you are watching BBC

WSHhlCrOJWY,US President Joe Biden to visit Israel as Iran warns against Gaza offensive - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US President Joe Biden to visit Israel as Iran warns against Gaza offensive - BBC News.jpg,"hello and a very warm welcome to the
program I'm Sally bundock and we start
with the news that US President Joe
Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday in
a show of support after more than 1,400
people were killed by Hamas gunmen last
weekend top us Diplomat Anthony blinkin
made the announcement after late night
talks in Tel Aviv he also said the US
and Israel had agreed on a plan to allow
humanitarian Aid into Gaza where un
agencies have warned of a deepening
crisis and more than 2,800 people there
have been killed by Israeli air strikes
meanwhile Hamas which is designated as a
terrorist organization by governments
including the UK and US says it fired a
barrage of rockets at Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv overnight with Sirens sending
lawmakers to bomb shelters and we can
bring you some live pictures of Gaza
today it's now just after 8 a.m. with
another very difficult day ahead for
garans who are coping with uh severe uh
restrictions on water electricity with
Food Supplies running dry and also uh
critical medicines running
out so more now on the news that
President Joe Biden will visit Israel on
Wednesday US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin said President Biden will focus
on securing the release of hostages
taken by Hamas while underscoring the to
minimize civilian casualties in Gaza the
United States and Israel have agreed to
develop a plan that will enable
humanitarian aid from donor Nations and
multilateral organizations to reach
civilians in Gaza and them alone
including the possibility of creating
areas to help keep civilians out of
Harm's Way It Is critical that Aid begin
flowing into Gaza as soon as possible we
share Israel's concern that Hamas May
seize or destroy Aid entering Gaza or
otherwise is preventing it from reaching
the people who need it if Hamas in any
way blocks humanitarian assistance from
reaching civilians including by seizing
the aid itself we'll be the first to
condemn it and we will work to prevent
it from happening again we welcome the
government of Israel's commitment to
work on this plan the president very
much looks forward to discussing it
further when he's here on Wednesday well
I spoke to our North America
correspondent David Willis who explained
the significance of the president's
visit well Anthony blink Sally said that
this was all about confirming the United
States solidarity uh with Israel and as
he put it the Ironclad commitment to
Israel's security and President Biden as
part of this visit will be receiving
what's called a classified and
comprehensive brief on Israel's war aims
and strategy now of course uh key
element of that strategy is thought to
be some sort of ground Invasion and it's
become clear that uh given the
full-throated support for Israel's def
right to defend itself earlier on the
United States has grown increasingly
concerned about the possibility of some
sort of humanitarian crisis given the
fact that water and Food Supplies
already said to be running low in parts
of the enclave and so on so a part of
this uh meeting today with Benjamin
Netanyahu on the part of the US
Secretary of State and blinkin was its
thought to ring some sort of
humanitarian reassurances on behalf of
the United States and some of its Arab
allies uh regarding the possible uh
terms of that ground Invasion if you
like the creation of safe areas for
Palestinian civilians who uh obviously
do not want to get involved in uh what's
going to be happening there and also uh
some sort of means of getting
humanitarian foreign aid into those who
are not involved with Hamas also the
president is expected to meet with other
leaders in the region isn't
he he is yes he's going to go on to a
man in Jordan where he's to meet with
King Abdullah and also president CeCe of
Egypt and the Palestinian leader Mahmud
Abbas now President Biden the United
States uh wants to want to prevent this
conflict from spreading and uh from
other actors Hezbollah most notably
among them from becoming involved and
broadening this conflict so it is very
important to keep those sort of allies
on board and to be seen to be listening
to their concerns and of course primary
among those concerns is that sort of
humanitarian crisis that could develop
so easily in Gaza uh if Israel does
indeed Mount this ground offensive Sally",20231017

had news of an Israeli air strike on the
Rafa Crossing of on the border with
Egypt our correspondent there tells us a
building on the Palestinian side of the
crossing has been damaged and there is
also damaged to the vital Road between
Gaza and Egypt the United Nations says
Israel's total Siege of Gaza cutting off
fuel food and electricity supplies is
causing a deepening humanitarian crisis
with hospitals close to complete
collapse it threatens thousands of lives
meanwhile thousands of Palestinians who
have left their homes hoping to cross
into Egypt have been left disappointed
with a Crossing remaining closed Jeremy

another war of words has started over
who's responsible for the suffering of
Palestinian civilians in

bombs it says Blame Hamas for killing
and kidnapping and says Israel hiding
behind
civilians gazans crowded into un schools
after Israel told them to move South
towards the Egyptian border they're
supposed to be protected by the laws of
war America has felt it necessary to
deliver repeated reminders of that to
Israel along with military
aid this grandmother blames Israel then
speaks of tragedy hunger death fear
horror and
destruction in Rafa at the closed border

passports are hoping to get out to
escape the pressure Israel has imposed

not had those
Provisions Anthony blinkin US Secretary
of State returned to Israel after a
rapid tour of America's Arab allies the
US is giving Israel all the military aid
it
wants but it's trying to stop the war
spreading in Jerusalem in the parliament
Benjamin Netanyahu Israel's prime
minister delivered another
warning he told and Lebanese Ally hisbah
not to test
Israel two guys ehod alet prime minister
when Israel last fought hisb in 2006 was
scathing about Mr Netanyahu for
mishandling relations with the
Palestinians for weakening the rivals of
Hamas and said Israel should have two
objectives one is to fight Hamas the
other is to recognize the Palestinian
Authority
and try and uplift the Western the
Palestinian Authority and start
negotiate with them and say there is an
horizon of Peace after war in Israel
there's Unity about fighting Hamas the
argument is about why Hamas could break
through Israel's defenses and how to
deliver Israelis and Palestinians from
another generation of Bloodshed Jeremy
Bowen BBC News Southern
Israel well as we've been explaining
there was an air strike tonight near the
Rafa crossing that's where thousands of
people are currently waiting trying to
escape from Gaza into Egypt well our
correspondent is Rush rushi Abu ALU he's
in the city of hunis in the southern
area of the Gaza Strip he gave us this
update on the damage that was caused by
the
strike yeah I have seen fresh footage
CCTV uh camera from inside the
Palestinian terminal of Ra Crossing
there is some damage to the external
hole of the crossing but also there is
damage to the road that lead from the
Palestinian side to the Egyptian side
the damage isn't great and can be
fixable easily if the Egyptian decided
to open to reopen the crossing and allow
those with dual nationality that to to
cross into Egypt when we talk about
bringing in Aid uh we are talking about
the commercial side of the Crossing
which is close to the to to to the
terminal and it's not damaged I mean I
mean now they the point is stuck into is
there is a deal or no deal for now no
deal uh there is some talks diplomacy
big diplomacy everywhere in Doha in
Egypt the Americans in Israel but so far
as far as as far as I I remember today I
have been talking to many many parties
and all of them said that
negotiation is moving very slowly but
there is no progress to reopen the RAF
Crossing which for I think for the
Americans they want their citizen out
but for the 2.4 million people they want
something more important which is food
medicine fuel because as I'm standing in
this hospital kanun hospital this is the
main hospital now that is providing
services for for 1.2 million people the
only hital hital they said they will run
out the hospital will be out of service
by tomorrow midnight because they don't
have fuel and they don't have medicine
and they don't have any facility to to
run the hospital",20231016

southern Israeli city of ashalon and our
chief International correspondent leis
duet um leas hello to you um can we
first of all just focus on the
Diplomatic efforts uh we awaiting a
statement from Anthony blinkin the US
Secretary of State he's visited what six
Arab states over the last four days
spoken to six different leaders how
would you summarize the US approach to
what's happening where you
are Israel is
I think it it's clear that Israel and
the United States are almost in lock
step now at least at this moment the
United States is doing everything it can
both to show Israel that it will stand
by it stand by its right to defend
itself but also to send a very clear me
message as it staunches of allies that
Israel also has to do everything it can
to try to minimize civilian
harm Anthony blinkin came to Israel some
days ago he did his tour of the region
speaking to every Arab leader who could
have some sway over one side or the
other one part or the other in this in
this conflation he's come back to Israel
and we've just heard that instead of
going back to the United States tonight
has planned he's going to go back to the
Jordanian Capital Aman so whenever a top
Diplomat like Anthony blinkin changes
his travel schedule it is perhaps a sign
that there is they're working on
something and we know that they are
focusing on two fronts one is that they
want to get that rough acrossing the
only way in and out of Gaza on on gaza's
Southern border to get the foreign
Nationals out about a thousand of them
to get that desperately needed Aid food
fuel medicine the lores are piling up at
the Rafa Crossing in Egypt Sinai
Peninsula secondly they want to do
everything possible to ensure that this
crisis does not spread as bad as it it
is in Israel and Gaza if it spreads even
further if it spills across the border
then it is an even more dangerous
territory tell us you're in uh ashalon
the military buildup presumably there
continues um
to the the ground offensive have you got
any sense of you know just tell us what
you're seeing what you're hearing where
you
are well this is day 10 of of this war
10 days since the massacres committed by
Hamas in southern in southern Israel
we've seen with every day the Israeli
forces uh racing down to the border the
artillery the armor they're now in a
Zone a closed military zone that were
not allow to enter but throughout today
we moved around southern Israel
including to stat Which is less than a
mile from the Gaza border there was the
constant sound of our Israeli artillery
firing into Gaza and at every place
place that we went the Israeli military
moved us away that it was too dangerous
that we could be in the line of fire in
the last position they said there could
be an errant missile fired by the tanks
which are firing into Gaza you get a
sense that that that the military
operations are gathering pace and of
course the non-stop bombardment of Gaza
it seems as though Israel wants to well
there was hope there could be a
ceasefire in southern Gaza that hasn't
been reached but that is Focus now so
that there can be more humanitarian and
a rescue of some of the people um in
Gaza I have to say it's been relatively
quiet there was two days ago there were
the air raid sirens went off almost
every hour here in ashalon it's been
relatively quiet today although there
have been missiles fired in other parts
of Southern Israel and in in Border
towns like satat an official evacuation
is taking place to move even more people
to safety away from that border okay Le
duet uh thank you that's leet our chief

Nh74H8Pyb8A,Your Questions Answered: Why are Israel and Gaza at war? – BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Your Questions Answered Why are Israel and Gaza at war – BBC News.jpg,"well the conflict in Israel and Gaza is
far from simple and many people are
searching the internet with their
questions here with me to help answer
some of them the most trending questions
at least that people are asking online
search engines is our Middle East
analyst Sebastian Asher Sebastian
welcome to you thanks very much for
being with us um for your expertise
before we go to those questions yes
let's get some analysis on where we're
at at this situation we've be talking a
lot about the Raffa Crossing if you can
explain what that is why it's so
important and if it is likely that
Israel will allow people out yeah I I
mean to a degree we're in a sort of
holding pattern here I mean the big
story of course is when and if Israel
will launch it's offensive from the
north down in the south at the Rafa
Crossing which is the one of the two
Crossings there's one obviously into
Israel this one is into Egypt is where
the anticipation is at the moment and
this morning we had reports that there
was going to be a temporary truce to
allow a very we're talking very small
number of Palestinian Americans
across um into Egypt so as you were
saying in your introduction that there
are several thousand people so at the
rro Crossing waiting to go but the
temporary truth has not been agreed
we've actually had a statement from uh
the Israeli Prime Minister's office
saying that there is no ceasefire and
when we talking about ceasefire we're
only talking about this most limited
truce in terms of down there there's
been no ceasefire no sign of a ceasefire
up in the north of Gaza where the
Israeli bombardment has continued how
has still continued to fire some Rockets
into Israel so the the the the war
between Israel and Hamas hasn't really
change in any of its Dimensions over the
past two or 3 days the efforts are of
course growing to try and open up Rafa
crossing the Hope being that once it's
open obviously the first aid can come in
the first people can come out and once
that has happened it's a major first
step towards allowing more people out
allowing the the the the hundreds of
thousands of God ains who come down from
the north of Gaza where Israel is
expected to have its offensive after
Israel warned them that they must go
obviously they're in very difficult
circumstances down in the South still
the blockade which has been tightened by
Israel is is in place there's been a
tiny easing of it but food shortages
water shortages electricity Etc where
did they stay all the shelters
essentially are taken up people staying
in relatives homes so it's it's it's a
very combust situation down there Egypt
uh which controls veraa Crossing does
not want a huge influx of Palestinians
one for its own security two it doesn't
want to be seen doing what would be seen
in the Arab world the Muslim world as
Israel's bidding the fear the concern
amongst many Arabs is that once the
Palestinians have left they may never go
back and Egypt does not want to
facilitate that okay so let's talk about
um the situation to in the northern
Israel and its border with Lebanon and
this group Hezbollah who have been
firing Rockets into Northern Israel
killed two people in the past day or so
to Israelis just explain who Hezbollah
are the influence they have the the
control that they have in Lebanon and
what they want to achieve well
understand that leban at the moment
isn't governed by anybody there's a
caretaker government there's no
president now part of the reason is the
division between certain political
elements and hasbullah hasbullah there's
no doubt is the most powerful political
military force in Lebanon it's more
powerful than the Lebanese Army um it
led a successful in hasbullah terms bid
for many years to drive Israel out of a
buffer zone that had established in the
south of Lebanon Israel finally withdrew
in 200000 and hasbullah saw that as a
huge success for themselves and they
essentially presented themselves as the
only force in the Arab world that
actually had won at least one Victory
against Israel six years later there was
um a a a a a a a problem between Israel
and and uh and Lebanon which led Israel
to invade Lebanon it essentially paliz
the south of Lebanon which is pretty
much under the control of Hezbollah and
hasbullah at that time was in dodgy
territory ear in Lebanon because many
people blamed hasbullah for calling that
Devastation on Lebanon by Israel by its
actions so hasbullah tries to have this
balance between its role as what it sees
as key resistance against Israel but
also within Lebanon of not pushing so
hard against Israel that it upsets the
whole status quo in Lebanon such as it
is um and for example I mean unlike
Hamas which is an islamist organization
obviously and wants the islamist
ideology to be imposed wherever it rules
hasbullah has never said that in Lebanon
that and it's never 100% wanted to be
politically in control of Lebanon there
the they uh they have Ministries
they have huge clout about who's elected
president who's elected prime minister
but they don't want to 100% carry the
can for Lebanon so it's it it's a very
very difficult situation A precarious
balance for Lebanon for for for
Hezbollah within Lebanon and its
relations outside and of course the
other side of Hezbollah is that it's
backed and essentially the creation to a
l extent of Iran so when people worry
when the Americans worry Anthony blinkin
at the moment has just arrived back in
Israel he was doing shuttle diplomacy
around the Arab world key issue he's
trying to lock down is that there's no
further spillover in this war obviously
every everybody looks North to hasbullah
hasbullah won't take Serious action
beyond what it's done so far without the
say so of Iran Iran has been
rhetorically suggesting that all bets
could be off if things go really bad in
Gaza but at the moment it's tether has
Bull's power and Israel has has made it
clear it does not want a war with
Hezbollah and we've seen the us moving
um air pane carriers big warships which
is essentially a warning to other
outside players who might want to get
involved less about Hamas and the battle
in Gaza but essentially a message to
Iran really that do not cross this line
we will take it very very seriously a
few moments ago you were talking about
Egypt about the raff of Crossing about
what Israel what Egypt wants or or
doesn't want people are also asking um
is it safe to travel to Egypt at the
moment I think you could say it's safe
to travel to Egypt I mean none of the
Arab states around uh um Gaza and Israel
are likely to get actively involved in a
war Lebanon may be drawn into it by
Hezbollah as as as we've just been
saying but Egypt has had the longest
peace treaty back to 1978 with Israel uh
it has in conjunction with Israel it is
very much control the borders around uh
Gaza and with Hamas it's tried to play a
mediating role it's tried to bring the
two factions the two main Palestinian
factions Hamas and fata in the occupied
West Bank together at various points
it's continued with that mission it will
and has been involved in mediation now
to try to get a ceasefire to try to get
talks going of some kind but at this
stage I think that's really too early to
Bear any througho you will have as
you'll see across the Arab world across
the Muslim World major protests in
support of the Palestinians to some
extent in boort of Hamas so if you were
going to K if you were going
to some areas where those protests are
going to be very large then you know
people traveling would need to be
careful of that there'd be security
reasons to to to have a concern of that
but in terms of Egypt directly being
involved in a war with Israel over this
that isn't going to happen and what
about Jordan people are asking is it
safe to travel to Jordan just explain
Jordan another neighboring country to
Israel previously enemies but we've seen
the uh Jordanian King also involved in
trying to negotiate some kind of it's a
very similar story I mean both both
Egypt and Jordan I mean Jordan signed a
peace deal in 1994 with uh um Israel
having participated in at least two Wars
against Israel 1967 and Myon kipur War
but its role is in some ways more
complicated than Egypt in that Egypt
returned the sin have the sin returned
to it from from from Israel it doesn't
have a large proportion of Palestinians
there either as refugees or anything
else Jordan essentially it's very
difficult to to gauge exactly the
numbers but it still has a huge
Palestinian refugee population and has a
large Palestinian population beyond that
who sort of identifies Palestinians as
much as jordanians so it's a real Tinder
books there which um King Abdullah his
father King Hussein have strugg
struggled you know throughout their
Reigns to control because anywhere I
mean if if you look outside uh the
Palestinian territories the place where
there's the strongest prop Palestinian
feeling and the strongest numbers of
people is in Jordan so King Abdullah is
playing again the same role that his
father did and as is happened with Egypt
a mediation role because of its
relationship with Israel because of the
stakes being so high for Jordan and it's
always been seen in the west as a very
West Friendly country and it depends
hugely on Western financial support in
order to survive so again it will play
as this story continues an important
mediation role but it would also be
trying very hard to keep a lid on
protests within its own country not just
palestin but also islamist it it has a
very very strong um islamist uh forer uh
politically and that has seen big
protests in the past it's seen violence
that could break out out as this
continues if the Gs are offensive goes
um goes ahead uh uh uh and there are
many many more casualties amongst
Palestinians than we've seen so far than
the pressure inside Jordan from the
people just as we'll see around the Arab
world will grow more and more intense
obviously we've talked a lot about Hamas
who they are over the past week Israel
is at war with Hamas they have vowed to
crush them to wipe them out it was Hamas
that launched this murderous attack on
Israel in which 1,400 Israelis and other
foreign Nationals were killed just over
a week ago they've taken 199 people
hostage explain a little bit more about
the Hamas leadership because we've heard
over the past few days Israel said they
have killed the leader of Hamas in Gaza
um but there is a differentiation
between the Hamas militant Wing the
Hamas political Wing let's talk about
first of all about the military wing and
who they want to destroy yes I mean they
haven't killed the actual leader of of
of Hamas they've killed some senior uh
uh members who they say were directly
involved in the uh assault uh on Israel
so you have a you have a leadership
outside a political leadership in Exile
essentially um Ismael hania is is uh is
the leader he moves between uh Qatar and
several other countries Qatar though is
his real host country and they have
shown more Readiness as you'd expect
from a political leadership to have
negotiation have talks to some degree to
move a little bit away from a founding
charge of Hamas which says that it is uh
uh working towards the total Destruction
of Israel it's blown hot and cold but
there have been times when that
leadership has essentially said that it
would settle if the 1967 borders were
returned to and the occupied palestini
territories were given to the
Palestinians as a formal state that they
would accept a truce perhaps a 100-year
truce now that kind of conversation has
died away over the past few years just
as the peace process has been stalled so
you have that element which is you know
as in any organization like this there
are different layers different strata
within it and then you have in Gaza
essentially a military leadership which
is much much more hardore you have
Muhammad de is the leader there Yahya
Sina is the political leader in Gaza the
administrative leader and these are
people who have shown no sign of any
quarter with Israel and still believe
that military solution is the only way
to go they still believe that they can
as as they obviously try to do uh in
this assault to cause so much pain so
much hurt to Israel that Israel will
either bow and leave and that's a
greatest hope or will be pressured
into compromise is probably not the
right word but in giving the
Palestinians more than I think anybody
else is expecting the the the the
political leadership the fataa
leadership
Etc they will at the moment feel that
they've made their point I mean as you
say Israel has vowed the total
obliteration of Hamas but they at the
moment are definitely in the lead they
only are in the ascendant they have the
upper hand as far as Hamas is concerned
um they will be you know giving a sense
but what they've done has changed the
status quo that's existed all these
years nothing else has done that
through their actions now they will
claim this is what they tried to say
they haven't killed any civilians they
essentially believe that anyone in
Israel is a settler and is therefore
guilty that's their way of looking at it
again the Hamas leadership itself
political leadership doesn't talk in
such black and white terms so we are
talking about very different um um
layers within Hamas which are definitely
not at odds with um at the moment but we
we could see as this progresses more
more of a division and at the end of
this process at the end of the war I
think the Hamas political leadership
just as a political leadership in the
occupi Westbank will try to reassert
themselves in terms of looking towards a
future and looking back to a two-state
solution Hamas is a prescribed terrorist
organization in the UK in the US the EU
also so many countries around the world
when we talk about the militant wing and
the political side of it is that one and
the same thing well I mean in the UK
originally the the the the armed Wing
was prescribed as terrorist and then two
years ago Hamas itself as an
organization as a whole was prescribed
as terrorist I think at the moment and
certainly in the US estimation it
doesn't make any distinction but if
there are going to be negotiations if
there are going to be talks Hamas to
some degree will have to be involved
because the Hamas political leader
leadership is unlikely to be destroyed
unless Israel is going to go on a
mission we don't know this yet but to
kill Ismael hania to kill the people who
who who who could speak for Hamas
outside of the Gaza Strip so it is a
difficult position to be in to some
degree because there's no doubt that as
far as Palestinians are concerned right
now they see Hamas as the only viable
leadership in the occupied territories
as far as f is concerned as far as Pres
Abbas is is concerned they're not seen
as having any real say even in the
occupied West Bank we're seeing there
new groups New armed groups have been
emerging in the past year and a half as
Israel has gone in on Military raids you
know almost daily there have been
clashes um in response to you know a
whole wave of killings inside Israel by
um Palestinian gunmen we've seen these
new groups arise and they and Hamas are
the ones at the moment who will be
calling the shots we've heard from
president abas he was speaking just just
yesterday saying that Hamas doesn't
represent the Palestinian people he will
hold to that but at the moment that
voice is drowned out okay let's talk
about the Palestinian people the
Palestinian people live in Gaza and the
West Bank and people are asking is
Palestine a country was Palestine ever a
country it's not formally a country at
the moment there are some countries
around the world you recognize it as a
St but it's not been formly recognized
by the UN it has a non-member Observer
status at the UN it's had since
2012 uh we talk about President Abbas so
I mean that gives a sense of a head of a
state but it's still very much in embryo
and the whole issue of a peace process
was to was to set up a viable
Palestinian state that doesn't exist the
difficulty over that was a Palestinian
never believe that what they were being
offered was anything close to what they
had lost so at the times when it looked
close that some Accord might be made
back in the early 2000s back in uh the
late 1990s the Palestinians in the end
rejected uh what they were offered
because they believe that it just didn't
didn't come near to the boundaries of
what they believed they should be given
it wasn't that the fata and uh uh and
the PLO rejected the idea of a two-state
solution wasn't that they rejected the
idea that Israel should exist but they
weren't satisfied with what uh with what
they were being offered Palestine as a
state I mean it um as an entity in the
Middle East it's existed for a very very
long time but it's existed under a whole
series of Empires under the Roman empire
under the Ottoman Empire from the 16th
century until the first world war then
it was a mandate under uh Britain up
until 1947 when Britain withdrew and
then of course there was the League of
Nations decision to divide what was
Palestine into Israel and into uh an
Arab State Israel declared independence
and then there was a war with Arab
states trying to take over the whole
area they
lost so there hasn't been a Palestine as
a country in modern times but as a name
absolutely and so the Palestinian people
100% believe that they have every right
to self-identify as Palestinians and why
did Jewish people claim it as their
Homeland well that
is based
partly on ancient history on the
Bible uh that that was their Homeland
going back you know to to the to the
days of King David Etc um it had
different states as uh uh uh uh that
existed over various times within the
framework of a
Bible but in modern history there hasn't
hasn't been an Israeli State what we're
seeing is there was a rise of Zionism in
the 19th century it was a movement in
Europe which essentially was uh pushing
for a safe Homeland for for for the
Jewish people and Israel as being their
original ancestral Homeland was where
they decided to go so the settlements
began from then and built and built and
built so more and more Jewish people
obviously were going during the next 60
70 years even before the creation of
Israel so
I mean you have slightly separate way of
looking at it you have many of the
settlers believe in the biblical sense
of Israel that all of it belongs to them
that everyone else is an intruder that
the Palestinians came after them that
they are the true indigenous population
then you have many people who came from
uh Eastern Europe uh who came after the
Holocaust who see it maybe in a slightly
more pragmatic way they see it as their
safe home that was created for them yes
it has the ancest side to it that
they're not as committed to the idea
that Judea Samaria the places in the
West Bank where the settlers are has to
be part of their Homeland what they're
more interested in is having an Israeli
State and therefore they're willing to
accept a Palestinian State side by side
if they can be assured of their own
security with that so there is that
Division I think between uh Israelis
settlers and also Jewish people the
diaspora so we have another question
which is why are Israel and Gaza at War
would you describe Israel being at war
with Gaza or being at war with Hamas
it's being described as at war with
Hamas that's how Israel describes it
that's how we're describing it
essentially because I mean I mean Hamas
controls Gaza no doubt about that there
was an election but it goes way back to
2006 but they won they then seized the
whole of Gaza by force from fata they
force them out in
2007 so there hasn't really been any way
of gauging how much the people people of
Gaza want Hamas to be in control so
Israel certainly doesn't want to look as
if they are Waging War on the
Palestinians of Gaza they want to
confine it to Hamas and that's why
Israel is saying that they're doing
everything they can to try and protect
Palestinians by telling them to leave so
they can then have a clear run at Hamas
for Palestinians they see it and many
people in across the Arab and Muslim
world and and Beyond see it as almost a
niche distinction that the bombs that
are falling from Israel the air strikes
that are happening don't make a clear
enough distinction between Hamas and
between the people who live there so
they see it as a war on Gaza as a war on
the people of Gaza as we've seen time
and time again they would say that this
is a war on Gaza and a war on the
Palestinians and a war on their desire
for a statehood their desire for dignity
why Israel why is Israel imposing this
blockade water food Medical supplies
we've just had a a update on the Reuters
news agency concerning the resumption
that Israel said was going to happen of
water in southern Gaza uh the Hamas
interior Ministry have said that that
has not happened um it said that
residents drinking unhealthy water
posing a serious health crisis
threatening the lives of the citizens
and of course many people can't get hold
of any water at the moment but why is
Israel imposing this blockade on on all
of the people the 2 million people of
Gaza well this has been a blockade to
degree that's been on Gaza since since
2007 and Egypt as well has imposed a
sort of blockade by controlling the the
entry and exit from uh the Rafa Crossing
and that's essentially a blockade on
Hamas Hamas which Israel see sees as its
biggest enemy that Egypt also sees as a
kind of enemy within the
Palestinians so what we've saw when
Israel responded to the Hamas assault
was they tightened it they then called
it a total Siege and several ministers
said that we are going to stop food
we're going to stop water we're going to
stop electricity and the thinking behind
that one imagined is to put maximum
pressure on the people of Gaza on the
pal um to to to try and disengage them
to some extent from Hamas to show these
are the consequences of what Hamas has
done you are suffering them they've done
something without necessarily your say
so they haven't gone and and and asked
you if you want this but they've done it
in your name so I think from the Israeli
perspective if they feel that if they
put maximum pressure then perhaps they
can complete their task which they've
set out to be to eradicate Hamas as
quickly as possible From anational
perspective from an aid perspective
we've heard day in day out from un Aid
agencies the other agencies that this is
just insupportable that in already very
very difficult conditions inside Gaza
have been made totally unlivable that
people will soon perhaps die uh because
of having to drink dirty water disease
all of these issues and how can you get
a large proportion of people to move
from the north of Gaza the hundreds of
thousands who've moved to a place where
there isn't much else provided there
either how can that continue and if this
is going to be a war which could go on
for months
then quite apart from what will happen
with the Israeli offensive the ground
offensive the likely loss of civilian
lives what about the people who are
actually to some extent to some extent
sheltered from that main offensive how
are they going to be uh uh uh looked
after and if a Rafa Crossing is not open
fully to allow eight I mean there are
hundreds and hundreds of lorries and
trucks containers waiting to move in
with aid but they can't they can't go in
at the moment so as I say from Israeli
perspective it's maximum pressure we
are I mean they're saying this is a war
like no other that we thought with Hamas
this is a war essentially of extinction
of obliteration the Palestinians are the
ones who are going to suffer thank you
very much for taking us through all that
in such great detail",20231016

assessment this is who Israel's now at
war with Hamas who last week crossed the
border solely focused on taking life
murdering women and children for most it
was in effect a suicide
mission the left side of my head was hit
with shrapnel from an RPG or a grenade
hard to say exactly what got shot in my
finger on my left hand and a bullet got
wedged in the left side of my neck yoav
who grew up in London was among the
first Israeli military casualties of
this war he won't be the last we we've
been asked to hide his identity he says
Israel's fighting an enemy unlike any
conventional Army we have only one
interest which is to to kill Jews there
was no preservation of their ability to
go home afterwards they were going to
die doing whatever they wanted to do and
that meant killing as many people along
the way they died doing
it this is just some of their Arsenal
Israel today displaying to journalist s
weapons they've
seized they say this is just 20% of the
weapons Hamas brought into Israel and it
is just a fraction of what Israeli
forces will face when they go into Gaza
Israel says many of these are built in
factories inside Gaza itself are you
worried about Israeli forces going in
and if they've got factories producing
this I'm not worried the IDF can deal
with everything that stays in that room
and more
but this is only a fraction of what they
have
yeah the tightly packed streets of Gaza
is where Israel could soon be fighting
which Hamas knows best it could be
littered with booby traps and roadside
bombs and their network of hidden
underground
tunnels brutal Urban Warfare can favor
the

they're still talking but he's noted a
dramatic change of mood it's a Divine in

they surprised Israel and in the last
few days the tone is very different the
tone is we're going to fight to the

Middle East correspondent Hugo Bea is
there for us and Hugo welcome to you the
situation there is also one that the
world is keeping its eye on because
there have been those rocket attacks
haven't there from your location into
Israel Hugo so tell us what's happening
there yes samanth and this morning we
had an announcement from the Israeli
authorities saying that they would be
evacuating villages in Northern Israel
uh next to the border with Lebanon 28 uh
communities to be evacuated we don't
know whether this is a mandatory or a
voluntary uh evacuation but the reality
is that most of the residents have uh
already left in some of those
communities my colleague uh Anna Foster
has been to some of those communities in
recent days and she said that most
people have left because of the violence
that's been happening that in that part
of the country and um one of those
communities is the community of Shula
where yesterday A man was killed the
first Israeli civilian to die as a
result of an attack carried out by
Hezbollah here in southern Lebanon and
uh this announcement came a day of of
intense exchange of fire between
militants here in Lebanon Hezbollah and
the Israeli military and I think uh in
the last few minutes we had some
reaction from a spokesperson for the
Israeli military saying that those
attacks yesterday attacks that were uh
carried out by Hezbollah happened uh
after Iran gave orders uh to the group
to carry out these attacks so this is
reaction from the uh Israeli Army a
spokesperson for the Israeli military
again showing how tense the situation uh
is along the uh Lebanese Israeli border
and obviously hasbalah is supported by
Iran uh and I think there's been a a lot
of pressure uh in recent days from
Western countries warning Iran against
escalating uh the situation here and uh
and the Iranian foreign minister has
been visiting some countries in the
region he was here in Lebanon uh where
he met the leader of Hezbollah uh Hassan
nzala and uh he also reacted to those
comments being made by Western leaders
saying that well if the United States
wants to prevent an escalation of the
conflict it should tell Israel to stop
uh the aggression in his words against
civilians in Gaza so again it shows how
volatile the situation is and I think
there are fears that Lebanon could uh
you know be dragged into this conflict

border crossing it's at the border with
Gaza and Egypt you can see the live
pictures there there's been some
confusion about what's happening there
let's bring you up to date with what we
know and that is that the Reuters news
agency has been reporting sources in
Egypt saying that a ceasefire has been
agreed in southern Gaza the cessation of
hostilities between Israel and Hamas was
to have begun at 6:00 in the morning GM
T and the sources said that the
ceasefire would last for several hours
they also said that the raer crossing
was to open at the same time that's to
let much needed Aid into Gaza as we're
hearing of a worsening humanitarian
situation there and Aid agencies and NOS
are saying they are desperate for that
border to be opened so that they can
send supplies across the border but
actually our sources on the ground are
saying that the border crossing has not
opened and you can can see the pictures
there they speak for themselves the
gates appear to be firmly shut there and
uh We've also heard that Hamas say it
has no knowledge of any truth and
Israel's prime minister Benjamin
netanyahu's office has also said that
there is currently no truce nor
humanitarian Aid in Gaza in exchange for
getting foreigners out so uh quite a lot
of confusion but as you can see there
the pictures speak for themselves uh
showing that the Rafa border Crossing
remains shut despite reports saying the
from the Reuters news agency that it was
going to be opened for several hours
today well as we've been reporting
Israel's Army is massing in the south of
Israel ahead of the expected offensive
although it's not clear at this point
what form it will take well President
Biden's warning against a longer term
occupation well our chief International
correspondent Le duet is in southern
Israel for us good morning morning to
you leas um Lee let's start with some of
the confusion around the Rafa border
crossing is there any more you can add
to that
story I think we have clarity now reini
I think that statement from the Israeli
Prime Minister's office and that is the
statement which matters at this moment
was categorical there is no truce there
is no agreement uh that people can go
out and Aid can get in so that's what it
is for the moment and you've been
showing the images that is also
confirming that Rafa crossing the only
Crossing out of Gaza right now for
people desperate to escape to get out
and for that Aid piling up the border to
get in but we understand from our BBC
sources in Cairo that there is an
agreement in principle but there are
still some very important and very
tricky issues to sort first of all Egypt
wants to have guarantees that its staff
operating that Crossing will be safe
that there's no danger of an errant
missile of an attack of the kind that we
saw earlier in this war secondly the
Israelis want to have a mechanism of a
way to inspect all of the lorries coming
into Gaza they want to ensure that there
are no weapons hiding hidden amongst the
food and the the fuel and the medical
supplies which are so desperately needed
in Gaza there was one hopeful account
that perhaps these issues could be
sorted by Tuesday but given the the
complexity of this moment the intensity
of this moment I and so many pieces to
be put in place I think we just have to
watch it hour by hour but Regina you can
imagine the the the the disappointment
the anger among those thousands who have
spent days without eating sleeping
washing properly they heard the report
that it could be open that they would
finally escape and these are families
with children who are traumatized by
what's been happening people living
through the worst nightmare of their
lives and now they've been told to wait
to wait again and of course not really
sure when that open when that window to
the world will open un least we've just
had another uh Source Hamas official
saying that there's no truth to the
information about the opening of the
Raffa border crossing or the temporary
ceasefire so as you say um we've had
both Israel and Hamas uh pouring scorn
on those reports that has reopened for
now but you talk about the people massed
at the border but of course there are
more than 2 million people in Gaza who
were also in a worsening
situation yes we remember a few days ago
we reported Israel's evacuation order
saying that the more than a million
living in the north of the Gaza Strip
where Israel wants to focus in this
these early phases it's military
operations we're told to leave
immediately within 24 hours to go south
and after the shock of people being told
to leave who had so few resources to
leave were were scared to leave under
the non-stop
bombardment within hours thousands
started moving and in recent days many
many Gins have moved South and that has
meant that the South as we've been
hearing hearing from our reporter AB R
Abu Alou the south is now at Breaking
Point food fuel water they're all
they're all running out as well and
everyone is on edge there so and there
are hospitals in the north who have
simply said we simply cannot up sticks
and go there are babies on incubators
there's severely injured in hospital
beds the who issued the bluntest
statement I've ever heard from The Who
saying this evacuation order is a death
sentence and that's not an
exaggeration Lee just bring us up to
date with what's happening where you are
in southern Israel of course everybody
is anticipating this Israeli offensive
what's your feeling about when that
might
come we just don't know Regina of course
this is a military secret they're
they're not going to tell us it's it's
clear both from the statements of
Israeli military and political leaders
it's clear from what we've been seeing
here on the ground in southern Israel
you may stay see behind me some of the
armor and artillery but there's masses
of armor and material that's been put in
place along the border thousands and
thousands of reservists prime minister
Netanyahu visited them another signal uh
that the ground incursion and not just
by ground sea and air as well could be
imminent asking them whether they're
ready we heard yesterday that one of the
Border towns which at one point is less
than a mile from Gaza stot where we've
spent many days over the past 10 days
that whole Community has now been
evacuated people all along this Southern
Belt have been told to leave they've
also been told to leave the Border uh
with Lebanon in the north all of these
signs are trying to get people away from
the border all the while they put the

aimed at deterring further attacks
against Israel in particular from Iran
or the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah
well let's cross now to our Middle East
correspondent yoland Nell um and yolan
just talk us through uh the latest that
you're hearing we've been hearing about
the the intensified clashes on Israel's
northern border with Lebanon and and
obviously we're hearing about Israel
extending this time period that it's
given uh gazans to leave the north of
Gaza just talk us through the
developments as they've been coming in
over the last few
hours well earlier the Israeli military
said that it was giving another 3-hour
window for residents of the northern
half of the Gaza Strip to make their way
South along a routes uh which it
declared uh to be safe and we have seen
in the past couple of days now hundreds
of thousands of people making that
Journey some of them on foot with their
belongings just in carrier bags or in
rock sack s some people with um carts
with donkeys other people with cars
using up what little fuel they have left
because of course Gaza remains under
this tight Siege by Israel with no food
no water no electricity and no fuel uh
being allowed in now there is growing
concern about the humanitarian situation
uh particularly in the south of the
strip where you have all of these people
uh really in makeshift shelters in un
schools places like that um they're
extremely crowded and with no Aid
getting in uh there's really very
limited means for the the very limited
number of emergency workers in the Gaza
Strip to be able to help them another
complication here is that the lack of
Internet and the lack of um people with
working phones so communication uh
becomes more and more difficult um we
know that the World Health Organization
has been raising awareness of these 20
hospitals in the northern half of the
Gaza Strip where it said that the
evacuation order given by Israel was
really a tantamount to a death sentence
there are very sick and injured people
there and at the moment there are there
are still babies in incubators uh things
like that and they're asking how are
these people supposed to be moved um
this is all complicating of course
Israel's plans uh for for a ground
offensive it wants uh as many people to
leave the north of the Gaza Strip
particularly Gaza City which we expect
to be a real focus it wants that area
cleared as much as possible before it
goes in saying it's going to tackle both
isra both the Hamas a military and
governing capabilities and what has uh
Israel been saying too there's clearly
mounting pressure on it to to to provide
safe passage for civilians we've had
President Biden talking about an
obligation to provide safety for
civilians and as you say the World
Health Organization really strongly
condemning these calls for hospitals
patients to have to move what is Israel
saying in its
defense well Israel is saying that it is
hamas's responsibility as the government
in Gaza to help people move Hamas has
been telling people not to leave their
homes um and when I asked the Israeli
military spokesman about this um he told
me that really Hamas had got cars Hamas
had got vehicles that it could move
people and that really it should should
uh get involved here um at the same time
of course yes there is Big pressure on
Israel from surrounding countries um
Jordan has called for humanitarian
corridors there's a lot of Aid which has
already arrived in the Sinai in Egypt
that's Aid that could easily be taken
into the Gaza Strip if Egypt was to open
the the Rafa Crossing now Egypt has said
it's not going to do that to allow
hundreds of people who have foreign
nationalities who are stuck in Gaza it's
not going to allow them out until it
gets some guarantees that Aid can also
safely be taken into the Gaza Strip so
that's the situation at the moment and
we know that the US Secretary of State
Anthony blinkin on his trip which really
defines shuttle diplomacy he's been
going from country to Country around the
region that's one of the the big efforts
that he's involved in is trying to get
the Raffa Crossing open also you
mentioned earlier about Hezbollah in the
north There's real concern there in the
North of Israel about what could happen
with new um firing by both sides um and
really a lot of concern that this
conflict could spread more widely in the
region that's something that Anthony
blinkin has been talking to different
Regional actors about as well trying to
get them to put some pressure on on the
different players um where they have uh
where they have some influence um and in
the last few hours at least one Israeli
has been killed and a couple of
civilians also have being injured we
understand by anti-tank missiles but at
the moment Hezbollah is not using its
longer range missiles if it gets
involved that is going to really change
this because it is a very powerful force
with a huge arsenal of longer range
weapons okay thank you very much youan
now for us there in Jerusalem can hear
now from our correspondent Nick Beak he
spoke to us earlier from ashalon in
southern Israel yes this is ashalon
which is about seven miles from Gaza
where this morning we've heard quite a
lot of activity in the air actually
there's been the distinctive Buzz of
Israeli uh drones but also the the
fighter pilots are going overhead and uh
what they've been doing is they've been
flying over us and then a few seconds
later we've heard large booms bearing in
mind we are seven miles away these have
echoed around this part of Southern
Israel so that's the situation on the
ground here we've just heard from the is
isi um officials that there will be a
window a 3-hour window today in which
people in Gaza can move from the north
to the South that is along one specific
route yesterday there were two routes
that would were opened up for a for a
bigger window these timings have very
much slipped but that's what the
Israelis are saying today all the while
of course the United Nations saying that
this is you know completely unacceptable
the World Health Organization for
example saying that trying to move
people people from the north to the
South and they is you know just not
feasible and they say specifically when
you look at 2,000 people they say who
are in intensive care and also in
maternity units they moving from the
north to the South that is tantamount to
a a death sentence so extremely
extremely strong language from them all
the while Israel saying that it's
carrying out a proportionate response to
the attacks by Hamas just over a week
ago and that this is all part of an act
of self-defense on their part be there
in ashalon while a missile fired into
Israel from Lebanon has killed at least
one person it hit a settlement near the
border between the two countries the
militant group Hezbollah said it was
behind the attack our correspondent Huga
Bacha gave us this update from tier near
the border with sou near the border in
southern
Lebanon so the Israeli Emergency
Services have confirmed that one person
was killed a Manning his 40s three
civilians were injured uh in this
community the community of Shula in
Northern Israel near the uh Lebanese
border and uh this is the first civilian
death on Israel's northern border since
the beginning of this war between Israel
and Hamas now hasbalah said he had
targeted uh this uh Community with
guided missiles and they said this was
in retaliation uh after the the killings
of three civilians here in Lebanon they
said that these civilians were killed as
a result of Israeli attacks uh the
Israeli Army hasn't confirmed that they
were involved in these attacks and I
think this shows how volatile the
situation is along the uh Lebanese
Israeli border I mean fears that Lebanon
could be dragged into this conflict
Hezbollah obviously a very powerful
group with tens of thousands of rockets
and missiles uh tens of thousands of of
Fighters uh as well and we've seen that
in the last few days Hezbollah and
Israel have uh exchanged rockets and
shelling so tensions are really high
here in this region and I spoke to a
source close to Hezbollah who said that
the group is on high alert but that
hezbollah's next steps will be
determined by what happens in Gaza and
if Israel goes ahead with this ground
offensive in Gaza against Hamas so again
a very tense situation uh and with a
number of incidents happening along this
order here I made fears again that this
could become another front in this war
here Goa for us there in southern
Lebanon",20231015

than 20 hospitals in Northern Gaza is T
to mount to a death sentence for some of
the sick and injured the W has expressed
particular concern for people on life
support and newborn babies in incubator
health centers in the South are also at
maximum capacity tens of thousands of
civilians are moving ahead of an
expected Israeli ground offensive in
Gaza earlier on I spoke to Dr Natalie
Roberts she's the executive director of
the humanitarian organization medson
Frontier UK she described the Grim
situation for the people of
Gaza it is as you've described just now
pretty catastrophic I mean they've had a
week of Relentless bombing so thousands
and thousands of bombs dropping down a
very small piece of land in the North
and the South of Gaza so producing many
dead but many many many many more
wounded at the same time with the
electricity and water having been cut
off now a week ago and we're getting to
the point where really there is no
access to clean water and no electricity
to continue running the medical
facilities anyway and now in the last
couple of days these evacuation orders
and and that's just led to Absolute
chaos you know we have 300 staff in Gaza
some of them have managed to move to the
South are trying to transfer patients to
the South some of them have no choice
but to stay behind in the north and try
and continue to run Medical Care in the
north either way they're describing
utter chaos and and a sense of Despair
well I want to to talk a bit more about
that because we've heard about
journalists being targeted we've heard
about air strikes on civilian
infrastructure how dangerous is it for
your teams on the
ground I mean it's incredibly dangerous
the majority of our teams are
Palestinian so they they come from Gaza
they live in Gaza they never seen
anything to this scale before um we're
seeing ambulances being hit we're seeing
medical facilities being hit and as
people were moving south yesterday they
were saying they could hear the bombs
they didn't feel in safety so they're
you know they're incredibly worried
about being caught up in this about
being injured themselves many of our
staff have lost family members um our
International staff as well they're
stuck in the same situation either
having to to stay in the North or choose
to move to the South and and and the
same the same scenario applies to them
you know even once they get to the South
there's no way for them to stay they're
trying to find you know a place on the
floor somewhere in a school um on a
mattress that there really is you know
this this sense that there's no way out
there's no Escape medson some Frontier
is known around the world for its uh Aid
work uh keeping away from politics how
easy is it for your teams to operate
around some of these border crossings
like close to Egypt where the
authorities there have shut things
down I mean yes we're very used to
working in war zones we're very used to
negotiating our way into into war zones
and to get our supplies in to get our
our staff in um and currently at the
moment the the only border crossing the
Rafa border crossing is closed to us as
it's closed to everybody else um so we
can't get supplies in we can't get staff
in we can't get our staff out so you
know we're facing the same situation as
everybody else at the moment despite the
fact we've been working in Gaza for such
a long period of time for the people who
are fleeing um heading for that that
border crossing the rougher Crossing
what kind of support do they
need I mean first of all they need to
have some reassurance that they can
travel in safety um that they can move
in safety on the roads and we saw
yesterday that that doesn't seem to be
the case that the bombing continues even
on these safe roads um we need them to
be reassured that once they get to the
crossing they will be allowed to cross
in safety um that there'll be met with
some sort of Welcome um and with
humanitarian Aid if they manag to enter
Egypt for example and also a reassurance
that people can return home um I think
there's a lot of concern that people
don't want to leave their homes and they
particularly don't want to leave Gaza
knowing that they might never be able to
go back so so obviously you know the
reassurance of safety and the
reassurance of you know you should be
able to go home at the same time people
have chosen to stay at home and people
have chosen to stay working in the
hospitals in Gaza City for example you
know they they're terrified at now that
means that they're labeled as a Target
um and and there needs to be reassurance
that hospitals will still be protected
that Medical Care will still be
protected even if people who stayed in
the north of Gaza that was Dr Natalie
Roberts from Medan sun frontier well the

group to the Eastern Mediterranean

DwtmeNDWtHg,Israel evacuation order: What is the situation in northern Gaza? - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel evacuation order What is the situation in northern Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"now let me tell you about the latest in
terms of on the ground there in Gaza
because the UN Regional relief agency
Ana says that hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians have displaced in the last
12 hours nearly a million almost half
the territory's population in the last
week let me tell you more from that
statement because there is more detail
coming in they're talking about uh the
Israeli order as well to Le leave that
northern part of the territory uh this
the full statement there that's
available online let me take you through
it because there are significant new
detail they've called on the Israeli
authorities to protect all civilians
who've been Sheltering in un under
premises across the Gaza Strip including
those in Northern Gaza and Gaza City
despite the order they say for more than
a million people to actually move they
say that many people pregn pregnant
women children older people people with
disabilities will not be able to flee
the area they have no choice they say
and they must be protected at all times
Wars have rules this statement says
civilians hospitals schools clinics and
un premises cannot be targeted we're
sparing no effort to Advocate with
parties to the conflicts to meet their
obligations under international law to
protect civilians including those
seeking refuge in H shelters and it goes
on finally to say at the end of this
statement this is unprecedented what
we're seeing this war should be no
exception protection of civilians and
civilian infrastructure including un
buildings applies to this conflict too
so uh a long statement there from ANA
about their assessment on the ground in
terms of the people displaced but very
clearly articulating that many people
won't be able to to move won't be able
to follow that Israeli instruction and
absolutely underlying the point that
they say that un premises cannot be
targeted if those people do not move and
follow that deadline order from the
Israelis well uh let's reflect more
about what is happening on the ground
because Mahmud shalabi is in Gaza is the
Gaza director for medical aid for
Palestinians he spoke to us about what
life is actually there in at on the
ground at the moment life is really
miserable and dire the situation is
really tense where I live I live in the
north of Gaza and uh one of the
governorates that the Israelis have
asked uh the peoples to flee from uh
yesterday I am one of the people who did
not flee um uh their home and I refuse
to do so because there is no place that
is safe in Gaza even in the southern
parts of Gaza where many of my
colleagues have went and where many of
internally displaced people are located
right now it's really unsafe just
yesterday at around 400 p.m. one truck
full of internally displaced people was
direct directly targeted by the Israelis
and 71 people were killed in that Direct
Hit of internally displaced people so
there is no place that is currently safe
uh right now I am talking to you uh
because I have a generator that we
bought years ago and I managed to have
some fuel uh leftt over fuel from like
the fuel station where I live so I am
one of the few ones who can actually
connect to the outside world and tell
you about the situation right now in
Gaza we do believe that it is unsafe to
move right now to any place in the
southern parts of Gaza as I told you
there have been uh many air strikes uh
uh since yesterday and early this
morning uh one of the areas of the safe
areas in the south of Gaza Strip is
kanun uh a colleague of mine Liv lives
there he has hosted six families of
internally displaced
people uh this morning at 7 A.M an air
strike happened next to his home and
they are trying to extract dead bodies
from under the rubble so as I told you
there is no place that is safe right now
uh yesterday we were also given as
Palestinians a safe passage from like
the early sunlight until like around uh
like 6:00 p.m. or something and that
happened during the time in addition uh
if you also uh see what's happenening
during the night in those areas in the
southern parts of Gaza there have been
many air strikes and many houses
destroyed over the top of their
residents there have been no warnings
such as like in previous escalations
where they would throw a you know drone
missile on top of a building to warn the
citizens that they have to flee their
homes nothing uh yes yesterday one of my
colleagues at Medical Aid for
Palestinians his name is Muhammad his
house was destroyed while he was in
there with his six children and wife
they managed to escape miraculously but
they lost some of the extended family
members they lost he lost his cousin and
uh the situation has been really dire he
he stayed in a shop like the neighbors
opened the shop for them to stay there
during the night and at the early
sunlight he went to shifa the largest
hospital in Gaza Strip he described the
situation for me the the hospital it's
self is full of internally displaced
people because they don't find any other
place that is safe to go to just a
snapshot of the latest on the ground
there in Gaza",20231014
K_Nkh0qGCHE,Gaza evacuation: Israel warns people must leave north - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Gaza evacuation Israel warns people must leave north - BBC News.jpg,"so let me just take you through where we
are a week since those Hamas attacks
because Israel is still urging civilians
to leave Northern Gaza as soon as
possible it specified two roads which
can be used by Palestinians heading
south well more than a million were told
on Friday to relocate before an expected
ground offensive Israel's prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said his
country's bombardment of Gaza is quote
just the beginning more Rockets have
been fired into Israel and Israeli air
strikes are continuing across Gaza
military sources in Israel say a senior
Hamas Commander is among those killed
Israeli forces are continuing their
buildup near the boundary with Gaza
while in the north of the country
Israeli troops killed several people
they identified as terrorists who were
trying to cross the border from Lebanon
and overnight Israel's military exchange
more crossborder fire with the Iranian
backed Lebanese group Hezbollah
the US Secretary of State anthonyy
blinkin as I was saying is in Saudi
Arabia on the latest stop of his tour of
the Middle East now Jordan's foreign
minister has accused Israel of flagrant
breaches of international law and warned
the displacement of civilians in Gaza
was pushing the whole region towards
conflict let me show you the live
pictures again at least 2,200 people in
Gaza have been killed in the strikes
over the last week and 1,300 Israelis
were killed by Hamas gunman over last
week and I just want to uh uh return to
that Ana quote that I was telling you
about a moment or two ago because those
sources there on the ground from the UN
saying that 1 million people have been
displaced in just one week so this their
latest tweet as you can just see as we
pull the strap away they are talking
about the Exodus they say a million
people have been displaced inside 7 Days
in the past 12 hours alone
hundreds of thousands of people have
been displaced The Exodus continues as
people move to Southern parts of the
Gaza Strip so that's some of the latest
information coming before we move on I
just want to take you to the pictures
here in central London outside of the
BBC and you can see huge crowds going
down Regent Street uh as Pro
Palestinian demonstrators gather here at
the B
before they will start moving towards
whiteall and we've seen similar scenes
uh across different parts of the world
as uh people come out and those the
pictures from just a slightly different
uh area just around the back of the BBC
is more and more people assemble here
for the start of that March down to
whiteall so that just gives you a
glimpse of what is happening here with
that at Pro Palestinian demonstration
and March but let's go back to what is
actually happening on the ground in Gaza
because I was giving you some of the
latest details coming from the UN well
uh Yan egeland is the Secretary General
of the Norwegian Refugee Council he was
involved with the oso Accords and
facilitated talks between the
Palestinians and Israelis now he talked
to the BBC a little earlier and gave us
his assessment of the humanitarian
situation in Gaza there are hundreds of
thousands of people fleeing for their
life there is
a not something that is should be called
an evacuation uh it's a forcible
transfer of people from all of Northern
Gaza which is according to the Geneva
Convention a war crime there is a a a a
Siege on Gaza which means that people
are starved there was a bombing at the
Rafa Crossing which everybody is
pointing to as the the only way Corridor
uh possible humanitarian Corridor in
into an area so I think really the the
UK the US the the EU all that have
rightfully said were with Israel in
fighting Terror after the worst Terror
in Israel's history I hope they haven't
given a green light to smash a million
children because that's what happening
now well there's been significant
diplomatic Fallout from the war Saudi
Arabia says it is paused talks on
normalizing relations with Israel well
Lord Malik Brown is a former deputy
Secretary General of the United Nations
he goes his thoughts on that
decision well I I think this was
anticipated it would have been
impossible for Saudi Arabia to have
continued them at this time uh you know
it has in recent years been quite quiet
on the issue of Palestinian rights but
when uh the events of this week unfolded
it you know raised its voice much more
clearly in defense of uh the Palestinian
people and it would be just in terms of
uh the Optics and politics of the region
impossible to press on uh in any effort
to to to normalize relations with with
Israel at the very same time that Israel
was seen as
attacking Palestinian Arab civilians in
Gaza but I don't know whether in the
longer term I mean I think this is now
up to Israel whether it wants to close
that door forever which would be the
result of a which will happen I think if
it makes a long-term occupation or
long-term military intervention uh into
Gaza or whether it recognizes the need
to contain its military action in as
Surgical and brief a form as possible so
that it can get this back on track
because for both Israel and Saudi AR
Arabia the stakes are high it would be a
reordering of of the Middle East in a
dramatic way and I think uh you know
there will be a desire to try once the
fighting is dies down to to try and
recover this
negotiation well the US secret of State
Anthony blinkin as we've been seeing is
in Riad in Saudi Arabia for those talks
it is the latest stop of his Middle East
tour let's have a list listen to a
little of what he's been saying uh no
country uh can or should uh be expected
to tolerate what um Israel uh has just
uh been on the receiving end of which is
uh an attack that almost defies
description and words in which more than
1300 of its people were slaughtered
along with the Nationals of more than 30
other countries by Hamas Hamas is not
representative of the Palestinian people
or their legitimate aspirations for the
future Hamas is a terrorist group its
only agenda is to destroy the state of
Israel and to murder Jews and it's
important that the entire world see it
as such at the same time as Israel
pursues its legitimate right to
defending its people and to trying to
assure that this never happens again it
is vitally important uh that all of us
look out for uh for civilians uh and
we're working together to do exactly
that uh in particular uh working on
establishing safe areas in Gaza working
on establishing corridors so that
humanitarian assistance can reach people
who need it uh none of us uh want to see
suffering by civilians on any side
whether it's uh in Israel whether it's
uh in Gaza uh whether it's anywhere else
and we're working together to do our
best to protect them I think um at the
same time it's uh vitally important and
I know that our countries agree uh that
we work together to make sure that to
the best of our ability this conflict
does not spread to other places on other
fronts and so I look forward to
discussing
that anony blinkin well with me here in
the studio is our Middle East Regional
editor Mike Thompson Mike uh give me
your assessment of this latest L of this
Middle East Tour and generally as he has
moved from Capital to Capital what
Anthony blinkin has been trying to do
here well he's trying to get together a
concerted anti- Hamas sort of uh um uh
grouping here amongst Arab countries but
he's having a a difficult time because
with the uh number of deaths as we've
just been hearing more than
2,200 and this imminent uh ground
offensive that'll begin fairly soon um
many Arab people are just outraged by by
this and uh not just of course in the
region but also as we've been seeing on
our television screens right across the
world and this is turning people most
notably actually Saudi Arabia who he's
with at the moment a key Ally who has
been encouraging to normalize relations
with Israel now Saudi has said as we've
been hearing that talks on that have
stalled this is what herass wants this
is Hamas wants to drive this W yes it
was one of the theories in terms of why
Hamas has actually done this one of the
theories was as we were edging closer to
that normalizing deal Saudi Arabia
crucial players it was to disrupt that
and to dismantle that but in terms of uh
The Wider going on and reaction in the
region interesting comments too from the
Jordanian foreign minister talking about
the abyss that was being approached
indeed yes and of course um secretary of
state had talks uh with uh uh with King
Abdullah of Jordan um and the country
has is is very very concerned about this
this this this Abyss as you just
mentioned there um and and Jordan is a
nation which has had strong relations
with the US so this has been in some
ways quite surprising and very
disappointing uh for Mr blinkon this
should be happening but it's really part
and parcel of what the attitudes that
are now sweeping that whole region and
there's worry because Jordanian foreign
minister was talking about the
displacement of people and only on news
night last night I was watching a senior
former military figure suggesting that
people should go over Palestinian should
go over into Egypt that is a real
concern isn't there that potentially
here the movement of Palestinians out of
the Gaza Strip completely indeed I mean
they're they're all going into areas
which in the main are quite agricultural
in the South there's very little to
support people to shelter people and
Egypt has made very clear that it
doesn't want refugees across the border
it's got about 280,000 people that fled
the war in Sudan for instance so it
doesn't feel able to deal with that that
could change of course under a lot of
international pressure uh because at the
moment people are being expelled into
into sort of nothingness in a way and
particularly those who are who are
injured and amongst them of course many
uh children as well presumably that is
why Anthony blinken uh continues to talk
and we saw it yesterday in katar about
these safe zones the discussions they're
having around that to try to set up
somewhere with a bit of infrastructure
for people to actually go to where where
are we in terms of the ability to do
that well it's still very complicated to
know quite where you would do that I
mean there could be an area inside Gaza
in the south of Gaza or it more likely
in in Egypt but as I said Egypt is very
worried about having temporary refugees
that it fears would become permanent the
other option of course is on the borders
of Gaza inside Israel and in a way that
might be easiest because Israel can
oversee the situation
and and as it's also responsible for the
barrage and for the what looks like BEC
coming off land offensive uh that would
make sense Michael final thought because
here we are a week since those Dreadful
attacks from Hamas and just about
everything in the region has changed
fundamentally and we are we know this
only at the beginning indeed and those
in fact were the words that Israel has
used prime minister Netanyahu has used
to say this is just the beginning and
you see the the the widespread concern
the the outrage in the Arab world the
outrage in Israel too of course after
those atrocities on Saturday um but
these are likely to deepen and deepen
significantly as soon as that land
assault uh happens because this is a
very crowded area there's going to be an
awful lot of life and it's going to be
on both sides Mike Thompson thanks for
going through all of that and Mike

expected ground offensive into Gaza this

terror organization by many Western
governments including the UK more than
1300 people died in those attacks and

have left around 1,00 Palestinians dead
including 600 children and now the

order should be ignored claiming its
propaganda the Palestinian ambassador to

amounts to ethnic cleansing while the UN

sides that even War has rules well we'll

the region we'll look at the situation

the Israel lemonon border but first
here's Jeremy
boen to win a war a country has to break
the will of its enemy to fight history
suggests air strikes alone won't do that
even ones as heavy as Israel's in
Gaza so Israel will have to send troops

to destroy Hamas telling civilians to
get out is part of preparing the

while it readies its next move a warning
from prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu we are striking our enemies
with an unprecedented power our enemies
have just begun to pay the price
I can't divulge what comes next but I
can tell you this is just the
beginning the UN Secretary General urged
both sides to protect civilians even
Wars have rules International
humanitarian law and human rights law
must be respected and upheld civilians
must be protected and also never use the
shields it's exactly a week since Hamas
gunman Ram paged through southern Israel
families still coming to terms with the
lives
lost this memorial for Tom
godo killed while protecting his wife
and three children during the attack on
a

kidnapped families of the victims
leaning on each other for support
katia's son among those missing
thing we are very anxious our hope is
that our child comes back we cannot
think
otherwise our child has to come
home a deep sense of for boing the
ratcheting up of this crisis seems
inevitable Nick Johnson BBC
News well we're now joined by Lord Mark
Malik Brown former deputy Secretary
General of the UN and current president
of the open Society foundations thank
you for joining us we've been discussing
the proposal put forth by Russia to call
for a ceasefire what's your feeling on
this proposal do do you think there's
any chance that a ceasefire might be
implemented I mean it'd be wonderful if
there could be a ceasefire and you know
the Brazil Brazilians who chair the
security Council this month have also
got a much more balanced resolution
which begins with a condemnation of
Hamas for its attacks on Israeli
citizens and then goes on simly to call
for a ceasefire to allow proper
humanitarian access and support to
civilians at risk in Gaza and you know I
I would love to believe that the
security Council can can come together
around that but in fact there are a
pretty wide range of views at the moment
with some Western countri us
particularly you know certainly calling
for humanitarian restraint but also you
know feeling and their correct in law
that Israel has an absolute right to uh
you know strike back at Hamas which it
does um and by putting that first and
foremost it's inhibited its ability to
the US has inhibited its ability to also
demand a ceasefire and respect for the
rule of law and the and for humanitarian
law so you know the trouble is a lot of
Israel's friends are a little ambivalent
at Best in their messaging you know
recognizing Israel's right to
self-defense and then leaving very much
in second place uh respect for uh the
civilians at risk and and so it it's
tragically hard to see how we get
quickly enough to a point where both
sides pause hold back and try and allow
a little space not just for humanitarian
protection but for the beginnings of
diplomacy as well Lord Malik Brown then
what do the discussions that are going
on at un headquarters in New York tell
us about the the health the strength of
the United Nations in general is there
any prospect that the UN as a body can
really Institute peace between the
Israelis and the the
Palestinians well look I think the
Secretary General who you know has been
criticized quite a lot lately for a
fairly sort of weak performance at the
recent UN General Assembly when he sort
of acknowledged his organization was
broken has had actually a good first
week of this crisis he has an article in
today's New York Times which is very
balanced which uh calls for a suspension
of the violence and uh humanitarian
protection and acknowledges the
longstanding wrongs against both
communities against Israel Israelis and
against Palestinians and the need for
both uh to to have a political voice and
to arrive at a political solution uh to
their decades long uh
confrontation and but the security
Council as I say while I think it's a
happy accident that this month it's
chaired by Brazil a country which is
always trying to find peace and a m way
to any conflict it's been criticized we
trying to do that in the case of Ukraine
and Russia but I think that's exactly
the skill set we need in the chair of
the council at the moment but you know
so and and you know similarly the
humanitarian Chief at the UN has spoken
out strongly against the risk of the
risk the one million Palestinians who
are being pressed by Israel to move to
the south of the country the Red Cross
has come out strongly so you know there
are a lot of principled moral voices
speaking up but you know to the real
import of your question will it lead to
an early resolution of this I suspect
not this you know a terrible crime was
committed last weekend and I suspect
Israel will not be satisfied until it is
you know militarily
uh disarmed neutralized Hamas but what
Israel needs to remember and what the UN
needs to keep saying is there may be a
military solution to Hamas that is not a
military solution to the
Palestinians uh for the Palestinian
people there has to be a political
solution and that's been postponed for
decades and each time there's a crisis
like that this it seems to get kicked
further back into the long ground Lord
Mal Brown as as you're speaking I just
want to to bring in an alert that we've
just received um from AFP they're saying
that Saudi Arabia has paused talks on
the normalization of ties with Israel
can you reflect on that development
where does that leave Israel now that
those those talks that have been going
on for quite some time now fostered by
the United States with Saudi Arabia have
been
paused well I I think this would was
anticipated it would have been
impossible for Saudi Arabia to have
continued them at this time uh you know
it is in recent years been quite quiet
on the issue of Palestinian rights but
when uh the events of this week unfolded
it you know raised its voice much more
clearly in defense of uh the Palestinian
people and it would be just in terms of
uh the Optics and politics of the region
impossible to press on uh in any effort
to to to normalize relations with with
Israel at the very same time that Israel
was seen as
attacking Palestinian Arab civilians uh
in Gaza but I don't know whether in the
longer term I mean I think this is now
up to Israel whether it wants to close
that door forever which would be the
result of a which will happen I think if
it makes a long-term occupation or
long-term milit milary intervention uh
into Gaza or whether it recognizes the
need to contain its military action in
as Surgical and brief a form as possible
so that it can get this back on track
because for both Israel and Saudi Arabia
the stakes are high it would be a
reordering of of the Middle East in a
dramatic way and I think uh you know
there will be a desire to try once the
fighting is dies down to to try and
recover this negotiation okay really
good to hear your thoughts on the
Diplomatic front Lord Mark Malik Brown
former deputy Secretary General of the
UN and current president of the open
Society foundations Lord Malik Brown

Arabia has paused talks on normalization

that is because it puts them closer to

YLV8WwTWiII,Israel prepares for ground assault on Hamas in Gaza - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel prepares for ground assault on Hamas in Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"the Israeli Army says it is preparing
for a ground assault on Hamas in the
Gaza street so far tens of thousands of
troops have been deployed to the border
with Gaza Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu says that they will
crush and Destroy Hamas which launch the
attack on Israel on Saturday well the US
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is in
Israel and speaking alongside his
Israeli counterpart at a joint news
conference in tviv he condemned Hamas
which he regards as a terrorist
organization now this is no time for
neutrality or for false
equivalence or for excuses for the
inexcusable there is never any
justification for
terrorism and that's especially
true after this Rampage by
Hamas and anyone who wants lasting peace
and security for this
region must condemn and isolate
Hamas Hamas does not speak for the
Palestinian people or their legitimate
hopes for dignity security and statehood
and peace alongside
Israel as a former commander of Central
Command the deliberate cruelty of Hamas
vividly reminds me of Isis
right let's get some analysis now on the
Israeli military operation with Shashank
Joshi he's defense editor at The
Economist magazine here in London thank
you very much for coming on the program
good afternoon so uh this idea of a
ground Invasion soon firstly do you
think it is coming soon and and what are
the the the the chances of achieving its
aim of destroying
Hamas well yesterday I would have said
to you this ground invasion was probably
imminent today following the Israeli
call to evacuate the north of Gaza and
move this very large population to the
South which is which is going to take
time I'm I'm less sure I think the
Israeli government in military seems to
think it will take a couple of weeks at
the very least and it's unclear to me
whether they will go in until that's
done um given that they want to be able
to operate on the ground with as few
civilians as possible uh Urban Warfare
is always extremely messy destructive
very harmful on civili
and the IDF would prefer to operate in
in extremely dense builtup places like
Gaza City without civilians so I suspect
we will see a ground Invasion but I
think it will take time to come and in
response to your second question well
the stated Israeli objective is to
destroy Hamas destroying a terrorist
group that has occupied a uh urban area
for 15 16 years and has built 500 kmers
of tunnels underneath it and is embedded
in uh uh the social economic and
political fabric of this territory is is
not easy and I suspect if previous
Ground Wars in Gaza took a couple of
weeks we're going to see an Israeli
military involvement here that goes on
for months and if it really is going to
obliterate Hamas as Israeli officials
have talked about we could be in for a
commitment of years which of course is a
much bigger proposition so an operation
lasting years
potentially well it entirely depends on
the Israeli political leadership and and
how they see their aims if the aim is to
make sure there is no Hamas left that
Hamas cannot reassert itself once the
Israeli Army withdraws from Gaza that
there is no uh uh tunnel capability no
Rockets no uh command centers no senior
leadership none of these things you know
this let's not let's not pretend this is
anything other than an enormous
open-ended campaign that I think will
take a long time it is not something
that can be done in weeks okay that's
pretty sobering what about the idea that
for two reasons there may well be large
number of civilians there still one that
people simply can't move we've been
covering the difficulty in the logistics
and two we've heard from people there
who simply say they won't move they
won't leave their homes so given there
will in all likelihood still be
civilians in the area does that change
any of the
calculations well Israel will be aware
that the greater the civilian casual
the greater the impact on their
International reputation including in
Europe and particularly in America where
they need American political support and
I would just say although America has
Israel's um has given Israel its full
backing now we just heard that clip from
Lloyd Austin it is worth casting your
mind back 20 years to the Israeli
operation in the West Bank when they
went in with massive Force Under Ariel
Chiron and even back then the George W
Bush Administration although initially
supportive eventually told Israel to
those actions because of the cost on the
Palestinian people so setting aside the
legality and and the laws of war around
this the political and diplomatic
constraints on Israel I think are going
to be pretty pretty high um as this
operation goes on okay shasa ji thank
you very much for your analysis thank
you thanks",20231013

the damage in Gaza well Merlin Thomas
from our BBC verifi team has been
piecing together just what we
know we've seen Israeli air Stripes
continue on Gaza with Force now this is
one of those locations a shat refugee
camp and this is the aftermath residents
sifting through the rubble with their
bare hands searching for survivors and
bodies now ashat is just on the coast
here on the Gaza Strip it's the third
largest refugee camp in the Palestinian
territories according to the UN and
remember Gaza is one of the most densely
populated areas on Earth with over 2.3
million people in just 41 km long square
piece of land and right now it's got
closed borders and within that there are
at least eight refugee camps now we've
been trying to verify the extent of the
damage at sh refugee camp and trying to
find the same before and after images
but pinpointing and matching up exact
streets is almost impossible because the
destruction is so bad now this is an
satellite image of the site just a few
days before the
attack and this is Dr own footage from
reuter's news agency now we don't know
precisely how many were killed but the
Palestinian Ministry of Health said that
there was a large
number and for those who were injured
Gaza hospitals aren't necessarily the
safest place either now gaza's Ministry
says that seven hospitals were hit by is
air strikes we've been unable to verify
that ourselves but we have been able to
verify the damage on just one of those
buildings that's this one here the
International Eye Hospital this is
before the
attack and this is what it looks like
after this is posted on X formerly
Twitter by a charity worker now we
haven't been able to find a statement
from the Israel Defense Forces on this
particular hospital but recently they
said that they have intelligence that
shows that Hamas hides inside hospitals
we haven't been able to independently
verify that now Israel Defense Forces
say they notify garans when an air
strike is imminent now we can't verify
whether that's happening right across
the territory but this this is one of
the ways they do that so sometimes they
drop letters so these little white
specks that you can see here that's them
dropping letters so that people know
when the strike is imminent this is sent
to us by rushi Abu ALU who's our
correspondent in Gaza and he sent us
this video from this area of B Leia and
this is what this letter says this says
in
Arabic so it says you know there's an
attack coming imminently make sure you
evacuate quickly and go to a

everyone is watching while this another
catastrophe is actually taking place
right now and everyone is is leaving
It's All About Kids elderly everyone the
roads are being bombed while we were
traveling now there is bombing and
smelling
smoke what is this madness are we going
to come back to any of our homes when we
were leaving we were like just looking
at things as if we're not going to see
them again of course it's not feasible
and of course you'll have hundreds if
not more of casualties and you'll have
destruction and then what Bravo Israel
yeah that's great the work that uh we
are supposed to be doing is simply not
feasible and not possible with the
extent of Destruction with the that
there is no uh no uh Seas fire there is
no uh humanitarian Corridor there is
nothing nothing is is is even discussed
or or or suggested we just hear it in in
in the media and discussions that that
doesn't allow for any kind of response
so people are simply suffering and will
continue to suffer in this placement in
the areas they are in in the schools or
in the streets now it's going to be
everywhere not only in whatever
designated schools it's going to be
everywhere and yes we are hearing about
know no water no enough food uh all all
all these
things well let's cross live now to our
correspondent Anna Foster who's near the
Israel Lebanon border Anna it's really
good to have you you're in a key
location aren't you to explore what's
going to happen next with the militant
group heah uh that's uh located in
Lebanon what have you been hearing
yeah there's real concern about this
northern border as you mentioned hez
blah who are base across in Lebanon a
very powerful uh political and military
group in Lebanon backed by Iran also
like Hamas in Gaza they are an
organization that has been designated a
terrorist organization by the US the UK
uh and other countries as well now the
question is whether or not if there is a
ground offensive in Gaza that Hezbollah
in the North in Lebanon will decide to
try try and support Hamas and will
essentially attack Israel from the north
now this is a it's a lengthy border if
you look at Gaza and you look at that
area we talking about how how sort of
relatively small it is down there um
along here you've got basically the
whole strip of Northern Israel so a lot
of troops have been sent here to
reinforce this area 300,000 reservists
have been called up but many of them
we've been seeing have been arriving on
buses in cars and they are being sent
along here because it is a real latent
concern also when you hear the us
talking about the support that they are
providing to Israel uh they're sending
of course their aircraft carrier their
Fleet of ships they've sent initial um
uh shipments this week of of arms as
well and they say of course that is to
support Israel uh in its war with Gaza
but also they talk about additional
scenarios and what that means the
subtext of that is that they are
preparing in case there is a significant
escalation here in the north as well
Anna of course the the the worries about
a widening conflict are are ever present
what have you been hearing from Iran and
and what has Hezbollah itself been
saying or
doing well there've already been small
incidents and I say small incidents
along the border this week at any other
time if what we'd seen in the last week
wasn't happening in Gaza these would
actually have been extremely significant
incidents it would have been the main
thing that we were talking about because
Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad
which is another islamist militant Group
which is based in uh in Gaza but also in
Lebanon they have fired uh rockets and
missiles across this border um Israel
has responded with its fighter jets
which have targeted uh PJ and Hezbollah
infrastructure on the other side of the
Border in Lebanon as well there have
been Israeli soldiers uh who were killed
several days ago when there was an
incursion from the north there were some
gunmen who came across and in that
battle to try and contain things um a
senior Israeli soldier a deputy
Battalion Commander was killed along
with colleagues um certainly when we
were here the day before yesterday there
was what turned out to be a false alarm
but it was a rumor of a new aerial
incursion from the north we spent about
90 minutes in a a shelter with a group
of local armed men who were trying to
find out information what was really
significant at that moment I think was
what you saw on things like social media
you know the the way that the rumor mill
just went into overdrive instantly and
it it sort of shows you how how nervous
people are a lot of people along here
have chosen to to leave their
communities all together because when
you are right on the border they have
seen what's happened in southern Israel
they have seen what happened when Hamas
crossed over from Gaza so some people
here are staying put staying near
shelters staying safe but some people
are choosing to leave all together while
they just live in the midst of that
uncertainty about what might happen next
if we broaden our view Anna we know that
the US Secretary of State Anthony
blinkin is is touring the region for the
next few days what countries really hold
weight when it comes to possibly
containing this
conflict well Egypt has always been an
important mediator when there've been
escalations before around Gaza Egypt to
often that the country that steps in and
and talks with uh with Israel and with
the Palestinians with Hamas and tries to
to negotiate you know some sort of some
sort of agreement I mean it's happened
before you know tensions been deescalate
that way I think when you look at what's
happening now the suggestion is that
things might have gone too far at this
stage Israel has said that there will be
a significant response to what has
happened here uh also in terms of those
hostages that are being held again
hostage negotiations are important um
countries like Qatar I mean you
mentioned Iran of course you know Iran
uh supports Hamas supports Hezbollah but
those sorts of dialogues you know
between the US and Iran for example or
Iran and countries in this region it
just doesn't work that way so even
though there are these attempts at
diplomacy going on and they're important
um I think how how vital they might be
how crucial they might be how much they
might work is Up For Debate Anna thanks
for taking us through that Anna Foster
speaking to us uh from the Israel
Lebanon board",20231013

on the Israel Gaza war in the last hour
or so the United Nations has said that
it it has been told by the Israeli
military that more than a million
Palestinians must leave the northern
Gaza Strip within the next 2 24 hours in
a statement the UN spokesman Stefan duar
said that the United Nations considers
it impossible for such a movement to
take place without devastating
humanitarian in consequences the United
Nations strongly appeals for any such
order if confirmed to be rescinded
avoiding what could transform what's
already a tragedy into a into a
calamitous
situation well this is the scene live in
Gaza where it has just turned 7:00 in
the morning the United Nations said that
the order by the Israeli military also
applies to all of its staff and those
sheltered in in un facilities including
schools Health Centers and Clinics there
and a Hamas official quoted by the
Reuters news agency said that the
relocation warning from Israel was fake
propaganda let's give you a sense of the
geography in Gaza this is a map of
Israel where you can see Gaza and the
West Bank marked what the Israeli
military is saying is that everyone
living in Northern Gaza should really
locate to the southern end in the next
24 hours that's more than a million
people around half of the population of
the entire Gaza
Strip well let's uh speak now to uh my
colleague from BBC Arabic s shahata um
what do you make side of what we've
heard in the last hour from the United
Nations from Israel via the United
Nations it sounds as if things could be
escalating uh in the next 24 hours or so
it looks like that because if you look
at the density of the population in Gaza
2 million on living on 88 square miles
uh so it's about 21,000 be uh square
miles so to move half of them to another
part this will be a crisis is going to
have like as the United Nation mention
uh humanitarian consequence for that I
think Israel doing that in order to make
it easier for the ground assault so it
makes because there is many times
hundreds of thousand of reservist of
Israeli troops came to join from
different plac in the world and so
Israel pushing for that and all uh you
know some military inside Israel
supporting that saying we cannot destroy
Hamas without the ground assault so I
think Israel trying to put pressure on
the people on Gaza to move in order to
avoid any casual qualities uh because
there is many people dying it's more
than 1,500 people and more than like
5,000 injured uh beside that the
blockade like no food no electricity so
all of that human think it's making the
picture is gloomy and it will put
pressure on other countries especially
on blank uh on America and blankin in
his visit to Jordan to do something in
order to diffuse that because I think it
will make re might make reaction from
parties which Israel try and America to
not to be involved in this conflict like
hisbah or Iran so a pretty tense 24
hours obviously um ahead um do stay with
us though for the moment s because I
want to cross over to to Gaza now and
speak to uh Nala shawa who's the
regional country relations manager uh
for oxfarm in Gaza she's currently one
of the 1.1 million residents of Gaza
who've been told to leave uh but by
Israel uh thank you very much for making
the time to talk to us M shawa um can I
get your reaction on the ground to this
uh call uh from Israel for people to
evacuate uh Northern Gaza how how
feasible is it even to do it within the
deadline that's been
set uh hi uh first of all we're there's
so much um chaos in in in Gaza uh we
managed to leave that uh at like 4:30
a.m. um we are about um um 15 people
here we moved to another location South
and um we we think I mean basically now
asking this question uh is clearly puts
um puts the the reminder that Israel can
do whatever whatever it wants and uh
nobody can stop it obviously so the
arrogance of of Israel is has been like
that for for decades so obviously now
it's happening again and it's um simply
on the news and everyone is watching
while this another catastrophe is
actually taking place right now I know
everyone is in a total panic and
everyone is is leaving it's talk about
kids elderly everyone the roads are
being bombed while we were traveling now
there is bombing I'm smelling smoke
what is this madness we of
course Gaza and Gaza City to the South
what what what is it what is the plan
and and are we going to come back to any
of our homes when we were leaving we
were like just looking at things as if
we're not going to see them again we
have of course n seen n we have seen of
course the the the devastating pictur is
coming out uh of Gaza we know that
hospitals are running out of crucial
supplies uh electricity has been cussed
to uh to many parts of of the area and
if this uh evacuation uh order is to be
is to be followed H how feasible is it
how possible is
it of course it's not feasible and of
course you'll have hundreds if not more
of casualties and you'll have
destruction and then what Bravo Israel
yeah that's great
what what is it that it's fighting
here what do you think the timing of
this order um says about the Israeli
military's uh approach to protecting
civilians yeah moving I don't know one
million people um to uh to travel to the
to the South during 1 million you know
you you understand you understand the
figure you're not talking about
neighborhood so Israel started with a
house with a building and with the
neighborhood just three days ago and
yesterday and the the days before now
it's like an
entire region of of the god STP like
like maybe third or more of the godess
strip area of course it's not feasable
but Israel can do whatever they want
nobody's stopping
them no matter how how I scream on the
TV or how angry people are around the
world it's not going to make any
difference right because we are living
by these double
standards decade after decade double
standard we are not seen as humans
enough we're not human enough that's it
that's a fact of
life as we're listening to you Nala
we're we're seeing pictures coming in of
uh uh fresh rocket fire uh what appears
to be fresh rocket fire uh over Gaza um
the situation there obviously incredibly
unimaginably uh difficult for you and uh
and others who are living there what's
your message to uh the world leaders
Anthony blinkin the uh us uh secretary
of state who's in the in the region
right now uh trying to to find some kind
of a a diplomatic solution what's your
message uh to him and
others to stop this
madness and what I just mentioned
stop living and practicing and imposing
these double standards because we are
also
people reminder we have been under
occupation for 70 plus
years we are people and we are here we
have been
here we are suffering before October 7th
Palestinians in Gaza and in the West
Bank Israel before before October 7th
was living a normal life not worrying
about anything before October 7th it was
not the same case for
Palestinians you should be aware of that
and they are aware that's why I'm not
sure I even want to say that passage to
them do they really
bother what are you going to do now Nala
you're involved obviously in the uh
humanitarian situation there
uh we've had this uh fresh warning
coming from the Israeli military just in
the last hour or so uh how is it going
to change your response today is it
going to change uh your the work you're
going to be doing
today the work that uh we are supposed
to be doing is simply not feasible and
not possible with the extent of
Destruction with that that there is no
uh no uh ceasefire there is no uh
humanitarian Corridor there is nothing
nothing is is is even discussed or or or
suggested we just hear it in in in the
media in discussions that that doesn't
allow for any kind of response so people
are simply suffering and will continue
to suffer in displacement in the areas
they are in in the schools or in the
streets now it's going to be everywhere
not only in whatever designated schools
it's going to be everywhere and yes we
are hearing about no water no enough
food uh all all all these
things now I bringing with me now to
this place some uh some water and some
food maybe for a couple of days God
knows until when are we going to be here
here
for okay and I am in a much better
position than many others so no talking
about response nobody is able to do
anything
Nyla shaer um we thank you for joining

worry about possible ground incursion as
I remember in 2014 when the Israeli
started to bomb the northern part of
Gaza it was straight away we have seen
tanks started to to move until now there
is no sign of any tanks Crossing into
Gaza but people here everywhere are
talking about possible ground in Kion

Oe1pVnKk-aU,"Gaza situation dire, UN says, as Israeli military admits security failures - BBC News","data/en_BBCNews\Gaza situation dire, UN says, as Israeli military admits security failures - BBC News.jpg","with me to discuss is Professor Lena
ctib she is the director of the soas
Middle East Institute um I hadn't seen
Jery's report we watched it together I'm
struck by how many of the victims in
these reports are pacifists who've
worked with Palestinians have picked
Palestinians up from the areas
Crossing they are the people in the
South most at risk from graza but in a
way they are in the same way closer to
the Palestinians would I be right
well we have to remember that in this
conflict not everyone is an extremist
not everyone believes in violence and
there are pacifists on both sides when
you're talking about pacifists who are
Israeli who live near Gaza these are the
people who are also observing the
suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza
and this perhaps makes them more likely
to want to help because of you know
observing the suffering of fellow human
beings rather than those who are in T
Aviv or West Bank who sorry or in
Jerusalem who are more detached from it
yeah I mean this is of course a
generalization however in general
communities that are isolated from
others uh don't really uh know what it's
like to be on the other side and so when
you have communities that are completely
detached from what life is like for
these Palestinians then perhaps they
don't even imagine the scale of the
suffering it's it's I I I don't know how
the
parents deal with what they're hearing
and and and what they're seeing um why
do you think it must have been a
deliberate strategy if Hamas had come in
and shot the men and shot the soldiers
that would be one thing but shooting
children burning children slitting the
throats of children that that is a
deliberate strategy why why have they
gone that far I mean the attack by Hamas
is is unprecedented in terms of scope in
terms of scale in terms of ambition
Hamas wants this to be a message to
Israel that this is an existential
battle now and for that reason they are
attacking everybody they regard
everybody as a legitimate Target to
instill fear in the Israeli population
because they know that the Israeli State
exists to protect the Jewish people and
the Israeli citizens and so in attacking
the civilians Hamas is basically trying
to say this idea of the Israeli state is
not viable so they are sending a uh
psychological message to the rest of the
uh Israeli population which is uh you
know another tool of warfare this is
psychological warfare as well as a
military attack causing actual physical
casualties what about the message to
their own people in Gaza that too I mean
Hamas wants to be seen as heroic and
it's no accident that the there are lots
of Palestinians who won't see this as
heroic no of course not but I mean we've
seen in the um reports uh people being
very desperate I mean we have to look at
the circumstances of people in Gaza they
are so desperate that for a lot of them
they feel they have no other alternative
and they think either way we're dead and
so we might as well get behind this kind
of lost battle because what have we got
to lose um it's really unfortunate I
mean not everyone necessarily believes
in hamas's methods or Hamas is a
political entity or a military entity
but for a lot of people they are so
desperate that they're just getting
behind Hamas for lack of other options
just on the wider region because we're
going to talk about that a lot this
evening um this is putting enormous
pressure it and it certainly will when
the pictures come out of Gaza in the in
the weeks ahead it's putting enormous
pressure on Arab governments and the
Egyptian government absolutely I mean
for Saudi Arabia that had just until
Saturday thought that its plan to go
ahead with a deal with Israel the United
States uh was kind of you know making
progress of course it was talking to the
Palestinian Authority about this deal to
try to find some sort of solution to
this conflict now that is stalled and
same for Egypt president CCE of Egypt is
facing an election soon and now he has a
very complicated uh problem on his hands
Professor KB good to see you thank you
for coming in this evening um lots to
discuss and we'll get into some more of
that uh through the course of the
program around the world and across the
UK you're watching BBC
News let's take a quick look at some of
the other stories making news today the
waiting list for Planned NHS England
treatment has risen again to a new
record high more than 7.7 million people
were waiting to start routine treatment
at the end of August it's highest number
since records began routine treatment
ranges from hip replacements to surgery
to remove cancerous
tumors the former Formula 1 boss Bernie
Eon has been given a suspended prison
sentence for fraud the 92-year-old
billionaire pleaded guilty at Souther
crime Court he admitted failing to
declare more than 400 million held in a
trust in Singapore to the UK government
in July 2015 he received a sentence of
17 months suspended for 2 years the UK
economy grew by. 2% in August according
to the latest figures the office for
National statistics says there was
strong growth in Services which was
partially offset by Falls in
manufacturing and Construction in
contrast some sectors fared poorly such
as Arts entertainment and
Recreation you're live with BBC News now
there are around 150 people thought to
have been taken hostage by Hamas last
night we received a bit more information
from the Israeli Defense Force on where
they're being held they believe they've
been dispersed among tunnels under Gaza
in locations that were not known to be
used by Hamas prior to this conflict but
remember this is not just an Israeli
hostage crisis there were 23
nationalities among those killed on
Saturday the US said tonight that 27
Americans were killed 14 are still
unaccounted for it's belied some of them
will be among the hostages there's 18
French citizens that are missing
including several children the French
prime minister Elizabeth Bourne said
they are sure that some of those were
abducted by Hamas 17 British Nationals
killed or abducted we don't have a
breakdown yet on the numbers that have
been taken so how do you get them out
alive that is the task of the
negotiating teams with me uh a man who
is an expert Scott Walker he's a former
hostage negotiator having resolved more
than 300 cases in his career thank you
for coming in it's good to see you um
what's the Arc of a hostage crisis like
this well as you can imagine in the
early hours and days there's lots of
High emotion uncertainty and confusion
so one of the early stages is to try and
build an information intelligence
picture try and find out what is going
on who actually has the hostages and try
and engage in some kind of dialogue with
them it's different though when you're
dealing with an organization rather than
a state or a government and the demands
of Hamas are so much different to what
other groups would be looking for
correct well this is the challenge in
this particular case because the
negotiations when they take place are
actually occurring in a war zone there's
an extra Dimension to it as well and
there are so many of them spread out
across G as well as you mentioned
earlier in tunnels and and and basement
and what have
you it seems to me that the strategy has
to be keeping in the mind of the hostage
takers the value of the people they're
holding how do you do that absolutely
it's about humanizing them and it's just
to kind of reiterate right at the
beginning when we talk about negotiation
we're not talking about agreeing or
condoning or acquiescing to the hostage
takers it's actually just opening up
some kind of dialogue to enable the safe
And Timely release so in the case of
Hamas that would be we could talk about
prisoners but what you have to give us
some proof of life you have to give us
some proof that they're being well cared
for absolutely proof of life is one of
the fundamental aspects of all hostage
negotiation uh and it's normally in the
very early stages what about the
complexity of this because as I've just
described I mean I I don't know how many
hostages are in there of different
nationalities but we've pulled out four
the French the Brits the Americans of
course the Israelis who takes the lead
because what you don't want to do is
over complicate a situation like this
well my understanding is there is a
coordination cell and Situation Room set
up and that will bring together the
Americans through the FBI and the Brits
and other National alties who have
hostages taken out there as well to kind
of coordinate the response to try to
identify and locate where the hostages
are being held and actually what are the
options are including there will be
options for hostage rescue perhaps as
part of the the incursion that is
inevitable but that obviously only
increases the risk to the hostages we're
going to have to brace ourselves for the
inevitable film that will come out we
hope against hope that it's it's not
somebody paraded who is already dead but
but does that as as a negotiator does
that affect the give and take that tends
to develop in a situation like
this well it's important to remain
optimistic in these and actually as I
mentioned just now it is about trying to
humanize the lives and the people the
hostages that they've got to actually
minimize the chances as much as possible
of them coming to harm and actually if
they want some kind of prisoner exchange
they need to take care it's their
responsibility for the welfare of the
hostages whilst in their captivity are
you hopeful yeah absolutely I think
normally there's a high chance of
success in hos negotiations generally
and I think if this is handled
well I'm hopeful for for Lam to come
back Scott it's good to see you thank
you for coming in",20231012

to be a a land Invasion at some point
the military piece is getting into place
today the diplomacy was in was what was
a focus with the arrival of the US
Secretary of State Anthony blinkin with
two messages from Washington that Israel
has will have the support of the United
States its staunchest Ally but that it
must also remember that even in war
There are rules and that humanitarian
concern is also deepening as the
humanitarian crisis in Gaza gets ever
worse that Complete Siege that Israel
has imposed on the territory targeting
civilians at a time of war is a war
crime and the United States all of
Israel's allies who are making it clear
they stand by Israel at this time this
unprecedented time for the Jewish state
but they also don't want Israel to come
under criticism for putting civilians in
harms way but quite frankly the mood
here has hardened so much after the
horrific events which began on Saturday
and there are many here in fact the
mayor of stot told us the reason why it
hasn't worked in the past is because
Western leaders have called the prime
minister of of Israel after one week of
an operation or two and said stop he
said and it reflects the public mood
here and possibly the political mood
this time we shouldn't stop we have to
destroy Hamas and Jihad but there are
others who say that it just won't work
you have to find a political way out
when this war is over",20231012

Gaza late this afternoon at kibuts B
regular units and some of more than
300,000 mobilized reservists were
preparing for the order to move in that
most Israelis believe will
come the buildup that we're seeing here
is certainly the clearest evidence that
I've witnessed that Israel is preparing

must be going in

Onslaught raises questions about whether
it's breaking the laws of
war in Gaza Israel has caused immense
damage in only 5 Days International
humanitarian law obliges belligerence to
protect protect civilian lives Israel
says all this is legitimate self-defense
against Hamas but it's also cut off

accusations that Israel is answering the

Israel well Palestinian media say the
only Power Plant still operating in the
Gaza Strip has now stopped working after
running out of fuel and as we've been
hearing there are more than 200 targets
that have been hit by the Israelis in
air strikes overnight and these images
show the level of Destruction this is
the remal area before the strikes and
this a light image of the same
neighborhood which came through
yesterday and has been located by our
colleagues at BBC verify more than a
thousand people are now known to have
died and a quarter of a million have
been forced from their
homes well Gaza is of course Under Siege
and Communications are extremely
difficult but we can talk now to our
correspondent rushi Abu alouf who's live
in Gaza City for us tonight rushi just
tell us what the last few days have been
like living in an area under siege and
under constant bombardment from the
air yeah I can see I have been
witnessing the heaviest air strike in my
20 years covering of this story it was
by far the heaviest I've been witnessing
what the destruction in this remel
neighborhood it's the for a very long
time this neighborhood is been the safe
heaven for most of the G and most of the
streets in this neighborhood was was
destroyed I was among the families who
were like suffering on during that days
but the humanitarian side of the story
is is is moving in a very significant
way when we have when when like two
million people lost the electricity
today we are talking about the essential
services such as Medical Services Water
Supplies Food Supplies are being
suspended because of that the
humanitarian Corridor for
letting food and medicine and fuel into
to Gaza is a must is a call from every
Palestinians that why we understand
tonight from a senior Egyptian official
that Egypt is working closely with other
countries and contacting Hamas and
Israel to try to find a a draft of six
hour to allow goods and fuel to come
from Egypt into
Gaza and rushi what about the suggestion
the possibility of a ground Invasion we
heard from Jeremy boen that the more
troops are massing on the border with
Gaza uh acrossing Israel how are people
feeling about the possibility that there
could be a ground
Invasion this is the most worry for the
people people in Gaza are fear this
because they have lived through a ground
Invasion before back in 2014 we have
seen Israeli tanks in refugee camp we
are talking about a camp in the North
like when 100,000 people live in a very
small tiny piece of land if people are
already ex exhausted by 3,000 air
strikes and 1100 people died o only
from from what soldiers and tanks are
engaging in Street to to Street and
house to house fighting with Hamas in
Gaza with two million people living in
this tiny piece of
land okay we'll end it there rushi Abdul

joining us live from Gaza where

Anthony blinkin and Benjamin netan who
as we've been mentioning have been
speaking at a joint news conference in
Israel let's have a listen in to what
they said we know Hamas instead of
promoting the well-being of its citizens
rules repressively and dedicates the
resources it has to Terror tunnels and
Rockets we know Hamas didn't commit its
heinous acts with the interests of
Palestinian people in
mind we know Hamas does not stand for
the future that Palestinians want for
themselves and for their
children Hamas has only one agenda to
destroy Israel
and to murder
Jews no country can or would tolerate
the slaughter of its citizens or simply
return to the conditions that allowed it
to take place Israel has the right
indeed the obligation to defend itself
and to ensure that this never happens
again as the Prime Minister and I
discussed how Israel does this
matters we democracies distinguish
ourselves from terrorists by striving
for a different standard even when it's
difficult and holding ourselves to
account when we fall short are
Humanity the value that we place on
human life and human dignity that's what
makes us who we
are and we count them among our greatest
strength that's why it's so important to
take every possible precaution to avoid
harming civilians and that's why we
mourn the loss of every innocent life
civilians of every Faith every
nationality who've been
killed
tragically the number of innocent lives
claimed by hamas's heinous attacks
continues to rise among those we now
know that at least 25 American citizens
were killed we joined families in Israel
in the United States around the world in
mourning their immeasurable
loss just some breaking news lines that
have come in to us via the Reuters News
news agency which says that Israel's
military Chief of Staff has said we did
not meet the challenge of protecting
Israel and uh goes on to say we will
learn we will investigate but now is the
time for War uh presumably responding to
criticism over Israel's intelligence
failures um at the weekend well now
let's go live to our chief International
correspondent Lee duet who is in Sarat
for
us yes to pick up on that phrase reini
now is the time for war and here in the
South as you can hear the sound of
artillery all the signs all the SES are
that Israel is preparing for an
intensification of this war as we drove
into stat which at this point is less
than a mile from the Gaza border uh
there was the constant sound of heavy
artillery you can and I think you can
see the the plumes of black smoke Rising
that's Gaza City in the background now
under nonstop bombardment and we've been
reporting on BBC News the humanitarian
consequences of Israel's attacks on the
Gaza Strip Israel continues to say that
it's only attacking Hamas infrastructure
only aiming to take out hamas's leaders
but as always in war it's also a
deepening humanitarian crisis and
they're feeling it here in Sou Israel
sarot has always been on the front line
when it comes to increased confrontation
between Israel um and Gaza the Rockets
have come in here year after year
decades after decades the whole town
many places are now shut but some people
still want to say saying they can't
afford to leave so when we arrived in
stat this morning we met the mayor Alon
davadi who's appealing to the Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to help him
evacuate this town you have asked prime
minister Netanyahu to evacuate all the
residents of your town of course because
I want to give the to the government and
to the Army a time to make the war
against the Kamas and the Jihad and this
is a dangerous place now because we are
so close to the Gaza to the border of
Gaza I know that I speak with you a few
time in the last days you see all the
and of the missile that land on the town
you see on the injur
that injur from the rocket we have
people that died from that it's a good
for the family that Liv in the road to
be outside from the city people have not
left already you haven't asked them to
left yes people left but imagine if you
you have your family you cannot rent a
hotel for one month from your money this
is responsible of the country to give
them the H support that they need what's
the M toot now you always bear the brunt
you're so close to Gaza whenever there's
a a crisis

heart is breaking but we need to make
the job with the people we need to take
care to the people that live here and
and thanks to God I hope that we have
the courage to continue and to crush the
Jad in theas are you angry at your
government that this has happened no I'm
not angry I'm angry about
our love of today I will say something
you know you are in the BBC you always
and I know that you are do it because
you are want that the world will be good
Jad and Kama
it's a organiz organization that take
money and the support from Iran jiad and
Hamas don't care about the future of
Gaza and don't care about the future of
Israel but you must care about the
future of Gaza it's your neighbor it's
just that if we want if you want that
the future of this area will be good we
need to find the way to take the Hamas
and the Jihad out from Gaza to take all
the weapon that they have outside from
GDA if they don't want to do it we need
to kill them we need to destroy them not
for me for you and for all of us and
because that I said to the GU the the
the Prime Minister take your time if you
need one month two months to make H the
war from today and it take you two
months to destroy them let's do it let's
do it
just take the people out give them the
supply that they need and we pray
together me and you and everyone to to
God that the God give us the power to
destroy the the the evil this is it
people here said that in 2008
2014
2021 it keeps happening no it's because
when always when we start to make
operation in Gaza after one week after
two weeks the leadership of britania the
leadership of United States and all the
country say to netan and say to our
prime minister stop stop we you need and
I hear the Biden what Biden said I'm I
said thank you for you to the president
of United States of your support I say
thank you for all the leadership of the
country that support Israel you need to
say to netan take your time if you need
your our weapon if you need our soldier
we need to destroy it and vage and vage
the Hamas and the from the area well
leas is still with us but before we go
back to lease and Sarat we have an
update from the Gaza Health Ministry uh
the latest now is that,
1417 Palestinians have been killed since
Israeli strikes on since Saturday and
6,268 have been wounded leas uh back to
you now when we were talking too earlier
we could hear the sound of artillery in
the background how are people who want
to leave Gaza going to be able to get
safe
passage well that is the big issue it it
it's a very dangerous moment the people
of Gaza every time there is a crisis
like this they hear Israel's warning to
the people of Gaza to leave and they say
there's no there's nowhere for us to
leave to there's nowhere uh safe enough
for us to hide you we have to keep
reminding our our our viewers that
Israel pulled out his troops in 2005 but
Israel still controls the airspace it
still controls the waters it controls
all of the crossings around this Coastal
strip except one which goes through
Egypt and and and Israel bombed it the
other day so today uh the Egyptians
pleaded with the Israelis please don't
bomb the crossing at Rafa uh the Rafa
Crossing is open today but they can only
take in 400 a day and there will be tens
of thousands of desperate people trying
to get out if of course they have the
paperwork to get out and that's why
there are intensive discussions going on
with the Egyptians the Americans many
other countries including the British
providing safe passage a way out through
that Crossing and also allowing food and
fuel to get in to help people who who
can't leave I mean most people will want
to leave if only for a short time is
Egypt of course is wor that it'll have a
huge influx of people and that as always
in this region a temporary situation
becomes a permanent one and no one they
don't want to see a depopulation and
also it's dangerous people are hiding in
their basements if there's bombardment I
mean look at that what's now the smoke
that's drifting through the sky children
elderly to walk on the streets their
their there their there's glass
everywhere the the rubble strewn across
the streets it's dangerous inside the
home and it's dangerous outside the home
it's dangerous everywhere in Gaza now
and Le we've been reporting throughout
the day a buildup of troops at the
border everyone's trying to guess when
that Israeli land incursion might come
what's your assessment and what are you
thinking at the
moment it is a very complex very
dangerous undertaking the Israeli
Defense Forces has said that the
decision to go go in to to launch this
kind of operation has still not been
taken but everything around uh all the
preparations all of the statements all
of the pressure suggests nothing else
that there will at some point have to be
a ground Invasion this is something
Israel has tried to avoid we saw in 2014
they made some kind of they did make
incursions across the border they were
trying to destroy the tunnels which were
used by Hamas to bring uh to to
penetrate into uh Southern Israel to
bring in resources but they didn't go in
for a full a full scale Invasion now the
big question is are they going to go in
are they going to try to reoccupy Gaza
this will be fighting Street by Street
house by house room by room it is a
densely populated enclave and it seems
beyond very absolutely certain that if
Hamas took made all the preparations to
carry out this unprecedented assault
they will have also carried out
unprecedented preparations to be ready
when it knows that Israel will retaliate
they are ready now they're waiting for
Israel to come in as Israel prepares and
all the signs are is that this is
gathering Pace by the day one of the
BBC's best lease du set please do stay

after they agreed to form an emergency
Unity government to manage the war with
Hamas at a news conference Mr Gans who's
a former Army Commander said the move
sent a strong
message our standing here together
shoulder to shoulder is a message to our
enemies and most importantly a message
to all citizens of Israel we are all
together we are all
soldiers there is a time for war and a
Time For Peace now is a time for
war well overnight Israel 's exchange of
Rocket fire with Hamas continued these
pickets these pictures show Rockets
being fired into Israel from Gaza and
this footage shows Israel's Iron Dome
missile defense system intercepting
those Rockets with Explosions in the

monitor the impact of Israeli air
strikes in Gaza several videos released
by the Israeli Defense Force
have shown their attacks one was on the
Islamic University of Gaza targeted
between the 10th and 11th of October
this is a satellite image of what the
university looked like before the strike
BBC verify matched the building's
distinctive shapes to know that this
image was taken after the strike Israel
says Hamas was using the university as a
training camp for weapons development
and Military Intelligence well that's a
claim we haven't been able to
independently confirm
these images show the AL Ral area before
the strikes and this is a satellite
image of the same neighborhood in Gaza
which came through yesterday and has
been located by our colleagues a BBC
verify well with me now is s shat from
BBC Arabic s just over two million
people living inside uh Gaza very small
area what have what's the latest of that
we've been hearing overnight uh the
latest is more bombardment from uh
Israel air strikes and demolish building
uh destruction people will killed I look
at several videos it's horrific videos
of children dying the ambulances
carrying some of them under the
Restriction because the ceiling of like
not allowing food or electricity so
there's a problem in fuel to even to
make this Hospital working at full
capacity so you use only the hospital
for helping people saving life all not
like death uh like threat but like
nothing more than that and this like put
pressure there is more than 100 1,200
people died according to the uh Ministry
of Health in Gaza and there is about
5,000 injured so far there is more than
300,000 according to the UN at this
place or forced to leave their houses
but the problem where do you go even
Israel like warn them like leave their
your houses because we're hitting it
under the claim they are used by Hamas
Fighters but where do you go these
people well where do you go that's the
question isn't it I mean I know there
are some negotiations ongoing there is
pressure mounting on Israel to allow
some civilians to leave Gaza what are
some of the challenges with that idea
the problem is uh there was a an old
idea that to put the people of Gaza in
Sinai and it was like a proposal but was
refused by Egypt and the president of
Egypt refused that but allowing like
humanitarian uh for humanitary reason to
come that's no problem and Egypt sent a
convoy big Convoy but Israel refusing to
allow it end so Egypt can do that
through Rafa Crossing uh United States
and I think with blinkin visit and with
other pressure from uh C turkey Saudi
Arabia Iran it might uh help to ease
attention and put pressure on Israel to
allow that because with the images of
people children dying and with
demonstration in many places so I think
Israel will lose I think the battle in
media if they don't allow this
humanitarian to go humanitarian Corridor
to do to go there you've mentioned all
these Regional players now we know that
Saudi Iran uh Saudi Arabia and Iran have
been speaking quite unusual really
they've only just started to reestablish
diplomatic ties can you tell us what
they've been talking about and and in
particular where Saudi Arabia is
standing in all of this it was the first
time uh a contact between the Iranian
president Ibrahim RI and the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia Muhammed bin
Salman since uh the uh agreement of
resuming the relationship in March uh
through mediation by China and according
to the Iranian State media they saying
that uh the Ibrahim RI talk with
Muhammad B Salman the need to stop the
what he described war crimes against
Palestine but on the other hand this the
Saudi media uh agency like the state
media saying Ben Salman didn't mention
about war crimes but he what he said is
there is need to allow humanitarian AIDS
there is need to stop like uh the
atrocities happening there and and there
is no and even he was rejecting killing
civilians and implicitly it means
civilian from both sides so he didn't
take one side because killing civilians
is is not is not is not allowed and the
same time you know like Iran has is
known to support Hamas and uh and hisbah
so I think the rule of Saudi Arabia to
convince Iran not to do that so it will
contain uh the uh conflict not to be uh
uh outside this uh thing and to escalate
it side thank you very much for taking
us through that side sh shahata from BBC
arbec thank
you",20231012
22LjM_9hmmA,Why US believes Israel and Saudi Arabia negotiations could be factor in Hamas attacks - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Why US believes Israel and Saudi Arabia negotiations could be factor in Hamas attacks - BBC News.jpg,"there's a lot of attention on why Hamas
carried out the attack on Israel now and
there's one factor America has
highlighted here's one thing that's uh
that's clear uh we've been actively
working on trying to help Israel and
Saudi Arabia normalize their relations
normalize here means to establish formal
ties such as setting up embassies and
creating other diplomatic and economic
links and America believes the Hamas
attack May connect to this push for
normalization
now who's opposed to that Hamas
Hezbollah Iran uh so I think that speaks
volumes Hamas is an islamist militant
group based in Gaza Hezbollah is an
islamist militant group based in Lebanon
both groups are armed and funded by Iran
all three consider themselves part of a
resistance to Israel and on the Hamas
attack the UN is unequivocal its
Secretary General says nothing can
justify these acts of Terror but Hamas
has tried to justify the attack it cites
what it calls Israel's crimes against
the Palestinians and its repeated
storming of alaka mosque that's a
reference to the actions of Israeli
police at Jerusalem's most important
holy site for Muslims and for Jews and
this year has been the deadliest on
record for Palestinians in the Israeli
occupied West Bank though Israel has
defended its actions throughout Hamas
will also have known its attack was
almost 50 years to the day since a
surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on
the Jewish holy day of yum kapor there
was something else in hamas's list of
grievances normalization that same
factor that America pointed to so let's
look at this because what's being called
normalization is in fact far from normal
in the region because for decades most
Arab states didn't recognize the state
of Israel in 2020 that started to change
the US broker deals with the United Arab
Emirates and Bahrain in which they
normalized relations with Israel but
Palestinians weren't involved neither
the Palestinian Authority in the West
Bank led by makad Abbas nor Hamas which
controls Gaza and they both denounced
the normalization deals at the time
BBC's Jeremy Bowen explained that the
new agreement breaks a long-standing
Arab consensus that the price of normal
relations with Israel was Independence
for the Palestinians in other words in
the eyes of its critics normalization
weakens the Palestinian cause and now
the US is brokering new normalization
talks that are even more significant
this time with Saudi Arabia one of the
Region's most powerful countries and in
September Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington
and he expressed hope that what he
called a historic peace with the Saudis
was possible I think such a peace would
go a long way first to advance the end
of the Arab Israeli conflict uh achieve
reconciliation between the Islamic world
and the Jewish State and Advance a
genuine peace between us well on the
Palestinians and unlike previous
normalization talks this time
Palestinians have been involved but not
all Palestinians in September a high
level Saudi delegation visited the
occupied West Bank for the first time in
decades it met Mahmud Abbas leader of
the Palestinian Authority now to be
clear there's no deal yet the US has
said the talks are incredibly difficult
but to supporters of normalization the
prize here is huge in the words of one
Israeli newspaper Saudi Israel
normalization would transform the Middle
East but this push for better Saudi
Israel relations has left Hamas wanting
to derail the process Hamas officials
have mentioned that they want to send a
message to um their to Arab leaders that
they can't be ignored that Arabs can't
just make deals with Israel and expect
to get peace Iran had a message too this
is its supreme leader in early October
before the Hamas
attack countries that use the gamble of
normalization with the Zionist regime as
a method for themselves will lose and a
loss awaits them they are making a
mistake Zionist regime is a reference to
Israel Iran refuses to use Israel's name
it also denies being behind the Hamas
attack and americ says it's not seen
evidence that it was and if Iran and
Hamas have points to make on
normalization so does Israel since the
attack its US ambassador has urged
everyone who has a stake in peace and
normalization in the Middle East should
support an outcome that would deal a
blow to Iran and its proxies to Israel
to the UN the US the UK the EU and many
others no reason can justify this mass
murder of civilians this war crime but
in quite different ways Hamas and
America both say normalization was a
factor in why this attack happened now
America and Israel's desire for
normalization is matched by hamas's
desire to stop it for now though Israel
is in shock in mourning and at War
normalization will have to wait",20231011

least 1,000 Israelis are now known to
have been killed in Hamas attacks over
the weekend more Rockets have been fired
today into Israel with the Israeli Port
of ashalon targeted in the past few
hours Israel has continued its campaign
of air strikes on Gaza for a fourth day
un Aid agencies have warned of the
severe consequences of Israel's Siege on
the territory the World Health organiz
sttion has called for a humanitarian
Corridor to be opened into the area the
families of Israelis taken hostage have
been speaking about their Agony today
the Israeli Army says it's contacted the
families of 50 soldiers seized by herass
at least 123 Israeli soldiers have been
killed since
Saturday well coming up in this hour
we'll hear from a former senior minister
in the Palestinian Authority we'll also
hear from an Israeli whose family
members have been Tak hostage and from
Oxfam on the humanitarian situation in
Gaza but let's take a closer look at the
attacks on ashon in the last couple of
hours our correspondent Anna Foster has
been there in the city as those attacks
began the sirens went immediately I
think actually I was just about to take
you upstairs out of the shelter um
because uh we thought that there was the
all clear uh but again I can hear just
coming from upstairs the sound of the
Sirens once again here in ashalon you
can see uh there's people around me I
should just tell you a little bit more
about where we are actually this is the
the center of ashalon at a shopping
center that at this time it's just after
5:00 on a on a Tuesday here in Israel it
would be really really busy uh one of
our local producers the words he used
were um you wouldn't be able to breathe
in this place at this time on a normal
weekday it would be wall to wall it
would be packed with people uh who just
finished work um who were out for the
the evening uh but instead all of the
shops up there are shut there are still
you can see people drifting down this is
basically an underground shelter and
it's Robbie if you wouldn't mind just um
around here um they're all really well
marked so if you come into one of these
areas uh you know where you have to go
so we were just out 5:00 when the sirens
started uh we came down the stairwell
there's a a shelter right underground
there you can see I'm just going to take
to this corner and you can just sort of
see up the stairs because remember
people who live uh in these areas they
are used to Rocket attacks coming from
Gaza this is not something that they
they haven't experienced before um I
wouldn't say they were relaxed about it
but you know they they've they've done
this many many times um so they come
into a place of safety when they get
underground you can see them starting to
move out again so well right here
because we are so very close to the uh
the perimeter the perimeter fence from
Gaza this is something this is an area
that is within reach for Hamas Rockets
essentially so what they do is they they
send them right around this area of
Southern Israel uh and they put out the
alasan brigades that the military wing
of Hamas put out this warning earlier
today asking people in ashalon to leave
by 1700 local time and as I was just
explaining to you at 1700 uh we were
just outside the sirens started straight
away 10 minutes or so ago we've had the
sirens twice but I just want to show you
we lost the signal a little bit cuz we
were obviously downstairs in that
shelter uh with the very thick walls but
look this would normally be so busy on
uh on a Tuesday afternoon the shops are
all shut there's nobody here I'm just
going to take you outside uh so you can
see just how quiet this place is right
now um a lot of people are choosing to
to stay at home some have left all
together um but a lot of people are
choosing to stay stay at home stay
indoors stay places where there are
shelters where they know they can be
safe but look it just gives you an idea
Matthew if you look around here you know
it should be a car park packed with cars
it's a a beautiful sunny evening here in
ashalon less than 10 kmers from Gaza um
but people here they are indoors they're
in shelters they're doing what they can
to stay safe Hann of Hoster in ashalon
the Israeli military have taken
journalist to a kabut today where
soldiers have been removing the bodies
of people killed by Hamas including
babies and children just a warning we're
about to show some distressing images
from that area a small community has
been destroyed with bodies strewn across
the area troops were unable to remove
the victims until now because of the
fighting and the need to disable booby
traps Israeli combat soldiers are still
deployed in the fields around that
kibuts our International editor Jeremy
Bowen is there and sent this
update these are combat troops from
elite units and there is a high state of
Readiness here you can feel it the
confusion in the the Israeli Army that
followed the initial Hamas attack has
gone now as they've come in and regained
control of these border
areas it was tough enough for the
Israelis to come in to recapture this
area these small border communities it
is a different order of military
challenge to cross the wire to get into
Gaza potentially to fight house to house
at a time when Hamas will have made its
plans and we be
waiting well we gone straight to these
live pictures from Gaza because as the
light has dimmed that is the scene and
we've seen this now for 4 days these
strikes in retaliation from Israel
lighting up the sky some strikes there
Israel says on Hamas positions but we
know from the Palestinian authorities
that over 800 100 people have now been
confirmed dead in that area let's bring
in Lee duet who's there for us in
Jerusalem as we stay with these pictures
day four of this and absolutely no letup
lease in terms of the Israeli
response Israeli response and uh Hamas
response it it was extraordinary that we
heard at about 3:30 local time that they
were going to attack uh the area of
ashalon in retaliation for Israeli
bombardment of Gaza and right right on
time local time 5:00 there was a rain of
rockets into ashalon you were reporting
them earlier in the program and now
comes Israel's retaliation last night
was reported as the night of the most
intense aerial bombardment of Gaza and
now as as the night draws in it looks
looks like it will be another night the
same last night Israel said it hit
2,400 Hamas targets uh we know that they
have said prime minister Netanyahu has
said they will hit everything to do with
Hamas they want to to Tred to degrade or
destroy all of their in infrastructure
we our our viewers will have seen the
comments by our reporter in Gaza rushi
Abu Alo he's been there for 20 years
reporting from which means that he's
reported on a lot of wars and he said
last night was the most frightening
night that he and his family the
families who living in their building
had ever lived through yes it was a
really graphic account he gave uh on the
BBC a little early he even filmed when
he got outside some of the damage in
Gaza he described it at one stage as
looking like an earthquake had struck
now the Prime Minister said uh around
this time yesterday it was only the
beginning in terms of options for the
Israelis what is still available to
them a lot is available to them we heard
from the Prime Minister prime minister
Benjamin atyu last night warning that
Israel's air strikes that we've been
discussing that our viewers have been
seeing in the live shots from Gaza was
only the beginning of a war he said
Israel was now engaging nothing less he
said than to ensure Ure Israel's
survival as we've been reporting most of
that military activity over the past few
days has centered around ashalon around
the southern border where it's given
that the Israelis say they have
recovered so far
1,500 bodies of Hamas Fighters those who
managed to penetrate what was always
regarded as an impenetrable fence with
so many uh you know high-tech sensors
drones te- walls watch Towers meant to
keep Hamas away from firing Rockets from
entering and of course Hamas was able to
overcome all of that we heard from
Israel earlier today they believe they
have secured that border with the Gaza
Strip although they admit it there may
still be ways for Hamas fighters to
penetrate but once they feel they have
that area under control and they will
intensify the bombardment try to to
diminish hamas's cap capabilities in the
Gaza Strip while all the while preparing
for what is widely expected to be highly
dangerous um highly risky but what
Israel now believes is highly necessary
a ground incursion of the kind they
haven't undertaken since they pulled out
their troops from Gaza in 2005 briefly
at least because we've been hearing from
some of the families about loved ones
taken hostage how much real pressure is
growing on benj Netanyahu in terms of
trying to get those citizens
back huge pressure Israel always regards
it as absolutely vital to bring every
Israeli home they negotiated for five
years to get one Israeli soldier gilad
Shalit uh out of Hamas hands this time
the situation is different because of
hamas's assault on Israel and so many
lives lost that may change the Dynamics
a bit but they'll do everything possible
but it is a process fraught with risk",20231010

Dd8nJBAf2WU,How did Israeli intelligence fail to stop Hamas's major attack from Gaza? - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\How did Israeli intelligence fail to stop Hamas's major attack from Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"I want to talk to you a little bit about
what's happening in the United States
because the US defense department has
described this weekend's actions by
Hamas as quote ISIS level savagery in a
briefing to reporters a senior defense
official added that the US is working to
expedite Israel's requests for more
Munitions and air defense the official
added that quote planes have already
taken off to deliver some of the support
requested additionally the USS Ford
strike group is expected to arrive in
the area very soon with capabilities
ranging from intelligence gathering to
long range strikes that includes the
carrier and accompanying Cruisers and
destroyers the defense department is
also working with Israel and other
partners to contain the conflict in Gaza
well us officials also say they have not
seen coroporation of Iran being directly
involved in the planning of Saturday's
attack and if you remember just in the
last hour or so the Iranian supreme
leader um aah Ki has said that Iran did
not have any involvement in that attack
but that he kissed the hands of those
who did how did Israeli intelligence
Services seemingly failed to detect
Saturday's attack by Hamas well retired
US Army Lieutenant General Mark Schwarz
served as the US security coordinator
for Israel and the Palestinian Authority
until 2021 he spoke to us about the
serious failure of intelligence I think
uh what the assessment is now after 72
hours post attack um the level of
discipline that Hamas exercised in
staying off of technical Communications
uh to plan this uh operation this raid
that they actually conducted incursion
into Israel and the terrorist acts
followed I think that was the the key is
that they you know they're they're an
enemy and a terrorist organization that
learns not only from other terrorist
organizations in uh you know in the
region but also from their own EXP
experiences and they knew that by
communicating and planning using any
type of technical means those the
operation would have gotten compromised
so I think that's in my assessment based
on what I've heard in open source
reporting that that's the most likely
way that they were able to successfully
pulled this
off",20231010

for your questions answered over the
next 15 minutes we'll be answering
questions that you've sent in about the
Israel Hamas conflict which has now
entered its fourth day well this drone
video shows the scale of Destruction
reaped across the Gaza Strip over the
past few days Israel's Army claims to
have hit a further 200 Hass Targets in
overnight bombing Israel has ordered a
total blockade of Gaza cutting off food
water and supplies the UN Human Rights
Chief says The Siege is illegal under
international law while the World Health
Organization is calling for the
establishment of a humanitarian
Corridor well to answer your questions
I'm joined now by the BBC's Middle East
analyst Sebastian Asher and joining us
from Jerusalem as BBC correspondent
formerly based in Gaza John donison
hello to you both and thank you to you
both for joining us today Sebastian let
me start with you we have a question
from alimu jalo in Guinea and they say
why is the United States supporting
Israel with all the killing done in Gaza
it's a very understandable question it's
one that many people ask uh from all
around the world and I mean I think in
this particular instance at the moment
the US is certainly not alone in this
because of what Hamas has done because
of the atrocities that have been carried
out at the moment it's being uh seen by
most governments certainly most western
governments to be honest a lot of Arab
governments and so on around the world
as a terrorist act that will change
almost inevitably as The Siege on Gaza
grows but a wider context of that is the
US has essentially yes it it gives uh
huge financial support to Israel it
gives almost 4 billion dollars most of
that goes in military hardware most of
which comes from us companies it vetos
motions resolutions at the UN Security
Council which criticize Israel now the
US itself as government's
change essentially has stayed pretty
much the same position it sees itself
and it tries to present itself as an
evenhanded mediator in the conflict and
essentially adhering to the idea that a
two-state solution is what is needed
under President trump it changed
slightly but with President Biden it's
gone back to that but from the
Palestinian perspective they believe
that that just isn't the case but it
isn't evenhanded uh that it is
essentially so closely allied with
Israel not just in terms of the support
that it gives but also I mean in a
political sense I mean the us as a
democracy sees and I think most American
citizens see Israel as a the only
functioning democracy similar to the US
in the Middle East they see it as a
Force for good for that reason of course
there's a large Jewish population as
well uh in the US which has a big say in
elections and very few politicians want
to say anything that that goes against
what they have to say so I I mean I
think that the US has to some extent um
tried hard to get a solution to the
conflict there have been several incid I
mean back in 2003 was was the closest
for its come to the two-state solution
talks have stalled but there is this
sense and I think it's a very
understandable sense not just from the
Palestinians but but more widely that
its its finger is far more weighted
towards the Israeli side and the
Palestinian side despite the fact that
it will condemn some of Israel does and
most recently with the current far right
relatively far right Israeli government
under under under uh Benjamin Netanyahu
there's been some of the strongest
criticism so far from the US of an
Israeli government but at the moment
that is all in abeyance at the moment
the US would be 100% behind Israel
Sebastian thanks for that John let me
ask you a question put to us from Carol
Fenton and she says what will it take
for Hamas to stop trying to annihilate
the whole of Israel what compromise uh
would be enough how can peace be
achieved without Mutual understanding
and respect for both
sides I don't think it can and I think
that's why uh there has been this
intractable conflict now for decades and
decades and I think Gaza is important
because until some sort of uh compromise
as you say can be reached with heras in
Gaza you are never going to have peace
in the Middle East and I I think at some
points over the last decades when there
continues to be this talk from Western
countries the United States Britain the
EU uh of the the the goal being a
two-state
solution uh but Hamas because so many
countries regard Hamas as a terrorist
organization who they're not prepared to
talk to not part of the discussions it
was always fanciful really to think that
there could be a two-state solution
until Hamas were part of that deal and
they have not really suggested uh that
they were ready to accept the existence
of Israel uh as a state alongside a
possible future Palestinian State uh
that's been new nuanced at times over
the years but essentially Hamas says it
wants uh the land uh between the River
Jordan and the Sea so all of what was
historically Palestine it's interesting
what John said there Sebastian I want to
ask you about this I've had a lot of
emails about this from people the
terrorist organization Hamas why is it
that news organizations like the BBC
like ITV like sky like a number of other
organizations do not use the term
terrorists when describing Hamas
militants I think it's uh I mean there
are a number of reasons I think one of
the reasons is that when you are
broadcasting to a world audience uh you
want your perceptions the way that you
are are are are are are dealing with the
story not to look as if you are taking
any particular side and calling a group
a terrorist group will always look that
way and people will always be demanding
for this cause or that cause that it's
called terrorist or that is not called
terrorist so I so I think the BBC feels
that the best way that it can maintain a
sense of of of of some form of
objectivity of not looking partial is to
do that I think it becomes difficult ult
when there are acts atrocities that are
carried out I mean I think the way that
is often found around that by
organizations like the BBC is to speak
of Acts of Terror or to have the voices
of people who are denouncing it as
terrorism but not itself using that term
but yes it comes under criticism I'm
sure you and I John as well I mean we
have these discussions both
professionally but also personally you
know a great deal of the time and from
the Palestinian perspective I I mean
again uh many Palestinians just would I
mean I mean they would feel I think if
we described Hamas as a terrorist group
they would feel that that was in a sense
a kind of total rebirth to them I mean
they see it as a resistance movement and
they would see I think it as being like
the us but we no longer being
even-handed if if we took that let me
ask you another question Sebastian this
is from maragold Robbins in France and
maragold says the US and Europe defend
Ukraine why are they not defending uh
Palestine well I I mean there's more
Nuance to that question isn't there I
mean without getting deeply into Ukraine
I mean Ukraine was a situation that
suddenly erupted what we're talking
about and what John was talking about
there is a situation between Israel and
P but has been going on for decades and
it has you know it has shifted in its
balance time and time again Ukraine you
know was was was at least at the start
almost clearly from most perspectives an
invasion by Russia that Ukraine was
resisting and I think that Clarity at
that moment made it simpler for
governments to respond in that way
whereas the issue between the
Palestinians and the Israelis is one
which is so embedded in so many
different phases that it's harder for
governments to come out with such a
black and white position but I mean you
can't gainsay the fact that the European
Union that the UK the US I mean all of
these countries to provide financial
support to the Palestinians and have
done I mean the US has been though again
it blows hot and cold has been one of
the main supporters financially of the
UN a agencies which essentially keep the
Palestinians going as much as uh that is
achieved both in in Gaza and in occupied
West Bank so I mean I think with all of
these things Ian it's a very boring
answer but there is you know a great
deal of nuance to this and I think we as
journalists have to try and stay with
that as much as possible rather than
just going with the main thrust of a
story at one particular moment and try
and stay as true to that as possible and
try to make you know an audience uh uh
care about that aspect of a story rather
than just immediately go one side or the
other I don't know what John thinks
about
that well it's interesting I mean I uh
covered uh two short Wars in Gaza when I
was based there in 2012 and then I came
back in 2014 and one of the things that
struck me was um for example the United
States provides a lot of the military
support to Israel that causes so much of
the destruction in
Gaza uh and at the same time you know uh
a lot of the EU Britain France Etc
offers a lot of support to Israel in
dealing with Hamas in Gaza but then it
is also those same countries who uh
support Israel who are then having to
pay time and time again for the Recon
Construction in Gaza and it was a
really depressing situation I suppose
that what there was a sort of pattern of
every two three years there is another
war in Gaza and things will get rebuilt
and then things will get destroyed again
and I think what Israel has said this
time is
they they want to well both sides
actually Hamas has said they want an end
to the status quo they want to change
the dynamic and I think Israel now in
its retaliation feels that it wants to
do the same and change that status quo
in its Favor John thanks for that
Sebastian we had another question here
from Damen Armstrong and Staffordshire
uh saying why is financing to military
aid required and needed by Israel a
relatively rich country against the
Palestinians well I mean it's not simply
against the Palestinians I mean the the
the military support that's given to
Israel is meant to defend it against all
potential threats I mean from an Israeli
perspective we've heard from the prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu for years
and years but he sees Iran as the major
threat uh and that's a view that is
shared not just by the US and much of
the west but also increasingly by a lot
of Arab countries but it's a very valid
question and it's actually a question
that has been raised within Israel uh
quite regularly that it's almost I mean
it's different voices obviously uh that
that that that and for different reasons
and perhaps for their own you know
political motivations but bring up this
in a sense you know why should Israel be
beholden it it's it's a rich country
essentially it's a country that that you
know that is that is extremely developed
why does it need $3.8 billion from the
US um and does that make it you know
just a satellite of the US and I think
that that is an issue uh that at the
moment again will be put in a bance a
bit because we're seeing the US actually
offering more Military Support to Israel
in this particular situation and also
they're bringing warships to the region
so again I mean these issues which
really need to be looked at you know
very very seriously and with a Long
View made which actually affect the
long-term future in terms of support for
Israel the billions of dollars I mean
there's lots of criticism inside the US
why are we sending almost $4 billion to
a country that's that's rich when we
have huge problems in the US that need
to be addressed but that you know
several billion dollars of that could
surely be more usefully uh spent in the
US let's take you very briefly both of
you to live pictures uh coming into us
uh from Gaza and I just want to update
people on what the latest lines are
before we move on uh we of course have
had the uh Israeli forces saying that
they have targeted 200 Hamas targets
overnight and they are continuing to
Target Hamas targets through the day our
correspondent on the ground rushi
describing it as Like An Earthquake the
Damage Done uh by these bombs and air
missiles being thrown from Israel this
is the scene live in Gaza for those of
you watching
now Sebastian let me ask you uh another
question from a viewer this is an
anonymous viewer and they say I'm an
avid viewer of BBC News Channel I like
many others are concerned about the war
Hamas has engaged on Israel um my
question is although Hamas instigated
this war against Israel by breaching its
borders is it fair or could it even be a
war crime that Israel has stopped food
medicines and fuel getting into Gaza and
that is an anonymous question
well this is a story actually that we've
been dealing with just now the uh un uh
human rights Chief urk has just issued a
statement in the past hour saying that
to uh have a Siege like this of a
civilian population is against
international law it's a breach of
international La he hasn't quite put it
as um a war crime um but it I mean
saying very very strongly uh that this
is something that is not acceptable
under international law and you know I
mean the rhetoric we're hearing from
Israel and I mean John obviously is very
much across that as well is so
much against that at the moment I mean
it's so strong I mean you're hearing
both from politicians and the people
that they want there's an appetite for
this total Destruction of Gaza so in
that context I mean this sense that a
Siege of Gaza this denial of food this
denial of water and remember it's
already under blockade has been under
blockade for 17 years there's already
huge I mean the water situation is is
absolutely dire in in Gaza the
electricity situation all of these are
already sufficiently bad for Gaza to
have been described you know as one of
the poorest uh uh uh uh places in the
world one of the places where the
conditions of Life are pretty much at
their worst so what is really happening
with Israel is it's just tightening that
squeeze rather than bringing a Siege
from nowhere um but the way things are
at the moment the dynamic we're looking
at doesn't look like these sorts of
warnings from internation Community from
the UN are going to be heeded by Israel
certainly not now generally again John
can can can follow this that there has
been this recurring pattern where Israel
hits Gaza hard and then after several
weeks sometimes months the international
you know outrage over the numbers of
civilians who are being killed reaches
such a point that Israel feels that it
has to end it's it's it's it's it uh uh
to end its operation I think under these
conditions after what's happened on
Saturday in the last couple of days I
think we we aren't necessarily expecting
that to happen anytime soon John what's
your take on it having spent obviously a
good amount of time in Gaza what kind of
an impact is this total blockade
having well one thing I would say just
adding to what Sebastian was saying
there is um you know this is on a
completely different magnitude of the
wars the escalations in violence that
we've seen in the past I was just
looking back in 2009 there were 13
Israelis killed in that short war in
2012 I think it was six Israelis here
we're talking more than 900 and
potentially up to 150 hostages taken so
Israel is feeling it has the right
frankly to do whatever it wants and I
don't think it's going to listen uh to
the UN humans right Chief I don't think
it's going to listen to UNICEF I think
it feels that it will have the backing
of its public to do everything it wants
I mean okay you go to the um the
blockade which as Sebastian says has
been in place in some form uh from
Israel and also Egypt to the South for
17 years and certainly when I was there
and the last time I was kind of
regularly going into Gaza was in 2013 it
was bad um at period there were periods
when I was living there where virtually
half the food you were getting coming
into Gaza was coming through tunnels you
know you'd open a can of Coke and it was
covered with dust on the top coming in
from tunnels uh from Egypt at times uh
those restrictions have eased and Israel
has let more stuff in uh and uh more
exports out but the the big thing I
think that is
important is that about half of gaza's
population is under 18 it's a very very
young population and there are many many
people in Gaza who have never left you
know so they've never met an Israeli so
there's no interaction between the two
sides no understanding of the other
point the other side's perspective and I
think that is what is really really
difficult to overcome John donison in
Jerusalem thank you so much for
answering questions today Sebastian aser
in London with me thank you both of you
for answering viewers questions today
and as always thank you the viewer uh
who've been sending these questions to
us we'll leave you with these live

Netanyahu has warned that his country
will use enormous Force against Hamas as

control over the Gaza border after Hamas

also said it has found the bodies of
1500 Hamas

Hamas is now threatening to start
killing hostages if Israel carries out
more strikes without warning let's get
an update now from our International
editor Jeremy

if Palestinians are feeling the full
force of Israeli military power Israel
says Hamas is responsible for the
suffering of gaza's civilians

attacks has only just begun Hamas has

border when a salvo came
in ashalon is so close to Gaza that
there is no more than a 10-second

offensive against Hamas looks certain to
be a ground offensive much bigger than

on his mission

friends that got injured or
killed Israel's prime minister Benjamin

Nation he said Hamas has made a mistake
of historic
proportions we will he said exact a
price that will be remembered by them
and Israel's other enemies for
decades and now Israelis are waiting for
their government and army to act stot
the Israeli Town closest to Gaza
littered with the debris of War felt
like the essence of Israel's trauma
almost deserted except for security
forces Hamas has rocketed stat for years
but never before stormed in at the
center of the Hamas killing ground was
the police station they broke in and
used it as a Firebase to shoot civilians
as well as
soldiers blood from Israel's dead and
wounded smears the
walls even here in what is always a
Frontline town for Israelis this was not
supposed to happen they expected their
military backed up by the intelligence
services to protect them and the fact
that that didn't happen means that
recriminations but who might be
responsible have already started but at
the same time there is a strong sense of
national Unity with the country under
attack about what happens next in the
places that Hamas attacked Israeli
military as well as the few civilians
left are jumpy still shocked a ground
defensive didn't feel
imminent and in Gaza a few miles away
casualties come into the main hospital
the first few hundred of many more it
will get worse Palestinians and Israelis
once more caught on the Anvil of war in
a conflict a century old that is as
deadly as it's ever been Jeremy bow BBC
News well the Israeli city of ashalon
has come under heavy fire from Hamas
over recent days and our correspondent
Anna Foster is there for us this morning
Anna we've had an update in the last
hour or so from the Israeli military
haven't we what are they
saying
that's right Jo one of their main
focuses was really talking about what
they've do to to done to try and secure
this area these Southern Israeli border
communities that were infiltrated and
attacked in the early hours of Saturday
morning what they have said is that they
are pretty sure that they have now
secured these areas once again they
can't say 100% they know that they have
managed to block the holes in the fence
that Hamas militants broke through with
diggers and bulldozers and used to
actually come in they know that the
fence itself is secure but what they
can't say is whether or not there are
any Still Still any Hamas militants who
are actually on this side already who
are perhaps hiding out uh they say it is
a possibility and it's something that
they are continuing to review continuing
to review the security of I mean you can
even see this morning the the military
vehicles coming by it shows you the
amount of presence that they have in
this area there are also still things
like tunnels that need to be taken into
consideration there are tunnels that
exist between Gaza and these Southern
Israeli border communities they are much
harder for the military to find and
locate because they're underground
they're very difficult to detect so I
think that is why there is still just
that that small caveat that small note
of caution from the Israeli military
that they have managed to mainly secure
this area but they can't say for sure
they say they found the bodies of 1 and
a half thousand Hamas militants in this
area and they've also updated us as well
about the ongoing air strikes on Gaza
200 different sites they say uh were
struck overnight as they attempt to try
and degrade hamas's capability and send
that very strong warning that you were
talking about that Israel will not
tolerate the kind of violence that was
seen here on Saturday and we've seen
pictures of the Israeli military
Gathering a talk of a potential ground
offensive going into Gaza what does that
mean for the mood of people there in
Israel where you are trying to get on
with their with their
lives that's right I mean at the moment
it it feels almost impossible for people
here to try and maintain some kind of
ordinary life and and I should say that
that is that is in communities like this
one who are used to regular missile
attacks from from Gaza many people who
live in these areas they know where the
safe areas are they have bomb shelters
many of them or they'll go and and hide
in in doorways or stairwells even
children at school kindergart and
children out they know what to do when
the sirens go off so these are people
who are used to this kind of thing
happening but but the size and the scale
of what we've seen in the last few days
this almost constant bombardment of
missiles that have been coming in from
Gaza means that a lot of people have
chosen if they can to move further away
to take their families at almost out of
range if it's possible I mean we
certainly moving around yesterday three
times had to go into bomb shelters
because missiles Rockets coming from
Gaza were so close to hitting us and in
terms John of that that ground offensive
that you were talking about this is
something that Israel are considering
right now but to actually put Israeli
troops into Gaza is enormously difficult
it's very densely packed uh there is a
huge civilian population there as well
and there are Israeli hostages being
held in Gaza so we've seen military
hardware I can actually hear tanks
moving just away to my left we've seen a
lot of the military hardware gathering
in this area here but I think Israel is
still considering very carefully what
its next move will be and when it will
start to implement that okay Anna Foster
live for breakfast in Israel thank you
for
that meanwhile meanwhile Israel has
carried out air strikes on Gaza
throughout the night with military
claiming to have hit 200 targets there
are worries that the Gaza Strip could
now be on the brink of a new
humanitarian crisis if supplies are not
allowed in well earlier on breakfast a
Palestinian Aid worker described a
situation faced by many civilians there
what colleagues are saying what my
family is saying in Gaza is that it's
never been this bad um they have lived
through almost six escalations and they
live under blockade there's really
nowhere to flee in Gaza
um very few already are crammed in very
few shelters there's no money to go
through Egypt and and crossings allowing
materials to Israel have been closed um
it's being bombarded from the air from
the land from the sea and really it's
deja vu for gazin and you know we we
need to ensure that this ends once and
for all and everybody's
exhausted I think we can show you uh
live pictures now uh from Gaza uh which
is where uh the is Air Force have said
in a statement just a short time ago
that 200 targets have been hit overnight
that's across the Gaza Strip now that's
Gaza City you're looking at at the
moment you can see smoke Rising there
from from some areas we just heard from
Oxfam talking about the problems of of
trying to get medication and food and
water in there and they're worried that
it's only going to become more of a
challenge in the hours and days ahead at
UNICEF calling this warning for a
humanitarian Corridor in and out of Gaza
uh as those supplies are cut but uh
clearly the situation there tents on the
ground on both sides of the Border as
Anna was explaining to us uh as we wait
to find out what Israel will do next in
retaliation to those attacks by Hamas
militants within Israel on
Saturday",20231010

far it seems a little bit quieter and
also I'm not hearing the same level of
explosions coming from Gaza as during
the hours of daylight but
I don't think they will have at all a
quiet night I think on this side
Israelis they're waiting to see what
their government does next it feels
almost like a a lull though back near
Gaza troops are jumpy certainly pointing
their weapons at our cars as we
approached uh their checkpoints because
they are still concerned there could be
Hamas people on the loose and in Gaza I
think there must be an immense sense of
trepidation among civilians and as for
Hamas well they must have expected a
response like this to the enormity of
what they did so perhaps they are
prepared who knows",20231009
7sHxRcebDzM,How the Hamas attack on the Supernova festival in Israel unfolded - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\How the Hamas attack on the Supernova festival in Israel unfolded - BBC News.jpg,"looking in closer detail at the shocking
events of early on Saturday morning you
can see people dancing at the Nova music
festival with no inkling of the horror
that's about to unfold BBC verifi has
established that this was taken at
sunrise on
Saturday and it's all happening just
very very close to the border between
Israel and Gaza the first sign that
anything was wrong came around 7 in the
morning and if we look at that video
again you can see that there's a man who
is looking up into the sky he's seen
something now we don't know exactly what
he's looking at but there are
suggestions it could be small explosions
from Israeli air defenses trying to
neutralize a barrage of incoming rocket
fire then we have this it was posted at
9:30 in the morning local time and it
seems to show security at the event
trying to get people to leave as quickly
as
possible and then here you get a sense
of the panic the fear the urgency as
people Flee for their lives through the
fields next I want to show you some
distressing footage from the dash cam of
a car parked at the edge of the festival
site we know it's filmed just before
9:00 in the morning and you see this
gunman taking a young man who appears to
have been wounded goes on to show a man
Sheltering under the car and you see him
being shot and then there's another
video apparently taken by Palestinians
who are either part of the attack
accompanying the attackers and it's come
to encapsulate the absolute Terror of
what happened so she's Noah agamani
she's 25 years old she'd been at the
festival and she is pleading for her
life as she's kidnapped along with her
boyfriend the reuter's news agency spoke
to her friend Amit who'd been messaging
her until just before she was
terrorized that's I don't think everyone
ever has felt such Terror and
such helplessness when you're you you're
taken away from your boyfriend from your
loved ones to to some place unknown with
terrorists and I can't I can't imagine
what she's going through right now
traveling with those terrorists in
Gaza waiting for someone to to send help
we don't yet know exactly how many
people were kidnapped from the festival
or killed but this is Dr footage and you
can imagine looking forward to a weekend
of music and dancing never in their
worst nightmares imagining what was to
come Caroline Hy let me take you back to
the live pictures because uh as has been
the case throughout the course of
today's program we have seen so many
explosions there in Gaza even since the
start of this program in the last two
and a half hours but that has been the
continued pattern through the course of
today with Israel continuing to Target
various sites in the Gaza Strip their
military action against a whole variety
of Hamas targets and of course that
alongside the cutting off of the Gaza
Strip that announcement from the defense
minister a little earlier that the whole
of the Gaza Strip would be cut off no
food no power no water so uh that just
part of what Israel implementing in the
wake of those Dreadful scenes through
the course of the weekend well",20231009
-rBGgIaO69c,What's happening in Israel and why now? - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\What's happening in Israel and why now - BBC News.jpg,"this conflict is extremely complicated
and it's difficult to explain to people
exactly what is happening let's uh cross
live now to someone who I think can help
with all the questions that people have
been searching for online and indeed
sending us here at the BBC our Middle
East editor Sebastian Usher is in The
Newsroom very very very very ready as
always to help with uh questions
Sebastian and I suppose that the first
question that we need to ask you is why
is this happening at this moment in
time well I mean there are quite
regularly eruptions in the conflict
specifically between Hamas which
controls Gaza and Israel the last one we
saw was back in 2021 the last really big
uh uh uh confrontation was in 2014 but
there have been a number of wars that
have taken place uh since Hamas took
control of Gaza in 2007 and and Israel
uh imposed a blockade which has held
ever since so those tensions are always
there in the past we have usually seen
uh the conflict although it's had
terrible consequences in the numbers of
people killed particularly in Gaza from
the air strikes that uh Israel launches
in response to Rockets being fired by
Hamas uh but that it it it's been within
a certain kind of lines that both sides
seem to accept that they don't cross in
order to take it into you know Uncharted
Territory what we've seen this time is
that those lines have been crossed those
lines were crossed essentially when
Hamas uh Fighters infiltrated into
Israel and caused I mean the worst uh uh
incident uh for Israel pretty much since
its Inception with hundreds I mean at
the moment we're saying at least 700
Israelis having been killed so that is
the real huge game changer here that is
why this is such a serious situation but
those pressures those tensions as I say
they don't just exist in Gaza as far as
the Palestinians are concerned but in
the occupied West Bank where we've also
seen a major rise in tensions in almost
daily clashes between uh is uh uh the
Israeli military which mounts regular
raids into uh the main towns in the
occupied West Bank and they're met often
with Palestinian fighters who who who
fire back who throw rocks uh EXP exp of
devices uh we've seen several hundred
Palestinians many of them Fighters but
some of them civilians killed over the
past year and a half and that so this
hasn't come out of nowhere but the
surprise is the way that Hamas executed
its attack on Israel Sebastian many
people uh have been searching this
particular question and and it is is
Palestine is Gaza an actual
country it it it's not officially
formally a country as such I mean Gaza
is part of a Palestinian territor as as
I was just saying there's there's Gaza
there's the there's the occupied West
Bank and there's East Jerusalem and it
and its surroundings which is seen as
part of the Palestinian territories um
the the the the Palestinian Authority
the PLO which uh is essentially the
original uh real driving force of
Palestinian stat ship declared that it
was a state many decades ago and some
countries have accepted Palestine as
state but uh there are a number of
others who haven't the us being perhaps
the main one um so what it has at the
moment is that the UN it has uh uh
Observer status non-member Observer
status which is essentially close to
being uh accepted as a state but not a
state and we still talk about uh the
peace process that has been going on for
years but it's been stalled for a long
time now the main objective through much
of that was to create a Palestinian
State the so-called two-state um
solution to the Israeli Palestinian
conflict another question many people
have been asking Sebastian is does Hamas
represent uh
Palestine no it doesn't represent
Palestine I mean it is one of the two
main factions as I say it has controlled
Gaza since 2007 holy uh uh um controlled
Gaza since then it won the last
elections in the Palestinian territories
in 2006 it then fought a battle with
fata which is the party uh that
essentially runs uh uh the occupied West
Bank and it drove them out so it's been
in control since then it's an islamist
organization it's ideology originally
comes from a Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
so I mean Palestines themselves uh many
of them are not Muslims they are
Christians there are face there as well
so it certainly doesn't represent the
entirety of the Palestinians by any
means it does represent for a number of
Palestinians not just the islamist uh
ideology which some support but also the
sense of resistance to Israel seen as
the most actively uh uh um the most
active in that resistance as we're
seeing once again here the pales
authority the PLO fata have moved
towards in in the past three decades to
essentially accepting Israel's right to
exist and no longer confronting it
militarily h has never changed uh from
its military stance towards Israel that
it sees Israel as its enemy and it will
fight Israel as we've seen regularly uh
this being the most extreme example of
the of the uh uh that we've seen so far
Sebastian another question that is one
of the most searched on the Internet is
who are the Palestinians can you explain
that with to us given obviously there a
very long history So within the time
frame obviously yes no there is a long
history I mean the word Palestine dates
back I mean at least 2,000 years it was
used in Roman times it was adopted uh in
the early days of Islam uh it was Arab
sized there was um a
Palestine existing uh
as I mean again we can't say as a state
but as a region for a very long time and
people identifying as Palestinians for a
very long time the Mandate that existed
under the British uh that came before
Israel was established at its dependence
in 1948 1949 was known as Palestine so I
mean Palestine is very much an accepted
uh way of referring to that region but
there are many problems with that it you
know in terms of uh how large a part of
that region is seen as Palestine who it
should belong to uh these
counternarratives that there are I mean
many uh
Israelis would go back further they
would go back to the biblical
denomination of many of those areas
talking of Judea and Samaria and other
words like that so I mean though
historically it is a fact and there's no
question about uh the sense of there
being a Palestine and there being a
Palestinian people the actual way in
which that's interpreted is still open
to question and depending on what
perspective people are looking at from s
Main's you know a very live debate but
certainly for the Palestinians who
identifies as pales opinions and that's
not just in the palestin territories but
beyond the the the huge diaspora both in
the w g camps that spread across parts
of the Middle East but well beyond that
they obviously naturally 100% see
themselves a Palestinians even if there
is no formal Palestinian State as such
at the moment and Sebastian finally one
of the biggest uh or the most asked
questions online is who backs
Hamas well I mean financially one of its
main supporters has been uh Qatar but
Qatar would make a distinction between
supporting the people of Gaza uh who
obviously have faced immense problems
economically uh it's one of the poorest
areas in the world um they would say
that the money that they give through
Hamas because Hamas controls Gaza is for
the people that it doesn't support
necessarily the political uh uh um
agenda of Hamas it doesn't support what
Hamas is doing now necessarily it does
believe in um the Palestinian bid for
its own State uh for its own identity it
supports that 100% it does believe that
the Palestinians face huge problems much
of them they believe uh resulting from
Israel and its occupation but it would
not say that it directly supports Hamas
as an entity you have other countries
such as Iran which do openly support
Hamas and what it's trying to achieve
and and we've seen since this assault uh
happened that Iran has very openly come
out and shown its backing and said that
it uh uh believes that Israel is
essentially reaping the wind uh that it
swn so and and also in in military terms
in the past maybe not so much now but a
lot of the hardware a lot of the
missiles that uh G that that Hamas was
somehow able to get despite the blockade
around uh uh Gaza were Ian made in more
recent years they've been able to
manufacture many of those themselves
within Gaza Syria again the the so-call
AIS of resistance and then other
non-state players particularly hasbullah
for example in Lebanon which did make a
gesture um by firing some mortars
towards Israel uh in in in uh on on the
second day of this assault but hasn't so
far committed itself beyond that Lebanon
as a country supports again the right of
the Palestinians to resist to defend
themselves but the government such as it
is in Lebanon wouldn't go all out in
support of Hamas so there are backers um
but it's not hugely widespread I would
say the most important would be Iran and
cata financially at
least Sebastian thank you very much
indeed Sebastian Asha there giving a
full explanation to all of those
questions that you have been uh
searching for online",20231009

VZ4ruk3KO48,Israel-Gaza conflict: What is Hamas? - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Israel-Gaza conflict What is Hamas - BBC News.jpg,"let's start with the islamist militant
group that carried out this attack who
are Hamas well its name is an Arabic
acronym for Islamic resistance movement
it's sworn to Israel's destruction and
its base is Gaza it's been in control
there since 2007 though as it's not held
an election since it's hard to gauge
what support it has and this weekend
President Biden called Hamas a terrorist
organization in fact the EU the UK and
the us all categorize it this way in the
region Iran is hamas's primary backer
indeed Hamas has told the BBC Iran gave
direct backing for this weekend's attack
Hamas also has close relations with the
militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon
which shares a border with Israel and
Israel knows all of this and more about
Hamas which leads us to the next
question why didn't Israeli intelligence
know about the attack the analyst Colin
Clark describes how Israel has
worldclass Intelligence collection and
Analysis capabilities that includes
using informers in Gaza and surveillance
drones above it in the words of one
former US counterterrorism specialist
it's almost inconceivable how they
missed this but they did and working out
why is now a matter of urgency our next
question is whether this is different to
previous escalations serious violent
escalations between Israel and the
Palestinians are not uncommon but the
scale of this ham attack makes it
different Israeli territory was
infiltrated hundreds of Israelis have
died as many as a hundred hostages were
taken Saturday was one of the deadliest
days in Israel's history the un's Middle
East peace Envoy says this is a
dangerous precipice and I appeal to all
to pull back from the brink this is
different and the scale of the attack
leads us to how is Israel responding

security forces in southern Israel have
moved to a war footing to combat a
surprise attack by the Palestinian
militant group Hamas the biggest in
recent years thousands of rockets have
been launched into Israel from Gaza and
dozens of militants appear to have
entered Southern Israel here's what we
know so far the rocket attacks have
struck Tel Aviv and areas that surround
Gaza air raid siren
have also sounded in several other towns
at least one person is reported to have
been killed so far the town of ashalon
has seen major explosions details of
Palestinian incursions are unclear but
gunmen have been reported in towns near
the Gaza border and Israel have been
sorry Israel have Israelis have been
warned to stay inside Hammer military
commander Muhammad de announced the
start of the operation in a broadcast
pass on Hamas media calling on
Palestinians everywhere to fight
Israel's prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is holding an emergency
meeting and the military says is
striking Targets in Gaza in response
there are Palestinian reports of Israeli
soldiers being captured let me bring you
these latest pictures from Gaza they're
showing Hamas militant celebrating and
posing for pictures on what is said to
be an Israeli army tank
Palestinian media are reporting that a
number of Israelis have been taken
captive by Fighters the footage also
shows what appears to be an an Israeli
military vehicle captured by the
militants our Middle East correspondent
Jan now is in Jerusalem and told us the
size of the attacks is
unprecedented all my years of covering
these rounds of violence we haven't seen
an infiltration um on on this scale um
really it does seem from the the videos
that are circulating that there are
perhaps dozens of militants who have
crossed uh from the Gaza Strip into
Southern Israel you've got unverified TV
images that show them on motorbikes um
in pickup trucks even by H glider um now
unconfirmed reports uh from Gaza also
saying that Israelis had taken back into
the Palestinian Enclave um some Israelis
holding them captured perhaps several
soldiers we're not able to to verify
that at the moment but that would be a
very worrying development indeed for
Israelis that brings back uh memories of
what happened to gillad Shalit the
soldier who was captured in a
crossborder raid by Hamas militants back
in 2006 and was held until
2011 um now all of this looks extremely
well planned um by hamas's milit
military Wing um now you can see in some
of the videos that there are um
militants now who are um filming
themselves close to Israeli homes that
they may have taken some of those homes
over there are also videos filmed by
Israelis where you can see um people are
in the street shooting and and these
people say they can hear Arabic outside
their
windows that was your land now in
Jerusalem well for more on this Let's
cross live now to the BBC's
International editor Jeremy Bowen who's
currently live in Kiev in Ukraine Jeremy
you've covered this story the conflict
between Israel and Gaza for many years
just how significant are today's
events this is extremely significant in
all the years that Hamas have been in
control of Gaza more than 15 they have
never done anything like this they have
never launched a surprise attack uh on a
number of different locations Israeli
security officials said an hour or so
ago that there were 21 separate
incidents going on there's a lot of
video circulating not yet verified by
the BBC showing uh bodies of Israeli
soldiers uh some of whom were clearly
surprised uh in their bunks even by the
attackers uh no one was expecting Hamas
to do anything like this tension has
been rising very strongly between pal
Ians and Israelis there's been a lot of
violence in the West Bank which is the
territory that goes from Jerusalem
towards the Jordan River uh which been
occupied by Israel since
1967 uh that has been the focus now for
months and months and there's been a a
lot of killing and violence there but
nothing in comparison out of Gaza so I
think now the Israelis are using very
strong language they say they're in a
state of War they've been attacked
they've pulled up reservists they're
having this emergency meeting of their
security cabinet and I think it is
highly likely that once the Israelis um
make their plans that they will probably
mount an incursion into Gaza uh this
thing is likely to escalate and Jeremy
the big question for our viewers will be
why now because this seems to be a
coordinate coordinated attack that would
have taken a lot of planning as well why
do you think Hamas is doing
today well uh they've called it
something like operation Jerusalem flood
uh there's been tension in Jerusalem
during the recent Jewish holiday nothing
on the scale that we've seen before
where there were Palestinians being
pushed out by force out of the the
mosque there the alaxa mosque which is
the third holiest site in the world for
Muslims and it's also uh for for Jews
the site of the Jewish the ancient
Jewish temple and therefore venerated by
them it's the most single contested
piece of ground really in the entire
Middle East and uh there have been some
incidents there Jews have been praying
on the what they know as the Temple
Mount which is something which is it
doesn't sound much but it's considered
to be highly inflammatory and I think it
comes as a culmination of these growing
months and tension uh between
Palestinians and
Israelis in Jerusalem in the West Bank
and now Hamas have decided to move
there's also symbolic anniversary and in
the Middle East anniversaries are quite
a big deal it's the 50th Anniversary at
the moment of the surprise attack in
1973 by Syria and Egypt which lasted
which resulted in a Middle East War
lasting uh almost a month uh where
Israel was it was a close-run thing um
and Israelis I've spoken to today are
calling this prime minister
netanyahu's yum kipor surprise when
Israel was taken by surprise 50 years
ago and you know it could well be that
the Hamas planners thought let's try and
do something like that again thank you
very much that's our International
editor Jeremy Bowen and we look forward
to speaking to you throughout the day
here on BBC News",20231007

Netanyahu says the country is at War and
will win after a surprise attack by the
Palestinian militant group Hamas saw
thousands of rockets launched into
Israel from Gaza dozens of militants
appear to have entered Southern Israel
there is a state of emergency across the
country let's have a look at what we
know so far these rocket attacks struck
Tel Aviv and areas surrounding Gaza the
town of ashalon seeing several major
explosions uh news channels in Israel
reporting 40 Israelis have been killed
with seven
140 injured details of the Palestinian
incursions are unclear but gunmen have
been reported in towns near the border
with Gaza and Israelis are being told
they need to stay inside there are also
reports of a number of Israeli soldiers
being taken captive by Fighters Hamas
saying it has a big number of captives
and among them Hamas says is senior
officers israeli's military targeting
Gaza very strongly in the past hour or
so at least 198 Palestinians confirmed
dead there well let's uh bring you some
of that statement from prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu who addressed the
nation in a video statement that was
released on social
media citizens of Israel we at War not
an operation not an escalation a war
this morning Hamas launched a murderous
surprise attack against the state of
Israel and its citizens we've been it
since early morning I convin the ads of
the security service
first of all I instructed to cleanse the
settlements of the terrorists who had
infiltrated this operation is being
carried out during these hours at the
same time I ordered an extensive Reserve
mobilization and a retaliatory war with
a strength in scope that the enemy had
never known the enemy will pay an
unprecedented price in the meantime I
call on all citizens of Israel to
strictly obey the instructions of the
army and instructions of the home
command we are in a war and we win it
Benjamin Netanyahu there many pictures
coming to us at the BBC and we're
verifying them for you this is a
bulldozer destroying the Border fence
between Israel and Gaza Palestinians are
chanting and pouring through gunman
reported to have opened fire as I was
talking about a little bit earlier on
the town of stot and reports of Israeli
military vehicles being attacked on the
Israeli side too with some taken back
across the border into Gaza now this
shows you here in this video Hamas
militants celebrating they opposing for
pictures on what is said to be an
Israeli army tank and I think we'll see
in a moment as well footage of what
appears to be this vehicle here an
Israeli military vehicle captured by the
militants Israeli journalist and orthog
Gideon Levy is in Tel Aviv which is
among the cities that's been attacked
and he told us about the scene that he
wok up to this
morning I don't remember T Aviv in this
situation for many years I just went out
to the streets the streets are totally
empty restaurants cafes everything is
locked down and there is a very heavy
feeling of of surprise of shock and of
fear from what is still expected to
happen when the first Rockets fall I was
jogging in the park the noise was
terrible and and ever since then T Aviv
went into a new phase first of all there
are many more Israeli kill than the
official number because things are still
very unclear and still are still going
on in many towns in the South so expect
much bigger number of of casualties it's
an
inevitable result of months and maybe
years of Israeli arrogance of the
feeling that Israel can do whatever it
wants and will never be taken
accountable and never pay any price for
the programs of the settlers in the West
Bank Beed and supported by the Israeli
Army for the arrest for the attacks for
the killings of innocent civilians in
the West Bank and also for violating the
status quo in the temple Mountain I just
got now a report that in sukot this
sukot there were five over 5,000 Jews
going in a very provocative way to the
temple mountain and and all those things
are feeding the fire and what is a
surprise is the capability of Hamas not
their intentions because nobody in
Israel had foreseen that they have such
impressive
capabilities in the South there are
still battles in certain towns and and
Villages settlements over at least T of
of Palestinian fighters who are inside
Israel and they have hostages this is
very very dedicated this situation in
the same time Kamas declared they have
35 captured I don't know if this number
is right but if they kidnapped 35
Israelis into Gaza it will be very hard
for Israel to release them and it will
be very hard for Israel to attack Gaza
now as long as 35 Israelis are in their
hands again I not sure about the figure
but this would Hamas
declares so and there are t of of
Israeli air Jets which are bombing Gaza
and and soon we will know more now there
is a lot of smoke about everything and
the full picture is not very clear right
now exess for journalist is quite
limited now to those places and we are
quite depending on the messages of the
of the army spokeperson who is not
always reliable in Israel
but there are also immediate questions
for example most of the troops that
should have been around Gaza were busy
with the settler celebrations in the
West Bank and if you become a a security
company of the settlers for all their
crazy celebrations in sukot and Gaza is
left with very few soldiers then those
things can happen and someone is
responsible for this and this is only
one example
for many questions that will arise now
but as I said it's too early to to judge
because we know to little Gaza is a cage
is the biggest prison in the world
nobody spoke about lifting The Siege and
you know people who live now 17 years in
a cage want to resist and if they have
the possibility they do it and I'm
surprised that they had a possibility
because the barrier I know the barrier
around Gaza billions of of dollars were
spent there to build this unbelievable
barrier under the surface and above the
surface with all kind of electronic
devices and finally you see that the
spirit of resistance is many times
stronger than anything else and they
broke it and penetrated into Israel
which is now shocked finally by the end
of the day by the end of the war the pal
will pay for it a unprecedented price
with this right-wing government I really
I'm quite scared from the Israeli
reaction people are talking already
about erasing whole neighborhoods in
Gaza people also talk about reconquering
Gaza and all this will lead to more
Bloodshed and to more despair",20231007

launched more than 2,000 Rockets into
the country killing at least 200 people
and wounding nearly a thousand officials
in the Gaza Strip say at least 198
people have been killed there in
retaliatory Israeli strikes The Barrage
of Rocket fire from Gaza into Israeli
territory began just after Dawn with
explosions heard on the streets of
ashalon s darat is one of the towns
thought to have been infiltrated by
militants with the latest on this fast
escalating conflict his our Middle East
correspondent you land now and a warning
you may find some of her report
upsetting Israeli party goers from an
overnight Rave running for their lives
Israel's nightmare scenario armed
Palestinian militants at large in
southern
Israel it's thought that dozens entered
some cutting through the perimeter fence
from the Gaza
Strip in the town of stot residents hid
as Fighters drove in there was shooting
and the Israeli casualties began to
mount in a dramatic turn videos were
also shared of Israelis being taken into
Gaza as hostages
the day had begun with intense barrages
of Palestinian Rockets some reaching as
far as
Jerusalem but the worst damage was in
the town's closest to Gaza this was
ashalon Israel's prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met top security
officials since this morning the state
of Israel has has been at War our first
objective is to clear out enemy forces
that infiltrated and restore the
security and quiet the communities that
have been attacked the second objective
at the same time is to exact an immense
price from the Enemy Within the Gaza
Strip
too leaders of Hamas the islamist
militant Group which controls Gaza now
living overseas was shown watching the
unfolding news and
praying
in Gaza there were celebrations after an
Israeli tank was captured and stolen
Israeli military vehicles were driven
in but soon the deadly pounding by
Israeli war planes began the Israeli
military saying it was targeting Hass
sites and in Gaza 2 the hospitals have
now been
overwhelmed many Palestinian families
have fled from their homes and are
seeking safety in un run
schools after this unprecedented
surprise attack Israel is calling up
military reservists it said Hamas will
pay the price for its actions and the
fighting goes on the question now can it
be stopped from spreading to other
Palestinian areas and The Wider
region youan now there will let's bring
you the latest figures coming into us
from Gaza the health Ministry have told
the BBC there that 232 people have been
killed and
1,790 have been injured well let's go
live now to our Jerusalem Bureau bureau
chief Joe floto who's following all the
developments and Joe also in the past
few minutes confirmation from the
Israelis that at least 200 Israelis have
been killed in those attacks today bring
us the
latest yeah so the the casualty figures
coming up on both sides there there's
still fighting going on so we're just
coming off of an Israeli military
briefing and they're confirming that
there is ongoing gun gunfire in some of
their military installations and border
crossing points on the Gaza Strip which
uh has taken them hours to retake and
they still haven't completed that
process they estimate that hundreds of
militants managed to break out of Gaza
and storm several locations near the
Gaza Strip in Israeli towns and we've
seen this chaos unfold during the
morning hours with people being taken
hostage a number of people killed and
we've seen extraordinary videos of
Israeli civilians being dragged away
by militants supposedly into the Gaza
Strip and we can confirm that there are
dozens we think of hostages now being ta
held by militants in
Gaza H there's there's so much to talk
about Joe um I just want to ask you
about the military operation because
also in the past few minutes the Reuters
news agency were reporting a military
spokesperson Israeli military
spokesperson saying we are prepared for
an escalation in the north now um
geography wise a lot of these attacks
happened in the south of the country
what do you think that's going to
mean what they're doing there is trying
to reassure people and send out a
message to Israel's enemies outside the
country that they are prepared for a war
on several fronts the main concentration
of military effort at the moment is in
the Gaza Strip so they are amassing
hundreds and thousands of soldiers
they've called up reservist and they are
preparing for a big ground operation
into the Gaza Strip they've made no
secret of that it will take them a while
to plan that in the meantime they are
bombing Gaza Strip and that hence the
casualties that we're seeing being
reported out of Gaza but to the north of
the country is Lebanon and Hezbollah is
a well-known militant organization that
runs pretty well that country and
controls the large area of the south of
that country and has had a war with
Israel in the past and they have voiced
their support for Hamas today and within
their control within the the the areas
of control of Hezbollah are also
Palestinian milit milit factions who
have in the past fired Rockets out of
Lebanon into Israel so Israel Israeli
military is saying they are prepared for
any eventuality but make no mistake what
they're planning at the moment is a
massive attack on the Gaza Strip using
thousands and thousands of soldiers we
just don't know when that's going to
happen Okay and politically Israel's
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in
the last 20 minutes or so said he's
invited the opposition leaders ya lapid
and Gant to join a national Unity
government what's that going to
mean well I think at times like this in
Israel you often get very very Stark
political differences set aside uh for
the sake of national unity and that's
what we've seen this evening this
evening those politic those opposition
figur really don't like Netanyahu
they've they've been bitter political
Rivals but they are going to sit in a
national Unity government Benny gance is
a very very senior military offic former
Chief of Staff and will for part of that
government but this is a a very divided
country at the moment politically we've
seen protests continue for most of this
year because of U of political um
decisions made by Netanyahu that haven't
been agreed with by lots of the
population here but at the moment this
country is reeling in the shock of of
what has never been seen by many many
people living in Israel you have to go
back probably to the Yom kapore War
about 50 years ago before you get
anything remotely close to this if you
think about the war between Hezbollah
and Gaza in 2006 we've already surpassed
that death toll on the Israeli side in
just one day and in in that situation we
only had a tiny
infiltration into Israel proper this is
something different this is something
that the Israeli military was supposed
to stop this is not a surprise that
Hamas have wanted to do this it is a
surprise that they did it today and in
such numbers and complete surprise is
that they were so effortlessly
successful for hours and hours and have
reached havoc and now they hold in their
possession we think dozens of hostages
both military and civilian",20231007

dead after unprecedented attacks by
Hamas militants it represents the
biggest loss of life in a single day in
Israeli history Hamas which is
designated as a terrorist organization
by many Western governments including
the United Kingdom is still holding out
in parts of Southern Israel where
they're coming under attack by Israeli
forces and Israeli war planes are now
bombing the Gaza Strip where more than
400 Palestinians are said to have been
killed and more than 2,000
injured and worry is also deepening over
the shocking hostage taking of more than
100 Israelis who are now said to have
been taken to Gaza our first report
tonight is from our defense
correspondent Jonathan Beal who brings
us all the latest and I should warn you
that in his report report there are
images that you may find
distressing Israeli troops are still
hunting down armed
Palestinians more than 30 hours after
their biggest and bloodiest breakout
from Gaza into Israel
itself one of the world's most advanced
militaries taken by
surprise by Hamas a militant group kept
behind barriers
that were supposed to stop this
happening their attack as brutal as it
was Brazen hundreds killed for Israel
that's included scores of unarmed
civilians as well as soldiers already
the largest loss of life in decades here
the bodies of an Israeli family shot
dead waiting to be identified and
buried Hamas has taken dozens of host
ages too like this 85-year-old
grandmother yafa Adar whisked Away by
militants in a golf
card families too among them yon's wife
and their five and 2-year-old daughters
he's left anxiously waiting for news and
pleading for their safe return I want to
ask of

women if you want me instead I'm willing
to come Israel's prime minister meeting
security Chiefs this morning has warned
his nation of a long and difficult War
ahead both sides have already suffered
significant losses Hamas murdered
hundreds of Israelis men women and
children and took dozens host St into
Gaza this horrific terror act Demands a
forceful determined and sustained
response Israel's response has been
Swift and
harsh despite the massive intelligence
Failure Its missiles filmed by our BBC
team in
Gaza Jets have been hitting what they
say a Hamas positions but many civilians
have also been killed in this densely
populated Palestinian enclave blockaded
and nowhere else to
flee tonight this is as close as we can
get to Gaza itself about 5 kilm in that
direction there is a lot of military
activity Jets overhead Israel has told
its citizens living nearby to leave it's
not clear whether that could signal a
land incursion by Israel into Gaza
itself but inevitably this will end up
being more bloody
still there's also the risk of
escalation Hezbollah has been firing
Rockets into Israel from neighboring
Lebanon they say a show of solidarity
with
Palestinians this region has long been a
Tinder Box and once again the Flames are
being fanned Jonathan Beal BBC News

talking to me now we're hearing very
loud
explosions still in the sky here in
ashalon in southern Israel and as you
were hearing there it has been a an
intense night we've had missile barrages
coming across here from Gaza and again
the Israeli Defense Forces have been
striking targets there this is one of
the missiles that actually hit its
Target most of them are destroyed by
Israel's Iron Dome defense system but
you can see here this is a a twostory
block of flats and a missile from Gaza
made a direct hit right into the center
of them you can see at the Children's
bike and toys on the floor I've just
been talking actually to a woman who
lives just in that flat there actually
right above and she was saying that her
and her husband when this happened they
were stuck inside the door was jammed
they were trying desperately to get out
and she said they had to be they had to
be rescued by firefighters people who
live in this area are used to missile
attacks from Gaza but really not the
size and the scale that we've seen since
Saturday morning and certainly not the
kind of infiltration with Hamas
militants coming through the fence from
Gaza as we saw paragliding into this
part of Southern Israel coming in by sea
and wreaking that the Havoc which you
have seen over the last couple of days
and people here this morning they are
out they are surveying the damage and
they're very much wondering what this
means next for them Anna thank you very
much indeed well our reporter rushi Abu
Alou is in Gaza this morning uh morning
rushi just talk us through the situation
there and what the latest information is
that you have over the last last few
hours yeah good morning just as we speak
abaj of rockets were fired from from
Gaza as mainly Hamas send message saying
that it's in response to what they call
Israeli massacres the in a statement
Hamas this morning said that Israeli
committed 11 massacres in in Gaza
killing families and kids and children
we have been getting reports since last
night about air strike in inun in
southern Gaza and in Rafa where civilian
casualties were uh discovered under the
rubble of those of those building and no
statement yes or update from the health
Ministry about the number of the people
killed overnight but medical official in
the main hospital in Gaza told the BBC
about 40 people killed overnight which
last night was the heaviest I think for
years Israel carried out more than 500
air strikes targeting many places
buildings houses uh and one of the
deadliest attack was in shat refugee
camp it's the densely populated refugee
camp within Gaza City it's called the
beach camp and they destroyed a a
two-story mosque it's a famous called
the Western white mosque is being
destroyed by five six air strikes ER
some of the buildings around the mosque
the mosque were collapsed and they are
trying to rescue people from under the
the rubel the situation is escalating in
a very dramatic way last night and and
this morning with for the first time we
are hearing some gunfire near the
Israeli border about half an hour ago we
heard
Israeli helicopter engaging in in in in
gun batt or in gun fighting near the
Gaza border which is about like 2 km or
3
km this way uh in the third day Gaza is
still H without electricity 80 85% of
the people H they don't have electricity

connect Gaza with the inter with the
world is is completely closed Israel

Crossings and there is no uh Goods or
medicine or fuel enter Gaza no movement

shortage of food and water too what can
people do to find food and water when
the supply chain is currently
blocked
well there is two sources of power in
Gaza one is produced by the solo power
station in Gaza which they said they
have fuel enough uh for another 20 48
Hours the the main source of the power
is lines coming from Israel and Israel
decided the first day of this operation
to stop supplying Gaza with those with
those B so now the what what is
available is quite small amount of of
few of electricity and they are now
being given to the hospitals to run the
essential services and the water
services but for the ordinary people
they are unable to see electricity or

about the military operation because
also in the past few minutes the Reuters
news agency were reporting a military
spokesperson Israeli military
spokesperson saying we are prepared for
an escalation in the north now um
geography wise a lot of these attacks
happened in the south of the country
what do you think that's going to
mean what they're doing there is trying
to reassure people and send out a
message to Israel's enemies outside the
country that they are prepared for a war
on several fronts the main concentration
of military effort at the moment is in
the Gaza Strip so they are amassing
hundreds and thousands of soldiers
they've called up reservist and they are
preparing for a big ground operation
into the Gaza Strip they've made no
secret of that it will take them a while
to plan that in the meantime they are
bombing Gaza Strip and that hence the
casualties that we're seeing being
reported out of Gaza but to the north of
the country is Lebanon and Hezbollah is
a well-known militant organization that
runs pretty well that country and
controls the large area of the south of
that country and has had a war with
Israel in the past and they have voiced
their support for Hamas today and within
their control within the the the areas
of control of Hezbollah are also
Palestinian milit milit factions who
have in the past fired Rockets out of
Lebanon into Israel so Israel Israeli
military is saying they are prepared for
any eventuality but make no mistake what
they're planning at the moment is a
massive attack on the Gaza Strip using
thousands and thousands of soldiers we
just don't know when that's going to
happen Okay and politically Israel's
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in
the last 20 minutes or so said he's
invited the opposition leaders ya lapid
and Gant to join a national Unity
government what's that going to
mean well I think at times like this in
Israel you often get very very Stark
political differences set aside uh for
the sake of national unity and that's
what we've seen this evening this
evening those politic those opposition
figur really don't like Netanyahu
they've they've been bitter political
Rivals but they are going to sit in a
national Unity government Benny gance is
a very very senior military offic former
Chief of Staff and will for part of that
government but this is a a very divided
country at the moment politically we've
seen protests continue for most of this
year because of U of political um
decisions made by Netanyahu that haven't
been agreed with by lots of the
population here but at the moment this
country is reeling in the shock of of
what has never been seen by many many
people living in Israel you have to go
back probably to the Yom kapore War
about 50 years ago before you get
anything remotely close to this if you
think about the war between Hezbollah
and Gaza in 2006 we've already surpassed
that death toll on the Israeli side in
just one day and in in that situation we
only had a tiny
infiltration into Israel proper this is
something different this is something
that the Israeli military was supposed
to stop this is not a surprise that
Hamas have wanted to do this it is a
surprise that they did it today and in
such numbers and complete surprise is
that they were so effortlessly
successful for hours and hours and have
reached havoc and now they hold in their
possession we think dozens of hostages
both military and civilian",20231007
J7sMXYm9hP0,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Israel - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Israel - BBC News.jpg,"the u.s secretary of state anthony
blinken is in
israel to try to consolidate the
ceasefire with the palestinians
following the worst flare-up of violence
in years let's go straight to laura
trevelyan who joins us
from jerusalem now he arrived a few
hours ago the ceasefire's still in place
laura is that what he's still trying to
uphold rather than
pushing on with any concrete peace talks
at the moment
yes that's right tim quite modest aims
at least
publicly for the top american diplomat
as he's here on this
tour of the middle east his first since
taking office right now he's meeting the
israeli prime minister benjamin
netanyahu in the prime minister's office
here in jerusalem and of course even
that itself is contested the israelis
claim jerusalem as their capital but the
palestinians
want east jerusalem to be the capital of
their eventual
state so everything here is so symbolic
and so freighted but yes
anthony blinken is here to make sure the
ceasefire is upheld
to get humanitarian aid into gaza
something that israel's cooperation is
required for because it controls the
entry to the strip along with egypt and
then he wants to talk about the massive
reconstruction effort for gaza after the
bombing again
very contentious with the israelis
because they do not want the
reconstruction effort
for that money to be diverted by hamas
so that they make more rockets to fire
at israel
neither do the americans the americans
objective is to try to strengthen
the palestinian authority in the west
bank and somehow reengage
them in the gaza strip very difficult
given hamas control the gaza strip and
there's a lot of rivalry
so all of this on anthony blinken's
agenda he meets first with prime
minister netanyahu followed by a press
conference and then this afternoon he
goes to ramallah in the west bank
and he meets the head of the palestinian
authority mahmoud abbas
but but no talks though with hamas as
was made absolutely clear a few days ago
by
joe biden but as you say i mean hamas is
in control in gaza
and abu mazen abbas has has stopped
elections
on the west bank for fear of losing to
hamas there as well so why are the
americans negotiating with somebody
who isn't really wielding any power at
all
well the americans won't negotiate
directly with hamas because they regard
it as a terrorist
organization and there are all kinds of
laws in america which prevent
direct negotiation and the flow of aid
to terrorist organizations which is why
it's very complicated this question of
getting
aid into gaza through the palestinian
authority somehow as the americans
want to do with the united nations so
all of this will be discussed but
anthony blinken also is going on to
egypt and to jordan remember it's the
egyptians who talk to hamas directly
they're the only ones who can speak
both to hamas and to the israelis they
brokered this ceasefire
they're doing the heavy lifting on the
details to keep it going the egyptian
foreign minister
has been here back and forth between
gaza and the west bank the last few days
uh so the americans are here for the big
picture but let's make sure this
ceasefire holds then anthony blinker
will go on
to talk to the egyptians about the
detail and he'll meet with the
jordanians and by the way the jordanians
key
to perhaps trying to calm down this
inter-communal violence that we're
seeing here in jerusalem
the disputed al-aqsa mosque one of the
holiest
places in islam where religious
nationalist jews increasingly want to
pray
something which is causing tension with
palestinians because the jordanians
control that
access to the mosque they could be key
in trying to come up with some kind of
resolution to this simmering conflict
just yesterday tim two israelis were
stabbed here on the street their
assailant was shot dead
yeah just briefly laura it was president
trump who controversially moved the u.s
embassy
from tel aviv to jerusalem is it still
there
any plans by the biden administration to
reverse that
the bride administration is not going to
move the embassy but what they could do
is open the consulate here for the
palestinians
this is something that would reopen
relations with the palestinians
and president biden was very careful to
say when anthony blinken left on his
trip that one of the purposes of this
trip is to restore
relations with the palestinians because
they've been abandoned
for so long and senior state department
officials said basically relations with
the palestinians have been
missing in action on background as it
was put for some years so that's
also the purpose of this trip to
re-engage the palestinians and make them
feel that this isn't quite such a
one-sided process
okay laura uh with the very latest on
jerusalem thanks very much",20210525

in gaza our middle east editor jeremy

nothing

israel says it has no record of a strike
at the time of that first attack
it says its assessment is that a
palestinian rocket
aimed at israel dropped short of its
target
the family showed a shrapnel they said
was from the bomb
independent experts who've seen these
photos say
they're fragments of air-dropped
precision munitions
not palestinian rockets the two sides
will not agree are you doing it

more people arrived to offer condolences

don't believe israel's insistence that
it works hard
not to kill civilians warning them to
get out before

so close like we are the closest from
the family we heard
lots of explosions we heard lots of kids
who are screaming
for help and we heard lots of mothers
crying for their children
i feel scared and terrified but i hide
it from my little brother because
i don't want him to feel like he's not
secured in
gaza because it's his real home i want
him to feel like
he's safe in his home
seeing the buildings fall down and
seeing the water
seeing people like this is not
safe i get scared from dark i don't like
the darkness
so when the luxury turns off i don't
like it
it scares me my mom was scared for her
kids
my dad was also scared for his kids me
and my brothers are scared for each
other so
we always try to be together because if
we die together that will be the best
thing because we can still see
each other when we go to heaven
so this is the bomb shelter and when we
hear a cold red
and then lots of sirens we run into here

israel and hamas came into force this
morning there were clashes between
israeli police and palestinians around
the al-aqsa mosque in the old city of
jerusalem
violence at the holy site was one of the
flashpoints that led to the 11-day
conflict which has ended with both sides
claiming victory
in gaza at least 243 people were killed
among them more than 100 women
and children 12 people were killed in
israel by
rockets fired by palestinian militants
our middle east editor jeremy bowen
reports now from gaza
at two in the morning the ceasefire
started in gaza
time to celebrate survival and to swear
allegiance to jerusalem the holy city
only 60 miles away that most gazans have
never visited
israel forbids it
we sacrificed everything for jerusalem
he's saying
and in jerusalem palestinians were up
late too
delighted that hamas declared they were
fighting for palestinian rights in the
city
israel says jerusalem is the eternal
capital of the jewish people
and will not be divided again
first light in gaza was not a new start
the conflict with israel
runs deep but no air strikes and time to
reflect
men from islamic jihad which fought
alongside hamas had no regrets
they paraded in khan yunus one of gaza's
towns
to bury nine men from their unit
they were killed in a strike on a tunnel
on the fourth day of bombing
hamas thought the tunnels were safe
locating and hitting them from the air
was a significant achievement for israel
[Music]
thousands came to honor the dead men
here in gaza as well as in israel there
is no sense
that they've come to the end of their
fight
[Applause]
the bodies could only be recovered after
the cease-fire
they're digging for others high morale
here will infuriate israeli nationalist
politicians
once said israel had surrendered to
terrorism
this is a huge demonstration of support
for the armed wing of hamas the cassand
brigades
and they're sending a message as well
that despite
the hammering they've taken from the
israelis
that they're still here they're still
ready to fight and they're talking as
well
about jerusalem that's been the theme
of many of the chants here in the
cemetery
and in jerusalem more violence between
palestinian worshippers
and israeli police at the axa mosque the
holy places
in the city are charged with national as
well as religious significance for
israelis and palestinians
in gaza hamas claimed victory as israel
did too the cease-fire stops the killing
until the next time it doesn't settle
the conflict
or even freeze it
but it has transformed gaza's streets
the people are out of hiding a day ago
going out could get you killed now
there's a chance to feel alive
now the israelis are keeping a close eye
on what's going on here the whole time
i've been standing here
i can hear a military drone in the air
above but i think they're pretty
confident
the ceasefire is going to hold on the
way down from jerusalem
i could see them packing up their iron
dome anti-missile
system at least from some of the
batteries and taking it away on a lorry
now southern israel was absolutely
paralyzed by the attacks even though
there was that big disparity
in casualty levels and here in gaza
there's a lot of rebuilding to do
people have lost their homes but as well
as that
the militant groups will be rebuilding
their
smashed up positions probably their
tunnels and most of all
their arsenals jeremy thank you

militant group hamas has brought
an end to 11 days of fighting
the violence has claimed the lives of
more than 230 palestinians
and 12 israelis the deal announced late
on thursday was brokered by egypt
and agreed to by the israeli security
cabinet and the palestinian militant
groups
it has been described as mutual and
unconditional
so far it seems to be holding on both
sides
cairo will send security delegations to
israel and the palestinian territories
to
help uphold this ceasefire
president biden has welcomed the
cessation of hostilities which he said
presented an opportunity now for
progress in the middle east courtney
bembridge has this report
there were celebrations on the streets
of gaza city after the ceasefire came
into effect in the early hours of the
morning
it brings to an end 11 days of
bombardment
in which more than 240 people have died
mostly in gaza
hamas is the militant group that rules
there and this was its reaction to the
truce
i say that today this battle stops but
netanyahu
and the whole world should know that our
hands are on the trigger
and we will continue to ramp up the
capabilities of this resistance
and we will tell netanyahu and his army
if you come back we will come back
the office of the israeli prime minister
benjamin netanyahu said the ceasefire
was
mutual and unconditional but some
israelis in tel aviv were doubtful
about how long it will last the
ceasefire is good for
humanitarian reasons to let civilians
relax a little bit on both sides i'm
skeptical though that it will really be
kept for a while
i don't think israel has achieved much i
mean there are no
any no agreements about the future
nothing this ceasefire
won't last um
eight hours they will start
shooting gas rackets again the us
president joe biden welcomed the
ceasefire which was brokered by egypt
we've held intensive high-level
discussions hour
by hour literally egypt the palestinian
authority and other middle eastern
countries
with the name of avoiding the sort of
prolonged conflict we've seen in
previous years
when the hostilities have broken out
cairo is sending two delegations to
monitor the situation
as the world's attention now turns to
maintaining peace
this was the message from the united
nations i stress that
israeli and palestinian leaders have a
responsibility beyond the restoration of
calm
to start a serious dialogue to address
the root causes of the conflict
the latest conflict is the fourth big
war between
israel and hamas since 2008
and many fear it won't be the last the
reality at this point is the gaps
between the
israelis and the palestinians on this
conflict and how to resolve
it are extremely wide both substantively
psychologically
and i would say politically for now
though
both sides are claiming a victory

have
of holding jeremy
i think when it comes in i think a
reasonable chance for at least a while

is that sometimes both sides like to
show they can fire the last shot
and then there is an intense period the
last hour or so
i hope that doesn't happen it might both
sides have also been crafting what's
referred to here sometimes as victory
narratives
uh hamas have said that they have forced
israel
to take its hand as they put it off
the al-aqsa mosque here in jerusalem and
also the
the district of shaitura which became a
big flash point in the run-up
to all of this the israelis say that
they have scored some unprecedented
military victories now this is the

big war between israel and hamas
since the first one back in the end of
2008

all the smaller ones

continuing at
full throttle there is still no
ceasefire on the table
those are the words of an israeli
defense source to the bbc
as the conflict in israel and gaza
continues
two palestinian militants have been
killed in the latest israeli air raids
targeting gaza city overnight
palestinian rockets were launched at
southern israel
let's show you the latest figures from
the health ministry in gaza that says
that 219 people have been
killed including 63 children
while 12 people have been killed in
israel including two children
a spokesperson for the un secretary
general said about 50 000 palestinians
in gaza had been displaced
so far in the last hour we've been
hearing from the israeli prime minister
benjamin netanyahu
he has defended israel's military
actions
we try to target those who target
us with great precision that is not
as surgical an operation as it is even
in a surgical
room in a hospital you don't have the
ability to prevent
collateral damage around the affected
tissues
even then you can't and certainly in a
military operation you cannot
but there is no army in the world that
does more than the israeli army
in israeli security services and israeli
intelligence
to prevent collateral damage to have
israel criticized for that is observed
benjamin netanyahu speaking just a short
time ago in a moment we'll speak to a
former u.n human rights official first
though mark labelle reports on events on
the ground overnight
more israeli air strikes more militants
killed in gaza
for a tenth day a palestinian rocket
intercepted
by israel's air defenses
after an earlier strike in southern
israel killed
two foreign farm workers so continues
a cycle of violence
visiting an air base in southern israel
its prime minister appears relaxed
saying hamas has been set back by many
years
we will continue as necessary to restore
peace to
all israeli citizens
but things are not getting more peaceful
last seen 16 years ago the al-aqsa
martyrs brigade
armed palestinians rear their heads in
ramallah
in the occupied west bank
in jericho arab protesters are met with
rubber coated steel bullets
and tear gas also
feeling the heat from all this is
america who despite voicing
its support for a ceasefire has so far
blocked united nations-backed efforts
to end hostilities where should the poor
go
where should the weak go isn't the u.n
the house of
all people
france now wants the un's powerful
security council
which includes america to vote for a
ceasefire
and greater humanitarian access in gaza
but the u.s view has for many years been
that the security council is not the
place to resolve issues
between non-state actors like hamas and
israel i think the us
is going to veto it but it will be part
of this
growing sense that the u.s will support
that we have to begin winding this up
i think within days with all eyes on
gaza
whichever way the u.s precedes its push
for peace here
unilaterally or inside the u.n it's now
under sustained political pressure
both at home and abroad to do so
fast mark lobel bbc news
well let's talk more about what the
world is doing to find a peaceful
solution to this we can speak to john
dugard former un special rapporteur to
the unhcr john good to see you
israeli defense forces and sources have
just told us
that the bombardment will continue there
is no ceasefire
what do you believe it would take to
bring israel
to the table to look at and agree to a
well ceasefire are certain difficulties
in the way of a ceasefire
first of all there's a problem that the
united states is blocking any
resolution from the security council
which is the
obvious body to initiate such action
there's also the problem of the refusal
of israel and the united states
and other countries to speak to hamas
directly
so you have the bizarre situation that
so-called or prospective mediators
are unwilling to speak to both sides in
the conflict and that's a problem
for the ceasefire so do you believe john
that the u.s is not actually an honest
broker now
in this i think it's become very clear
that the us
is not an honest broker
first of all there's the evidence
provided by the failure of the united
states to support
a resolution at this stage but secondly
there's the fact that the united states
continues to operate
its embassy from jerusalem which is
contrary
to international law and also there's
the fact that the
united states pays military aid or
tribute to israel in the form of 3.8
billion dollars a year so the united
states
had disqualified itself as an honest
broker and that means that the
security council will now have to
initiate any peace process that
arises from the present conflict so do
you believe the reality is
that the u.s that president biden is
just going to allow
israel this window now to achieve its
objectives
the evidence seems to suggest that
and i think it's time that the united
states reputed some of the
allegations made by prime minister
netanyahu for instance his recent
statement
that the israeli defense forces do not
target civilian targets
is simply disproved by the evidence the
israeli defense forces have repeatedly
targeted areas where they know that
there will be collateral
damage which will injure civilians so i
think the united states
is obliged to address issues of this
kind and also
to withdraw its statements that israel
is entitled to act
in self-defense this is not
a conflict between states israel is
engaged in a police operation
in gaza and it is subject to the rules
of proportionality
so i think on all kinds israel must now
be
seemed to be in violation of
international law but to make matters
worse
the united states is aiding and abetting
the
government of israel in these activities
john who was talking to hamas
egypt we know that for sure that they
are
yes and in previous
conflicts of this kind in 2008 2009
and 2014 it was principally
egypt that brought about the ceasefire
though in 2014 john kerry did play
an important role in uh brokering
a ceasefire but that doesn't seem to be
the policy of the biden administration
how do you think john the abraham
accords are complicating things i mean
arab countries originally said they
hoped this would give them some leverage
over israel
that is clearly not the case in fact
it's turned out to actually be quite
embarrassing for them
yes the states that are partly to the
abraham accords
have not played a role in this at all it
seems that
egypt is determined to assert itself
as the broker between
hamas palestine and
israel and i think it's most likely to
achieve
its goal of course together with jordan
so i think the
abraham accord states uh have been
completely marginalized john good to get
your thoughts thanks for joining us from
the hague

forces and palestinian militants led by
hamas
is entering its second week and there is
little sign of a political or diplomatic
breakthrough
the united nations security council
still can't agree
on a formal joint statement today there
were clashes between palestinian
protesters
and israeli security forces in the
israeli-occupied west bank
our middle east editor jeremy bowen
reports now from jerusalem and there are
some distressing images
in the report
the israeli army blew up the car of a
man who attacked them with grenades
soldiers shot him dead it was the center
of hebron where soldiers protected
jewish settlement
in the heart of a palestinian city
[Applause]
last night a group called the al-aqsa
martyrs brigade showed off their weapons
in ramallah
on the west bank they have been quiet
since the end of the last
armed uprising around 16 years ago
their return if that's what it is is a
sign of the hardening mood on the
palestinian side
and competition between rival factions
to confront israel
this morning the al-aqsa brigade and
israeli troops exchanged fire near
ramallah the israelis said
two of their soldiers were wounded
[Applause]
this was at the damascus gate into
jerusalem's old city
egypt blames heavy-handed israeli
pressure in jerusalem
for what it calls palestinian
retaliation
the egyptians have used unusually harsh
language to
condemn israel's behavior that matters
because egyptian mediators are a
critical part of ceasefire negotiations
much more anger in more places is on
display in the palestinian territories
than during previous
wars between israel and hamas this was
bethlehem
just outside jerusalem
this kind of thing just doesn't build up
overnight
it comes after years of settlement
expansion
land confiscation what happened in
jerusalem and what's happening in gaza
was
the last straw it's about for these
people
years of israeli pressure
inside israel jaffa is shared by jews
and palestinian arabs
arab businesses across israel were
closed in a general strike that was also
solid on the west bank
in the last week coexistence between
israel's arab and jewish citizens
has broken down a disaster for national
cohesion
[Music]
hamas is still hitting israeli towns
this was ashdod
all the pounding of gaza this was an
american-made israeli bomb has not
stopped hamas
firing back that could be an incentive
for israel to respond to pressure from
its allies for a ceasefire

palestinians across the west bank and
gaza
are on strike today to show their anger
against ongoing israeli airstrikes
over 200 people have died in the last
week nearly all of them palestinian
the airstrikes against targets in gaza
have continued throughout the night
and into today the other way a new
barrage of rockets and mortar shells by
palestinian militants into southern
israel
have killed two workers and injured
seven more
the strike has shuttered businesses
across the region
and some of the strikes are on the
streets in the west bank town of
bethlehem
israeli police use tear gas after
clashes with the protesters
paul adams reports from jerusalem
[Applause]
gaza's punishment continues more
airstrikes at dawn
israel says this is not over it doesn't
just want the rockets to stop
it wants its opponent crippled it's been
hitting the homes of hamas leaders
and destroying as much of their hardware
as possible
hamas still has plenty of rockets but
launchers are vulnerable
the directive is to continue striking
terrorist targets
the idf is doing this very well we will
continue to take
whatever action is necessary to restore
peace and security
to all residents of israel
international outrage is building over
the civilian cost
almost 40 000 people have been displaced
the territory's only coveted testing lab
partially destroyed
kamal hazala says he got a call from the
israeli army
telling him to get out of his home the
house next door was bombed
when he and his family returned this is
what they found
my mother was with me at home and now
she is out in the streets with no
shelter and i also have no shelter for
my children
here the whole house is totally
destroyed
in the west bank palestinians are once
again demonstrating over the situation
in gaza there's a general strike not
just among palestinians
it's being observed by israeli arabs too
but diplomatic efforts much less visible
are now gathering pace
international mediators are trying hard
to stop the fighting
and when the u.s president joe biden
spoke to mr netanyahu last night
he called for a ceasefire for the first
time
the un is heavily involved its envoy in
jerusalem one of few officials
actually talking to hamas with pressure
mounting on israel
its window of opportunity in gaza is
slowly
closing paul adams bbc news jerusalem
well i've been speaking to tarek adele
the egyptian ambassador to the uk
i asked him what conversations egypt was
having directly with hamas
over the last few days we've had many
contacts with the
palestinian factions in gaza and in the
rest of the palestinian occupied
territories
also we've had discussions and contacts
with
with the israelis with the hope that we
can
broker a ceasefire agreement
we have all witnessed the
falling of casualties on both sides
last numbers go up to more than 200
deaths on the palestinian side including
uh
more than 60 children and women also
there has been casualties on the israeli
side
up to 10 so far now this should stop
and we are hoping that the the rest of
the international community support us
on this
that we need to have a priority in this
conflict the priority right now
is to reach a ceasefire agreement after
which
we can have a serious discussion on how
to resume
peace negotiations between the two sides
so
just to get get a clear ambassador you
are talking directly at the moment to
hamas as well
we are talking to all sides uh that are
party to the conflict
and and when you make those contacts
with hamas i mean one of the conditions
for
the israelis is this won't stop until
the rockets stop
is that a message that you are
reiterating and putting pressure
on hamas to do so we are using all the
diplomatic tools at our disposal
to reach a ceasefire agreement now
if one side is going to say the other
side has to stop
first this is not going to get us
anywhere there has to be an
understanding
on both sides that the escalation must
stop
and must stop now
you are in a very unique uh position uh
ambassador because
a few people uh can speak to hamas
directly
and you have been in a position back in
2014 where you were able to broker
some kind of fragile ceasefire but you
did broker that
cairo is very much in the diplomatic
driving seat here
so you can put that pressure on hamas
country you do have leverage over the
group yes we are speaking with them and
uh we have indication that they would be
uh
willing to adhere to a ceasefire
agreement
if the israelis on the other side
adheres to it
and and again that's part of the problem
of what you're saying both sides are
saying well the other side has to stop
first so where the
where does this end well i'm
i'm seeing and i'm hearing that the
israelis
are saying that they have some goals to
achieve
and that they are only going to uh
pursue these goals which may take
a day two days three days whatever it
takes
now uh which means that we cannot have a
ceasefire agreement now
and if this is the position uh one would
expect
the other side not to adhere to any uh
ceasefire agreement
so there has to be an understanding that
things have to stop and stop
now there are casualties that are
falling on both sides
and this is not time to uh uh uh
blame uh one side or the other things
have to stop now
now we are uh working tirelessly uh we
have
envoys in both israel and the
palestinian
territories and in gaza and we hope that
our partners including the uk would
weigh
in uh on those efforts in order to bear
pressure
on the israelis as we are bearing
pressure on the palestinian side",20210518

president biden has said he backs
a ceasefire in gaza and said the u.s is
engaging with egypt and other partners
to secure one
in a phone call with the israeli prime
minister benjamin netanyahu
mr biden also voiced his support for
israel's right to defend itself against
indiscriminate rocket attacks
while urging mr netanyahu to protect
civilians
more than 212 people including 61
children have died in gaza
and 10 including two children in israel
this was the scene in gaza city as day
broke
bringing with it more airstrikes with
the latest here's our middle east editor
jeremy bowen
nightmares come true in gaza for parents
and their children
this mother couldn't talk about the
airstrike that engulfed them last friday
eight-year-old mustafa al-zahana and his
mother are further down the children's
ward at
chifa gaza's main hospital she says
mustafa trembles when he hears israeli
attacks
ever since the one that wounded him
almost a week ago
as he left their home with his father to
buy new clothes
for the end of ramadan his father was
paralyzed
most of his friend who went with them is
dead
his friend was killed when bara was
dying
he was clutching my son tightly and
telling him not to leave him alone
but died when my son has a fever he
hallucinates about it
as well as the badly injured 61 children
in gaza have been killed
in the last week
about 20 miles north is this synagogue
in the israeli town of
ashkelon it was hit by a hamas rocket
it was the festival of shavuot the feast
of weeks
usually a celebration it's a very sad
time for
for us over here in ashkelon we are
always on
bombing i hope it will finish
fast in jerusalem the western wall plaza
was almost deserted
this is the holiest place for jews to
pray it's usually packed on religious
holidays but some of the worshippers
said people were scared to go out
the grey dome of al-aqsa mosque is one
of the most sacred places for muslims
you can see how close it is to the wall
above the wall is the golden dome of the
rock both muslim shrines are built on
the site of the ancient jewish temple
these sites are all also national
symbols a month of tension here
raised the hatred level so high it led
to war
the events of the last week have shown a
couple of things first of all
the power of jerusalem to ignite this
conflict
and hamas have sent a strong message
to palestinians that as far as they're
concerned
they are their real protectors here in
the holy city
even though hamas hq is 60 or 70 miles
away
by the sea in gaza our gaza producer
filmed his drive to work and you can see
the bomb sites
if palestinians and israelis could be
equally safe
and secure they might have a chance of
peace
right now they don't jeremy bowen bbc
news
jerusalem well let's speak now to the
former prime minister of sweden carl
biltz he currently sits as co-chair on
the european council on foreign
relations a pan
european think tank mr bill thank you
very much for joining us
on bbc news the united states blocking a
u.n
security council statement again calling
for a
cessation of violence in the region
although president biden
has spoken of his support for a
ceasefire will
eu foreign ministers meeting today
explicitly call
for an end to the violence
well i certainly hope so um particularly
now with even president biden had come
out and talked about a ceasefire and
i would expect that within not too
distant future we will have a ceasefire
i think the important thing is what
happened thereafter
that uh international community be that
the united states would be that
the european union doesn't just walk
away from the issue again
as we've done after these outbursts of
jerusalem or gaza that
occurs frequently a comprehensive
solution might be difficult that's
granted but it should be possible to
move towards a more stable situation
after this but it requires
political determination and political
courage and i hope that
you can demonstrate that so why
specifically
do you think do you say that a ceasefire
may be coming i mean what's happening on
the ground what's happening
internationally to make you say that
uh i do apologize we're having problems
uh with the lines to guests
let me see if we can get carl built back
uh while we do that this is the
area around sterot in in southern israel
very close to the border with gaza
where we have seen sustained activity
from the israeli army
obviously this is an area that is within
range
of rockets fired by hamas militants
and we're now into the second week of
this
violence in the region as efforts
continue
to find a diplomatic solution and to in
the first
instance secure a cessation
of violence i i believe we do have carl
biltback
co-chair of the european council on
foreign relations apologies for the
technical issues
mr bilt i was just asking you
why you had said to me that you think
that a ceasefire
may be coming soon because that is what
normally happens i mean
these these conflicts over gaza that
they don't go on forever
at some point in time israel will say
that we've run out of a target list and
we will accept
a ceasefire and i hope hamas does the
same
but the important thing is what happens
thereafter that we just don't walk away
from the issue because the only thing
that is certain if that happens is that
the conflict is going to be back new
rockets new airstrikes new misery
and how do we build how do we build a
sustained
conversation a sustained dialogue and
diplomatic
effort to ensure that we don't have
these crisis points
and then more conversation how do you
keep the conversation going then to try
to work towards a longer-term solution
difficult difficult difficulty but the
first thing you have to do is to try to
do it
i mean in the last few years the
international community be that the
americans are the europeans have not
been very active on these issues
it is difficult it is hard it might fail
but if you don't try
it will not happen and and there are i
remember way back
10 15 years ago when we have this
outburst as well
then the eu was trying actively to
facilitate some sort of at least
temporary solution
so there are models that can be used in
order to
get a slightly better situation you say
that the core problem is the absence of
a two-state solution
um where where do you think
international efforts are
on that question nowhere
uh i mean the americans i mean the trump
administration was against the two-state
solution defector
divided administration seems to i can
understand that they seem to be
reluctant to engage because it's too
difficult
the europeans have been too divided
lately to be a particular active actress
netanyahu is against so it's difficult
so perhaps one should start with trying
to sort out them
issue by issue see can we do something
with garcia can we do something with the
issues in jerusalem can we do something
with something else
but just to walk away from the issue is
i think that's been demonstrated not
responsible
let me pick up on what you said uh about
joe biden
you don't think that the u.s is going to
engage in this you say because
they see it as simply too difficult
the obama administration in the second
term john kerry was the envoy
did make a very determined attempt to
move forward with the two state
solutions
and and failed no faults of that but
failed
of course part of that administration uh
bruised by that experience you think
i think washington is bruce by that
particular experience um
then of course trump tried to do
something entirely different that's of
the cards at the moment but i i would
hope that in spite of that experience
and in spite of perhaps understanding
that sort of a two-state solution within
the next few months is not
achievable to put it badly there that's
issues that needs to be dealt with
say garcia is an example of what can be
dealt with and must be there
it feels like the international
community needs to take this in small
steps because trying to clearly solve
the totality of this is impossible at
the moment so as you say it is about
small stages so what do you think
needs to be the next step
well the immediate step is obviously a
ceasefire
then perhaps i think one should start
perhaps with the gauss asia perhaps with
the jerusalem issue perhaps with some
issue
and then move gradually forward with
those particular issues i mean certainly
not giving up on a two-state solution
but perhaps doing more incrementally
instead of the big bang
okay carl built a former swedish prime
minister now co-chair of the european
council on foreign relations thank you
very much",20210518

to the violence between israel and the

second week israeli airstrikes on gaza
reached a new level of intensity in the
early hours of monday morning as the
military targeted the homes of islamic
jihad and hamas militants at least 200
people have been killed in the past week
including 59 children in the gaza strip
and 10 in israel so what might it take
to end the violence well in a moment
we'll talk to two people on either side
of the conflict who belong to the same
organization which is dedicated to
lasting peace and cooperation but first
take a look at this
[Music]
by
[Music]
okay well one of the people in that clip
is osama aliwat who joins me now from
jericho also joining me from tel aviv is
ayala shalif who works with the sama for
an organization created by former
fighters on both sides called combatants
for peace thank you both for joining us
here on the program ayala i'll begin
with you just help our audience
understand very briefly what your
organization aims to do
i think
first of all it aims to
put an end to the occupation
and we do it in different ways
but you you bring uh sort of people who
were combatants
together
to try and
get them to work on reconciliation and
cooperation just just help our audience
understand that
okay the movement was
built by
combatants who put down their weapons
and they understood
that violence is not a way
to move forward in any way
and they today
the movement is is bigger and
we work together
in
any way possible
to
forward this message
uh summer i'll i'll bring you into this
uh because we saw you in that clip there
you yourself uh were a palestinian
police officer you say that you've known
nothing but this conflict and you
started to really think about your place
in it from the age of about 14. how
difficult was it then to look at the
other side see the conflict uh you know
unfolding and and be able to say no i
want peace
it was
hi thank you first of all for having us
for paying attention to us and our work
this is a big support for us
for me at the beginning
this conflict was
something like i was built in i didn't
think who's right and who's wrong all
what i knew about the conflict that
there are some armed soldiers and these
armed soldiers are against us they come
to our schools they come to our houses
they demolish our houses and that's all
what i knew about israel israel
succeeded to show me how strong and
powerful
and how much they can hurt me but they
never tried to show me that there is
another voice inside israel there is
another people who don't agree with
what's going on and the minute i saw
this in 2010 after a long time of being
involved in
this circle of violence i understood
that there is another way
and there is different
face for this coin that israel is trying
to show us and there's partners on the
other side and together we can make it
better because keep ignoring the story
of each other keep ignoring the
narrative of each other will not take us
to anywhere and we have to find a way to
share this small place and not to divide
it into small gate to zero and there and
as long as
jewish people and palestinian people are
not free no one will be free as long as
i am not free the israelis also would
not be free so that's why we are
fighting together for the freedom for
both sides
i'm just gonna i'm just gonna bring in
uh ayala because that that is quite a a
strong point isn't it that no matter
what happens neither side is free till
both sides can live in peace
exactly
it is
it's like uh i i
the picture i always have in my head is
like a prisoner and a guard
both tied
so one side is has has a benefit but
they're both tied and nobody's free and
that's our situation here and
there's no way
of solving it through violence
only if you work together something that
osama also said is just being raised
believing that the other side is the
enemy how do you change that mindset how
do you help re-educate families and
people to
stop telling their children i i suppose
that the other side is the enemy
it's more than parents telling
children it's the whole system and you
said the word it's education
it someone needs to be in the head of
the pyramid that wants
to make a change and wants to work
together and then
the educational system has to change and
that that's what brought it and that's
what can stop it
uh education osama do you find when you
are speaking to other palestinians when
when they see the level of violence and
destruction in a place like gaza that
they are unwilling to to join the
movement the organization
actually people are afraid to join this
kind of organizations because as i
mentioned before israel is still
controlling the land either we accept it
or not even when we have palestinian
authority israel can enter to any city
and arrest anyone so people are afraid
of putting them in this themselves in
this risk and join the other side the
other thing is people are disappointed
actually because since the palestinian
authority signed the peace agreement
with israel israel is taking land beast
by peace and we will give up this whole
thing
but we are changing lives of people as
much as we can and through this change
we are doing education for example when
we go to harvest all of the trees for
the palestinians to protect them from
settlers we take palestinian children
and israeli children to meet when they
are young and to me to see each other as
a human being and not as enemy before
they go to exactly
is that helping
it helps a lot and i am as a
responsible of the education
department and combat transfer bees i
give lectures to palestinian students
israeli students teaching them about
peace resistance teaching them about
life under occupation teaching them
about the both the right of the what
people to live in this land and teaching
them about
how being playing the victim all the
time will not help anyone and we should
stop playing this game of who's more
victim than the other and start being
united together in order to save the
future of our kids
yeah
anywhere from this place indeed i'm just
going to bring in uh ayala and ayala we
don't have much time left but i just
wanted to ask i mean how do you feel the
entire system can now change how do you
think there can be some kind of lasting
peace and what your organization does
can be translated into something more
my hope is that the the current say
prime minister will
be
will change and it will bring a change
because it needs to be systematic it
helps what we do helps in in uh
where we work but for the whole system
to change
we need to
influence the whole system and if
the prime minister will change if
netanyahu will not succeed
to make a government
there's a chance
that the system might change especially
after all this violence that's erupted
here now it's like
i'm sorry but everybody everybody
has to see that there's no no
it goes nowhere it goes nowhere it's
just going to be happening again next
year or in two years
a solution
is needed
in a deep way not not just stopping
ceasefire now indeed ceasefire now but
then go on and and something more lost

hours of monday

minister benjamin netanyahu rejected
international appeals for a ceasefire
officials in gaza said that nearly 200
palestinians had been killed in the past
week
10 israelis died in rocket attacks
launched from
gaza well a series of attacks early on
monday
rocked gaza city for 10 minutes covering
a broader area than the raids 24 hours
earlier
in which 42 palestinians were killed one
local resident we spoke to said he had
never seen strikes of this magnitude the
israeli military said it had destroyed
15 kilometers of tunnels used by hamas
it also said israeli aircraft had hit
the homes of nine hamas commanders
meanwhile more rockets were fired from
gaza at the israeli cities of besheva
and ashkelon
no word yet though on casualties on
either side in these latest attacks
i spoke to our diplomatic correspondent
in jerusalem paul adams and asked if
there had been lenny let
up this morning from either side uh no
lucy in a word
more rockets fired at israel what about
an hour
or so ago fired at ashkelon and
some other towns in the south no reports
of
significant damage or casualties and we
are as you say
still waiting uh to get some indication
of the
damage caused by the israeli airstrikes
on gaza
overnight which clearly were very
substantial
indeed i think this is the second or
third night in which we have seen really
very very intense activity uh perhaps
the pace of activity
increasing uh as uh israel recognizes
that maybe time
is running short for uh to be
for it to be able to carry on this
operation um the
the israeli defense forces are saying uh
in a briefing this morning that this
operation will continue
uh for the time being that it may take a
little while longer
you mentioned the tunnels that were
attacked overnight
they were saying that this system which
they call the metro
under gaza consists they say of hundreds
of kilometers
of tunnels and they have been attacking
them relentlessly for several days
not to destroy every uh every every
uh stretch of tunnel but to particularly
target the
the connections the the nodes between
tunnels in an effort to make it
impossible for
hamas to operate uh in this network uh
quite interesting details about what
they're doing
and uh and also no sign that it's going
to come to an end any time soon
paul antonio guterres calling for an end
to what he calls
utterly appalling violence i mean where
are we at in terms of the diplomacy
well there's a lot of it going on but
but no discernible results so far an
american envoy has been here since
friday he has met israeli officials he's
met
israeli arab leaders because let's not
forget we had several
quite uh shocking violence on the
streets of israel between
jews and arabs and he has met
palestinian leaders
and there is also the involvement of the
un uh with their coordinator here in
jerusalem he is also conducting quite a
lot of discussions
one thing worth remembering about this
is that it's complicated by the fact
that
because the united states regards hamas
as a terrorist organization as do many
other countries
it has no direct contact so it has to
rely on mediation
involving other parties egypt and qatar
are both involved in those conversations
but so far to no obvious avail paul
adams there i'm joined now
by beltrue the independence middle east
correspondent in jerusalem bell lovely
to see you i know you've been speaking
to colleagues
and others in gaza today what have they
been telling you
well they said that last night was
pretty ferocious once again i got a
message from one of them at about 2
o'clock in this morning this morning
saying
that he had counted about 50 airstrikes
in less than 10 minutes
a lot of them are cowering at home with
their children again it's a reminder
that in gaza they don't have bomb
shelters
they don't have a system like the iron
dome they don't have any early warning
sirens although the israeli military say
that they do
often warn buildings especially
high-rise buildings before they hit them
in these kinds of intense levels of
bombardment as we had earlier this
morning
those warning systems are not put in
place so for many of the civilians they
don't know where these things
they don't know what the targets are
they don't know where it's going to land
and so they're sort of cowering in their
homes um but
as your correspondent said there it
looks like there wasn't as high
uh death toll as we had on friday
morning which was the highest death toll
in this week-long offensive well we're
hearing really heartbreaking stories on
both sides i know you've spoken
to a father who lost his entire family
and it seems like a miracle
except for his little baby boy
absolutely it was a strike that hit
during that really bad night so sort of
it was friday morning that took out an
entire home there were two families in
there actually um
part of one larger larger family his
wife and four children
were in that building the entire
building uh came down and
we thought that all 11 of them were
killed which is two
women and the rest children but rescuers
were able to bring out from the rebel a
five-year
five-month-old baby called alma the
father hadn't been in the house that
night he said his wife
had gone to have dinner with her
sister-in-law for eid
because this is you know a religious
holiday that's taking place at the
moment despite the war
she stayed the night with her
sister-in-law and that proved to be a
fatal decision
but his baby was pulled out miraculously
alive and is now being treated in gaza's
larger hospital
um ashifa but he of course is absolutely
heartbroken he said to me
his entire family was wiped out in an
instant and didn't know why his family
was targeted he said
their children they were women they'd
never fired rockets they were in their
special
clothes for eid having dinner together
when it happened it is a miracle that
the baby survived and you mentioned bel
he's being treated at the largest
hospital in gaza
we are hearing that two senior doctors
have been killed in some airstrikes
as well how have the medical services
and gaza been impacted by all of us
well i was speaking actually to a
spokesperson yesterday for medicine from
frontier who run a clinic for burns
units and supporting our shiva hospital
which is as i said is the largest
hospital
in gaza they said indirect fire
destroyed their entire sterilization
unit
they said that their staff is it was too
unsafe for them to move around it was
stuck at home
it was massively impeding their ability
to be able to treat the wounded
this is the case across the strip
actually the gaza's health ministry said
that
several different medical clinics and
hospitals had been hit not by direct
fire
i'll make that clear by indirect fire
and at the same time as you mentioned
two senior doctors were killed in their
homes
one of them gaza's only neurologist who
was killed with his five
children um in a massive bombardment on
his streets
in addition to that i've heard reports
from medics both international and
palestinian on the ground
that the roads surrounding shiva
hospital which is as i said gaza's
largest hospital
have been hit which has made it very
hard for ambulances to be able to get
access
to the medical center and made it very
hard for medics to be able to bring the
wounded in so
it's very very difficult at the moment
for them to be able to treat the wounded
and they say
you know this could mean that the death
toll is actually higher than it needs to
be
and what is happening bill in terms of
other infrastructure
in gaza what are you hearing about the
damage done to things like power lines
and what could potentially happen to
fuel and water supplies as well
well i was actually just speaking to uh
palestinian officials
yesterday about the fuel issue now gaza
already suffers from massive
electrical power outages at the moment
uh there's only four hours of power a
day for those families that actually
have access to the grid so there's also
places where they have
no power whatsoever and that is because
gaza is running off one
of only four turbines left of its power
plant and
it according to the their statistics
their fuel will run out basically
tomorrow which means that one turbine
will stop
working completely there is some power
lines coming from
israel but they've been severely
impacted it's only operating at about a
third of the power as it normally would
have
because several lines have been hit by
the fighting there is some confusion
over
who's responsible for that so the
israelis have said or israeli security
officials have said that
um rockets that have not made it over
the border are responsible for targeting
those lines
whereas the palestinians say it's the
air strikes but either way the same
outcome
is going to happen which is that people
across the across the strip which is
only 40 kilometers long
but home to 2 million will not have any
power that will impact hospitals
who will have difficulty trying to run
their icu units their ventilators and
the water supply because water pumps
will not be working
so we're talking about humanitarian
crises over humanitarian crises at an
incredibly difficult time
for the population of gaza well thank
you for joining us belle true the

in the latest israeli airstrikes among
them 10 children

thousand rockets in the last week
killing ten israelis

benjamin netanyahu israel's prime
minister convened his security chiefs
a cabinet meeting did not discuss a
ceasefire
on the way down to the gaza border are
some of the communities the government
here says must be safe from rockets
before it will stop its attacks israel's
leaders said the same thing
during the other wars with hamas
the israeli army showed off their
anti-missile system
iron dome they say it shoots down around
90 percent of the missiles fired out of
gaza
previous wars between israel and hamas
have ended with
mediation generally with egypt involved
leading to a ceasefire now
contacts have been made but it's a
difficult process because
each side needs to get to the the point
where they can say to their people that
the sacrifices
their damage the killing were worth it
if israel takes this to the next level
with a ground invasion of gaza that
process gets knocked on
further into the future the 2014 war
lasted for nearly two months iron dome
is one reason why israel suffers fewer
casualties than gaza
another is the weight of israel's
firepower
well civilians of course aren't our
target they never are but you do kill
them and any loss of life on both sides
of this conflict any loss of civilian
life is tragic again
it does happen an awful lot in gaza and
i i hear that and again
any any loss of civilian life is is
tragic it happens here as well
while we were there they launched
a volley of missiles was heading out of
gaza north towards the israeli town of
ashkelon iron dome didn't stop all of
them
but this wasn't a fatal attack
in gaza six-year-old susie esquintana
was pulled out of the rubble
her mother two sisters and two brothers
were killed
until he saw susie her father riyad
thought he was the only one left
thank god he said because one day she
might recapture the smiles
of all his daughters
the amer the israelis blame hamas
for the deaths of palestinian civilians
they say that hamas
effectively hides behind its own people
in america president biden and the white
house are saying that
israel has a right always
to defend itself biden's always been a
strong supporter
of israel but egypt while saying it
takes its mediation
duties very seriously is using harsher
language about the israelis things like
aggressors and occupying army

dump yet more misery on its residents
some 20,000 homes here were destroyed
and 880,000 damaged in this Summer's
conflict with Israel and until now few
repairs have been carried
out months this is I've come back to see
Abdul Karim Abu Ahmed an English teacher
we were hoping that they will
immediately
rebuild our houses but after 3 months we
feel now very frust rated they promised
us they will give us uh money to pay for
uh renting uh flat they didn't uh give
us concrete they didn't give us
equipment to rebuild so nothing
happened but in just the past few days
the way waiting has come to an end for
some a deal brokered by the UN Works
around Israel's blockade of Gaza so here
at this building firm there are some
signs of progress these men are waiting
to have their names checked against a
computerized system they then get a chit
of paper they can bring over to the
warehouse and exchange it for the bags
of cement that they're entitled
to Israel wants guarantees militants
won't take these Goods to rebuild
tunnels they can use used for
crossborder attacks so this firm has
special security clearance the cements
monitored to make sure it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands but the pace of
deliveries is very slow the manager says
reconstruction is now years behind
schedule we'll need a decade to rebuild
Gaza if the system continues like this
he tells
me the huge scale of Destruction means
it's taking longer than expected to
assess all the damage un officials also
blame Palestinian politics for delays in
reconstruction and say ultimately Israel
needs to lift its tight border
restrictions their efforts can only
achieve so much the mechanism is a
significant step it's important to make
sure that the families that were
affected by the conflict can rebuild
their homes it is not a replacement for
the lifting of the blockade I mean if
there's going to be peace and security
if it's going to be a stable Gaza uh
then the blockade needs to be lifted
for now there are only temporary
solutions being offered to gaza's deep
political problems that leaves many here
facing a long wait to return home and an
uncertain future yoland Nell BBC news",20141208
h8OCreZy_Zs,Tony Blair on whether Israel will allow aid into Gaza - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Tony Blair on whether Israel will allow aid into Gaza - BBC News.jpg,"myself and many others have been in
discussion with the Israeli government
about making sure the building materials
get into Gaza I I don't think in the end
that's going to be the problem actually
I think that there there is a an
agreement being worked out uh which I'm
reasonably confident about that will
allow construction material to go into
Gaza rebuild the infrastructure but also
for private housing um there's a whole
set of other measures we want to take in
order to help Gaza help his private
sector for example but I think the the
real question is you can reconstruct
Gaza but are we going to have a um a
lasting peace and make sure we don't go
back into the cycle of Destruction again
and that I think will also require a
political framework a political Horizon
and a a Palestinian politics that's
unified on the basis of of Peace So I
think it's these bigger political
questions that are really the issue it
was interesting I thought today the
Egyptian president Fat Al Sissi he
called for the vision of the Arab peace
initiative to be considered now just for
a viewer that would be full recognition
of the Jew Jewish state but only if it
gives up all land seized in the 1967
Middle East war and agrees to and I
quote open to interpretation a just
solution for Palestinian refugees what
did you think of that statement by
President
ali um I mean I think the Arab peace
initiative remains one of the most
important things that's happened in the
Middle East over the last couple of
decades it does provide a basis for for
going forward you know 67 borders with
agreed land swaps is essentially the you
know that's the as it were the
traditional formula for the borders of a
Palestinian state but I think my point
really is that you know you you could
probably take 90% of that conference
today from the International Community
from the Arab world and so on and they
would have rough agreement on the
parameters of a of a of an a of a deal
to create a Palestinian State the the
issue and the challenge is the politics
both Israeli and Palestinian that at the
moment aren't cohering in a way that
allow us to to take that that pretty
clear shared International vision and
make it a reality so that's why I say I
think the critical thing is really the
politics so how do you then get in there
and begin to try and battle the
ideological political positions that are
obviously so firmly
entrenched right I think the first thing
is if we're going to reconstruct Gaza it
should be done under the authority of
the Palestinian Authority president abas
and their prime minister prime minister
Amela and it's very important that that
process of of change in Gaza is led by
unified politics in other words Gaza and
West Bank together so Hamas and fata
which are the two Palestinian main
Palestinian parties have agreed that
they will have a process of
reconciliation we need that to happen
but we need it to happen on a basis of
Peace which also takes account of
Israel's security and the second thing
is that we need an Israeli
politics we need to have a a clear Way
Forward so that when the Palestinians
get into a negotiation they know there's
a serious political Horizon for
Statehood because otherwise they think
we're just going to go and talk and talk
and not come to an agreement so it's
it's as I say it's the political
challenge that I think is an even bigger
challenge than putting the bricks and
water back into Gaza which probably
probably can be done",20141012

there is quiet and Hamas is not able to
rearm themselves and something is put in
place so that they are demilitarized
then I think it's a good thing I think
everybody is tired and needs a rest and
needs to get back to a normal life I'm a
little bit skeptical as to whether it's
really going to hold and whether Hamas
will follow through this time as we know
they've broken their ceasefire time and
time again I think we've seen it before
um I don't think really solves anything
the whole Mi didn't solve anything we're
back where exactly where we were before
uh it's my opinion as long as they don't
want peace we're not going to have peace
uh they have great opportunities to have
economic growth and have peace and grow
they just don't want to do it so as long
as they don't want to do it we're not
going to have
peace I'm not really sure it will be I
think we'd have to go in and physically
remove the Rockets the missiles and the

way I could see it being quiet anytime

MOHLaf3qitE,Hamas & Israel reach long-term Gaza ceasefire - BBC News,data/en_BBCNews\Hamas & Israel reach long-term Gaza ceasefire - BBC News.jpg,"yes they have agreed on some points and
delayed other points for discussion in
one month time what the Palestinians and
the Israelis have agreed upon via the
Egyptian mediations is that the border
crossings between Gaza and Israel will
be open to allow aid supplies in also
construction material will be allowed
into the strip to help in the
Reconstruction process white scale
damage have be has befallen Gaza during
the war so finally construction material
will be allowed into the strip also the
fishing area for the Palestinian
fishermen will be expanded that's the
points both sides agreed upon however we
have more controversial issues like
releasing Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails h building a Seaport and
an airport for the Palestinians in Gaza
Strip that what they have repeatedly
demanded both sides will hold further
discussions about that in one month time
so it's finally a long-term ceasefire
agreed on between both sides after a
really tough process of negotiations
here in Cairo and what we understand is
that the Egyptian mediators kept
contacting both sides even after the
Palestinian and Israeli delegations left
Cairo a couple of days ago all right
Sally for now in Cairo thank you very
much indeed uh let's just go uh via uh
this live shot we have of Gaza the sky
is now uh clear uh no Rockets 5
certainly today although Israel
reporting that an Israel has been killed
and several injured near ashol let's go
live though to Quentin Somerville who
joins us uh from Gaza Quentin how are
they reacting to the news
there lots of gunfire in the air at the
moment uh Tim and right up until the
wire right up until we came on air there
were in fact Rockets leaving Gaza and
flying over uh into Israel within the
last hour we believe that three
Palestinians were killed in a bombing in
the Rafa Crossing in the South uh of
Gaza and one Israeli was killed uh just
across the border as a result of rocket
and mortar fire uh but the expectation
is here that this ceasefire deal is uh
has been
agreed there's more of that gunfire and
celebration you can probably hear uh
ceasefire has been ceasefire deal has
been agreed it's been a long time in the
in the coming 50 days we've seen a
number of ceas files I think our
counting is there have been eight
previous ceas files some of them just
for a few hours some of them for as long
as 5 days they haven't held uh but the
the Hope from people here in Gaza and I
expect people in Israel will be that
this time it will be different that
after 50 days and 2,000 people uh being
killed many hundreds of thousands of
people now homeless here in Gaza that
this deal might actually hold have you
got any more detail though about the
substance of this ceasefire uh will all
the borders be open will the blockade be
lifted well we don't have those details
yet we're told that the blockade will be
lifted the Egyptian and the Israeli
blockade but what does that really mean
how many um trucks will be allowed into
Gaza from the Israeli side will it be
200 a day will it be a thousand a day
those details haven't been released how
many uh people from Gaza will be able to
enter into Israel how uh how will they
then proceed with the thornier issues of
a sea port for Gaza uh will Hamas
prisoners be released those Hamas
prisoners who were arrested in the
occupied West Bank before this conflict
uh began and and and that was an issue
that really contributed uh to this
conflict so many many uh issues still
outstanding we believe that the
fundamentals are the blockade will be Li
lifted people here in Gaza will be happy
about that and the gunfire All Around Me
seems to indicate that that fishermen
will be able to fish further uh into the
Mediterranean and that rocket fire and
Israeli air strikes will stop",20140826

afternoon uh the after several days of
uh ceasefire they uh began shooting at
the biva and we uh retaliated and we'll
continue doing that uh these ceasefires
are pretty peculiar we seize and they
fired us again and again and again um if
they want this whole thing to go away
they need to stop shooting at us and
disarm Gaza and uh then we could uh
continue living side by side some will
though question the timing of course
when you you ended the seasar or indeed
whether you say Hamas ended this
ceasefire because of course it does
coincide with your strike the Israeli
air strike on a top Hamas
Commander yeah you know in any case uh
we're always uh looking to to get the
commanders of uh these Terror groups
we're we're you and I are in the same uh
boat here if I may say fighting radical
Islam I mean we're talking about the
Islamic State we're talking about Hamas
we're talking about radical Islamic
states that want to uh create a big
caliphate from Baghdad through Tel Aviv
into London whenever you identify a mega
terrorist you have to take him out like
Bin Laden like El bagdadi if possible
let's talk about the people that who are
being killed because whatever way you
look at this there unequal number of
casualties more than 2,000 Palestinians
killed mostly civilians that against 66
Israelis mostly military me the figures
just don't add up why are you killing
innocent
people we're retaliating to uh over
3,000 Rockets shot at us let's make no
mistake Hamas has decided to shoot
rockets and missiles on Israel from
within uh civilian concentrations this
is a very cynical and cowardly approach
but can I ask you H how many uh Israelis
need to die for us to gain your sympathy
Hamas want you to lift The Siege I mean
why is it so difficult for Israel to do
that if it will bring about
peace no we have no Siege there's no
Siege going on in Gaza every day there's
uh dozens and dozens of um shiploads or
or um trucks of uh food and medicine and
humanitarian needs flowing into Gaza
that's not a problem the problem is that
what they try and and bring into Gaza is
also weapons and more concrete to build
more tunnels in order to kill more
Israelis and that's unacceptable so the
general rule is anything that's
humanitarian will go in anything that
can uh create weapons in order to kill
Israelis we won't allow in very quickly
yes or no you going to go back to those
peace talks in
Cairo no I I uh think that the those
talks are over uh once Kamas has started
shooting at us missiles again and again
we're not going to uh conduct talks
under uh a threat of uh shooting uh
we're facing a very
determined radical Islam group and we
have to beat it and we will",20140820

unilaterally we took out the 22

settlers by
force we handed over to the Palestinians
a free open
Gaza which is a beautiful strip of a of
a beautiful beach they could have
developed it for
tourism for fishing for

frankly why are they fighting what are
they shooting what are the reasons we
left what is the purpose they want to be
free they are free there are people
critics of the present government who
say that their voices are being drowned
out and that they're not being heard and
that Israel is in danger of losing its
democratic tradition is that a fair
comment I was for the
unal withdrawal from
Gaza actually supported Shan that was
the least expected person to do so he
made a very tough decision and I
supported him when I did it I thought my
God we're going to releve the kazian
people we offer them the best without
any conditions we didn't ask anything in
in
town and people say what if they'll
start shooting at us I says look why
should
they now I have my problem to explain
they say why did you agree to it
and the furthermore say if we shall do
it in the West Bank it may happen the
same look we have to give some answers
not only to the
terrorist but to mothers and children
around Gaza that every night they have a
rain of missiles over their heads why
what for if these talks in Egypt fail uh
these talks that are being moderated by
the Egyptians between Israel and the
Palestinian factions would you support
this government and those who want it to
go back into Gaza militarily and to
defeat finish the job against Hamas no I
don't think it will be
necessary and I think we should look for
a better solution than that we don't
want to raise the
Flames we don't want to increase the
number of victims who wants
it who wants it
and look uh it's very
symbolic that The Negotiator between now
the Hamas and US is an Arab
country and we trust the Arab country We
Trust edpt we don't have any problems
contrary to the
protesters and the one cannot say that
Egypt is particularly for Israel and
against the Palestinians it's nonsense
but Egypt is for peace and Against
Terror and this is the
question and that what we have really to
fight for and change the situation now
people say it's becoming worse I don't
know you know 50 years ago nobody here
believed that we shall ever have peace
with Egypt we
have nobody belied that we shall have
peace with Jordan before Syria we
have nobody believed that we can do
anything with arat we did so all the
pessimists have a short
memory and all The Optimist have a long
memory and a good
hope and I'm going to change it because
some articles or some demonstrators I
think I'm right not them I seek
peace I don't seek war I don't want to
to kill
anybody for me when I see a child being
killed it's a tragedy a human
tragedy but there were 400 children
killed in Gaza I mean that that's an
awful lot I mean that is why I don't
know how many suppose but
why because they use them as a shield
the journalist we there saw
it tell me what Would You Do You See
with a child on a teras and somebody
shoot at
you and other men who shoot El has a
child on on his lab what would you
do you cannot simplify
it it's not our preference it's not our
choice but that has been one of the
reasons you mentioned I only ask because
you mentioned the the protests in London
and in Paris that has been one of the
reasons why these protests were so big
this time do you think Israel has been
stung by the level of criticism of its
of its my criticism about them I never
heard him tellas to stop
shooting then they supposed to start the
demonstration why were they
quiet when they saw that Rockets are
flying over the houses of
aots that is really totally devoted this
I didn't hear their voice maybe if they
would raise then their voice we wouldn't

white smoke of Palestinian Rockets being
fired from Gaza towards Israel and we've
also seen and heard a number of
incredibly loud explosions which
indicate that Israel as it says has
resumed its air strikes on Gaza as I
speak to you now I haven't heard reports
of casualties uh but very clearly there
will be a sense of fear among the
residents of Gaza just looking around
the streets I can see very very few
people uh out and about at the moment it
is of course the day of rest but I think
many people will have heard the fact
that the ceasefire is over and they will
not be confident enough to go out into
the street and to resume their normal
lives Hamas says it's not yet got
anything from those indirect
negotiations uh in Cairo it wants an end
to Israeli restrictions an ability to
use the ports of Gaza an ability uh to
get people to come and go from the
borders but Israel says that its
priorities are very different it wants
Hamas and other groups including Islamic
Jihad to disarm for good and so there is
clear gap between those sides the
Israeli side and the Palestinian side

themselves listening to and experiencing

these images the government says the
killing of civilians in Gaza is
intolerable a Slaughter but it won't say
Israel's response is disproportionate or
criminal and it's that lack of
unequivocal condemnation that prompted
this foreign office minister to resign
the first Muslim woman in cabinet
decided she could no longer support her
government's foreign policy over the
last four weeks I have done everything
that I can both at formal meetings and
informal meetings trying to convince my
colleagues that our current policy on
Gaza is morally indefensible that it's
not in our interests it's not in British
interest and that it will have
consequences for us both internationally
and here at home uh but in the end I
felt the government's position wasn't
moving and therefore I had to on AO a
principal resign the Prime Minister on
holiday in Portugal was informed of her
decision shortly before it was announced
on social media Mr Cameron's spokesman
said he regretted her resignation others
had stronger language I think this is a
disappointing and frankly unnecessary
decision the British government is
working with others in the world to
bring peace to Gaza and we do have now a
tentative ceasefire which of course we
all hope will hold lady vary once stood
for election in her hometown of jeury in
Yorkshire and some there today thought
she had done the right thing I have to
agree with her on that so I may not
agree with her other policies whatever
but I have to agree with this but I I
support her I think good yes yes I think
Israel has just gone beyond what can I
say s Avari has long been a supporter of
David Cameron without ever being part of
his inner circle I am proud that I can
stand here with the first Muslim woman
in a shadow cabinet or cabinet in s aasi

the world with him a symbol perhaps that
the Tory party was changing but she was
also outspoken and mocked his Reliance
on fellow
alaton in his response to Lady vsy David
Cameron says that he has expressed grave
concern about civilian casualties and
called on Israel to exercise restraint
but her resignation means he's now under
much greater pressure to go further
pressure that's not just coming from
labor it's a proper principal
resignation over a very serious matter
of international policy and I like her
would like the United Kingdom to have a
more constructive policy I think people
around Britain have been shocked by the
casualties and suffering that we've seen
in Gaza and I hope that David Cameron
will reflect on what she says in her
resignation letter and change his

I'm not
seeing any real effort to say wait a
minute why haven't we had a solution
until now and what can be different this
time around here's a couple of
encouraging things first of all you have
a United Palestinian delegation in Cairo
uh you have the the leader recognized by
the world president abas you also have
Hamas and other factions there I think
that's positive going forward if that
can be encouraged second L the Egyptians
seem to have shifted in the course of
this conflict from pursuing a vendetta
against Hamas they have their own
domestic struggle with the Brotherhood
they saw this as an extension of that
domestic problem they seem to have
shifted to a position which says maybe
it's better as a new Egyptian regime
that we prove we can actually be useful
as a mediator but other than that we're
not seeing that much that is encouraging
very important your your your last
segment
some people tend to think ah this whole
problem is rockets that began a month
ago right much bigger issues can you
resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict
RIT large and can one end this situation
where garans are living in an open air
prison is enough pressure being put on
Israel by the US in particular to come
up with some kind of viable solution to
actually sit down and come up with
something well of course we we're just
off the back of nine months of us
sponsor said peace talks people will
remember that Secretary of State John
Kerry shuttled back and forth intensely
uh during that period that ended late
March early April nothing came out of it
and I think that what you have is the
problem that continues to this day that
the Israelis really don't feel they have
to make this choice there's almost an
impunity that Israel has gotten used to
I would argue it's a luxury that doesn't
really serve the Israelis because they
get dragged in further into Gaza they
themselves don't have a future I don't
think until the Palestinians have
security have freedom have their rights
the Americans don't seem to be doing
anything to change that equation neither
do the Europeans because we just heard
from Mustafa bhushi again here on BBC
World News something that we hear from
Palestinians all the time if there was
not occupation there would be no
resistance this effect they say would be
solved in terms of the aggression coming
from Hamas is that even viable or
possible that the occupation could end
of course the occupation can end and of
course until there is an end to
occupation the human nature is to say
wait a minute if someone's denying me my
basic freedoms I'm going to do something
about it I would rather people did what
Mustafa barouti uh calls for which is
nonviolent resistant sanctions on Israel
rather than Rockets but as long as the
occupation continues of course there'll
be
resistance an equation an incentive
structure has to be created for Israel
whereby it's more costly to continue the
occupation than it is to end the
occupation we know how to do that we've
had examples in the past like South
Africa those aren't being applied to
Israel it's sad that this is what might
be necessary but by now it seems that
that is what will be necessary",20140805

they say and they add the world has
failed us has failed to protect
protection of civilians is an expression
we do not want to hear anymore many
commented I also call on all parties to
respect the sanctity of un premises and
to exercise the highest precaution in
the conduct of military operations that
affect civilians in this
region that the attack on the shelter in
jabalia came only six days after a
strike on a designated unra emergency
shelter in banun caused multiple
injuries and fatalities to internally
displaced people taking Refuge there and
making the call all the more in
Urgent there is another challenge in our
operational field to which I want to
draw attention on three occasions we
have found in empty unra facilities
Rockets belonging to Armed groups in
Gaza we immediately alerted all relevant
parties to their existence and we
strongly condemned placement of weapons
in our
schools unra is now working with un
Partners to improve procedures to
address such violations in a manner that
does not compromise the safety of Staff
or civilians including
unra
beneficiaries it should also be said
that these discoveries do not in any way
justify attacks on unra facilities and
in particular ones Sheltering
idps unra takes robust measures to
closely monitor all its facilities to
which it has access in an effort to
prevent misuse by combatant and other
parties dear members of the council
allow me to turn to the most difficult
challenge facing unra in Gaza today we
are currently hosting over
220,000 internally displaced people a
number which has grown every day of the
conflict and at an accelerated Pace in
the last week this is four times higher
than the peak number of displaced people
during the conflict in 2008 and
2009 I am not here referring to the tens
of thousands of displaced in Gaza that
have found temporary shelter with most
families only to those that are
registered in unra schools we are doing
everything possible to provide the displ
with minimum
needs food mattresses and blankets but
we are now into the fourth week of mass
displacement in facilities unequipped to
shelter large numbers for such a
duration conditions are increasingly
dire in the shelters there is no water
for Hygiene very few showers and
latrines are totally inadequate disease
outbreak is beginning with skin
infections scabs and others there are
thousands of pregnant women in our
schools deliveries are precarious and we
are shelting Sheltering newborn infants
in these appalling conditions our
ability to mitigate this situation is of
course heavily restricted by ongoing
hostilities we are gravely concerned
about this situation equally we are
gravely concerned about any possible
additional displacement that will drive
up the numbers in our shelters with as
many as 2,500 displaced people residing
in schools and an average of 80 people
to a classroom we have exceeded the
tolerable limits we can accommodate it
is therefore with alarm that I have
received accounts of new instructions
from the Israeli military to
Palestinians to evacuate the zun area of
Gaza City and areas in the vicinity of
Kan Yunis in view of these facts of the
shelling affecting unra schools on six
occasions I believe the population is
facing a precipice and appeal to the
International Community to take the
steps necessary to address this extreme
situation should further large-scale
displacement indeed occur the occupying
power according to International
humanitarian law will have to assume
direct responsibility to assist these
people dear members of the council the
new reality being created before our
eyes in the occupied Palestinian
territory in Israel is not sustainable
under any circumstances the humanitarian
and political costs grow by the day with
each death and injury with the
continuing destruction of infrastructure
vital to the life of the Palestinian
people in Gaza and with the continuing
violations of international law as I
have stated on previous visits to Gaza
the rocket firing on Israeli cities and
endangering Israeli civilians is
unacceptable and must cease we all
aspire to see a middle east in which its
people share common interest a stake in
each other's well-being and a commitment
as the Secretary General recently said
to peace Justice and security for all in
the region this cannot happen under the
conditions of military occupation and
those caused by the pitiless conflict
now unfolding it is past time for an
immediate and unconditional ceasefire to
be agreed by parties and called for by
the council in its recent statement
allow me also to add my voice to those
calling for the redress of the
underlying conditions that fuel this
conflict and the violence that repeats
itself in full view of the world in
other words a ceasefire while
immediately required to save lives is
not enough it is not conceivable to
Simply return to the situation existing
before this conflict not withstanding
Israel's legitimate security concerns
the illegal blockade of Gaza must be
lifted this small territory is home to
1.8 million people who face the prospect
that it will become unlivable in a
matter of only a few years unless urgent
steps are taken by the International
Community to enable the development of
Gaza and in the ensuring security for
all in the region unra truthful to its
mandate will remain steadfast in its

amount uh amounts of rockets uh that
have only one goal to shoot on the
cities of Israel to uh Herm civilians
just civilians uh they they have no uh

Israel made a withow in 2005 but since
then Hamas keeps on shooting rockets on
our cities and our children and
unfortunately Miss hot Valley I have to
say there were no rockets in this school
the UN had removed them before this
offensive began the UN told Israel 17
times of the location of this school
Israel knew there were 3,000 people
Sheltering there again how do you
justify would like to remind you I would
like to remind you since this military
operation has started because Hamas
decided to shoot and fire Israel's
cities and Israel's children uh they
were found thousands thousands of
rockets in chifa in the hospital in G
particular un schools in un schools I
have to correct you in this particular
case we spoke to the UN less than an
hour ago to the man who runs these
schools there were no rockets in that
school there was no warning given to
them and they told Israel 17 times of
the location of the school and who was
there so again I would like to remind
you throughout this military operation
time after time uh Israeli Army found
rockets in those un schools you can't
deny this fact uh specifically if you
can say if if there are mistakes that
are done in a military operations of
course uh are you asking U me if Israel
deliberately is harming children
definitely not Israel is doing
everything in order to prevent those
harms but unfortunately Kamas leadership
at this moment still using the uh
civilians in Gaza uh in order to use
those pictures you you enjoy uh showing
to the world uh instead of using the
Army in Israel that is saying time after
time to the children in
don't cooperate with these people now I
would like to remind you that Israel
didn't go to this military operation uh
uh because we came up in in the morning
and we' decided to go to this military
operation we did that because we needed
to defend ourselves defend our children
10,000 Rockets were shoot to Israel's
border since 2005 those were against
children in Israel in military
elementary schools in Israel many many
hundreds now of children have died
Palestinian children have died there are
not many people in the International
Community who believe now that Israel is
doing its very best not to kill
civilians and what is the most densely
populated part of the world many people
are asking and I'd like you to explain
to us what the moral line is for Israel
now where does it
stop okay
unfortunately um as you know uh there
was an Egyptian offer on the table for a
ceasefire that Kamas refused to accept
time after time Hamas wants to get
reward for the fact it's shooting on our
cities and on our children now I want to
say that Israel can sit quietly and
peacefully if it wouldn't have been
Hamas again trying time after time to
kidnap children uh would like to remind
you that three children were kidnapped
and murdered in the most uh cruel way uh
by Hamas and Time After Time Israel
needs to defend itself now no uh proof
at the moment uh that the international
Comm Community is offering us uh and
after that going to demilitarize
demilitarize so can I can I ask you
about that we have heard from Hamas and
we have heard from fata and Islamic
Jihad as well that they will not accept
any ceasefire offer unless we see a
lifting of the siege of Gaza do you
think that your leader Benjamin
Netanyahu will accept that condition
ever of course not um as you as you know
uh unfortunately uh no one in the world
is doing the work for Israel um if
wouldn't have been our soldiers that now
cleaning Gaza from the terror tunnels so
those T tunnels that were supposed to be
outside of Israel uh as part of uh
elementary schools kindergartens so if
you see Benjamin Netanyahu says he will
not accept this when do you think this
will come to an end how long will this
go on
for uh the truth is if Hamas would have
decided to uh to say I'm not going to
use uh this uh Terror power anymore it
would have stopped unfort we know how

slept next to their parents on the floor
of a un of a classroom in a un
designated shelter children killed in
their sleep this is surely an affront to
all of us a source of universal shame
today the world stands disgraced we've
visited the site we've gathered evidence
we've analyzed fragments we've examined
craters and other damage our initial
assessment is that it was Israeli
artillery that hit this school in which
3,300 people had sought Refuge we
believe there were at least three
impacts it's too early to give a
confirmed official death toll but we
know that there were multiple civilian
deaths and injuries including women and
children and the unre guard our guard
who was trying to protect the site these
are people who were instructed to leave
their homes by the Israeli Army so we
condemn in the strongest possible terms
this serious violation of international
law by Israeli forces and to be clear
there was no
warning we gave the precise location of
the jabalia elementary girls school and
the fact that it was housing thousands
of internally displaced people this was
communicated to the Israeli Army 17
times 17 this of course to ensure its
protection the last of those calls was
at 10 minutes to 9 last night just hours
before this fatal shelling draw your own
conclusions we're waiting to get a
reaction from somebody representing the
Israeli government but I'm sure that
they would point out according to the UN
itself uh the UN revealed that a cash of
rockets was found at one of its schools
in Gaza and that is the third case of
its kind so Rockets were being used it
would appear uh deliberately in areas
that you're trying to protect well
several points first of all we have on
three separate occasions found rockets
in schools which were mothballed for the
summer and which were empty they were
discovered as a direct result of our
inspections we iMed imediately notified
all the relevant parties strongly
condemned the groups that did this as a
flagrant violation of our neutrality
Point number one point number two there
is absolutely no evidence that we can
find so far of militants launching
Rockets from that school that was hit
and thirdly I hope when you speak to the
Israeli Army representatives and spokes
people you're going to speak to ask them
when even if there had been some rockets
in that school was that a justification
for a direct hit I mean what you'd be
accusing them of and I'm certainly not
is of directly targeting a school where
there were 3,300 people but let me make
it clear we are not saying this was
direct shelling we have simply condemned
it we've identified um who was who had
done this we've said it's artillery it's
Israeli artillery but these are points
which you need to put to the Israeli
Army",20140730

very small so we're going to have to

operation along the sides you can see
that there's a lot of work has gone in
there's wiring there was electricity in
here and there's a floor there's a roof
it's not quite tall enough for somebody
to stand comfortably but the Army
believes it was big enough to allow
several militants to pass through here
and they say that that was the aim at
the nearest kibuts the nearest Israeli
Community is only a few hundred meters
away and just yesterday a tunnel like
this was used by a group of Palestinian
militants they managed to cross the

in this conflict and as the UN secretary
uh General there said most of them are
women and children will Israel now pause
stop and change its rule of Engagement
uh every death is a tragedy in fact it's
not true by the way that the majority
are women and children the majority as
far as the figures that we've seen some
80% are actually men of fighting age but
obviously every death Every Woman every
child every individual who's not a
militant it's an absolute tragedy it's
really it's a double tragedy we we we
we're we're sad because of the loss of
life but we're also sad because
unfortunately Gaz are in the hold is in
the hold of a terrorist organization
Hamas which is literally putting these
people in the front line but if we look
at uh the images that we've been seeing
uh of that un's shelter in bitth hananon
that was targeted the majority of them
were children the fact is if you look at
the UN just over the last couple of
weeks we've had two cases where the UN
has admitted that un School have
actually been used as storehouses for
missiles for rockets and missiles and
when you think about what that means you
have a terrorist organization that is
placing within schools we've seen houses
houses where civilians and children are
are booby trapped one of the most
fundamental humanitarian principles is
let us try and leave civilians out of
the equation unfortunately you know when
every democracy thinks that the goal of
a military is to protect their civilians
we have Hamas that thinks that the goal
of civilians is to protect their weapons
indeed but that particular School the UN
has said and ban kimun has just said was
full of uh civilians and the IDF were
given the coordinates for that
particular once again the fact is that
particular incident is still under under
investigation and the fact is the UN
itself is still investigating that
incident it's not clear what is clear is
that it's made absolutely clear that
there were terrorist organizations Hamas
firing from the V vicinity of the school
so it is absolutely not clear that the
casualties tragic casualties were caused
by Israel it's worth remembering that
some 10% of Hamas missiles never leave
the Gaza Strip they actually land on
their own population it's an absolutely
tragic situation but your strategy it's
not working is it when civilians are
killed when this number of civilians are
killed the strategy isn't working
Israel's strategy is not working um the
fact is in a situation there is no
democracy that has found a Fail Safe Way
dealing with brutal terrorist
organizations that hide in civilian
areas but as we're talking now Israel
has managed to uncover some 30 terrorist
tunnels that run from the Gaza Strip
under Israel in an attempt to blow up or
kidnap Israelis and manag to
decommission them we estimate that of
the 12,000 rockets and missiles that
Hamas has in the Gaza Strip many of them
long range missiles that have been
smuggled in from
Iran system though the Iron Dome
protects Israeli citizens from these
Rockets but the people in Gaza are
densely populated area do not have that
level of protection the I'm not going to
apologize for the fact that more
Israelis haven't been killed the fact is
75% of Israel's population some 5
million people have to leave their lives
Within Reach of bomb shelters and even
Iron Dome doesn't work in every
circumstances but as far as the Gaza
Strip is concerned when you think about
the miles and miles of concrete
reinforced tunnels some 20% of the
building equipment shipped into Gaza for
the purposes of building schools and
hospitals why doesn't Hamas allow people
to go and protect of children dying
homes
flattened you pause for a second and
think this
we we absolutely appalled but we also
have to remember that Hamas
unfortunately is relying on the World to
care about Palestinian civilians more
than it does itself we have one side in
this equation which is causing a which
is committing a double War crime
targeting our civilians hiding behind
their civilians Israel committing war
crimes no absolutely not the if
civilians are being killed and the un uh
has uh indicated that they're they're
concerned that Israel is committing a
war crime would you say Israel is then
is Israel is engaging in serious
attempts serious legal advice working
closely with other democracies in how to
deal with this but you have to remember
that when a terrorist organization hides
from behind civilians saying that you
have cart blanch saying that you have
free range to do anything you like is
simply not an option not an option for
Israel and not option for same that
Israelis are uh you know air strikes
against civilians air strikes against I
don't think I think the I think more and
more and you have to look at public
opinion survey in the Gaza Strip to
realize how disappointed people are with
the Hamas leadership they can't speak
publicly because they are under threat
of gun they are intimidated but quietly
they realize that Hamas has done nothing
to increase the prosperity of their now
the Palestinian people have nowhere to
go and Rockets are being fired on them
day and night the fact is we are making
it absolutely clear we are taking on
additional risk Israeli soldiers we send
in ground troops because shooting from
the air is more of a risk we give
advanced notice of where we are actually
going to be attacking to try and enable
school is here and the fact if we think
about the fact that within the Gaza
Strip of 15 to 20,000 Hamas militants
with 12,000 missiles in that situation
to try and limit the amount of damage
the damage that we've done shows that
we've been taking extraordinary care in
extremely difficult circumstances uh
Ambassador we'll just uh keep you there
for a second because I'd like to bring
in Mustafa bouti who's a member of the
Palestinian legislative Council and head
of the Palestinian national initiative
he joins me now from rala we've been
speaking to uh amb TP here and he is
saying that thousands of rockets are are
being fired on Israeli civilians so what
will it take for Hamas to stop these
Rockets yeah thousands of rockets and
nobody is killed it's a a simple
psychological warfare that I I I don't
want to see but in reality Israel is not
just not a democracy as he claims but
Israel is behaving like a fascist
country when when they don't recognize
the fact that they are killing children
and women and continue the propaganda of
Defending such unacceptable behavior and
when the racism in Israel and among
Israeli leadership reaches a point where
a member of keset elite shaid stands in
the Israeli Parliament and says we
should kill all Palestinian women so
that they would not give birth to
Palestinian children who are snakes this
particular Behavior this is a language
the SE when there is a call for a
ceasefire Hamas continues to fire these
Rockets no let me cl explain and I am
aware of all the positions and I've been
talking to them this morning Hamas and
all Palestinian groups are unified in
accepting and demanding ceasefire
immediately because we want this
horrible attack on our people in Gaza to
stop we want this attack that has killed
so far 1,34 people mainly 90% of them
are civilians and the fact that person
is a civilian but in in at an age that
makes at an age where he can be in an
army does not justify killing him he's a
civilian we are talking about 6,000
people injured what will it take for the
Palestinians the Palestinian leadership
to come to the negotiating table so that
their people do not continue to
experience this level of
Bloodshed what we need is Israel's
acceptance of two things first of all to
stop immediately their operation in Gaza
to stop the attack on Gaza to stop the
aggression on Gaza and to accept to lift
The Siege on the people of Gaza because
The Siege on Gaza is causing the worst
humanitarian crisis ever it has been
responsible for the fact that the
poverty level is so high it has it has
been responsible for the fact that 90%
of the people cannot have drinkable
water according to International
standard it is responsible for the fact
that H there is a big seage problem in
Gaza it is responsible for the fact that
fishermen cannot fish in the sea and the
tunnels the tunnels were an act of
self-defense they can all be abolished
tomorrow if Israel stops these acts and
let's remember that this is not just
about Gaza Gaza is only a small tiny
problem everything started with the West
Bank because the whole aggression
started by Israel was started in the
West Bank when 27 Palestinians were
killed while they were peacefully
demonstrating when Israel conducted an
act of collective punishment arresting
no less than 1,000 people including our
members of parliament and the cause of
everything is the occupation there has
been an occupation that has been there
for 47 years and has transformed into a
system of aparti and segregation Mr isra
does not want to stop occupation that'ss
has said that uh uh the people of
Palestine are very disappointed in Hamas
and the Palestinian leadership are you
letting your people down by by not
coming and having serious discussions
with the
Israelis on the contrary people are
disappointed with Israel not with Hamas
or any other Palestinian political
faction in reality president Abbas has
been conducting negotiations with Israel
for 21 years all he got is more
expansion of settlements all he got is a
system of enslavement of our people well
he obviously has isra was the one that
broke Israel was the one that broke
negotiations that were conducted by Mr
Kerry so Israel Netanyahu is saying the
following he does not want two State
solution he does not want one state
solution so what does he want a system
of enslavement a system of Oppression a
system of aparti we will never ever
accept This Ti fat continue if Hamas
doesn't stop the Rockets uh Israel will
continue with with its air strikes no no
Hamas is ready to stop all the Rockets
actually as I said these Rockets did not
did not kill really people most of the
people people who were killed on the
Israeli side and I don't want anybody to
be killed but out of the 44 people
killed 42 Were Soldiers invading Gaza
Soldiers the the those who are killed
are women and children if the Iron Dome
wasn't there then more Israelis would
get
killed well luckily they were not and we
don't want them to die but on the other
hand when I see an ambassador of a
country that claims to be a democracy
who doesn't care about the fact that
1,33 people people have been killed
mostly children and women and civilians
when I see a man who doesn't care about
the fact that 30 families were
completely eliminated including the
father the mother the grandfather the
grandsons the children they were all
eliminated when I see a man who doesn't
care about the fact that 6,000 people
are injured and he thinks that we are
subhuman beings then this is
unacceptable the fact is that Israeli
propaganda is trying to dehumanize
Palestinians to justify an OP that is
unacceptable I'll just bring in uh
Ambassador t uh as a WR of reply um it's
absolutely shocking to hear somebody
representing an organization that has
deliberately put men women and children
In Harm's Way to protect its terrorist
leaders who are hidden in the basement
of hospitals the fact is if Hamas was to
stop
firing we don't want a screaming match
here but Mr bouti has said but don't
mislead the public you know me very well
and you can't CL fact five times over
the last few weeks has accepted
ceasefires including the Egyptian
proposal supported by the Arab the
United during those humanarian windows
we've seen Hamas continuing to fire
rockets and celebrate the death of
Israeli civilians which of course is
something that no Israeli would ever do
this is not true because those who are
dying are Palestinian civilians not
Israeli civilians and you cannot mislead
the world anymore the world already
knows the facts and the reality you
cannot continue to mislead the world
about the fact that you are occupying
another people and oppressing them and
this cannot continue we need our freedom

been intercepted some Israelis have been
injured but so far no one has been
killed just how this latest escalation
came about is inevitably the subject of
debate but a climate of heightened
tension was created by the kidnapping

already poisonous 8 months of us

says the blockade is vital for its own

are already refugees the role of Egypt
is vital in all this while the Muslim
