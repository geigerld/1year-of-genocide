Israel says 14 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza this weekend marking some of the heaviest troop losses for Israel since its ground operation began there has been more heavy fighting Israeli strikes hitting Central and Southern Gaza on Sunday Israel says it has achieved almost complete operational control over Northern Gaza it's also said it's planning to expand its ground offensive against Hamas considered a terrorist group by the EU and the US Israel says that means shifting campaign to gaza's South where most displaced Palestinians have fled this as the Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry says more than 160 people have been killed by Israeli forces in the past day they are doing what they can to pull anyone alive from under the debris every day people across the Gaza strep wake up to new scenes of Devastation often all they find is dead buddies but sometimes they're lucky they rescued me from under the rubble to take me to Abu Al naer hospital they treated me there may God protect them it's destruction the children were screaming the children's mental health is affected the injured were on the street me and four others were retrieved from under the rubble in the southern city of ru an Israeli air strike destroyed a house and damaged several others in a refugee camp in nearby canun the attacks also flattened several buildings this area is designated safe there are thousands of displaced and a few meters away from us there's an office for unra where there are more than 40,000 displaced to the east of us is the agency's clinic and schools with each School housing no less than six or 7,000 displaced this area in general is designated safe this is the Safety and Security that Israel claims es calls for a ceasefire grow Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the fighting will continue the war exacts a very high price from us but we have no choice but to continue fighting so far our forces have eliminated many thousands of terrorists we're continuing with all the force until the end until victory until we reach all our goals his comments coming as Israel lost 14 soldiers in Gaza in two days that brings the total number of losses among Israeli troops to 152 as the fighting continues Hamas run Health officials say more than 20,000 people have been killed there let's get a across to Jerusalem where journalist Samy SLE has more for us Sammy thank you for taking the time let's take a look first at Israel's claims to have taken almost complete operational control of Northern Gaza and that is now looking to focus efforts on the south what can we expect from this what does this tell us well we've seen that this control means that Israel has succeeded in Breaking the Chain of Command within Hamas in the city of Gaza and in the surrounding area but what Israel is facing is a kind of a urban Guerilla Warfare launched by small cells sometimes individuals who have been left behind and they're continuing to fight the Israeli forces so this means that there's no end to this war in site H Israel is now going to focus more on the area ofun this is where the major battles are taking place the major ground operations after kanun there's still the camps in the balah area uh but it is a difficult if as many analysts here are saying to see how this war will actually end and we've heard that at least 14 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza just this weekend that's bringing the death toll to more than 150 since the start of Israel's ground offensive this is obviously a very sensitive issue within Israel do you think that the rising death toll will affect support internally for netanyahu's military campaign well I think one has to differentiate between the support to netan and the support to the campaign Nan is is not popular he was not popular before the 7th of October and his popularity has dropped down a lot uh but by and large the isra public does believe that the campaign should continue that crushing the Hamas should not stop and it also doesn't look the way the other International communities viewing the desperate situation of the gazan population the hunger all of these things the Israeli public is is looking at it in a very different way in fact what we see the public is a is a shift to the right and what we are expecting to see is the rise of more Hardline positions in this period thank you so much for that update that's a journalist Sami Sak in Jerusalem we very much appreciate your time now Israel's bombardment of Gaza has forced the cancellation of Christmas festivities in nearby Bethlehem the biblical birthplace of Jesus the city in the Israeli occupied West Bank would usually be full of tourists and pilgrims but the Crowds Are absent this year as is the traditional large Christmas tree many of bethlehem's residents are in mourning over the devastation in Gaza which is just 50 km away we have our correspondent Yan Philip Schultz reporting from Bethlehem and he's described for us how different the atmosphere there is this year very different no big celebration this year it's an incredibly sad atmosphere here in Bethlehem as you can see behind me no big Christmas tree no Street vendors selling candy to the children no music uh the officials here said it's impossible to celebrate Christmas this year under those circumstances all big churches that are present here said uh there is no Moment In Joy when so of Joy when so many people are suffering some say maybe it's also a moment to reflect on uh what Christmas is also about the hope of a more peaceful
