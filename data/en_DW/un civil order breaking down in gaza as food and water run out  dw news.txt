the United Nations says the humanitarian situation in Gaza is growing more desperate by the hour the UN agency that overseas aid for Palestinian says its storage facilities in Gaza were broken into with thousands of people taking vital Food Supplies the UN called it a worrying sign that civil order is breaking down the Israeli military says it attacked 450 Hamas targets over the past day and that it was increasing the number of its forces on the ground in Gaza it is the 23rd day of fighting in Gaza there has been no letup in Israel's attacks and it has now declared Gaza City a battlefield the scale of the destruction is plain to [Music] see we want the war to stop we lost our loved ones our relatives our children all my siblings and their children are gone with hundreds of homes and buildings in trouble there is hardly any place left for civilians to seek shelter a temporary Communications blackout only added to the suffering of cousins we couldn't check on our relatives we've been calling them to check how doing but last night we couldn't people in the streets have become lifeless bodies walking Israel has begun ramping up its ground operations prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza would be difficult and long Friday evening more of our Ground Forces entered into Gaza the stronghold of of Hamas this is the second phase of the war and its goals are clear the destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and bringing home the hostages Israel has been telling civilians in Northern Gaza to seek safety in the South but many gazans fear they might never be able to return to their homes our correspondent Rebecca Ritter is in stot close to the Gaza Border in southern Israel Rebecca Israel is talking about the second stage of its operation in Gaza do we know what this second stage specifically entails well they haven't given a huge amount of detail on exactly what their military operation is planned or what what what they've planned as you can imagine but we are from where we're standing which is just a couple of kilometers from the Northeast Gaza border behind us you can see the city of bade hon uh we can hear near continuous strikes both artillery air strikes also mortar strikes and I've also been able to hear this morning we actually at the moment having a little bit of a lull we haven't has been relatively quiet in the last few moments but uh earlier this morning we could hear both heavy and light machine gun fire suggesting that there is actually combat happening on the ground we've been able to also see through some Zoom some some tanks on the other side so there we are can just hear uh an outgoing fire there uh make landfall in bate hanon and so we we are seeing and hearing that second phase we know that they've ramped up ground forces the Israeli military have ramped up ground forces inside Gaza and that is certainly part of the second phase as Benjamin nety who was calling it last night uh exactly the tactics we don't know we think it is less likely to be this major ground Invasion ground uh ground incursion that we were first thinking and talking about we've seeing those huge troop numbers uh now it looks more likely that they're going to continue with this kind of slower e they did say it was going to take a very long time and it certainly seems at the moment that they're trying to encircle certain cities particularly Gaza City so you can hear occasionally artillery fire and no doubt you've seen some trace of the fighting in the form of smoke rising over Gaza but I wonder is there any information trickling out about the degree of resistance Israeli forces are getting from Hamas at this point I'll just say that it isn't actually that infrequent what we're hearing hearing uh also fighter jets overhead at the moment it's actually being quite constant just at the moment we're seeing a little bit of a reprieve although I think it's about to pick up again in terms of Hamas fighting back it's almost impossible for us to to know exactly what's happening on the ground in fact it is impossible we don't get these updates in real time and of course when no journalists or anyone else in fact is able to get access to the to to inside the Gaza border so in terms of how significantly they're fighting back I don't know they have said Hamas I'm talking about have said that they are ready for a ground Invasion that you know they've been preparing for this it will have come to no surprise to them Israel's reaction to the events of October 7 uh so they'd say that they are prepared they of course know the the strip very well they've in fact built these underground tunnel networks and and know the the lay of the land incredibly well they say they're prepared and they say they're ready to fight back we do know that a couple of soldiers two in fact one injured severely and another one moderately they're the figures that we have so far but of course the longer this goes on the more casualties we're likely to see Rebecca we only have about 20 seconds or so but I do want to ask you we understand the communication Network appears to be working again in Gaza what do you hear from there I've actually in fact just been in touch with a colleague of our in Gaza they have been able to restore communication he's been able to recharge in fact his Israeli SIM card and be able to again have access to the outside world uh but we know that the situation there the the humanitarian situation is increasingly dire you've been reporting on it and uh you know that's been backed up with what he had to say he he in fact said that he had heard about these raids these unra raids can hear some firing again there um that the happing of the warehouses so people in a very dire situation uh on the other side of the Border Rebecca riters from stol in southern Israel many thanks let's welcome Ahmed bam media and Communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council an independent organization that protects the rights of people affected by displacement he joins us from Aman um Ahmed welcome what are your colleagues in Gaza telling you about the situation there thanks for having me actually uh we managed to get a short message from one of our 54 colleagues uh on the ground in Gaza it was a 58 second message in which he said that um signal was back network was back uh but they still don't know what was happening around them uh he reported not being able to identify whether where the sound of the of the next bomb was was was going to come from or was coming from um he wasn't able to know if the rest of his family was alive or not uh today this morning the the full scale of what happened over the past 36 uh hours is is starting to reveal and the numbers are starting to jump the number of of killed and injured hospitals cannot cope and there are people still stuck under the rubble uh who were not able to uh to uh find someone to call the ambulance so um yeah I mean sadly it's it's going from bad to to worse in Gaza at the moment the UN says there are worrying signs that civil order is breaking down we in the media have been reporting for days now that people are running out of food and water when will that likely happen for sure and what do you fear the breaking point will look like um it is happening I mean we keep warning about it happening but it is happening already there are people who are literally surviving of one loaf of bread a day plus probably some some salty water it is happening we're just not seeing them uh live on television there are people who are taking turns to to uh to get hold of a of a bag of of bread there are people who are spending 5 hours to just find one bottle of petrol that they can use to pump water out into their homes I think the the trickle of Aid that is arriving across the border from Gaza is giving the impression that Aid is arriving and while this is true it is nowhere near enough so there is a humanitarian catastrophe already happening we've heard about you know hospitals having to uh do without painkillers and children having to to drink contaminated water so it is all unfolding and it's all about now stopping that from getting at worse from killing more people we don't know for sure how many people are dying from from from uh from all these other causes we know about the bombardment that is uh intensifying almost everywhere in Gaza this is why we need more Aid urgently for those people are gazin responding to Israeli calls for them to move South of the Wadi Gaza Valley um yes yes and and no no because I've heard accounts of people making their way to Southern Gaza realizing that life was not much safer there there was still constant bombardment we have seen that you know uh Rockets hitting and bombs hitting um homes residential homes and then uh my colleagues told me about relatives who made their way back from Southern Gaza to to Northern Gaza and again from northern Gaza to Southern Gaza I mean there's there's that tells me there's no safe spot there's no safe Corner in Gaza whether that is because of bombardment whether that is because of you know the basics of Life the bread the water the food um and just to say here finally a rest fight in do at the moment is getting a full 2 hour of uh of a nap during the day because there is just simply no chance you can get any sleep during the night goodness uh that is akmed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council many time many thanks for your time sir thank
