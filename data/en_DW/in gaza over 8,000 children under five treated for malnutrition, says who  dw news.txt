an Israeli official says that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved Israel's war cabinet that's after Minister Benny guns and his National Unity party quit the government on June 9th the move comes as Israel continues its military operations in the Gaza Strip Israel's Army has said it would Implement a daily tactical pause as it calls it along a road in southern Gaza to allow a deliveries through the key Kim Shalom border crossing the United Nations has welcomed the announcement but said more needs to be done children are among those with the greatest needs the World Health Organization said over 8,000 children under five have been diagnosed and treated for acute malnutrition 1,600 of them are classified as severe as well as not having enough food eight agencies say children lack access to sufficient health care and are living in a constant state of fear James Elder is a global spokesperson for Unicef he joins us now from Rafa in southern Gaza James so good to see you thank you so much for making the time you were last in Rafa back in March how has the situation changed since then especially for children look it's gotten so much worse no one should be surprised by that since March those same children have had two three more months of Relentless bombardments every night as before as we were getting this sorted out there are bombardments here now last night the night before if it's not bombardments it's drones either attack drones or drones that are like a lawn mower in your head this continues to go on I the great fear is that it's being normalized there is nothing normal about children being deprived food there's nothing normal about thousands of children being bombed there's certainly nothing normal about the constant fear that people live in so people now are physically and psychologically shattered they were in March somehow they've held on but they are literally now just holding on with a die lack of water with nutrition consistent denials of Aid and ongoing indiscriminate indiscriminate attacks I've just come back from a hospital again seeing children with limbs missing with eye with with with uh being made blind in the last few days while sleeping in their home it's 250 days that's how things are compared to March and thousands of children are also suffering from acute malnutrition now that's according to the wh now do you believe these 11-hour tactical pauses that the Israeli military has announced will do much to remedy the situation any pause in bombing is good news for children they haven't seen it they haven't heard it it's hard to explain what it's like must be like for a child for this Relentless bombardment and as a mother said to me in March where they thought they were going to get a ceasefire tonight is a night I can promise my child she will wake up tomorrow morning that ceasefire of course didn't happen that that hope was bombed away so any pause is good there is a lot more to be seen with what what this means it's it's one Crossing it's about getting some Aid in we need to get more Aid in yes but then we need to get that Aid safely across the Gaza Strip that is the responsibility of the occupying power it is a very difficult it is very dangerous place um to give Aid so we have to see it there is a lot of lot yet to be seen right now there is uh you know we need to see evidence on the ground not more statements we need to see evidence as to whether this will mean smoother faster safer delivery of Aid the the clearest way to do that would not just be with a pause or a strategic strategic pause would be with more Crossings opening in fact we've seen them close Rafa Rafer in the south is the humanitarian Lifeline for humanitarian agencies for Aid coming in we've seen half as many trucks in May as April half as many at a time where the need is skyrocketing and we've seen half as many because May of course was the offensive and raer the so-called quote unquote limited offensive The Limited offensive that led to a million more people being displaced so we need more Crossings uh and we need a much safer environment so it's a step but it's a very baby step and it's only been around for a day I'm not exactly sure on the space but there's been bombarding the last couple of hours nearby where I am at least in Rafa yeah the fact that the situation on the ground is growing increasingly desperate what does it mean for unicef's ability to carry out its task look this is a really difficult place to operate uh we've seen more United Nations colleagues killed here than in any War since World War II and this is eight months on now but this is what my colleagues do they're Frontline responders whether it's UNICEF whether it's unra the backbone of an aid operation wh wfp these are Frontline workers whether we're in Afghanistan Syria Yemen Ukraine this is what people do but it's very difficult I was on a convoy on Wednesday to go to the north with a truck of medical and nutritional supplies for 10,000 children critical life-saving supplies it was about a 25 mile 40 kilometer Journey it took 13 hours with all the paperwork it took 13 hours and in the end that truck was denied based on that it was meant to be a van not a closed truck after all the inspections it was denied those 10,000 children did not get that Aid now we will return we will go again but it's not as simple as going the next day because given how dangerous this operating environment is we need armed vehicles for every Convoy so that's 10,000 children we've got a very wide mandate UNICEF it's water it's sanitation it's tents because so many families have lost their home we won't stop but we need we need Israel to facilitate enable us to do our work for those civilians who are who are again just holding on you say that people live in constant fear understandably so what psychological impact are you seeing on children and their parents oh we're in Uncharted Territory um there is no doubt there is every single child in the Gaza Strip needs some sort of mental health care I don't really know of an example everyone no one wants to leave their home but if your home gets destroyed and 2third of houses and buildings here have been damaged or destroyed I've never seen this Devastation it's post-apocalyptic 2/3 if your home gets bombed of course you just want to leave you want to get as far away from the constant threat of missiles and bombs as you can you cannot here children cannot Escape that here so the sound constant sound of drones and bombs and of course the deprivation and if for a child to look into their parents' eyes and now to know that your mom or dad cannot protect you is a terrifying thing I've had more than a handful of young people this past week say to me I have nothing left I hope a missile hits my tent I'm done that's the mental health of Children Here of a very young generation who you know with opportunities and and education and a and a labor market you know it's a young population is the Envy of of Aging countries but not with the conditions these children forced to live through this is UNICEF spokesperson James Elder in Rafa James thank you so much for your time and please try to be safe thanks Ni Call and for the latest I am now joined by DW correspondent Rebecca ritters she joins us from Jerusalem Rebecca Centrist Benny Gant left the war cabinet last week and now Netanyahu has dissolved completely why is that well this hasn't come as a surprise Nicole it was largely expected after guns uh and G Eisen cot did stand down from the war cabinet now the war cabinet was made uh around about October 11th last year just after the breakout of the War uh at the behest of Benny guns who said that he would come on board to provide a more unified force a Unity government as it is known here to try to guide the to guide Israel through this complex time H now since they've stood down the prime minister's office now says that it is no longer needed this War cabinet but it's largely thought that's because far right Minister itamar Ben the national security minister was pushing to be allowed into that war cabinet and that's something that uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu clearly wasn't in favor of and certainly wouldn't have pleased Israel's Ally the United States so instead he's decided to dissolve the cabinet completely instead now decisions will go to a wider security cabinet on which itar benier and the Finance Minister betel smotrich both heading tionalist parties in the Coalition they are both on that security uh in that security cabinet and will be overseeing some of the decisions being made although it is thought that there will also be smaller consultative groups uh made up in an ad hoc fashion and they may contain you know various members that Benjamin Netanyahu picks at the time for particular decisions but it is being said or it's thought in some circles that this situation may actually favor Benjamin nety who is looking for ways not to end this war even though there's a lot of international pressure to do so and by by allowing or by in fact having to have these decisions go to a wider security cabinet that do include these hawkish members uh they they have already said that they do not want to see an end of the war uh until all the military aims have been met uh so that could work in Benjamin netanyahu's favor yeah Rebecca this is not the only political headache for Netanyahu it seems Israel's military and its government don't really see eye to eye on the issue of those so-called tactical pauses that were announced over the weekend what more can you tell us yeah that's right these were announced yesterday pretty early in the morning by the Israeli military that there would be these 11-hour tactical pauses on a particular humanitarian route that has been demarcated uh now shortly after that announcement these farri right ministers namely betel betel smotrich and itar Ben both came out against them and then we heard from the prime minister's office or or at least it was reported to have come from the prime minister's office that Benjamin Netanyahu was also upset by this news showing a kind of a rift between the military and what Benjamin Netanyahu is planning for them to do so it's not the first time we've seen uh difference in opinion and difference in issues there we'll have to see uh what comes of these pauses and whether they'll continue given that Rift tww correspondent Rebecca ritters from Jerusalem thank you for
