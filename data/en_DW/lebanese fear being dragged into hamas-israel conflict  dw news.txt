well the leader of lebanon's Hezbollah terror group has broken his silence about the Hamas attacks on Israel Hassan nazrah praised the operation and said his militia is engaged in unprecedented crossborder fighting with Israel he stopped short of saying hesah would fully join the war but warned that a wider Middle East conflict is a realistic possibility large crowds turned out in the Lebanese Capital bayout to hear this widely anticipated speech Hezbollah is backed by Iran and is classified by the US and Germany as a terror organization as R said the October 7th attacks on Israel were carefully planned this decision to carry out this operation was 100% Palestinian and it was carried out by Palestinians the ones who planned it kept it secret from everyone including the different resistance factions within Gaza they also hid it from other countries and the access of resistance the fact that no one knew about it proves that this battle is completely Palestinian the Palestinian people and has no relation to any Regional or even International our correspondent Aman in the Lebanese Capital Beirut followed that speech and I asked him whether nazala said anything to suggest that Hezbollah is moving towards an allout attack on Israel the short answer so far is no All Eyes in Lebanon were on the speech some expecting him to make an allout declaration of war on Israel but that didn't happen what he did say was that while a lot of people were expecting him to say that Hezbollah was going to enter the battle alongside uh Hamas uh militants uh we already we meaning Hezbollah already entered that battle on October the 8th what he's referring to is basically the status quo that has arisen on the border between Lebanon and Israel where almost daily Hezbollah sends Rockets into Israeli territory uh Israel sends Rockets back into Lebanese territory but all within the bounds of an unofficial uh unofficial Rules of Engagement uh not risking escalation uh but what has come out of the speech while it might not be an escalation while it might be maintaining some kind of status quo fully supporting Hamas uh he says but not escalating further uh we are actually going to be looking to what's happening on the ground to see if uh the if the conflict escalates further because there's a lot that can go wrong when a daily fire between Israel and Lebanon becomes the normal On the Border there the Lebanon is a is a is in a strange political situation uh the the economy in tatters and Hezbollah operating effectively autonomously within its territory the the government there and it need people on the ground must be uh worried about being dragged into this War I can't stress enough how anxious most Lebanese I've talked to are about this conflict I would say in most of my conversations the the majority the vast majority have no interest in getting involved in a war with Israel a far superior economy far superior military which has ended in disaster for a lot of residents here in Beirut the last times that they got involved in a conflict but what's interesting here is Hezbollah which is just a minority political party with a mil powerful military Wing supported by by Iran while it's just a minority it has amazing power over the future of Lebanon we we saw that the speech by the the Secretary General of Hezbollah today was looked at as what's going to happen in the next days is Lebanon going to war with Israel or not uh so there's not a lot that lebanes can do in this political situation in this financial crisis which has been going on for four at least four years now there's not a lot they can do uh to protect themselves against a war with Israel and that gives Hezbollah uh outsized Power in this situation so a lot of Lebanese are feeling a bit reassured by this uh Speech where he said that we've already entered the battle we're not going to escalate further that's the implications of his speech so far and a further complicating factor of course is that Hamas has a presence in southern Lebanon um how explain to us how that complicates things that's right Hamas is not a political presence in uh Lebanon but there are so many Palestinian refugees many of whom came in 1948 when they were expelled uh from the territories that are now president Israel and the Palestinian territories uh and within these uh refugee camps which we visited yesterday you have more and more support for Hamas a lot of Palestinian militants have been leaving these refugee camps going to the border and firing their own Rockets into Israel now where Hezbollah explicitly says it's only firing on Israeli military establishments across the border uh Hamas does not make that distinction has actually fired Rockets into civilian in Israel and this presents another danger for the escalation in the region uh with just another military presence On the Border that's not controlled by a Unified Government here in this country thanks for that Aman in
