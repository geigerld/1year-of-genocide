United Nations Secretary General Antonio gues is on his way to the Rafa border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip that's where a limited number of trucks are expected to deliver humanitarian Aid into Gaza in the coming hours following a plan announced by US President Joe Biden Gaza is currently experiencing severe shortages of fuel food and medicines Israel launched air strikes in Gaza and sealed the territory off from supplies after Hamas militants entered Israel almost 2 weeks ago and killed at least 1,400 people the UN Chief says more than 2 million are at risk of dehydration and waterbor diseases in Gaza civilians in Gaza desperately need core services and supplies and for that we need rapid and impeded humanitarian exess we need food water medicine and fuel now we need it at scale and we need it to be sustained let's bring bring in kareim El gawari here he's a journalist in Egypt's capital Cairo Kareem what are Egyptian authorities saying about when a deliveries to Gaza will resume well the talk is that it is set for today uh that also in the presence of the UN General Secretary gutiz um officially it's not open yet because there is extensive repair work especially on the Palestinian side because this area since the war was since the war broke out was bombed four times in its vicinity and the the the street to the border crossing has extensive damage but I hear that until now there's also until this moment a struggle in the background between the US Israel and Egypt about how much Aid will be allowed in until now it's supposed to be only 20 trucks that can go to specific locations one once the border is open uh but of course on the Egyptian side there are many many more trucks lined up talk is about that there's waiting eight of 3,000 tons right now on the other side talk for sure will be also about the foreign Nationals and possibilities for them to leave the Gaza Strip via uh this Rafa border crossing Egypt since days tries to link the two things they're saying like they can go out only if eight comes comes in and that is all still probably that discussion until now it's not sure if and when this Crossing is really opening today know we're talking about humanitarian aid for people who are living under extremely difficult conditions and civilians who are are facing serious uh health issues among other things they're hungry uh why has it been so difficult Kareem to get that Aid flowing back into Gaza well it is has to be done in coordination between Egypt Hamas Israel and the un uh it seems to be very very difficult from the Egyptian side they are ready to bring the aid in the big topic for the Egyptian side is uh about crossing the border opening the border crossing and for the Palestinians to leave from there there's a big fear in Egypt about a Palestinian Exodus from Gaza Egyptian president CCE just said that the current war was not just aimed at fighting hamama but also an attempt to push civilian inhabitants to migrate to Egypt uh that's is the big fear you have to understand there is a Palestinian and Arab trauma about a nakba the fear that Palestinians once again will be forcefully displayed displaced until now in their history whenever they escaped to another country they were never allowed back and uh I think that's is really the big issue this is also the issue in Jordan This is the issue in Egypt right now why they are so reluctant that the Palestinians can come from the Gaza Strip kareim thank you very much for now that was journalist kareim El gawari reporting from Egypt's capital Caira Palestinian militants continued to fire Rockets from Gaza into Israel on Thursday this as Israeli forces struck Targets in the Gaza Strip throughout the day including in the south of the territory where Israel has told Gaza to head for their own safety one explosion there reportedly killed and injured several people including children a father carrying his child to the Grave his was one of three children among those receiving the final rights on this Barren patch of land prayers are held to the sound of Israeli aircraft hovering above a constant menace to the Palestinians below and a reminder of the air strike on the town of Kanan yunes that killed the civilians being buried here hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled the northern part of the Gaza Strip after Israel told them to leave for the South running out of food and desperate for shelter they have found no reprieve from Israel's Relentless bombing [Music] campaign we came from gasa City they told us to come to the South so we came to the South we found that the strikes intensified in the South we stayed in a house in front of us there were strikes behind us strikes there's no safety there's nowhere safe in gasa you have to be ready to die and to just stay in your house Israel vows to continue targeting Hamas all over Gaza when there is a threat originating or uh being conducted against Israel from the south and we will strike absolutely and it will soon move its powerful Army into the strip Israel's defense minister told troops massing on its border oh my God I promise you that whoever sees Gaza now from afar will see it from the inside good luck an Israeli ground operation will likely focus on the north at least in the initial stages with hmer expected to put up Fierce resistance the batt confines of Southern Gaza may still prove a sanctuary of sorts hen belusa is a journalist in Gaza earlier I asked him about the humanitarian situation there the humanit terranean situation is getting hard and harsh um no electricity no power at all and no drinking water uh no internet um limited access to food um U no bers no trucks coming in uh people are lying on bories in grocery shops and restaurants people can afford some stuff but still uh others are not um some people are staying in um at schools and they are providing very limited amount of food and according to the limited amount that they have according to the official um uh all the services and infrastructure are there in in Gaza barely we are connected on the phone it come it comes and goes no internet people are not communicating um as regular um people don't know here and the officials that how long that Gaza can survive with the current situation their efforts to resume Aid deliveries to Gaza across the border with Egypt are Palestinians in Gaza expecting those Aid deliveries to resume to actually reach them well this is a question that um how and when this Aid will come um there are a lot of reports that it would come today but seems like up to now nothing came in into Gaza um with the with the they are talking about 20 trucks which is very limited and this would be through the UN agencies particularly uh uh H and maybe R presentent we didn't know yet about the mechanism and uh I don't know how how this will be distributed to Ordinary People the other people in the South or only for those refugees are staying at the H cast is there any place in Gaza where the people there can flee to and be safe actually not um I'm displaced uh myself with my family for the third time in this war um many people left their places in North and and Gaza City to the South but you know overnight here I'm in the central G thre and I still hear bombardments and air strikes there were many reports about air strikes in raan commun which is in the South uh many buildings were destroyed there are many people killed in different a strikes but we can't we have to say that it's more intense in Gaza and North here is is continued but still there are many people killed by or due to to the a strikes hen thank you very much for your reporting that was journalist hen Balia speaking to us from Gaza thank
