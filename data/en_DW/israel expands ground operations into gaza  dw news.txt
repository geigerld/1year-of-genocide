tonight there are growing signs that Israel could be on the brink of launching a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza Israel's military says it's expanding its ground operations there and it has launched a massive aerial bombardment targeting the terrorist group Hamas as night fell over Gaza Israel stepped up its bombing campaign again Israel aims to degrade the military capabilities Hamas has to the greatest degree possible in the last few hours we increased the strikes in Gaza the Air Force is striking underground terrorist facilities and terrorist facilities in a very significant way following the series of strikes of the last few days the ground forces are extending the ground operation tonight Israel has steadily been increasing its incursions into Gaza using mobile units with tanks supported by Jets and drones a steady stream of attacks before an expected full-scale Invasion and a warning from Israel on Friday it accuses Hamas of using gaza's largest medical complex the alifa hospital as their military operational headquarters when medical facilities are used for Terror purposes they are liable to lose their protection from attack in accordance with international law the challenge Israel faced alifa hospital has become a refuge from the bombing for tens of thousands of Palestinians an appeal by Israel's allies the United States has made clear in both public and private conversations that as Israel exercises its right and indeed its responsibility to defend its people against the terrorist group it must do so in line with the rules of War there are no law free zones in war Israel has not yet succeeded in stopping Hamas firing Rockets over the border from Gaza the militant group says it fired a number of salvos on Friday Rockets like this one which hit a residential building in Tel Aviv wounding several Israelis a reminder that the terrorist threat from Hamas is still very much alive well journalist Sami soal is following this story in Jerusalem he has more on the Israeli military's expanding operations tonight yeah so so not only have they said that they're expanding the the ground operations but we have now reports from the ground from the north of the Gaza Strip that Israeli tanks are rolling in into the Gaza Strip and there is also Hamas Hamas Fighters there that are confronting them uh so so this is like the most recent development earlier this evening there was a bombarding of the Gaza Strip uh people in the Gaza Strip are saying that this has been the worst bombardment since the beginning of the Israeli uh campaign Israel has been both from the air artillery and from the sea the extent of this bombing is that Israeli residents who live in communities out the Gaza Strip have been reporting that their houses have been shaking and some of the windows have been shattered as a result of this bombardment that is taking place in the Gaza Strip we also know that these strikes hit a jaal which is the the leading Palestinian telecommunications company it hit their facility and now in the Gaza Strip there's no internet and this situation of course is very grave and Sammy I I just want to make sure we can confirm that you're saying that the the Israeli military is saying that its forces are encountering Hamas militants inside Gaza so this is the urban Warfare that we've been warned about correct well we still don't know the scope of this we still don't know whether it's similar to what we've seen in previous evenings or whether this is something of of a larger scale but there are Israeli tanks now in the northern Gaza Strip and what can you tell us about claims by the Israel Defense Forces that the alifa hospital is being used by Hamas militants inside Gaza yeah well today the IDE of spokesperson spoke to a foreign media uh and told them uh that the Hamas headquarters the military headquarters are under the shifa hospital that shifa hospital is being used uh by Hamas Fighters that there uh tunnels that are leading and connecting between and under the hospital to the network of Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip I mean uh of course Hamas has denied it they they issued a statement in which they deny this and uh clearly by making these kinds of statements Israel is signaling to the world that it regarding this hospital as a legitimate Target yeah yeah and we we have to remind our viewers we cannot um verify these claims that are being made by the military but it if it is true it it does fall in line with what we've been hearing from Israel all along that Hamas uses civilians civilian um areas as human Shields right yeah I mean this kind of argument is something that we've heard over the years uh but you have to remember that the Gaza Strip is a very crowded area 2.3 million people are living in the Gaza Strip and clearly the Hamas Fighters are located in the Gaza Strip um I would also say that in Israel you have also military facilities and Military presence in civilian areas so I this is not something which is unique to Hamas but this is a point that Israel has been raising again and again to justify the kind of campaign that it's waging against the leaders and commanders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and explaining why there have been so many civilan casualties throughout this air campaign journalist Sami Soko with with the latest developments tonight from Jerusalem Sammy thank you well our coverage continues now with Frank ledwitch he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University he's also a former UK Military Intelligence officer and he joins us tonight from Oxford Frank it's good to see you again let's let's talk about where we are right now Israel's Defense Forces say that they are expanding their operations tonight do you think that this is the beginning of that much anticipated ground Invasion there are three indications Brent that would indicate that it is a beginning of a military operation uh and I'll come back to that in a second first is the communications blackout which will include electronic uh Warfare to deny Hamas Communications so we've seen that for the last few hours and we'll see that that go on and that will include cyber cyber attacks as well as well as taking down of radio towers uh the second indication is a huge bombardment and and we really are talking about something considerable here bombs are are being dropped at a rate of about one every heavy bombs every 10 seconds and finally there there's the announcement of the Israeli Defense Forces plus and I I I saw this as well uh the the uh Israeli press is picking up that Palestinians are saying that Israeli tanks are conducting at least a raid in force however the US are advising the idea very strongly they have a very senior General in the Israeli headquarters advising them not to conduct huge or large scale operations but rather to conduct what we would call pulsing operations which is to say large scale raids withdraw large scale raids to achieve objectives withdraw I suspect that's what we're going to see over the next few weeks if we don't uh they will know that they're not taking us advice um the IDF says that the alifa hospital in Gaza is being used by Hamas militants as their main headquarters ERS for military operations I mean they also say that Hamas is using civilians as human Shields now considering this knowing that if you move into Gaza you're talking about Urban Warfare is is there any way that the Israeli military even if they destroy Hamas that they can win this battle because there's going to be so many civilian lives that will be lost well I have no doubt at all that the IDF is uh is accurate on this not for nothing it's h Hamas called a terrorist organization we saw the measure of them 3 weeks ago uh the main weapon against the Israeli Defense Force of course civilians and the IDF is more than aware of that I think but also it's fair to say the military center of gravity of this operation at least on hamas's part are the tunnel system and the Israelis have plans for that it's not they haven't just discovered now that the headquarters of Hamas if if they are there are underneath that hospital that's something they'll be aware of for a long time and they they will have planned for that I seriously doubt whether they're planning to take down their hospital that would have that would be probably be disproportionate under international law and would of course present them with political problems as well they've got plans for it for sure Egyptian officials are saying that unidentified drones hit two Egyptian Red Sea towns on Friday we've got Israel accusing Yemen's iran-backed houti Rebels having the intention of harming Israel what can you tell us about this Frank last week an American Destroyer the USS Carney shot down I think several dozen tens of drones that seem to have been fired from Yemen and were aimed towards Israel the another drone fell on taba I think yesterday which is near the border the Israeli Air Force today reported that it had engaged drones it said it wasn't convinced it knew where they came from but the heavy hints that it was Yemen again and I suspect that the drones that crashed on Israeli wrong on Egyptian territory today were uh were being fired from Yemen military analyst Frank Le joining us tonight from Oxford Frank as always we appreciate your time thank you thank you Brent well meanwhile the situation for the more than two million people trapped inside Gaza it is growing worse by the hour just a trickle of humanitarian Aid has been arriving and supplies of food Fuel and water have nearly run out in the Gaza Strip the Relentless bombing continues from the air and from the sea amid dire warnings that the trickle of Aid that is getting in is nowhere near enough basic services are crumbling medicine is running out food and water are running out the street of Gaza have started overflowing with swich Gaza is on the brink of a massive Health aard at the risk of diseases aling all of this is made worse by the fuel shortages around 200,000 people in shelters receive fresh bread from the world food program every day and the few bakeries that are still open are producing a fraction of what they were before The Crisis began with no other options this woman has resorted to using whatever paper she can find as fuel to bake bread on the streets the we've gone to get FL under bombardment from a besieged area and we've brought firewood from the streets and we're risking Our Lives looking for paper fresh water is also in short supply many in Gaza are now queuing up with bottles and canisters unsure when the next delivery might make it through Gaza Health authorities warn that the hospitals are at Breaking Point lacking medicine and fuel to to carry out essential operations the humanitarian situation on the ground is looking increasingly Bleak this woman unable to breastfeed her baby and lacking access to milk fears the worst my son's skin is gradually turning yellow due to the lack of breastfeeding what has he done wrong what has this baby done [Music] wrong this man Mourns the death of his wife an eight-month-old baby both were killed in an Israeli air strike despite earlier Israeli assurances that southern Gaza would be spared it seems nowhere is safe in the strip and fears about escalation will only be exacerbated by the sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis but the UN says that it will be forced to Halt its operations in Gaza if fuel is not allowed into the territory samah Hadid from the Norwegian Refugee Council told us earlier what this would mean for for the more than 2 million gazans in need it means an absolute catastrophe uh for over 2 million uh people in Gaza because food is running out water is running out and medicine is running out and the aid that has come through is just not enough it's nowhere near enough and uh fuel is not being allowed to be delivered into Gaza hospitals need fuel to keep operating uh water pumps require fuel bakeries require fuel uh so it's an absolute catastrophic situation and the events tonight in in Gaza are terrifying Gaza right now is under a full Communications blackout uh and with the announcement that the Israeli government has launched um a ground operation uh we fear for the worst yeah m i I just want to be clear are you saying that your organization is also going to have to ha its operations in Gaza well we've had to uh scale down our operations because of the bombardment uh and the lack of safety for our colleagues on the ground uh We've continued to deliver cash assistance to support uh civilians and families uh to buy basic food items and other items on the market uh but the aid relief is nowhere near enough to meet the growing needs on the ground that mean we need a urgent scale up of Aid all Crossings need to be opened and the Israeli government has to lift its Siege off go off of Gaza and what about the situation in terms of medical care we know there are reports that many about a third if not more of the hospitals in Gaza have basically shut down are are things improving as Aid slowly begins to trickle into the territory I think there was a report that what 10 European doctors have arrived the medical uh equipment and supplies that are coming through are simply not enough and hospitals right now need fuel they need fuel and electricity to keep running so that they can treat people with the Right medical supplies and care and this is just not happening uh right now and with this escalation in violence uh with uh Israeli ground operation being launched into Gaza we will see widespread uh civilian Bloodshed and even more destruction to civilian infrastructure so our plea to the International Community is to end this horrific suffering call for a ceasefire enough is enough whilst this catastrophe is unfolding in Gaza world leaders are still debating over a ceasefire at the United Nations it's simply not good enough and they must step up their efforts Miss um I want to ask you what you've been hearing from your people on the ground in Gaza you know that the Israeli military says that Hamas is using at least one hospital as as its headquarters where civilians where patients are also being housed um can your people can they confirm claims like that have your people encountered Hamas militants on the ground these claims cannot be confirmed uh and what we've seen over the past few weeks is indiscriminate Israeli bombardment over Gaza that has hit civilian infrastructure has led to civilian casualties on a widespread scale uh over th thousands of children have lost their lives uh under Israel bombardment so we need the International Community to really focus on ending this suffering uh and preventing further Bloodshed uh they really do need to step up and call for a ceasefire s Hadid from the Norwegian Refugee Council we appreciate your time tonight thank you thank
