now the potential for the conflict to spread is even more evident in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah militants in Israel have been involved in crossb clashes since October the 7th on Tuesday Israel released a video of what it says was a strike against a senior Hezbollah Commander Israel says Ali Hussein bargi was in charge of hezbollah's drones in southern Lebanon also on Tuesday large crowds turned out for the funeral of another senior Hezbollah leader killed in an Israeli air strike in southern Lebanon on Monday for more I'm now joined by DW's abas Alkali who is reporting from Beirut for us so Israel says it has killed senior Hezbollah Commander Ali Hussein Bari in a strike however Hezbollah denies this how important is he actually good morning Aron first I cannot confirm or deny that the commander ofah was killed some website in leanan have confirmed this information but Source sources from hisbah have denied it hisbah usually Mourns any of its Fighters or commanders killed publishing reports and photos about them uh as we saw in the last few weeks as example however the hisbah public relations website denied this claims stating that the commander was never subjected to any assassination instead referred to him as a commander of the Drone unit indicating that he is one of the most important military commanders in hisbah hisbah often maintains secrecy regarding to its officials names or informations is a part of a long standing strategy sometimes names emerge after their death so it seems bargie fate is still is undetermined um now turning to the political side lebanon's prime minister said that he is ready for talks on long-term stability with along the country's Southern border with Israel but he could but could he pressure Hezbollah on that uh look the internal situation and the economy in Lebanon are on the verge of collapse right now the states is suffering from inflation and the people Lebanon are tired of frequent crisis the factors makes hisbah think twice before escalating the conflict in the south hisbah is aware of this the Secretary General of hisbah Hassan nah has mentioned in his speech several times that he understand the internal situation situation in Lebanon it's not a secret that there are a kind of coordination between hisbah and the government in leanan that was DW's abas Alkali reporting for us from Beirut thank you very much thank you in the next few hours US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is due to meet with Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank blinkin reiterated us support for Israel during talks on Tuesday with senior Israeli leaders but he also urged Israel to reduce the toll of the war on civilians in Gaza Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is classified as a terrorist organization by the US EU and other nations Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is calling for Cal in the region to prevent the war in Gaza from spreading nice to see you blink held talks with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Washington is trying to balance support for Israel with limiting civilian suffering blinkin emphasized the need to protect the people of Gaza and increase Aid we know that facing an enemy that embeds itself among civilians who hides in and fires from schools from hospitals makes this incredibly challenging but the daily toll on civilians in Gaza particularly on children is far too high 3 months of fighting have left Gaza devast stated and thousands of gazans dead blinkin called on Israel to start planning for peace he said it must do more to support moderate Palestinian leaders to Halt new settlements and Stamp Out settler violence it's our unique Bond and America's enduring commitment to the people of Israel that allows indeed demands that we as forthright as possible in the moments when the stakes are highest when the choices matter the most this is one of those moments the role of Iran has raised those Stakes defense minister yav Galant said increasing the pressure on Tran was critical to preventing the war from spreading Iran which backs Hamas supports a network of militant groups throughout the region houi rebels in Yemen have attacked and seized ships in the Red Sea Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon are firing rockets at Israel while in Iraq and and Syria militants aligned of Iran have attacked US troops with rockets and drones we're determined again that we uh not see escalation that we don't have the conflict spread uh and we've made that very clear uh but of course if our Personnel if our forces are are threatened or attacked we'll take appropriate steps we'll respond blinken will continue his Tour on Wednesday he due to travel to the occupied West Bank for talks of Palestinian president Mahmud abas DW's Tanya Kramer joins us now from Jerusalem for more so Tanya the US Secretary of State has been trying to calm thing down in the region is there any indication that he's having success well all we can say he certainly comes at a critical time and as we heard in the report now 3 month into the War uh in Gaza but also heightened tensions between Israel and has BAH on Israel's northern border with Southern Lebanon but also in other regions like with the yemeni houis in the Red Sea so uh we've heard again from um US Secretary uh Anthony blinkin that he's pushing to scale down the intensity of the strikes uh in Gaza saying the daily toll on the civilian population in Gaza is far uh too high he also said that he's pushing for this uh uh uh an assessment mission uh to Northern Gaza of the United Nations to see uh when uh Palestinian residents had to flee or had to evacuate to the uh Southern Parts could uh come back uh home now uh the Israeli military on the other hand had announced that they are uh changing their combat tactics in the north uh of Gaza uh but they would be intensifying uh uh their offensive in the sou especially around the city uh of KH Yunis and on the other front in the North we're hearing uh from the United States uh from uh Anthony blinkin that he said that he would push for a diplomatic solution to find a diplomatic solution uh um uh between uh Hezbollah and uh uh Israel but uh having seen you know in the past weeks uh there have been a lot of crossb attacks this has been intensifying so it's still to see uh whether this will work out and if we could stay with the Diplomatic solution for a second Anthony blinkin also called for the realization of a Palestinian State when the war is over however that's something Benjamin Nan yahu has rejected in the past well this is certainly something that the United States and Israel at least with this government uh are not on the same page uh prime minister Benyamin nanyu has said time and time and again that he does not support a Palestinian the creation of a Palestinian State and that is also uh certainly uh um what you can say of his far-right religious uh Coalition Partners in this government uh Benin even said he had be rented a Palestinian state but Anthony blinkin made it very clear he has talked to Regional leaders uh especially also uh he held talks in Saudi Arabia and that's a bit connecting the dots before October 7th there was talk about a potential normalization between those two countries but he has made clear that those Regional leaders only see a pathway uh you know for peace and Security in the region if there's a way to Palestinian State and that Israel would have to make hard choices that was DW T Crea in Jerusalem thank you very much for your
