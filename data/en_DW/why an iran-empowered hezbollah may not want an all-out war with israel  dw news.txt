We Begin tonight with a conflict between Hezbollah and Israel Israeli leaders have stepped up their rhetoric in recent days warning that the Army is preparing for an offensive along the northern border with Lebanon the iran-backed militant group Hezbollah began firing Rockets as Israel immediately after the Hamas Terror attacks last October now in recent weeks attacks have increased with Hezbollah Rockets sparking massive wildfires in Northern Israel many of the homes closed to the Border have been evacuated for months due to the conflict tens of thousands of people who fled the region have no idea when they will be able to return home the Israeli government is under increasing pressure to restore Security in Northern Israel but does that mean an escalation in the conflict with Hezbollah is imminent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited areas affected by the fires today and issued a clear warning to Hezbollah anyone who thinks they can hurt us and we will sit idly by they're making a big mistake we are prepared for a very intense operation in the north one way or another we will restore security to the north I'm joined Now by political analyst and commentator Ronnie shata in Beirut he's the host of the Beirut banan podcast which covers modern Lebanese history Ronnie so good to have you on the show now Netanyahu says that Israel is is prepared to act against Hezbollah how are those comments being viewed in Lebanon for better or worse this type of tension along the Lebanese Israeli border is familiar terrain and this isn't the first time in Israeli Prime Minister has threatened further escalation I think it's also important to remember that since October 8th a day after the October 7 tragedy began hb's calculations in South Lebanon against Israeli interests in Northern Israel have also been extremely cautious so I in my assessment is that despite the Bluster despite the threats this is still careful calculated to a degree escalation but nothing that's nothing that's not familiar and the reason I'm using this word is because for a long time now for decades South Lebanon has been a battlefield at times it's quiet at times it's like today which means there's a battle field that's being leveraged now how it's being leveraged is a story in itself but hb's calculations in 2024 are very different than hezbollah's calculations in the 1990s or for that matter in 2006 I think one of caution I think is actually extending despite it being eight months into this conflict and how has Hezbollah changed over the years and where does it stand now that's a great question uh hb's influence in Lebanon is that an alltime High hb's leverage against Israel is at an all-time low and the reason I frame it this way is because today Iran's interests in Lebanon are more important than hb's local Affairs or even for that matter hb's own calculated interests Iran does not seem willing to let go of its Crown Jewel and its Crown Jewel is's leverage from Lebanon it seems up until now despite this group having an enormous amount of Sway and influence on local Lebanese Affairs and despite of being able to at times veto political decisions that have less to do with its security decision making and despite its capabilities that are known to Lebanese hb's actions against Israel are unfamiliar being that this is the Palestinian cause this is the raise on debt for this substate militia in Lebanon and has been acting extremely I'll use this word carefully pragmatic pragmatic for a militia not pragmatic for any other Lebanese political party this is a group that stands on its own in Lebanon and that it has substate military capabilities but hasbalah right now despite the escalation despite the threats from the Israeli side and you're right Netanyahu is threatening action up until now it seems like for better or worse this is the usual in Lebanon yeah tell us more about hezbollah's ideology and it's viewed as a terrorist organization at least in part by the US by Germany and several other countries so what does Hezbollah want and how far have they been willing to go until now to get it I appreciate that question I think it's a complicated question and what hasbalah wants on local Lebanese issues may not always match what Iran wants from hasah but up until October 7 2024 to put it in perspective The South was fairly quiet to the point that America time deal was negotiated between Lebanon and Israel of course indirectly but hasbalah was on board we have a maritime deal with the Israelis that's the kind of climate hasah can succeed in as well so I I doubt right now the interests for hasah is an allout war with Israel it seems more like what Iran needs from that group and what it needs may not actually be at the at the same time What Lebanon can handle and the reason I say that also is because the Lebanese economy crashed Lebanese politics is paralyzed we haven't had a president for the better part of nearly two years if not more we have a caretaker prime minister we have a caretaker government and we have a country that's increasingly unfamiliar in terms of safety local violence is on the rise this may not be good for hasbalah longterm but it may actually be better for Iran in the short term meaning that they have gained something which is quite unusual a substate militia in Le Lebanese politics that's Lebanon security help save the Assad regime from crumbling train Iraqi substate militias and get involved in Yemen when necessary in addition to all the other stories that come out from this group in South America via drug trade and everything at how a proxy militia can survive 34 years after the Civil War ended at an all-time high for its Weaponry for its survivability so it's an unusual circumstance I think at the at the end of the day it's it's the Lebanese state that pays the heaviest toll because this state is is wobbling today yeah now with with these threats uh coming out of Israel and and you know the the battlefield that you talked about before in the South heating up more and more since October 7th or or 8th the day after um an allout war is on people's mind and Hezbollah went to war with Israel in 20 06 I want to know from you what impact that had on Lebanon 2006 did several things uh it showed that hasah can if it deems necessary cross the border and kidnap Israeli soldiers and and kill a few as well and enter a month-long conflict with Israel that is now referred to as the July War it can also accept under Jess a security Council resolution like 1701 and 1701 ended that war it created the ceasefire that still exists today on paper at least but it's a it's a resolution that enhances Lebanese sovereignty at least on paper and 1701 also did other things it expanded unifil presence unifil begins in 1978 under resolution 425 in 2006 we have 1701 that if I'm not mistaken three-fold increase in unifil troop presence in the South and it also did something which I don't think hasbalah wanted then in terms of how the war played out is that the Lebanese Army for the first time since the Civil War returned to the South prior to 2006 there was no Lebanese Army presence in South Lebanon despite Israel's withdrawal in May 2000 so the Lebanese Army is there unifil is there and hasbalah is there right now and if you fast forward it seems like the terms of Engagement meaning how this plays out in the long term Vis hasah and Israel are being honed in I doubt this is a call for allout war this is actually more familiar of how ceasefires were conducted in the 1990s and it's less to do with 2006 and the reason I say that is because hasah is not under Jess the way it was in August 2006 when 1701 was acceptable tobah hb's favor actually this time around is one of Leverage I think and enhancing maybe what Iran would like to get out of a regional deal that has yet to emerge mhm how how big is of course you know Iran is hezbollah's biggest backer how big is their leverage does Hezbollah do whatever Iran says or is there are there frictions among leaderships and and can Hezbollah say you know this is a bridge too far this is not something that we're willing to do how far can they can they work in their own accord great question there are local issues that matter to that group in Lebanon and don't really matter to Iran and there may actually be at times friction from security apparatuses you wouldn't imagine whether it's Iran or even the Assad regime actually to to go all the way here the Assad regime as it regains control in Syria may now always see eye to eye with hb's presence in Syria and may seek leverage once more in Lebanon they that might may not be satisfactory to H maybe to Iran long term so there is always a natural friction but in terms of the the capabilities and the military interests and the security security of the Iranian regime hasah is 100% in alignment on the Lebanese front I don't think hasbalah is happy with the economic crash I don't think hasbalah is happy with the presidential vacuum it may not be happy that it's pick for the president has not been acceptable but that's I think local friction that maybe Iran May nudge hasah to reconsider but at the end of the day local interests for that group and how it survives among other Lebanese actors that are disarmed that I think isb's terrain less what Iran looks at when it comes to Lebanon but in the bigger picture it is clear this is Iran's mirror reflection it is a substate group that manages it is born out of the 1980s it increases rather than decreases its presence it becomes sophisticatedly involved in Regional War that play out largely in Iran's favor and it seems to be shielded for the time being shielded from International curiosity and how to end this kind of Le end this kind of nightmare at least when it comes to the Lebanese Geographic Battlefield that unfortunately for too long we as a people have been paying a price for yeah how has this latest uptake in in violence and intention especially in the South been experienced by communities living on the Lebanese side of the Border over 100,000 Southern Lebanese are out of their homes uh Le South Lebanon is a war zone um even though it is it is so familiar to be in the capital of Lebanon and Beirut and almost feel like you're not in a war zone but then you're reminded with flyovers with the sound on occasion of a sonic boom or for that matter more recently watching the news of something that's happening kilom away there is there is a serious concern that this could escalate at any time but it's a stark difference from 2006 when overnight overnight Lebanon was engaged it's almost its entire geography engaged in war Bridges being bombed power plants being bombed institutions breaking down in the middle of war and of course over a million Southern Lebanese pushed out of their homes that summer it has not reached that level yet but I agree age with the premise in that the threat of escalation should be taken seriously even when up until now it doesn't seem like Iran wants a full out War but they should be taken seriously and for that reason alone International engagement should be focused on how to end this nightmare rather than kicking the can down the road which seems to be the preferred stabilization policies that keeps leban on a battlefield but brings back a semblance of quiet for years until the next round of War that was Ronnie shata in Beirut thank you so much for those fascinating and very thoughtful insights my pleasure
