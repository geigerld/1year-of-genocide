now to talk more about this I'm joined by kazer Arabi an Iran specialist and irgc research director at United against nuclear Iran a nonprofit kazra based on your research to what extent and how does Iran fund Hamas well it's important to understand that the Islamic Republic of Iran the regime in Iran is the primary military Financial logistical and ideological supporter of the Hamas terrorist group and if take a step back I want to unpack the nature of this relationship which really started to flourish in the early 1990s we saw pamas militants being sent to Lebanon to undergo training by Hezbollah but also a contingent of militants being sent to tan to undergo missile training by none other than the so-called Godfather of the Iranian ballistic missile program IC Commander tan Madam Hamas officials have also uh been on record uh underscoring the fact that this sophisticated smuggling Network that is underground in Gaza was the product of the late irgc GS Force Commander kasim sumani so one of the mechanisms to get this kind of material and financial support to the terrorist organization Hamas is through the sophisticated underground networks with Israel which Israel has tried to to counter but there is no doubt that this has Iranian fingerprints all over it and are these tax dollars or oil income that Iran is using to fund Hamas how does the money actually reach them sure it's a combination of both and I think the uh oil revenue is really important here illicit oil revenues uh since the coming of the Biden Administration the White House have surged so we have seen the Iranians be able to export conservative estimates put it at around 2 million barrels of oil per day so that's really at levels uh pre- sanctions so the US Administration hasn't been enforcing sanctions and the Islamic Republic has been taking advantage of that and this is consistent by the way with the surge in funding that we see for Hamas as you earlier mentioned this year in the past year we have seen Iranian funding we have seen funding but via the irgc increase from around 100 million dollar to $350 million you put that against the backdrop by the way of ir changes to the irgc's doctrine changes to the irgc's structure and you can get a clearer picture that clearly indicates that the Islamic revolutionary guard call the irgc had a hand not only in giving a green light to the recent terrorist attacks but also uh playing a role in strategically uh coordinating these attacks the Kaz briefly if you can what role are cryptocurrencies playing in this movement of money yeah cryptocurrencies uh have played an important role uh Iran is actually a crypto mining Hub so I think the crypto element is important they have been on record they have spent a lot of resource the Iranians to try and use cryptocurrency as a means to evade International sanctions but also they use traditional forms of uh of exchanges such as havala banking uh and through a network work of regime uh facilitators oligarchs that are spread all over the world including in Europe by the way um and so far these operations have gone have undergone without much uh without much uh Limelight being shun on them I think the US and the Europeans need to come together to set up a task force to identify the uh Iranian regime facilitators uh not least the oligarchs who are acting as these uh facilitators across across Ross the world not least in Europe what do you know about the status of the $6 billion dollar the US agreed to unfreeze as part of a recent prisoner deal with Iran so this is an important question because the US has obviously come on record and stated that it has refrozen these these uh funds and it's important to underscore that these funds are funable this money is funable the there is no guarantee that the Islamic Republic that the irgc will not be able to access this fund These funds and then transfer them for their uh activities across the region which includes terrorism and I think past us administrations including the Obama Administration by the way said on record that there was no guarantee that we could prevent the irgc from accessing this money now the US has been very clear in its communication has tried to uh direct has tried to avoid directly holding tan accountable for the terrorist attacks uh on Israel but but I think the very fact that the Biden Administration has refrozen this uh 6 billion uh fund these 6 billion uh in assets uh is indicative of the fact that the Biden Administration acknowledges uh the Islamic Republic's role in this so I think this clearly implicates that tahran did have a hand now the status of that money uh is in question the gataris uh have said that they this money is still accessible to uh the regime in Iran and I think there's a more important Point here uh you know the US last year in 2022 made Qatar a u major nonn Ally all the signs indicate the evidence is there that the gataris are hosting Hamas senior leadership terrorists they are supporting the Hamas terrorist organization in a way that is not really that different to the Islamic Republic of Iran so instead of being designated as a uh major non-nato Ally I think the US should designate the gataris as a state sponsor of terrorism alongside the Islamic Republic of Iran there is another aspect to this story that I want to address though and that is the role that Charities play in funding hamas's terrorist activities what can you tell me about that this is a really important question because once whenever we discuss the irgc's uh militia network uh which includes the Hamas terrorist organization we often focus on the hard power assets but underpinning this hard power asset is a soft power infrastructure that the irgc has carefully created uh with full support by the way uh of all the resources of the Islamic Republic of Iran so full State support from the Iranian regime and these uh soft power organizations call them Charities play a key role in both recruiting radic I alizing young men for these proxy organizations and militia organizations but also for the transfer of funds and we saw this model really reach its uh sophisticated Peak if you like after the 33-day war in Lebanon where the irgc GS Force created the so-called reconstruction committee for Lebanon uh which was headed by an irgc GS Force Commander Hassan asteri and they went into south of Lebanon to funnel money via this enti by this Char charity entity to Hezbollah but also reconstruct civilian buildings to suit and to enable the housing of irgc missiles and this is what they've tried to replicate in Gaza by the way in 2008 they created the Reconstruction committee for Gaza uh where the goal was for the irgc not only to funnel money via these entities to Gaza not only to recruit and radicalize Young men for Hamas but also reconstruct civilian buildings schools hospitals uh and housing for ordinary civilians with the objective of housing missiles in those civilian buildings and we're seeing this today in uh in in Gaza right now this is what we're seeing is a product of this irgc Goods force uh strategy and plan they've carefully uh created this plan as it makes it much harder for is is to identify and strike Hamas positions uh with with Min with to minimize um civilian casualties this is all part of the irgc strategy to use civilians to protect its missiles and of course this is entirely perverse strategy but it should not be surprising given that the fact that the irgc along with Hamas are violent islamist extremist organizations uh that that operate in such a way given how much atten ition this conflict is getting how much more difficult will it be for Hamas to access funds in the future well this goes back to targeting and imposing consequences on uh the chief supporters of the Hamas terrorist organization the West so far when I say the West I saying the US and its allies have avoided uh imposing direct consequences on tan they have avoided imposing consequences on Gat which is housing the senior leadership of Hamas and really until the US and its allies uh maintain this strategy So to avoid uh imposing consequences on tahran and Doha uh this strategy of escalation will continue the funds will still reach the hands of the Hamas terrorists and unfortunately um this period of escalation will continue uh this is completely in line with the recent structural changes and doctrinal changes to the irgc uh the irgc in the many months leading to this uh terrorist attack Was preparing for a major confrontation with Israel all the signs were there but unfortunately we weren't I say we the West wasn't paying attention uh if we really want to change the irgc's calculus and ability to send funds to the Hamas terrorist organization the focus should be targeting and imposing real consequences that will be felt uh in tan so punishing the Islamic revolutionary guards core for what we are seeing today uh in Israel how would that punishment look in concrete terms sure there are numerous ways uh and numerous tools at the US's disposal but the first uh tool should be a concerted push to gain all European allies and other nations in the world to prescribe the irgc as a terrorist organization the irgc is a violent islamist extremist organization that operates no differently to prescribe groups from Hamas to Hezbollah uh it has a program of indoctrination that calls on its members to wage Jihad against Jews Christians and zarrian for quote having unacceptable faith and look at the way it operates terrorism militancy hostage taking it should be prescribed as a terrorist organization this would impose maximum cost on the irgc to ensure that both its Financial assets are hurt to prevent its ability to fund terrorist organizations like Hamas but also to curb its ability to conduct Terror operations as well as homegrown extremism home radicalization on European soil that's one objective that should be at the priority a top priority for the US another priority for the US should be imposing consequences on Gat making it very very clear that they should immediately hand over Hamas Terror senior Hamas terrorist leadership or else they will face consequences that should include asset freezes in Europe in America Etc but also there should be a focus on targeting irgc assets these should be irgc gluts Force assets should be targeted in the region but also the US should make it very clear that the assets inside Iran irgc bases are legitimate targets until the irgc believes that the US will not impose uh consequences on on its ENT on its operations and directly on its operations and its coordination and strategy planning in Iran then this process of escalation will continue we should not tiptoe around the irgc's plan we need to take back control uh and make it very clear to the irgc that this is completely unacceptable and there will be consequences for this terrorist attack that it had a role in coordinating and greenlighting against Israeli civilians kazra Arabi thank you very much thank
