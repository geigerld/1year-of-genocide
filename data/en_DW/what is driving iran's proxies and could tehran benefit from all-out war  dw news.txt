we're now to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza Tuesday was the deadliest day for Israeli forces since the Hamas Terror attacks on October 7th 24 Israeli soldiers were killed in the Gaza Strip as the military tried to encircle Southern gaza's main city most of the soldiers were killed in an explosion in central Gaza according to Israeli military officials two buildings they had been mined for demolition collapsed after Hamas militants fired at a nearby tank Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it one of the most difficult days for his country and he added that Israel will not stop fighting until absolute Victory is achieved one of hamas's biggest supporters is the regime in Iran which has a goal of destroying Israel Iran's influence reaches far beyond Hamas in Gaza the clerical regime in tyon is using a network of proxies stretching from Israel's border with Lebanon to to Iraq to Syria and along the Red Sea all of these proxies are part of a strategy against Israel and its main Ally the United States Israeli troops on the advance footage from Israel's military shows its forces fighting in the Gaza Strip prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly framed this as a struggle between Israel and Iran which backs Hamas Israel has long been locked in a sh war with Tran conducting covert strikes and targeted killings it was believed to have been behind this strike in Damascus at the weekend but Netanyahu says his country is now in direct conflict with Iran who says we're not attacking Iran we are attacking it Iran is the head of the octopus and you can see its tentacles all around Iran backs a network of militant groups throughout the Middle East among their goals to undermine israil and drive out American influence these proxies have become more active following the October 7th Terror attacks in Lebanon Tran supports and arms Hezbollah seen by some countries as a terrorist organization its Fighters fire Rockets into Israel on an almost daily basis Israel is returning fire these images released by the Israeli Army but while the situation here at the border is tense so far it side has been careful to avoid in escalation Iran also arms the huis an armed group in Yemen Civil War which is seized control of large parts of the country including the capital SAR now the hoffies are attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea they released this video showing them boarding and seizing a cargo vessel they say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians Yemen is Bravely standing against Israel thank God for your beautiful effort Brave Mighty and proud Yemen is defending the oppressed and strong Palestinian people the United States and others have sent warships to the region and launch strikes on houy targets another front is in Iraq and Syria where Iran appears to be encouraging its militias to attack US military bases Washington has responded with its own strikes Israel's president is calling for a global response to these challenges care there is an Empire of evil emanating from tan they have proxies all over the region quietly lurking to undermine any peace process and any stability of the world and that is exactly what we are seeing and they have to be faced by a very strong Coalition for the moment Gaza is the most active front in Israel's cold war with Iran but Iran's proxies are becoming more heavily involved each strike and Counter Strike could bring the sides closer to open conflict well I'm joined Now by Alex vatanka director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC Mr fanka it's good to have you with us um this this growing involvement of Iran's proxies what is driving all of it is it all about the war in Gaza uh you know I think in many ways we really need to go back to the creation of the Islamic Republic back in 1979 and when ayahi came to power um he kind of created an agenda that this his successor Ayah who's been in power since ' 89 have been pursuing which is basically the two pillars of this Regional agenda is to end the state of Israel as we know it and to push the United States out of the region and I think you know the Islamic Republic has been pretty fiful in in sticking to this agenda at a very high cost for the Iranian nation and people but that's where we are at now having said that on the one hand while they do want to push the United States out of the region and confront Israel as we've heard the Iranian supreme leader say himself on many occasions since October 7th Iran is not in a business of confronting the us or is Israel militarily directly so what they're doing instead is the sort of low intensity Warfare through this network of groups that they have created in the last few decades but it's still not without its risks because what Iran does not know is the reaction from the West ultimately could could uh be uh quite costly for Iraq yeah I I've read that it is the goal of the Islamic Republic um of Iran to not to kill Israel not with one blow but with 50 minor or small stabbing wounds if you will and with that in mind do you think then that Iran has more plans and if yes what might that look like I think the Iranian game plan is pretty obvious in the short term is to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza as quickly as possible both for humanitarian reasons as they say but also to salvage as much of the Hamas military Wing as possible the Iranian regime would like to see a military wing of Hamas exist and continue to be a point of concern for the Israelis going forward in years to come so that's the sort of game plan in the short term I think in the long term two things that Iran is banking on one is not to get itself dragged into a regional War uh certainly not one that involves the United States because once the US enters the war against Iran that really puts the Islamic Republic at risk I mean the future of the Islamic Republic is not a certainty uh this is a regime that is hugely unpopular with its own people this is a regime that has pursuit of foreign policy that's hugely unpopular with the Iranian public so they would take a big risk fighting the United States and for that reason they don't want to go there at the same time what they're hoping to see is that what Israel is doing in Gaza its conduct in Gaza will undermine Israel's long-term presence in the Middle East and for example chip away at support in countries that recently signed the Abraham Accords the Saudis the UAE and so forth so that I I think in in summary is what the Iranians are playing on how has Iran's Regional policy shifted since the start of the war in Gaza it really hasn't I mean the two P big issues that I just mentioned in terms of trying to save as much of Hamas as possible keep hisbah out of the war and also prevent a direct confrontation United States those things have been true since day one what we saw in the last few weeks particularly with the attack in the city of Kerman uh by Isis horasan and the Iranian response to it when they started firing ballistic missiles into Syria Iraq but also Pakistan it sort of created a new set of questions into Iran and as somebody who's an Iran Watcher I think they're now wondering if what they have done particularly Pakistan was the right course of action you know to fire off ballistic missiles at a country that is three times the your population that has nuclear Arsenal it just suggested Reckless on the part of the Iranian regime that ought to concern all of us so one one has to hope that messages are going to Teran that look one thing is to have proxies uh fire off uh you know small Rockets into Northern Israel and get away with it another thing is is to for Iran to think that he can afford a regional war against adversaries that are much bigger than Iran has faced in recent years you know on the outside people looking in at the situation you know would consider the Abraham Accords will we seen several Muslim majority countries manag to normalize relations with Israel and then they they look at the Islamic Republic of Iran and and ask well why hasn't Iran managed to do this I mean is it as simple as as a Shia Sunni divide or is there more to it look the the Iranian enity toward Israel is limited to the Islamic Republic's leadership the Iranian people are not uh you know anti-israeli uh and before 1979 Iran and Israel had good relations as we all know but as I said ay came in 1979 decided to turn this into issue that his regime would inves in has done at a very high cost um aay who is the leader today at age of 84 I doubt very much he's going to change his position but I think people that are sort of waiting on the wings trying to maybe be the successors to to this supreme leader they need to really seriously do a bit of soul searching is what Iran doing Vis A IR Israel of of any serious benefit to the Iranian National interest I think most objective observers would say no it's an ideological commitment by this regime but if they chose a different course of action Vis Israel that would really benefit Iran because it will break its isolation I'm wondering too how this entire situation is affecting Iran domestically I'm thinking about the recent huge protest against the government there's the faltering economy and there's the 45th anniversary of the Islamic rep repu which is coming up soon right look I mean this goes back to what I said before about the the region a regional War being something that's too much of a risk for Ayatollah K and the generals in the Revolutionary guards precisely for for the fact that you just mentioned public sentiment inside of Iran this is a very angry Iranian public this is a public that looks around and inside of the Border sees incompetence mismanagement corruption on scales never seen before and in terms of foreign policy a regime that is basically taking risks everywhere you look while not being able to protect Iranian citizens against basic threats such as Isis from corasan as we just saw in with the attack in keron so it's a it's a regime that if really its uh Regional policy was put put to vote inside of Iran I have no doubt it would not be able to to win but one point final point if I make quickly on what we heard from we got 30 seconds go ahead seconds look the issue also is this Iran benefits from other peoples in the region particularly in this case Israel making mistakes if there was a real serious attempt to two-state solution uh in uh by the Palestinians and the Israelis that Iranian militant message would be so harder for Teran to sell so that's important for us to Alex vatanka director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute Mr vatanka we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank
