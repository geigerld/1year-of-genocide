well with famine imminent in the Gaza Strip the United Nations says it has enough food to feed the population there either at or near its borders but getting Aid into the besieged territory continues to prove extremely difficult in theory food and Medical Aid can get into Gaza via Land Air and sea for now ships unload at Port SED in Egypt and freight trucks take it to the gazen Border many countries are airdropping Aid despite the death of people hit by packages or who drowned trying to get to Aid that fell in the Mediterranean in an attempt to speed up deliveries the US plans to build a floating platform off the Gaza Coast it's unclear exactly where it will be it's the same design as this one built in the United Arab Emirates experts say it will still not be enough Overland routes are the most efficient way to bring food in but inspections make it a lengthy process Aid trucks are inspected by Egyptians in Elish they are then inspected by Israelis at the Kum Shalom or nitsana Crossings and only then head to the Rafa Crossing where they are often delayed again after coming under pressure from the United States Israel said it would allow its part of ashdod to be used temporarily to bring an aid and open the ARA's Border Crossing into the north of Gaza The era's Crossing was breached by Hamas militants in the October 7th Terror attacks which led to Israel's military operation in Gaza previously the era Crossing was limited to people on foot and was not built for truck traffic that means its opening is unlikely to drastically change the flow of supplies into Gaza JB McGoldrick is the UN Aid coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory welcome to DW news apart from the Aras Crossing Israel's defense minister has announced the opening of another Crossing closer to the coast near seek Him and reckons Israel will flood Gaza with Aid what do you make of that well I think we welcome any opportunity to get more Aiden we need 500 trucks a day and we're probably getting at the moment about 200 to 250 and as you mentioned there's famine in the north that's imminent and in other parts as well really deep insecurity food wise so if we can as many roads open and as many land routes as well as this proposed sea route then it'll all help but uh right now the humanitarian community's only got the one opening which is the kamam Shalom Rafa you were in Gaza just this week what did you see well I've seen it I go every week and every time you go in there it's no different just gets more and more depressing um people are worried very much now because of the the actual impact of a possible Raa in Curson and at the same time they're dealing with a day-to-day living there which is really drastic people living in really squal conditions very very hot temperatures now the water and sanitation issues are problematic the health uh the health services don't work and we are struggling to get enough food supplies and so there's so many areas of people's daily life which they're suffering with you say it's getting worse and worse from trip to trip but do you sense any hope with um the situation changing at least internationally with more pressure coming from Israel's biggest allies especially the US when it comes to uh continuing this war well we've been asking Israel for a long time now to have more supply routes and more possibilities of delivering Aid inside and they now starting to listen to us and as you saw last week they made announcements of all of these things like the as the ashdod port more openings in the north a COR coming from Jordan into it as well as the sea route and the three roads inside to allow delivery of assistance side and the especially the north part of Gaza so these are the things so there is hope in the sense that that's starting to move we see more trucks come in yesterday and the day before than ever before and I think that's part and parcel of what we're looking for from the Israeli authorities to allow us a much more permissive approach to delivering more and more Aid into different parts of Gaza because there are 2.2 million people there who are dependent on humanitarian assistance and there's only 250 trucks that are coming in so that doesn't make enough up there because there's usually usually 500 trucks today so there's a massive gap which has been in place for over 6 months of course another challenge is once you get that Aid in there those trunks are being ransacked in some cases by people out of pure desperation criminal gangs how do you deal with that well I think there's two ways to do it and one was mentioned the fact that you flood the place with uh enough Aid so every gets everybody gets enough and then you demonetize the problem so that there's not a value product everybody has something and the desperation goes and I think the other one is then to have the the former blue policemen who were there before who are no longer able to do the the the security crowd control and the guarantees they used to give us because they've been targeted by Israel so Israel holding back deliveries is creating this desperation is that what you're saying well I think that we we've asked for these more openings it's now start to happen so hopefully the announcements will actually turn into actual operations and implementation right now they're just announcements there's no extra trucks have come in through ashod or through G the north part of Gaza we're dealing only only basically with one road at the moment uh that's delivering assistance and it's clearly not enough and the roads we're using two of them are really badly damaged the one on the coast Road the AL Rashid and the one in the Middle sakaden Road both of them have been shunned up through military activity and other hostilities we have to Flat grade those again for them to be used and the only really operational one is the Military Road on the outside which only allows we've only had eight corn convoys over the last three or four weeks so the the supplies to the North in particular are very limited jimie what about the air drops are they making a difference well anything makes a difference if it comes in but I mean I think it's very very costly uh to have air drops it's about 300 times more per ton by air than it is by Road and there's no guarantee who ends up having those who reaches you've seen many people dying in the water or getting hit by things that are falling and it doesn't go to the ones who are probably most needy it goes to the ones who are strongest is able to run and catch these and carry these back and I I don't know that what type of food they drop but I'm not sure it's the it's the food that people are looking for so it's not just creating a a state of desperation but also one of survival of the fittest by the sounds of it you've dealt with many humanitarian crises in your time how would you say This One Compares I think that this one is different because people can't leave you know the tra in this space Gaza and they're piled into what's in Rafa right now which was a town of 250,000 before the war it's now over a million and the conditions there are quite solid and they're overcrowded and people are have really facing uh you know things like uh diseases that emerge hepatitis A the diarrheal diseases all these things have happened the services that are there are broken the health services only 10 out of the 36 hospitals Bas barely function there's no electricity and the water supply SS really really series it's very very rare you get a a crisis that's being created to this depth and magnitude in a short period of time affecting the whole population in an area that's not normal in a crisis and this is something that's been done through his man-made J codrick their un Aid territory thank you very much for joining us from Jerusalem thank
