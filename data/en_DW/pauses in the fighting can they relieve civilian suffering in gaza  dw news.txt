well the threat to civilian life is all too obvious in Gaza City and the World Health Organization has been warning of a deteriorating conditions leading to infectious diseases there but there's little relief for those who make it out of the warart torn city to the relative safety of the South and a lack of electricity and medical supplies makes the situation particularly challenging for those with existing health conditions since being displaced from the jabalia refugee camp in the North Hanah abuid has been living in a tent in conun in the southern Gaza Strip the 55-year-old has health problems including severe asthma which she has been suffering from for years she needs to use her inhaler daily and can only do so by connecting it to a battery there's no electricity here and that's not the only hardship in the camp I have severe shortness of breath the first thing that helps me is my device but the temperature inside the tent is very high and it's humid and at night I can't sleep whenever the neighbors use a fire to cook it affects my breathing I used to have a monthly appointment with the UN agency and I used to receive monthly treatment the camp for displaced people is overcrowded 27,000 people live here with no adequate health facilities and no electricity proper treatment is difficult several times a day Hana has to walk to the charging station to recharge the battery for her inhaler when there's not enough power in the battery I have to go and charge it it's a distance of half a kilometer every two steps I have to stop and rest I use the inhaler at least 10 times a day maybe more than that it's a really long distance for me I'm tired I need electricity I need help there is a health care center inside the camp but it's not equipped to provide all services that patients need however doctors and medical staff here try their best to give their patients as much care as they can with what they have at their disposal we received dozens of medical cases because of environmental and water pollution and infections that's in addition to the many cases of chronic diseases like Hannah who suffers from asthma and angina and needs treatment on a daily basis our treatment is aimed at alleviating the severity of the chest pain that she suffers from along with other displaced sick people Hanah Abu Z hopes to soon be provided with electricity inside the tent being able to charge and to operate her inhaler here would make survival a little bit easier short while ago I spoke with Shaina low a Jerusalem based spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council I asked her whether 4-Hour pauses in the fighting in the north that we've been hearing about would provide any relief to the people in Gaza nothing can be done in a 4-Hour pause first of all these pauses are unilaterally declared in order for there to be assurances of Civilian safety we need all parties to this conflict to be committing to these 4-Hour pauses but secondly in terms of of the four hours it's not really enough for humanitarians to go and provide assistance many of the people stuck in Northern Gaza are struggling to flee because they have mobility issues people in their families with disabilities there's no food or water in Northern Gaza so people are expected to make this long Trek on foot and it's just it's it's not safe they when they arrive in the South they won't be assured of their safety either this is um forcing people out of their homes with no assurances that they'll be able to return When hostilities are over amounting to forcible transfer which is a grave breach of international humanitarian law now the World Health Organization is warning of disease outbreaks in Gaza the humanitarian situation there as we all know is dire what are you hearing from your people inside the territory well we have 54 staff on the ground in Gaza who are reporting to us daily about what they're seeing and experiencing conditions there are just getting worse and worse by the day not only with the increase in the spread of communicable diseases and waterborne Illness but also just finding lack of food water medicine everything is in short supply in Gaza those who are not staying in designated shelters are having a hard time finding food on the markets and not getting uh Aid distributions that are being sent primarily to the shelters for the internally displaced people as you I'm sure you know uh Shane Cyprus has proposed uh humanitarian sea corridors for Aid uh to to help relieve the humanitarian situation in Cy in uh in Gaza do you think that could be a viable solution for providing to Gaza you know I don't know about all of the technicalities and how that would actually be facilitated but what I do know is that there isn't really time at this point to to plan uh on establishing new corridors we have the Egyptian Crossing in Rafa there are also Israeli crossings that could and should be opened uh and we need just a massive influx of eight however it gets in it needs to get in but we don't have time to waste the amount of assistance that's going in is in uh is is nowhere near enough what's what the humanitarian needs are in Gaza and on top of getting that Aid in we need a ceasefire in order for humanitarian organizations and the UN to distribute that Aid to Palestinians throughout Gaza uh and be assured of their safety and the safety of those seeking Aid Shaina thank you very much for talking with us that was Shaina loow a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council speaking to us from Jerusalem
