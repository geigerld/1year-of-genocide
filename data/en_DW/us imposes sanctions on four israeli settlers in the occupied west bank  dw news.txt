I'm Phil Gail welcome to the program US President Joe Biden has issued an executive order imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank following a wave of violence measures include the FI include financial and travel restrictions on a small number of settlers accused of violent attacks on Palestinians Israeli Prime Minister's office has criticized the sanctions as unnecessary and described the vast majority of settlers as law-abiding straight to our Washington bureau chief Inus Paul welcome enus what more do we know about the president's latest executive order well pH this executive order will enable the United States to impose Financial sanctions on individuals who are I quote here uh directing or participating in certain actions including acts of threats or of violence uh against civilians intimidating civilians to force them out of their homes destroying or seizing property or engaging uh in Terrorist activity uh in the West Bank uh we typically see these types of financial sanctions targeting Russians or or citizens of states that the US is in openly conflict with but we have never seen that targeting Israeli citizens and so does this tell anything about the sort of pressure that Mr Biden must be under at the moment absolutely this Phill is really indeed a striking and unprecedented policy decision I think it is fair to say that this is the most significant step any us Administration in history uh has taken in response to Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians uh in the West Bank and indeed proves a greater frustration uh of the Biden Administration but not only that it also underscores uh the immense pressure President Biden faces in this year which is just the beginning of a crucial presidential election year 70% of his party disapproves of his Israeli Israel Israel policies sorry and uh he indeed risks losing crucial support from black voters younger voters and of course Arab Americans if he is unable to exert pressure on Israel to commit to a lasting ceasefire and agree to a two State solution and Phil it's no coincident that this order comes uh right uh in the moment before President Biden was on his way to Michigan this is an important swing state with a large Arab American Community okay thank you for that uh Inus pole in Washington let's get more on this from DW special correspondent de Ibrahim in Jerusalem this initial round targets four individuals they've been named in uh uh press releases uh from the Biden Administration these are Financial uh sanctions that are aimed at making sure that these four individuals which the US says have been involved in violent attacks on Palestinians and Israeli settler Israeli uh activists peace activists in the West Bank uh they're aimed at making sure that they do not use the US Financial system a and that also to prevent American uh citizens from financially uh dealing with them like as you have mentioned uh the Prime Minister has already reacted to this um to to this uh executive order saying that it is UN necessary but also saying that Israeli authorities do uh what they're supposed to do to to to deal with this kind of violence in the occupied West Bank which is something that rights groups and Palestinians that I've spoken to in the West Bank will tell you just does not happen according to rights organizations there's documented evidence that the Israeli Defense Forces and the Israeli police has often times either accompanying settlers as they uh uh as they conduct these attacks or is sometimes uh even helping them with these attacks and these attacks have seen an increase since the October 7th uh uh Hamas Terror attacks on uh Israel their violence in the occupied West Bank has been spiraling uh since then and in fact um the United Nations has documented that over a thousand Palestinians uh have been displaced in the occupied West Bank these are bedwin uh communities as a result of uh these attacks and all of this of course undermines uh what the US says is its policy which is eventually reaching a two-state solution because um it is widely considered that the occupied West Bank would uh form uh the heart of any future Palestinian State and with every displacement of a Palestinian that goal uh is pushed uh even uh further so this is very much in line with what the US says is its policy in the region thanks a a Ibrahim in
