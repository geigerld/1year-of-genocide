US President Joe Biden has urged Israel to protect Palestinian civilians in its planned ground offensive of the Gaz and city of Rafa Biden met with Jordan's King Abdullah on Monday at the White House their first face-to-face meeting since Israel's war with Hamas began Biden said the two had discussed a possible six-week break in the fighting Jordan has been pushing for a permanent ceasefire Washington is the King's first stop on a tour that includes Canada France and Germany here is part of what Biden had to say in a joint news conference partly focused on Israel's expected move on Rafa the major military operation raaa should not proceed without a credible plan a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than 1 million people Sheltering there let's bring in our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca RIT is here Rebecca the US is Israel's most important Ally it's one of several countri countes urging Israel to think twice about launching an an assault on Rafa how are these words of caution going down in Israel well Terry this isn't the first time that the US president has said this he reiterated comments that he made a few days ago uh and it really depends when it comes to reaction on who you're talking to or who you're talking about uh Benjamin Netanyahu and his far right Coalition members don't take criticism uh against this operation very well they many in the far right uh you know hit back against uh President Biden when he criticizes their mission um when you're talking about the general populace within Israel let's not forget that the the war Israel's war in Gaza it does have pretty strong broadspectrum support here in Israel so when you talk to Israelis and and you talk to them about criticism or intern International condemnation most of them say well what do you expect we have the right to defend ourselves and that is really uh the main feeling across the country of course there are some other voices who say that you know these that these uh the criticism from the International Community and particularly the US need to be heeded and I think in the end that is something that will be taken seriously by Benjamin Netanyahu even though publicly he might uh you know he might condemn these comments or he might you know hit back the US president but in the end I think it's unlikely he needs the uh and and he needs to try to avoid further International condemnation so it is likely that any you know ground operation in Rafa will be taken as he has said that he will they will be looking uh to to try to evacuate the civilians living there and I think you know it's unlikely that an operation will begin without at least some attempt to do that you say they might Evacuate the civilian population we're talking about over over a million Palestinians who've been compressed into this town of Rafa uh is where would they go Rebecca does Israel have a plan to to evacuate them to a particular place well that really is uh a major question being asked here being asked by the International Community in particular and by eight organization saying that there is just so few places left uh for people to be able to go Benjamin Netanyahu has has ordered the Israeli military to come up with a plan so far nothing has been made publicly available as to where they see uh those Palestinians being able to go there's very few options as I mentioned you know much of the the center and the north of the strip has been destroyed there's few places that people could potentially go back to there and they are literally running out of space in the southern part of the strip so it remains to be seen just what kind of plan uh the the the Israeli military will come up with uh that is something that Benjamin Netanyahu has said is uh is underway and is being looked at but no no details yet on that Terry meanwhile talks are still going on uh trying to broker a ceasefire and uh the release of those hostages being held by Hamas how is that affecting how is the talk of assault on Rafa affecting those negotiations Rebecca well quite severely we've had you know Hamas certainly saying that if there's a ground operation then we are all out we are not going to negotiate any any longer and we've we've had the likes of Egypt operation without the evacuation of those civilians that they are looking at potentially ripping up the peace agreement they have with Israel now that would have huge ramifications in the region not just within Israel but but a much wider ramification so uh you know some really strong words coming there and of course affecting these negotiations that is something that the Israeli population are looking at they really really want negotiations they really want to see at least a limited ceas fire or a majority certainly want to see a limited ceasefire in a in in order to be able to have those remaining hostages return safely uh but these negotiations uh are ongoing despite uh threats of this ground operation the Israeli military is sending a delegation to to Egypt today Egypt cat playing a huge role the US also playing a part in those negotiations they continue uh they have we saw some some you know hope last week people really sort of giving positive words coming out of those negotiations uh we've seen that falter a little bit but they continue and the hope is certainly from all sides uh that all people involved in those negotiations that some kind of deal could be met if this ground operation goes ahead however that looks less and less likely Rebecca thank you very much that was our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem more on this Let's cross over to journalist kareim elari in Cairo kareim first of all tell us what are Egypt's concerns concerning an Israeli ground invasion of Rafa that's right on Egypt's border yeah right and that's exactly why there is a big fear in the Egyptians on the Egyptian side that there might be some kind of mass Exodus from the Palestinian side towards Egypt towards the north of sa that would be of course not only a security problem for the Egyptians but uh they really don't want to be seen as any kind of part in a in a wider displacement scenario of the Palestinians because the big fear on the Egyptian side is not only that the people come over that but also that they might be never be able uh to come back there's also like in the Egyptian media talk that such ground offensive might reach the Cav peace agreement because within this agreement there is an agreement for a buffer zone between Egypt and the Gaza Strip where the Israeli Army a demilitarized buffone where the Israeli Army can only be there um without heavy weapons so that is that's the other talk with in the Egyptian media about this ground offensive now more than a million Palestinian civilians are believed to be Sheltering in Rafa they came there from other parts of the Gaza Strip seeking shelter um from what you know Kareem where can they go if and when an invasion begins well yeah no more sou left in the Gaza Strip obviously uh so there is the choice of crossing over this Mass Exodus to Egypt I think the what the Americans want from the Israelis that they create some kind of corridor for people to flee uh towards the north but I mean to flee where too there's I mean big parts of the north are completely destroyed uh there's nothing provided for the people no food no water no medical attention and they're standing in front of the ruins of their former life Karine tell us about negotiations that are taking place right now in Egypt Kata Saudi Arabia the United States Israel involving of those what would a ground offensive on Rafa mean for those negotiations well I think the the everyone is trying to put up the heat right now I mean alone the threat of the ground offensive is of course putting up the heat on Hamas from the Israeli side uh and on the other side Hamas is saying if there is some kind of if there is this ground offensive that will be the end about the negotiation of the negotiations about the return of hostages so both sides are really trying to put up the heat here but it's of course An Extremely Dangerous Game the Biden Administration is putting pressure on Israel to show some restraint the Biden Administration is also calling for at least a temporary ceasefire how is that talk going down in in Egypt and across the Palestinian territories well not really very well I mean I don't when I saw the pictures now you showed when Biden was talking I saw the King of Jordan besides him with quite a grim face while Biden was speaking of course it was like I heard both of them last night um it's like two words Biden is not in principle against a ground offensive he wants just the the Israelis to manage this ground offensive in a certain way the King of Jordan was very clear yesterday that he said there should be no ground offensive there should be an immediate ceasefire and then immediate talks about a political solution uh to this problem so I mean we're talking like this was as if two people two worlds in one room yesterday with Biden and the King of Jordan Kareem thank you very much as always that was journalist Kareem El guari in Cairo you're
