now Israel says talks with top us Egyptian and Qatari officials in Paris on the Gaza War were constructive but that there were still significant gaps that remained media reports have been reporting that the sides were working on an agreement in which Israel would agree to a ceasefire in return for the release of more than 100 hostages joining me now is defense and Foreign Affairs analyst na bin Mubarak Alani he has served earlier as the katari Director of Defense intelligence operations and as the defense attache to the US he joins us now from Doha welcome to to DW we're hearing about a ceasefire deal in the making in Paris as we just mentioned uh do we know more about its terms well actually uh Nisha the the way a lot of these uh negotiations happen uh in the past and the way the qataris have been dealing with this is through utmost secrecy keeping it very close to their vest to ensure a successful outcome and I don't believe that this will change in the process that is reportedly happening now even so we saw over 100 hostages released the last time around in November but can we expect all hostages to be released given that they're being held as a bargaining chip by Hamas well that's the point of any negotiations is to come to a conclusion of uh you know a positive result in this case the release of hostages and the cessation of violence through a ceasefire and hopefully lasting peace to help the uh people of Gaza who are suffering under uh very bad situations as you've been reporting so that is the expected end State and again the qataris as the lead uh negotiators have proven the effectiveness of this approach in the past over 100 released unfortunately the Israeli approach has been less successful through IDF operations that have failed and led to the death of deaths of hostages and obviously thousands and tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians you mentioned Qatari Effectiveness but we do know that there is a serious trust deficit between Israel and Qatar and that is required if we are to reach that long-term ceasefire that you mentioned doesn't this limit what doha's negotiators can even pull off well again that depends on you mentioned Israel when in this case it depends on the Israelis the Israelis have a proven track record of the qatar's effectiveness in the past through requests from Israel and from our partners the United States as well and recently with the release of hostages so the proof is in the pudding they either see the proof and see well that's an effective thing that it's not Pie in the Sky it's not theoretical it's achievable or they can continue in this Mass military operation that hasn't achieved even the idf's own stated goals to this point but I have to ask Israel has reiterated again and again you mentioned the idea of stated goals that they will not stop until Hamas is eliminated how then is a long-term ceas fire even possible because that is clearly not happened yet well it's is a standing understanding standing you know um uh view in all policy and military operations that there is no military solution to a political question or a problem there is only a political uh solution to a political problem and this is no different than any other uh the region is not ready for another Forever War it's already spilling over to other regions just as we came on air you saw the reports on the Jordanian border uh of uh Americans being attacked there this is very worrying and if it grows even further than this then it will engulf not only the Middle East but it will involve the Europeans and the Americans as well defense analyst na M Alani in Doha thank you so much for your
