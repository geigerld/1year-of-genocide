Hassan nasah the leader of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon has threatened a fight with no rules if Israel launches a full-scale war with his group he also said Cyprus would be a legitimate Target in any future War if it continues its military collaboration with Israel his statement followed Israel's announcement that its military has approved a plan for an operation in southern Lebanon the latest strikes on Lebanon Israel and the militant group Hezbollah have been trading crossb attacks almost daily now they have taken steps with the potential for a fullscale conflict Israel has approved what it calls operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon we've made absolutely clear that one way or another diplomatically or through uh military means uh our our northern border the north of our country will our Israeli Sovereign territory will be made safe for Israel's population Israel's people to return them hezbollah's leader Hassan nasala responded by promising a fight with no rules they have to wait for us on the ground in the air and in the sea we have said this before and I will say this again today if the wars imposed on Lebanon the resistance will fight without control without rules and without a ceiling the crossb exchanges of fire began after the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas the UN says more than 400 people were killed in Lebanon in such strikes including dozens of civilians on the Israeli side the reported casualties amount to at least 25 soldiers and civilians Hezbollah says it is ready to deescalate but to do so it wants something that has proven difficult to achieve alastin ceasefire in Gaza and DW correspondent Rebecca rits is following events from hia near Israel's northern border with Lebanon Rebecca good to see you Hassan nasah has warned any potential Hezbollah attack on Israel would be one with no rules how is Israel seeing this warning well Israel takes the threat on its northern border very seriously beish and that is why it has had a very very large troop presence here in the north along the border and of course all the military hardware that goes with that uh since the very beginning of this war in fact since uh Hezbollah launched its attacks into Northern Lebanon on the 8th of October in support of hamas's war in Gaza uh so it's been taking it seriously all along I mean the Israeli military has been incredibly tied up in the Gaza war and it hasn't wanted to open up a completely a second front in the north but it is the received wisdom that the idea would be that Israel has to in fact push back uh the the the threat of hezb at its northern border and that after it has quote unquote completed its missions in Gaza it will then turn its attention to the north that could be what we're starting to see with this ramp up of rhetoric and the heightened tensions here on the border NASA is not the only person raising the rhetoric though you're seeing that on the Israeli side as well with threats coming and we saw the the confirmation as you just mentioned that they have in fact green lit their plan uh and they will implement it if necessary you're in hia which Hezbollah apparently filmed with a drone showing potential targets do residents feel under threat of attack from Hezbollah well we came here to gauge that sense beish you can see behind me uh a little bit of the ocean and the port which is there which is one of the targets that Hezbollah had in its sights in that Drone footage um we've spoken to people here on the streets you know last night when we arrived all the cafes restaurants everything was open it's definitely business as usual here in hia I think residents here uh feel a sense of normality still at this stage though they do uh obviously are aware of the heightened threat they are concerned and I think everybody feels that that a a wider conflict or certainly a larger scale war with Hezbollah is in the future so of course there's concerns but really when you walk around Hyer I have to say that it's it's seemingly very normal I was just actually speaking to a military personnel in uh downstairs down from where we're standing now and he was saying that he believes war is is is really inevitable but that as as you look around and as I can see with my own eyes people here are not yet yet concerned enough to be to be making any concessions meanwhile crossb attacks between Israel and Hezbollah have actually been taking place for months so why are tensions particularly escalating right now well despite the fact that Israel and Lebanon have have been H in a quasi conflict regarding the Border region uh for many years this current flare up is inextricably linked to the war in Gaza and the longer that that goes on uh the more risk there is of this spilling over into a wider conflict into a direct conflict with Hezbollah or with Lebanon and seeing that as as a more allout conflict rather than the tit fortat that we have been seeing now for for nine months or so uh so the longer this goes on without a hostage deal without an end to the war in Gaza and without a withdrawal of troops there we're we're moving further and further closer towards some wider conflict we leave it there for the moment twws Rebecca RIT is reporting from hia thanks so much
