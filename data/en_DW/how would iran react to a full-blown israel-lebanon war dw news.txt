Germany is making a further â‚¬1 million EUR available for humanitarian Aid to Gaza foreign minister analena babok has been holding talks in the region in the occupied West Bank she called for the Palestinian Authority to play a role in post-war Gaza in Jerusalem bebook criticized the Israeli government over settler violence she says these actions damage Israel's interests in the long term parts of the Israeli government ition are stirring up trouble and endangering Israeli security interests in the long term with their aggressive settler policy Israel's strength lies in its liberal democracy the shocking reports of cruel detention conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli camps and prisons do not fit in with Israel's own claim to be a democracy and constitutional state let's get a broader perspective on these developments Randa slim is a foreign policy specialist from the us-based Middle East Institute she joins us now from Washington welcome to DW Randa we just heard unusually explicit criticism from babok there how significant is that coming from the German foreign minister it is significant because until now Germany has been one of the strongest supporters of Israel um especially also of its war in Gazza and so um you know it's better that it's coming but uh in my opinion it's a bit late it should have come much earlier especially in in in rejection of the war in Gaza and Israel's war there yeah beok also warned about the dangerous situation in Lebanon on Israel's northern border she says she's working hard on finding solutions to prevent more suffering but to what extent is Germany really involved in efforts to diffuse tensions between Israel and esbah it's not involved in any significant way I think it's involved through the European Union it's involved through its relationship with with Washington the two primary parties that are now involved in seeking deescalation pushing a diplomatic process to resolving the conflict on hisb between hisbah and Israel has been the United States of course first and then second France and they are now working together in tendon now Germany has some impact in terms of basically you know pushing the the the alarm on sounding the alarm on any potential escalation between hisbah and Israel into an allout war and it will have an impact because it has shown itself to be a strong supporter of Israel and so if that if in case there is this kind of escalation that leads to an allout War I mean Germany has some leverage in basically saying you know we are not supporting the Israeli action um on this front especially If it threatens to devolve into an allout War yeah and well she hasn't said that quite yet Israel on the other hand yesterday announced it will move some of its troops from Gaza to the border with Lebanon in your opinion how volatile is the situation there right now the situation is very volatile I think there has been a long-standing conflict between HB and Israel I have not seen the kind of rhetorical escalation between them in in this way it's unprecedented in in the history of this conflict but also the time of military escalation that's taking place you know with the two parties striking deeper into each other's territories and still there are certain Unwritten ground rules that are trying not to violate especially when it comes to hitting civilians but the escalation is really significant and in my opinion we are really right now at dangerous moment in this confrontation between them that can that can basically move into an all at War any any time any Mistake miscalculation by either party can really push the the the confrontation which has so far been limited to border clashes between the two sides into an allout allout Regional war and you have seen Iraqi militias that are affiliated with Iran coming out strongly saying they will be coming in to fight on the side of hisbah you are going to see more from other members of the Iran um you know pro-iran resistance AIS um also coming uh to the front basically threatening to get involved in this contest in this conflict if the escalation were to happen yeah let's talk about the role of Iran here because Hezbollah is of course mostly defunded by a Terran if a full-blown War really were to break out with Israel how would you expect Iran to react to behave it all depends on whether that war will present an existential threat to hisbah that's the red line for for Iran uh as as long as long as hisbah will be able to defend itself will be able to you know engage in that war without any kind of threat to its U continued existence as a anchor of the Iran lead resistance access I don't think Iran will get involved directly it will definitely prompt uh other members of the pro-iran resistance access to get involved it will uh uh not only involved in Lebanon but also involved in other fronts like uh attacks against maybe us assets from Iraqi militias in Iraq attacks on us Assets in Syria attacks on us assets and Israeli Assets in the Mediterranean Sea so that's the kind of involvement but once once the threshold is crossed in terms of that war representing any kind of existential threat tobah then you are going to see Iran getting directly involved in the war the Middle East a powder CAG still and for the foreseeable future by the sound of it Randa slim of the US based Middle East Institute thank you so much thank you morning now I'm joined by journalist Stella Mena from Beirut Stella we have just heard unusually clear criticism from barbach there how significant is coming from the German foreign minister of course criticism coming from Germany is one of Israel's allies as more significant than if there's critique coming from other countries but the question is rather if bearbox criticism will have any consequences the US government who's also a very important partner for Israel has criticized the government many times before and even hold back bombs or Fighters and yet these actions have not really led to any change in Nan's policy and the question is of course whether Germany wants to continue criticizing only by using words or if it will take further diplomatic actions now the German foreign minister situation in Lebanon just North of Israel is that another focus of her trip yes the situation uh in the Border region is definitely a major focus of her trip after book's visit in romela she flew directly to Beirut where she met with the caretaker caretaker prime minister miti and the Minister of Foreign Affairs buh Habib and as we speak right now Beach is supposed to be at the airport leaving beay in a statement published by the German Ministry of Foreign AFF Affairs earlier uh it says that Germany wants to to prevent an escalation of the fighting in the Border region into a bigger Regional war and uh the statement also mentions that Germany sees the implementation of UN resolution 1701 as a solution for this conflict that would mean that Hezbollah has to withdraw its troops from the region south of Lani River the German foreign minister has visited the region there multiple times since the October 7th attacks how much weight does Germany carry as a diplomatic player in Israel and the surrounding region well it's quite hard to say how much of an impact bebook was able to make with this visit when it comes to Israel is quite clear that Germany is an important partner for the Israeli government but when we talk about the surrounding Arab countries burok uh diplomatic power is limited Germany's strong support for the for Israel in the current Gaza War especially through weapon supply has caused a lot of criticism in the region uh as well as in Lebanon and uh in Lebanon Beach was originally supposed to meet with the speaker of parliament Nai ber who's very close to hisb but this meeting was cancelled officially because the time schedules were incompatible but of course this uh still says something about uh the priority bebook uh is for Barry Stella thanks for taking time to talk with us today that was journalist Stella Mena for inbay rout
