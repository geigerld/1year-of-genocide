media Reports say ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas are due to resume in Cairo mediators have been trying to secure a pause in nearly six months of fighting in return for the release of hostages still held by Hamas which is designated as a terrorist group by a number of countries the intensified mediation efforts come after a public saring of relations between Israel and its main Ally the United States the Biden Administration which is facing election year criticism at home has been stepping up calls for a break in the fighting to allow the flow of humanitarian aid for gaza's civilians let's get some more analysis with journalist kareim elari who is in Cairo as well uh Kareem bring us up to speed with the latest what can we confirm about ceasefire talks and what are the challenges facing both sides well first as now media reports that uh as as a sign to create trust there is an agreement to release the bodies of two Israeli soldiers in exchange for an unknown number of pal Palestinian prisoners that is the pretext for this negotiations Netanyahu agreed last Friday to send representatives from mosad and shim bit intelligence services to Cairo to take part in these negotiations uh today and also there is Israeli media reports that this time they have some room to work and to to negotiate there is talk that during Ramadan both sides came closer uh but it's not the first time we hear this we have to see it's clear what Hamas wants Hamas wants a ceasefire Hamas wants the withdraw of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the return of the many displaced Palestinians that had to escape to the South so they can be are able to go to the north of the Gaza Strip and um a prisoner exchange of about 40 Israeli hostages in exchange for 800 prisoners it seems like this is something Israel the Israeli side according to Israeli media reports agreed even that among them there are about a 100 um prisoners that convicted for murder murder the head of mad said that there is now more flexibility on the Israeli side especially when it comes to the return of the displaced uh but the defense minister says there is no time for flexibility so there seems to be also some disagreement on the Israeli side but to be clear before any of this happens and it Bears repeating you're saying that there are preconditions to those talks let me let me go to the next question Israel's prime minister Netanyahu seems very determined to go into Rafa despite objections from Washington what are you hearing will these talks make a difference well this threat to go into Rafa of course is the elephant in the room in the negotiations in in in Cairo um we have to see that the US agreed uh now to send more weapons to Israel but at the same time they indicated that they would be not very happy with a direct full-fledge Israeli offensive against Rafa with its 1.4 million people living there uh according to Israeli Channel 12 there is preparations for this uh offensive to isolate Rafa to EV to start to evacuate the idea to evacuate civilians they even it said both 40,000 tens from China for that but uh it's also we have to not forget this talk about the offensive is also some point to make pressure on Hamas in these negotiations got it that's a journalist aim alwari from Cairo in Egypt many thanks you're
