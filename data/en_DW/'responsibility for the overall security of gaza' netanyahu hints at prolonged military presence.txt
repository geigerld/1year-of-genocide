the Israeli Army has stepped up its operations in Northern Gaza pounding the area with air strikes and encircling Gaza City Israel Defense Forces are expected to enter the city soon they've been preparing for urban Warfare with the islamist militant group Hamas which is likely to lead to a sharp rise in casualties the Israeli troops have already severed Gava Gaza City from the south of the territory now in an interview with us broadcaster ABC News is Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu said that Israel will take responsibility for the overall security of Gaza after the war those who don't want to uh continue the way of Kamas it certainly is not I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have the overall uh security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of Hamas Terror on a scale that we could couldn't imagine well for more I'm joined Now by DW correspondent Ben fulan who's in Jerusalem good morning Ben good to see you so as we've just heard Israel's primee Minister said that the country will take uh responsibility over the Gaza Strip after the war what does he mean by that well responsibility is one word and occupation is a very different one uh we know that Israeli troops withdrew back in 2005 we also know uh what hamus reaction would be a senior official in Lebanon saying it would never accept a puppet government uh you also have to remember that the right-wing uh religious government of Benjamin Netanyahu is under fire at the moment uh Netanyahu himself uh a dead man walking as he's been described his career sounds like it's already over uh protests here against him and his government only continue so there's certainly a lot of pressure over him that would bring into question whether or not Israel does have any Authority uh when it comes to the PA though the Palestinian Authority and these have been the suggestions so far by uh US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin uh it has very little authority and autonomy over parts of the West Bank at the moment and to put it in place to govern the Gaza Strip would also be highly problematic there has been talk of a group of uh several governments coming together and international agencies to perhaps govern the Gaza Strip and uh provide security but that is also under question now Ben uh the Israel Defense Forces are intensifying their focus on Gaza City did the IDF give much detail why specifically there and with what aim well Gaza City is the biggest city it's expected to be the stronghold of haras no one knows for sure exactly where they are in their tunnels uh but the IDF or Israeli Defense Forces have managed to separate they say the hamama strongholds of the north and south and are now operating at full force uh there have been new plans uh approved by the health Ministry but uh if this next phase is to begin and troops uh start entering Gaza City according to media that could happen soon then uh this would mean Fierce Urban Warfare and could mean High casualties on both sides uh we're talking about high casualties as well as far as civilians go with hundreds of thousands staying a humanitarian Corridor remaining open but Israeli troops only able to secure part of that the health Ministry overnight saying that another 292 people have been killed hits on hospitals and more Hamas Rockets flying towards Israel Ben briefly if you could Israel also o says it's open to pauses in Gaza what more can you tell us uh this was mentioned in an interview the White House also saying that this has been mentioned in talks between Netanyahu and Biden but a complete ceasefire is totally off the table all hostages would have to be released for that and Netanyahu would like to see all hostages released even if there was some sort of temporary Tru of types uh the pressure though mounts and a lot of pressure coming not just from abroad but also locally because of the hostages held and the hostage families putting the pressure on Netanyahu thanks Ben DW correspondent Ben fulan reporting from Jerusalem the Hamas controlled Gaza Health Ministry says that more than 10,000 people have been killed by Israeli strikes since they began their campaign a month ago many gazans have been heading to the south of the strip in the hope of avoiding Israeli bombing but nowhere in the territory is truly safe in Gaza the human cost of this conflict keeps on mounting as the small strip of land continues to be pummeled the Israel Defense Forces say they opened a humanitarian Corridor this allowed Palestinians to evacuate the north where the bombardments are heavier though it seems that nowhere in the strip is truly safe an Israeli air strike hit a residential building in a densely populated District of khun in southern Gaza they are all children not a single adult all children the whole building collaps on them these are your goals Netanyahu may God take revenge on you hundreds of thousands of displaced garans are now living in makeshift shelters in the south of the strip as Israel intensifies its bombardments for this Hospital hital employee just one missile strike took everything away I was working my shift at the hospital when the casualties started arriving to my shock I saw among those marted were my wife meon as well as our four children the youngest of which was 8 months old it's an all too familiar story for many living in the Gaza Strip the war between Israel and Hamas shows no sign of letting up and it's the people on the ground who are paying the heaviest price of all un Secretary General Antonio gutes has again called for a ceasefire and voiced concern over violations of international humanitarian law in the monthlong conflict Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces and continued bombardment are eitting civilians hospitals refugee camps mosques church and un facilities including shelters No One Is Safe at the same time Hamas and other militants use civilians as human Shields and continue to launch rockets indiscriminately towards Israel well for more we're going to talk now to Toby fricker a communication specialist from UNICEF currently in the Jordanian Capital am man good morning Toby and thanks for joining us on DW news so we just heard there from the UN Chief Antonio gues saying that nowhere is safe in Gaza how are people coping there with such a dire situation yeah that's right I mean we can safely say you there is no safe place for for children for civilians in in the Gaza Strip right now um we know know that you know around 1.5 million people have fled or to the southern area You' have been displaced in different areas particularly in the southern part so what that means is you have many many people in what was already a densely populated area now living in in shelters you're very very closely together um so the conditions are extremely difficult in terms of accessing Safe Water Sanitation hygiene you know these issues that compound the other issues which is staying safe trying to stay safe you know day in day out and that stress of of for children particularly of going through this on a 24-hour basis and and that's why UNICEF why the UN SEC General as you heard you calling for this immediate humanitarian seasar and also to them be able to scale up the amount of life saving Aid that we can bring into the Gaza Strip but importantly then move around you know in a in a safe way Toby the UN Secretary General also warn that Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children it's a truly horrifying image do we we know how many children have been killed yeah I mean well if you look at the reported numbers of more than 4,000 children who have been killed you know and many many many more uh injured then saying it's becoming a graveyard for children is you know we can say that I mean the numbers are are horrific um and and again that's why the protection of children the protection of civilians is so important as the statement there was a joint statement with uh un heads and Civil Society you know saying enough is enough we're now you know for a month now we've had this same day in day out this horrific bombardments you know we still have children civilians held hostage inside the Gaza Strip who need to be immediately released as well and you have Rockets flying into Israel traumatizing people there as well so this needs to stop now and that and that's why the UN SEC General's been speaking out again and that's why the un's coming together many others to to keep calling for this humanitarian ceasefire Communications were restored in G on Monday after being cut again how has the lack of communications affected people's lives yeah the lack of communication is is is a massive impact on on on children on families inside the Gaza so we've heard from our staff members when it was reconnected you know how isolated and even more scared they feel you know they they they're then removed from family members within the Gaza Strip they can't contact they don't know how they are uh when people need urgent care they can't call for that support for ambulances to move around and then also from a humanitarian assistance perspective of course it's extremely difficult to coordinate Aid I mean you you can't when you don't have any communication um so when those lines are cut when there is no communication Network it's extremely difficult for humanitarian workers but also ex extremely scary if it can be even more scary for families living inside the Gip who are completely isolated now Israeli military uh have have said that it surrounded Gaza City and it's preparing for expected ground battles how has your organization been preparing for this yeah I mean we're massively massively concerned about the northern part of the Gaza Strip I mean if you can talk about one specific part now of the northern part is even more dangerous let's say than other areas because we have many many families many children many civilians who who are trapped in the northern part of the Gaza Strip so we're hugely concerned because it's not just the the safety but also the access to particularly to Safe Water uh to food to medical supplies you know which were already extremely low and now we're massively massively concerned because also for us to work there as humanitarians it's it's it's almost impossible um so this is a huge which is again why we need space you know this humanitarian Seaside to then be able to support people particularly inside the northern part of Gaza Strip thanks Toby Toby fricker from UNICEF joining us from am man I'm joined Now by Jonathan Spire Middle East expert and author in Jerusalem welcome to DW news Jonathan what do you make of Benjamin netanyahu's remarks about taking responsibility for the overall security of Gaza well it's been the stated position of the government of for a while that the goal of its war effort in the Gaza Strip is to uh bring down to collapse the Hamas government uh in Gaza the one which of course launched the atrocities against Israeli civilians on October 7th it's not been so clear until now what Israel intended to as a successor authority to uh the uh Hamas Authority and I think from netanyahu's remarks it's become clear that what we'll be talking about if indeed of course Israel achieves its Mission its stated mission in the Gaza Strip will be a combination something like what exist in the West Bank I would suggest of a Palestinian Authority of some kind or another governing authority of some kind but with u a continued Israeli security presence and commitment within the Gaza Strip so that's the way that I would interpret netanyahu's remarks yeah now Netanyahu also says he's open to pauses in Gaza fighting for Aid do you think that's because of pressure from the United States very possibly I think that there is a a sort of gamut of opinion right now if uh the UNSC was discussing I think yesterday the issue of ceasefires and of course uh the position of some of the members there China I believe and others was for a an open-ended what they call humanitarian uh ceasefire the Americans Administration is call calling for what it calls humanitarian Paws that's to say a ceasefire of a few days I think W Netanyahu is clearly positioning to do is to say well Israel is not necessarily opposed to very brief tactical pauses but I guess what the government of Israel will be trying hard to convey is that Israel is very seriously committed to the military Mission which it has set itself which to reiterate is to bring down the Hamas Authority from that point of view a long a ceasefire certainly or even a long pause allowing Hamas to regroup and requip its Fighters would very much not be on the agenda so yes I think that the prime minister of Israel is seeking to sort of position himself in order to continue to advance Israel's agenda and intentions without risking uh you know a rift in a certain sense or a decline in a certain sense in the currently close relations between Israel and the US Administration now Jonathan um in the case that um Israel does take of Gaza um Talk us through some of the major challenges I'm assuming we're talking about here that Israel would face in that that uh if that were to take place first of all I think it's clear it's important to note the distinction inside in the PR's words we're talking about security uh responsibility that's to say the Israel Defense Forces would retain its capacity to act against similar efforts by Hamas or Islamic Jihad to murder Israeli civilians as is their stated goal of course I don't think it means that Israel would be wanting to take on political responsibility which does then of course introduce very much a a challenge for Israel and indeed I would suggest for the International Community which is who then in fact would rule Gaza would it be the Palestinian Authority of rala notably uh secretary Anthony blinkin was recently meeting with mhmad abas in rala but the sense seems to be that he would only accept any return in return for diplomatic concessions which might be difficult to find would it be some combination of perhaps Arab forces and countries that have been noted the Emirates Egypt Morocco even and these are all things that have appeared in media in recent days some people have suggested that Muhammad dlan the gazan former gazan strongman today a resident of United Arab Emirates and close to the authorities in Abu Dhabi might be able to play some role so yeah I think there are very very major question marks over the political and administrative future of Gaza if indeed the Kamas authorities brought down I think what Netanyahu is doing is he's saying well bottom line whatever the future is it should be understood that Israeli forces will uh intend to maintain freedom of action in Gaza against those who would harm Israeli civilians thanks Jonathan Jonathan Spire mid least expert and author joining us from Jerusalem thanks very
