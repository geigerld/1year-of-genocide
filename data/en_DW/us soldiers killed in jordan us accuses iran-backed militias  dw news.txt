well the Pentagon says the US is preparing to take significant action against militias which have hit American targets for days the Biden Administration has been hinting at strikes in retaliation for a drone attack in remote on a remote US military base in Northwestern Jordan known as Tower 22 three American troops were killed in the incident on Sunday defense secretary Lloyd Austin said it's take it's time to take further action against militias backed by that have attacked US forces on land and at Sea Serv MERS he also said that while wishing to avoid the conflict escalating the US will not hesitate to act the president will not tolerate attacks on American troops and neither will I our teammates were killed by radical militias backed by Iran and operating inside Syria and Iraq so this is a dangerous moment in the Middle East we will continue to work to avoid a wider conflict in a region but we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States our interest and our people and we will respond when we choose where we choose and how we choose let's look at this with Bradley Bowman who's senior director of the center on Military and political power in Washington DC welcome to DW uh what are you hearing about the when where and how thank you for the opportunity to join you you know the Biden Administration has uh been deliberately vague on uh the when and the how and I think that's appropriate right because Washington does not want to give its targets a lot of advanced notice because that would endanger US forces and change the results but at the same time uh there's been a lot of signaling here the administration seems to be looking for some sort of goldilock strategy if you will where it's not too hard and not too soft the premise of this Administration for months now has has been that American restraint is the best path forward the problem with that approach is that we've seen more than 165 attacks on US forces in Iraq Syria and now Jordan and many republicans in Congress think that's what brought us to this horrible point where we've seen three the lives of three service members taken members who will not be returning to their families so uh there's many in Washington pushing for strong attacks but this is more art than science and they're trying to find that sweet SWAT between establishing reestablishing bolstering deterrence but not starting a larger War okay so no or when or how what about where yeah you know I I think it's almost certain that we'll see significant attacks this is my informed conjecture in Syria uh maybe in Iraq there's some disincentive to conduct these attacks in Iraq because when we cut when the US conducts these attacks it creates pressure in Baghdad to try to evict us forces which would be a gift to Iran and a gift to the Islamic State so I think we'll probably see attacks over multiple days certainly in Syria uh some IR Rock and perhaps elsewhere and many in Washington are saying that if you just focus on the terror proxies the puppets if you will and avoid the puppet master in Iran then it plays right into the Islamic Republic of Iran's decades long strategy where they Advance their interest through others and to displace the counter punches and consequences onto others usually Arabs you've talked about this this Goldilocks strategy uh not so uh hard enough to uh to deter a further attacks but not so hard uh as to uh provoke more attacks escalation does seem inevitable as you look at the events of the last few weeks between um clashes between the the IDF and Hezbollah along the Israel Jordan border the US and Britain striking houthi Targets in Yemen and now uh this talk of uh of American America hitting targets perhaps in uh Syria perhaps in Iraq the the escalation seems inevitable it it uh yes but it is interesting that everyone sounds the alarm about escalation when America responds I mean imagine for people watching home imagine your home was hit 165 times and and and and the homeowner repeatedly Said Knock It Off please stop please stop and they keep attacking your home 165 times when that homeowner responds I wouldn't call that escalation I would call that Common Sense self-defense to knock off the attacks I I think the real danger right now for Washington is a too weak of a response rather than too strong sorry right okay so the the idea though that that Washington whether with or without its allies goes ahead and Andes and attempts this goldilux response you don't think it carries a strong risk of the whole thing going up in Flames I think it's very likely as a student of history and the student of this region and someone who's studied defense and National Security issues for a long time that if the US does the strong response which I believe restoring deterrence requires that you may have a short-term escalation of course of course uh we saw that in January 2020 in Iraq when after the uh kasum solomani killing we saw two US bases in Iraq hit with ballistic missiles from Iran an active war against Iraq and had more than a hundred US service members with traumatic brain injury so I hope and expect that pentagon is taking steps now to protect us forces for the inevitable response which will come but that doesn't mean the United States can sit on our hands because we can't leave our adversaries with the impression that they can kill our soldiers and face no consequences that's unacceptable Bradley Bowman from the central military and political power thank you thank you sir I'm joined Now by Alex vatanka director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC welcome to the program Alex now we've just heard those uh strong words from the defense secretary there what more can you tell us about the possible targets and timing good interview what you told me I think uh timing remains to be seen clearly uh the United States needs to act uh the killing of three Soldiers by this Iraq based militant group really demands action and response uh it will be significant and in terms of targets and your question look it really depends I think overall uh if you look at the axis of resistance that Iran has been spearheading in recent decades it spans from hisbah in Lebanon and to some extent we could call the houthis in Yemen on the other side of the Middle East also a proxy of sorts um of the Islamic Republic I don't think these organizations will be targeted I think the US will be very specifically going after those militant groups that have been carrying uh about 167 attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria so I think it'll be very targeted I don't think it will be a sort of major uh you know attack against some of the bigger players in the axis of resistance like hisbah it will be minor groups that the US will go after so you don't think this could cause some kind of escalation military tensions particularly after the US has said it's not seeking war with Iran if you mean escalation in the sense of a regional War I don't think that is likely to happen for one simple reason the United States as white has has made it very clear is not interested in Regional War I don't think the Israelis are interested in a regional War at this point and certainly the Iranians are not interested in Regional War so I think most likely what would happen is clearly you don't want a regional War if you're Washington but clearly you want to make sure you uh re uh you know reinforce the idea of deterrence um you have thousands and thousands of American troops across the Middle East for them to become uh sort of sitting targets for militant groups is unacceptable to any American president and certainly this American president who just enter election cycle so for politic reasons in the United States and because the reality is on the ground something needed to be done but nothing as large as inviting a regional War which is just said I really don't don't think is of the interest of any other the larger players you mentioned the political angle there how how big part does that have to play oh it's important I mean uh for any American president it it would be important when American soldiers are killed uh overseas and for this particular uh American president as he's facing a reelection he needed to do something but at the same time I think President Biden knows that the American public opinion is not interested in a large war in the Middle East that's the last thing American public opinion wants but when you start killing Americans it requires a response and I think the Iranian side clearly understood that if you noticed the last few days Tran is trying to distance itself from these proxies and the proxy group responsible for the attack in Jordan has itself not suspended attacks in in the United States so I think that tells us quite a bit about where each uh is coming from and where we're likely to go in the near future okay so so Iran as a whole you would say they don't have a a major um overall objective in in backing these groups well clearly Iran does have a long-term objective and that goes back to the Iranian Revolution of 1979 there are two key pillars to that one is to basically bring the end of the state of Israel the other one is to push the United States out of the Middle East but that's a long-term strategy of the Iranian regime if you listen to Iranian supreme leader Ali he's not asking for war and these objectiv is to be met next week or next month or even next year he's saying that's a long-term strategy now that's a whole different issue and how the West deals with that requires um you know a strategy on the part of the West which frankly doesn't exist right now but in the short term as I said I doubt very much anybody's interest in Regional war that would essentially put everybody at a loss okay Alex vatanka thank you very much for your insights
