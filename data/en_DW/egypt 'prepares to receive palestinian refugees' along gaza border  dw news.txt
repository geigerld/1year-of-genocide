sources in Egypt say construction work to create spaces to accommodate Palestinian refugees has begun on the border with Gaza they say the area is being prepared in case of an Israeli offensive in the city of Rafa as part of its campaign against Hamas who launched the October 7 Terror attacks such a move could cause an exodus of Palestinians across the Egyptian border video released by Egyptian NGO the Sinai foundation for human rights shows work verified by the royal news agency has being along the gazan border Egypt has repeatedly said an Israeli offensive in Rafa would be unacceptable more than a million Palestinians are currently Sheltering there well our correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca ritters told me more about Egypt's plans in the area well just as you say there Phil we're getting reports credible reports that are being verified uh to show that this is actually underway this construction is underway we're seeing satellite imagery that shows this these eyewitness videos that have been confirmed and also from speaking to contractors on the ground you mentioned there the the SII Foundation of Human Rights they've been talking to two contractors on the ground who've confirmed that this is indeed the case that this area is being built and on the satellite uh imagery we can see it's from the Gaza border uh through quite quite an area to one of the to another Highway inside the Sinai Peninsula and that is being built for as you say the case where we might see a mass Exodus of Palestinians now Egypt have been saying that they don't uh want to accept a a huge amount of Palestinians into their territory for fear that they won't be able to return uh but this is of course an emergency measure should Palestinians either break through the Border or or or should for some reason the Border be opened and does it look like Israel will heed International criticisms and call off its offensive on Rafa it's really difficult to say we we the IDF do not give us advanced warning of their plan plans but we have no reason to believe that they won't carry out what they say they have been going to do and that is to continue their ground offensive into the Rafa City into the Rafa region where more than a million people are now Sheltering from other parts of the Gaza Strip and were told by the Israeli military to go down there to shelter in that area so we they've they've carried through with all of their other uh statements that they say that they were going to go into hunas they were going to go into the South they did so so we have no reason to believe that they won't in fact uh go ahead with their ground offensive of Rafa as well uh of course there have been huge international calls to ensure that the civilians that are Sheltering there are able to leave and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly stated that he's asked the Israeli military to come up with a plan to evacuate these people Sheltering there though we have noos you know the UN and many other NOS saying that there simply isn't room there isn't space where where will these people go uh many of them have been displaced multiple times already and they're tired we we've spoken to some people on the ground there who say they simply would just rather die and rougher than have to move again they're tired uh and they're living in squalid conditions with little belongings left and they've seen many of their family members die already so there's a lot of frustration and fear from the civilians who are still Sheltering but plans a concrete plan to evacuate them hasn't emerged yet okay Rebecca thanks for that Rebecca rers in Jerusalem journalist Karim El gavari joins me now from Cairo with more Karim what do you know about Egypt's plans in the area well we first know that there are satellite pictures that shows an area about 12 square miles that is prepared for something like this we have now the videos from this NGO from sa you were showing in your report and we have um we have security sources anonymously talking that this Camp is in the making uh that it's going to be surrounded by a wall and that it will be housing something between 60 what is able to house between 60 to 100,000 um people accepting Palestinians forced out from G was a red line for the Egyptian government has the government now changed its mind no um it's clearly a constituency plan I mean they don't want to be part of any official plan of any displacement uh of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip of any forceful conviction eviction of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip so this is a camp that is just preparing for what might come because of course on the Egyptian side there is Big fear that there will be some kind of mass Exodus when um this Israeli ground offensive in Rafa really start because I mean what the people will do in front of them they have the Israeli Army behind them they have the Egyptian uh uh wall of the border so it's a big possibility that they might to try to get out onto the Egyptian side and they're just basically preparing for this they're trying to put it into so some kind of controlled area that was was the and because the Egyptian Army also don't forget they will be not able to go against these refugees or the people who come over the Palestinians by force it's politically impossible even that they shoot at the Lis so they try to set up something where they can control the situation and is Egypt certain that if it came to this that these refugees in the Sinai in the places that are being uh in the area where all this construction work is happening that these refugees would be there only temporarily well that is the big fear I mean the big fear is of Egypt that there will be they they really don't want to be part of a displacement scenario and uh uh of course first I mean big parts of the Gaza strips are completely destroyed so where would the people go back to when the war is over and the second thing is there's of course parts of the benam Beno government who is talking openly about the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip forever so that is something of course Egypt has in mind that Egypt is very fearful of are there concerns Karim that this could eventually affect bilateral relations between Israel and Egypt h if it comes to that absolutely I mean the Egyptians already said if their security concerns are uh not addressed through this Israeli offensive they might even recall the Ambassador and there was even talk uh few days ago that the Camp David peace agreement might be uh completely suspended but that's something the Egyptian government denied by now we'll leave it there for the time being thanks for speaking to us journalist Karim Al gavari reporting from the Egyptian Capital Kyo thanks so much you're welcome
