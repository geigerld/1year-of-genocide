I'm David Levitz welcome to the show in Israel Mass rallies against the government of Benyamin Netanyahu marked the eve of the six-month anniversary of the Hamas Terror attacks mounting anger over the government's handling of the war in Gaza brought tens of thousands onto the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities protesters demanded that Israel agree to a deal with Hamas for the release of the remaining hostages many calling on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down some accused Netanyahu and his Coalition of delaying a hostage deal for political reasons our correspondent Aman ISF sent us this date from Jerusalem thousands of Israelis have taken its streets across the country to demand the end of Netanyahu government not just here in Jerusalem but also in Tel Aviv and hia the thing that brings them together is the fear for the safety of Israel now we talked to several people here and they said that they're mostly concerned about the lives of the hostages the hostages that remain in Gaza under Hamas control they believe that Netanyahu is not negotiating in good faith to bring those hostages home and especially with mounting pressure from across the world on Israel with how Israel is conducting the war in Gaza the people here believe that Netanyahu has made Israel less safe by alienating it on an international stage the protests come as Israel is responding to international calls to allow more humanitarian Aid into Gaza the government has approved the reopening of the arz Crossing into Northern Gaza and the temporary use of ashdod port in southern Israel Aid agencies say not nearly enough supplies are getting through to the Palestinian territory and that famine is imminent inside these boxes is medicine and supplies much needed Aid at this Hospital which has become the most important in Northern Gaza after alifa Hospital stopped functioning many patients arrived at Kamal adwan hospital this is a small hospital and we lack medicine and supplies we call on International organizations including the World Health Organization and we thank God today that we received some supplies Aid has been trickling into Gaza however agencies say it's not enough to meet the needs of the population pressure has been growing on Israel to allow more humanitarian supplies Into The Enclave which the Israeli government has approved this decision comes in the wake of the killing of several Aid workers in an Israeli strike earlier this week but safety concerns remain an issue for agencies still operating in Gaza we don't have the ne necessary security guarantees to work here the people also need to be safe so for that for us to really be able to scale up to avert famine so that people don't have to die because they don't have food we need security guarantees for us as humanitarians but also for the people we serve in Gaza farman is edging closer in Northern Gaza where some 70% of the population is facing catastrophic hunger according to the un's world food program Oxfam says since January Palestinians in Northern Gaza have eaten an average of just 245 calories per day that's less than a can of beans when we were displaced at the beginning of the war we used to eat rotten bread because of the high food prices this is the only place where I can get anything for my children I have three boys and a girl they need food where do I get food I can't afford to buy it everything is so expensive and I have no money this Local Kitchen is our safe place we come here every day a problem shared by many gazin 6 months into the war and with no end in sight to their suffering the US and Israel are on high alert expecting retaliation for the bombing of Iran's Embassy in Damascus on Monday after funerals for seven members of the Revolutionary guard who were killed Iran warned that it reserves the right to quote take a decisive response Tran says Israeli War plans were used in what it considers a major escalation in Israel's war with its Regional adversaries benam benali is a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies Research Institute in Washington DC he focuses on Iranian political and security issues benam good to have you with us Iran has promised what it calls severe Revenge what exactly could that mean well it's great to be with you we've seen the clerical regime in Iran promise something similar before uh for example in response to real or perceived threats from Israel in 2022 and again in 2024 uh the regime ended up striking publicly from its own territory um Targets in Iraq that ended up being the homes of Kurdish businessmen K killing innocent civilians alleging that those targets were mosad bases uh in the past the Islamic Republic uh has been increasingly uh interested and willing and able uh to publicly launch missile operations the more capable they have become but thus far in its history it has never directly targeted Israeli territory publicly from its own territory uh using these weapons so what is the risk of us seeing a full out Regional War now there's certainly the risk but looking at uh Iranian commentary particular within the past 48 hours while there is talk of quote unquote a slap against Israel and lots of political and security and military officials on a recently manufactured Iranian holiday called KS day the other day which is held on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan uh between their commentary if you kind of read between the lines uh was a lot about how Iran felt emboldened because it felt like it was already winning in the battle fields to the post October 7 Middle East so my assessment is that Iran is likely not going to do something uh to shake off the current trajectory so that might mean not targeting Israel directly or again launching an attack against a third party country or more likely you've even had Iranian political officials talk about terrorism against Israeli embassies so what capacity would Iran though have to hurt Israel uh it broadly depends on how one defines hurts I mean uh within the past 48 hours you've had Iranian news agencies actually admit that this Brigadier General that was killed in the Damascus strike Brigadier General zahedi uh allegedly partook or helped plan uh the October 7 terrorist attack which is an eerie slip of the tongue given Ton's denials for the past six months uh so clearly they have a robust terrorist apparatus in the past the Israelis and the Iranians have traded barbs in cyberspace that could potentially continue as well it's also an open question because tan was pointing a finger at America despite the very public American denial um if it will resume militia attacks in the heartland of the Middle East like in Iraq and Syria against us positions in your assessment just briefly what could be done right now to deescalate the the situation if anything you know listen this this is a really tough question because I think the Iranians at this point in time were politically locked in uh they've sunk a lot of costs publicly and rhetorically about uh feeling the need to respond the question is how will they intend to save face here and what can the west and Israel others do to bolster deterrence to limit any kind of potential Iranian response Ben I'm Ben Tali blue senior democracy thank you so much for your time and your analysis we now would like to get some more on this Potential Threat from Iran and for that I'm joined by hin yakob Schindler he's senior director of the counter extremism project which is an international non-governmental organization welcome to DW so Iran has promised what it calls severe Revenge are we about to see a full out Regional War thank you so much for having me I I don't think that a severe Revenge that Iran has promised the US for example also in the aftermath of General Solani is necessarily coming in the way that everyone imagines so everyone of course justifiably because you cannot 100% excluding it is looking at air strikes into Israel however has many more opportunity toties to respond and I think the most obvious way is really to go back to the old Playbook on how Iran responded in the past and that is looking at attacking installations in this case Israeli or even us installations outside the region worldwide there were attacks for example in 2012 in Bas Bulgaria against Israeli tourists that I think is where the threat lies should Iran attack Israeli ter proper by itself not via hisbah this would really put a lot of water on those uh in t Aviv as well as in Washington who argue for direct attacks against Iran already and hence this is not in the Iranian interest well talk to us a bit about these proxies you mentioned hisbah this is the largest and best armed non uh governmental force in the world if I'm not mistaken what is its capacity to really hurt Israel um on behalf of Iran we've already seen the last couple of months crossb attacks on a daily basis around 80,000 Israelis in the North of Israel have not been living in their homes since the last six month this is a real pressure also on the Israeli economy and a political pressure on the government but Isa is much more than that missa has a global truck distribution and transporting Network that finances in part the go hisbah has quite a lot of economic interests around the world and hisbah has an attack Network structure every single attack in the last several decades that Iran initiated had some element of hisbah operatives behind it I.E normally the strategic planning the organization on the ground was done by irgc or pastan offic off offices um sometimes even based in the embassies in the in the country but the operatives who actually planted the bomb who killed the individuals the these were Isa operatives so hisbah is for all intents and purposes if needed also an additional foreign attack Network for the Islamic Republic of Iran and if as you suggest this retaliation may even take place outside of the Middle East um possibly in some other country and some other continent is there anything that can be done to deescalate the situation right now well at the moment it's really hot we are in a super tense situation not only do you have the Gaza situation continuing we have thepa attacking Northern israels we have renewed attacks of Iraqi groups and Syrian groups on us installations over the last couple of days we have the houthi problem in the Red Sea all of this creates a very difficult T situation to diffuse the regime in Teran of course after the death now of a really high ranking general who was also the alasan PO person between Iranian forces in Syria and hisbah and hispa forces that operate in Syria on the behest of Assad um in the embassy of tan uh in in Syria is a really really difficult political thing and they will have to react unfortunately in some shape or form that was Hans yakob Schindler senior director of the counter extremism project many thanks
