a new report concludes Israel has failed to provide evidence backing up its claim that members of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees were involved in Terror activities Israel made the claim in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks which led to some donors freezing funds for the UN agency but an independent report reviewed the workings and has concluded that the agency has robust Frameworks to ensure compliance let's get more on this story from Chris gunnis a former Chief spokesperson for the UN relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East Rena uh anra he joins us from London thank you so much for taking the time i' I'd like to start with your thoughts on this report was this an expected outcome for you well I certainly welcome the Colona report which confirms the indispensable role of unra and as a Lifeline as it calls it it also confirms has established a significant number of mechanisms and procedures to ensure compliance with humanitarian principles this is important particularly the principle of neutrality and the report says unra possesses a more robust approach to neutrality than any other UN agency or NGO that's important because at the moment people are trying to give some of unus functions particularly in Gaza and the West Bank over to other agencies most significant if I may of all the clan report States clearly that though Israel has made public claims that a large number of UNR employees are members of terrorist organizations that Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of this in other words the allegations that triggered this crisis that saw this massive famine remain unsubstantiated unsubstantiated so it would seem that the Israeli claims amount to the mother of all lies and that intelligence dossier it was based on that intelligence dossier was a dossier and if I may just make one last point the curriculum the H curriculum which has been much criticized um according to the colonal report it says that unra has been responsive to criticism of its textbooks and has initiated a range of initiatives to ensure neutrality of its materials and it finds the unus education policies updated guidelines and manuals have become robust and adequate for purpose that's really you know that's quite a thing for her to conclude the finding that Israel has yet to back up its claims does indeed seem to be the main takeaway from this independent panel and yet they have also cited serious gaps in the agency upholding the principle of neutrality specifically examples such as staff openly stating political views on social media uh for example is that something that needs to be worked on inside of unra in your view well I and I think onra 2 will welcome these recommendations and these things being pointed out as they fully align with un's continuous efforts to improve and to keep Pace with evolving challenges in fact continuous Improvement is absolutely core to unr's success under the microscope of scrutiny and criticism over the years and that's why unra is now considered by Miss cloner as best among un and NOS on this issue so I think yes these gaps are important it's good that she's pointed out but I think unra will embrace them it's part of the continuous Improvement that unra sees as calleda to its Zero Tolerance policy against neutrality violations now as we've hinted at Israel's allegations came with with serious consequences more than a dozen countries suspended their contributions in its wake that led to a pause in funding of about $450 million according to this report could you give us an idea of what effect that has had on the relief agency's ability to function I have to say it's had both a political effect um in that we've seen this attack this political attack on unra which I think lies behind the attempts by the Israeli far right to discredit unra to defund unra and ultimately to dismantle unra but let's be clear as far as countries like Germany are concerned Germany froze its funding â‚¬2 200 million EUR a year now that's had a devastating effect for example unra in Gaza has been feeding before the conflict 1.2 million people now that's of course been put in Jeopardy by this German decision and of course the number of people unra is feeding has almost doubled in that time so I hope that Germany will think very hard about this because you know the German people I think will be mystified why its government um would continue to do this in the light of the fact that the Colona report effectively says that unra has processes in place for dealing with neutrality and indeed the fact that there were no that Israel has produced no evidence at all to substantiate the allegations on which Germany based its decision to defund so let's hope that Germany because we're now seeing so many hundreds of thousands of people slipping into starvation I think the German government of all one of the richest in the world will realize that you know2 200 million EUR for starvation no that that doesn't that is not you know what I would see as core German values so let's hope that the German government will refund thank you very much for joining us on DW with those insights that's K Chris gunis uh formerly with anra
