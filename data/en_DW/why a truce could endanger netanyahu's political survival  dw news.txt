to news now about the war between Israel and Hamas International mediators are calling on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire proposal put forward by US President Joe Biden Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense domestic pressure some want him to reach a truce and secure the immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7th attack but netanyahu's far-right allies are threatening to bring down the government if he does so since the beginning of the war Netanyahu has insisted on the total Destruction of Hamas he has carefully avoided defining any clear timeline for ending the conflict or any discussion of the day after in Gaza but now his hand may have been forced by a truce proposal forwarded by US President Joe Biden the deal would bring a permanent ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the remaining hostages held by Hamas crucially the US stresses the plan is not theirs this was an Israeli proposal we have every expectations that that if Hamas agrees to the proposal as was transmitted to them an Israeli proposal that Israel would say yes while Hamas says it views The Proposal positively netanyahu's far-right allies are Furious it is a reckless deal there is no total Victory except a total defeat de feat for Hamas I say that if prime minister Netanyahu continues to lead this deal we will dismantle the government the ultimatum has left the Prime Minister facing a stark choice and the clock is ticking last month one of the members of Israel's three-man war cabinet Benny gance delivered an ultimatum of his own gance gave the government until June 8th to come up with a plan for the future in Gaza or he withdraw from the government the pressure is mounting on Netanyahu and it's coming from all sides DW correspondent Rebecca rits joins me now from Jerusalem good morning Rebecca is prime minister Netanyahu willing to accept the deal that's a really really difficult question to answer bees as you heard there the pressure is really mounting on Benjamin Netanyahu especially from the United States who say that the prime minister's office tacitly agreed to this deal they are framing it as a deal that has come from Israel one that they had previously agreed to but on the weekend we heard from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who again reiterated that he would not accept any deal that led to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas are completely uh you know obliterated and completely taken out of the Gaza Strip so that is something that he's promised to his far-right members of his coal Coalition who on the weekend also threatened to break up that Coalition should prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu agree to such a deal uh we heard this morning that he is due prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that is is due to meet with one of those far-right ministers so there are clearly talks ongoing but as he keeps reiterating he wouldn't agree to a deal that leads to this permanent ceasefire that has been the sticking point on the other hand you have Hamas who won't agree to a deal that doesn't lead to a permanent ceasefire so that's where the kind of the Gap really lies and has lied for months now so you know the sticking point of that is is that particular deal the US are putting immense pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu and and saying as you heard there from John Kirby saying that if Hamas do agree to this and it's certainly looking like they may do they have responded positively so far we're still waiting for a final response but if they do that that the US expects Israel to agree to Israel's defense minister yav Galant has said Israel is looking into an alternative local governing body to take over from Hamas are they talking about the Palestinian Authority well he didn't specify what he meant by this governing alternative uh the Palestinian Authority is certainly one serious option that is being touted by the United States for one certainly that's what they're saying they'd like to see in a post-war Gaza that a revitalized Palestinian Authority as they say uh could then govern both the West Bank and uh the Gaza Strip currently obviously as we know they don't govern uh in Gaza but they do govern in the West Bank though there are issues they largely seen as corrupt uh they don't have a huge support base they haven't held elections for many years and you know they don't have a lot of authority with Palestinians in general so that's why the US are calling for them to be revitalized but you know the Benjamin Netanyahu has said he does not see that as the option you have Galant has criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for not coming out with a post post Gaza War plan he says that you know that that it's irresponsible that they need to be making a plan um he's certainly against establishing uh Israeli civilian control in Gaza that's something that Galant has said he does not want to see and he is all for Palestinian entities governing in areas along with International bodies but we'll just have to see what happens he hasn't specified whether he means those governing entities to be the Palestinian Authority but that is a very unpopular uh option for the Israeli government we'll leave it there for the moment DW's Rebecca RS in Jerusalem thanks very much let's get some more context from Professor Yosi melbeck from the middle Easter and North Africa program of the think T Think Tank chattam house Yosi prime minister n finds himself in a sort of a clinch between his own government the US and the will of many of his own people who demand he bring the hostages home is that a circle he just can't Square it's a difficult Circle to square but it's all of his own making he is the one that form a government with the far right that has no strategic Outlook whatsoever they don't understand how Wars are conducted they have they have a Messianic view of the world and they will continue the war forever H the pressure from the United States actually helping is a right now to end this this war because Israel set from from from the outside and un unattainable aim of destroying of destroying Kamas and we see eight months later it's still deep into into Gaza and and bring soldiers and and troops back to areas that it it already was supposed to clean from from from Hamas militant so it's it's a time to end this war to bring the hostages back to look into the future of the Reconstruction of of Gaza and also to look at the bigger picture of the Israeli Palestinian conflict now this is not the first time that the US especially is putting pressure on Netanyahu if he says no again what effect will that likely have on us Israeli relations will Joe Biden lose patience as as as we just saw this is an Israeli pop proposal so one assumes that it was discussed with with with netan negotiated with him so if he goes back on his world this creates further tension with with with Washington we know it's it's an election year in the in the United States but patience is running out and I think it ran out a while ago there is a difference between a gap right now between the lack of patience with the netan government at the same time how the United States react you know netan has an option here because he has the support even from the opposition those who didn't join the government and the Coalition after October 7 said a deal with they we support you from the outside the the the parties the party that was in opposition before October 7 says exactly the same this is part of the ultimatum of reaching a deal along these lines and supporting netan but the end of the day it it it his decision what he puts first the country or his vested interest but there is also another complication that has to do with with the case of the the Supreme Court actually deliberating about the issue of drafting Ultra Orthodox into the army and this might complicate this further which might end actually in in in election quite soon How likely do you think it is that this this government netanyahu's government um breaks down it's it's a real possibility the most important thing it's not whether it's has the we know in democracy it has the support of a majority in Parliament in the KET but if you look at every public opinion P this government there's no mandate from the public because what happened since the last election until now was a SE change in Israel this is not what Iran ran for this is a government that failed its people on October 7 and fails the country ever since so the the the public is is desperate for election and said time and again that it was netan out and and a new government that will deal the pressing pressing issues with that comes again the complication of of drafting Ultra Orthodox the right is actually threatening to leave government if there is a deal or they even put pressure to accelerate and escalate the war withal in the North because this is the only mod op the know never ending War thank you very much Yosi melack from the think tank chattam house in London thank you
