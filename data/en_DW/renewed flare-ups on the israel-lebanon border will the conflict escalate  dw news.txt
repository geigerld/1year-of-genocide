to the Middle East now and Lebanon where missile strikes in both directions across its Southern border with Israel have been ongoing since October the destruction insecurity and fear of an allout War have pushed many to leave their homes in those areas DW's Muhammad sha reports haidar is almost 60 years old yet before he moved here he'd only been to Beirut once or twice he comes from BEDA a small town in southern Lebanon close to the border with Israel this is what it looks like now daily crossb shelling between hasbullah and Israeli Army since October 8th has destroyed much including haidar's shop and home he came here to Southern Beirut 7 months ago and set up a grocery store he named it after his hometown I had my own Butchery and grocery store in BEDA and my brother owned a supermarket we lost everything it's all destroyed our shops and our houses thank God I'm working again but it doesn't feel the same being away from my hometown I'm happy that I can still see and meet people from my town and the nearby border towns who come to my shop this brings me some Joy haar's new Beirut neighborhood is home to many others who fled the southern towns it's thought around 100,000 refugees have fled their homes near the border with Israel many here have become haar's loyal customers the man lost everything his house his store everything and yet he is not greedy what you get Elsewhere for 50,000 you get it here for 20 or 25,000 he sympathizes with others who have been through trouble times he feels for them and he tries to reimburse them I come here every day to buy fruit and vegetables it's always fresh I like him because he's always smiling outside the grocery store people are anticipating the latest updates from the Frontline these people are celebrating Ashura the most sacred date in the Shia Muslim calendar it marks the death of Imam Hussein grandson of the Prophet Muhammad this Gathering is also used by hasah to deliver political messages this is hassanah Secretary General of hasah the party designated by many countries as a terrorist organization if your tanks invade Lebanon and Southern Lebanon you will not only suffer from the lack of Tanks but you will lose all your tanks his message we are ready for an allout War even though we don't want it the growing tension and destruction On the Border would point to such a development one that would push many more Lebanese people to become refugees in their own country uh let's get more from G Steinberg he's the Middle East expert at the German Institute for international in security Affairs he joins us from Berlin gido we've just heard in that report that hasbalah is ready for a fullscale war from your perspective is it well uh I think that hisbah is trying to deter the Israelis because there has been a debate in Israel going on since the 8th of October when hisbah started attacking the Israeli North uh whether Israel shouldn't start a preventive War War and the the main um the main personality arguing for such a war has always been the defense minister yuf Galant uh and I believe that hisbah is extremely worried about recent news that this uh debate has been started a new in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem uh it tries to tell the Israelis U that hisbah is prepared for this confrontation but I think that it fears this confrontation what's Hezbollah trying to achieve with continuous attacks on Israel well it's trying to show solidarity with Hamas in Gaza but at the same time it tries uh not to escalate the situation uh and that's mainly due to the fact that hisbah is not an independent actor it depends heavily uh on Iran it's in fact an Iranian proxy force and Iran andah don't want a big war right now simply because Iran doesn't believe that it's ready for a war with Israel I personally believe believe that this calculation might change someday uh when Iran is nuclear U has acquired a nuclear C capability but for the time being these two actors don't want a big war simply because they believe that they can't win it eyes around the world have been watching weily for months now is there any reason to believe Israel will in fact invade Lebanon oh yes yes uh there there has been a debate even before the Gaza War even because before the events of the seventh of October 2023 um and those who argue for a war with hisbah argue uh that Israel can't accept uh the very fact that there is a very strong terrorist organization on its northern border threatening uh the Israeli North uh and this argument has gained um has gained power after the 8th of October when hisbah started attacking um attacking villages and attacking cities in the north with the result that between 60 and 990,000 Israelis had to evacuate this uh this area and many argue that this is not a sustainable situation if there is no diplomatic solution if there is no hisbah withdrawal from the Israeli border many Israeli pundits believe that such a war is in inevitable as you surely know Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the US and on his agenda among other things is gathering support for fighting Hezbollah and other Iran back groups in the region is that something the US supports no uh the the current Biden Administration has tried to restrain Israel and it has tried to Res restrain Israel since October uh 20 2023 simply because the Biden Administration fears that an escalation between hisbah and Israel might lead to an escalation uh between Iran uh and is Isel and a war a wider War uh in the region uh it might be that Benyamin Netanyahu is now uh discussing will now discuss these uh these issue with the Biden Administration but I don't believe that uh that the letter will change its view uh in order to avoid this War uh the Biden Administration has tried to deter hisbah it has tried to convince hisbah uh to seize its attacks to no avail and at the same time it has sent an a diplomatic Envoy uh to discuss this problem and discuss a withdrawal of hisbah in southern Lebanon um indirectly uh in beay our thanks to GTO Steinberg the Middle East expert at the German Institute for international and security Affairs in Berlin thank you sir thank you
