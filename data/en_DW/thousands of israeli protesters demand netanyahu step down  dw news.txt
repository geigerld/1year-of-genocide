thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets in Tel Aviv and other cities to protest prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's government many demonstrators have criticized his handling of the war in Gaza and some have called for Netanyahu to step down they rejoined by the families of hostages still being held by Hamas at demanding that Netanyahu bring them home the protest later descended into clashes with police Israel believes 130 hostages remain in Gaza in cluding more than 30 people who are presumed dead let's get across to Rebecca Ritter in Jerusalem for more Rebecca thousands of Israelis turned out to take part here can you tell us how these protests compare to previous demonstrations that we've seen in Tel Aviv yeah CL uh there's no official figure of how many were in attendance last night but some media reports saying tens of thousands and protest organ organizers saying some 50,000 people were out on the streets in Tel Aviv these are certainly starting to resemble some of the bigger anti-government demonstrations we were seeing in the leadup last year in the leadup to the war that was against of course plans to overhaul the Judiciary they then stopped when the war broke out and uh we we've been seeing much smaller anti-government protests continue though the attention turning to the government's handling of the hostage situation as you were mentioning there but what we were seeing uh what we see certainly last night and and really in the last couple of weeks is a change in flavor or fervor of these protests if you will we're starting to see them become more angry and more aggressive uh you mentioned there that there were scuffles that broke out people uh were on the highway trying to block the major highway in and out of Tel Aviv there were bonfires lit and police used water cannon and sound Cannon to try to break up those protesters uh now what we're also seeing as well as a change in fervor is the merging of two separate protests and one of course being that anti-government protest I speak of but there have been weekly rallies a vid that started out as kind of a vigil if you will for the hostages uh in support of them we've been seeing that happen uh since the beginning really since the first week uh that they were taken and that is now moving into to join this anti-government protest so it's growing in size we saw some of the hostage families last night saying this rally is not going to continue this vigil we're going to take to the streets and we saw one spokesperson for the familes Tweet these rallies are over the protests have begun so we can potentially uh expect to see these grow and and change in form we are expecting protests here in Jerusalem starting the evening continuing for some days outside the knesset and they promise to be even bigger than the ones we've been seeing in Tel Aviv and Rebecca we have an Egyptian media report suggesting that talks aimed at brokering a truce between Israel and Hamas are set to resumed today in Cairo can you tell us what we can expect from the Israeli side there yeah we saw those reports yesterday that's been confirmed now by the prime minister's office that a delegation is being sent that delegation tasked with trying to move these talks forward the government obviously under increased pressure as we were just talking about now 177 days after the hostages uh were taken they're becoming under increased pressure to to get some kind of a deal we've been seeing these talks ongoing uh for months now uh since the last breakthrough where we saw more than a 100 hostages released in November but we've had no success in the talk so far they call them rounds but it's really been one continuing discussion and you know it's beginning again uh in uh in Egypt today uh Egypt playing a major role in those discussions as well as qat the US uh and of course teams uh from both from both sides but you know both sides still having just far too a a gap in between not being able to to reach an agreement Hamas demanding for a permanent ceasefire full withdrawal of Israeli troops and for people to be allowed to go back from the south into Northern Gaza that's something that Israel are unwilling or unable to agree to they say that that is T tantamount to defeat and they will not be able to meet their military aims of defeating Hamas they say that more military pressure is needed on Hamas in order for them to be able to get the hostages back so you're seeing two sides really unable to come to an agreement I think it's unlikely that we'll see anything firm come out of these talks of course there's always hope but as I say these two sides are still very very far apart Rebecca thank you that is DW's correspondent Rebecca riters in Jerusalem for us the United Nations Secretary General Antonio gutes has condemned an explosion in Lebanon on Saturday saying that the UN peacekeeping mission security must be guaranteed at all times the UN says it's investigating a blast from a shell that struck near the town of Rish close to the border with Israel three unifil observers and a translator were injured Israel and the Lebanese militant group hasah have been exchanging fire across the border nearly every day since October our bureau chief in Beirut Muhammad sha told us more about the rising tensions between Israel and Lebanon hasah have been firing heavy Rockets into new Israeli uh territory and and positions and in return Israel have been uh targeting uh and widening its its targets inside Lebanon uh reaching uh the bah Valley and balek which is relatively far from the uh Northern from its northern border and this is a clear extension of the usual rule of uh engagement between both uh uh parties now there's a growing fear among uh Lebanese from a large scale War most of people we talk to are very concerned about a war that the country is far from ready uh for uh on the financial logistical and and also uh the mental aspect the country is going through the worst economic and financial crisis in lebanon's modern history and barely functioning uh uh like the the UN the the um government organizations is uh barely able to uh uh support the uh uh citizens in
