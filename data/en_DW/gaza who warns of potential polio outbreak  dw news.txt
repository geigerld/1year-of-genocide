the World Health Organization says it is extremely worried about a potential polio outbreak in Gaza it warned that traces of the irus have been detected in the territory's Wastewater and that the dire situ sanitation situation could allow it to spread quickly polio attacks the central nervous system causing paralysis and death in extreme cases the wh says a mass vaccination campaign may be needed Let's cross over now to Joe English who is with the United Nations Children's agency UNICEF so help us understand this what exactly would a serious polio outbreak mean for the children in Gaza with you this is something that we've been warning about for many many months the threat of of communicable and waterborne diseases and sad to say that we continue to see our worst fears come true now thankfully this is just traces at the moment we have not seen any paralytic cases in children but that does not mean that that cannot happen and so we are scrambling with our colleagues at Who and the health authorities to do everything that we can to prevent children because I mean your viewers can see the pictures you know this is Rife conditions for waterborne diseases and so we need to be able to get in and vaccinate children on a mass scale but the only way that we're going to be able to do that is with an end to the fighting it will be near impossible to do whilst the bombs continue to fall fighting continues you know these are just no conditions for children to live in Period so what has been done currently to help limit the spread of the virus in Gazo so we've already begun a risk analysis and we're also working with the local communities to make sure that they are aware of the risk and know how to prevent it but the reality is is that we can give people that advice but when you have 600 people in some cases in Gaza sharing a single toilet you know there is a very different very there's a huge difference between between knowing the risks understanding the risks and still being able to prepare yourself and prevent the spread and so ultimately as I say we need to be able to get in we need to be able to provide children families with safe drinking water with adequate sanitation you know it's a sad reality that portable toilets are one of the supplies that we've had issues getting into the Gaza Strip you know and so we've said this again and again but it Bears repeating the only way that we will be able to get in with the scale of humanitarian support that is needed to prevent these kind of outbreaks and to address the huge needs of the population is a ceas fire is a release of the hostages and it's an end to these absolute Horrors now help us understand this as well how big of a setback is this for the worldwide campaign to eradicate polio is this something that we expect to stay in Gaza or could this spread further yeah polio does not respect borders you know I think that is incredibly important to say say the sad reality is is that a couple of years ago Gaza had 99% coverage for polio vaccinations so this wouldn't have been an issue and and it has to be said that it is not just those unsanitary conditions and the the terrible conditions that many people are living in but it's also the fact that the vaccination polio vaccination in children has fallen from 99% in 2022 to 89% in 2023 so that means there are potentially thousands of young children who are vulnerable and that's not just going to be in Gaza that is also going to be in Israel that is also going to be in the West Bank and that is also going to potentially affect the wider region so the quicker that we can get in and protect children by ensuring that they're getting their vaccines and not just vaccines against against polio but against all of these childhood diseases the better we can prepare the entire region all of these vulnerable children against these kind of outbreaks it's really a tragic situation that was Joe English from UNICEF thank you very much for joining us thanks so much
