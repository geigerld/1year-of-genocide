yet another effort to bring calm to the Middle East US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has arrived in the hope of securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas this is his fifth trip to the region since the Hamas Terror attacks of October 7th Lincoln is in Saudi Arabia and is also stopping in Egypt Qatar and Israel the proposed deal would allow the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners Lincoln also wants to prevent further Regional escalation of the conflict the US has retaliated against attacks on its forces with air strikes on houthi rebels in Yemen and other militias backed by Iran tww correspondent Ben fulan is in Jerusalem he told us earlier what's at stake for blinkin with this visit quite a lot at stake all right Sarah you can say that uh first of all there's the worry about Regional spread I mean already this is escalating and uh we're receiving reports uh thre of reprisal attacks in Syria on a us-backed Kurdish group uh with some deaths reported there in a deadly drone attack that's in response uh to the attacks that the US and the UK have launched um there have been us deaths the first US US deaths in this conflict as you know uh which sparked this response in the US saying this is just going to be the beginning uh Saudi Arabia there's a lot of St uh for that Nation it wants to normalize relations with Israel and that would be in return for some sort of security PCT from the US and then of course you've got the security and safety of some 1 million Palestinian civilians all crammed into Rafa right now uh the problem being with them being crammed into that region uh is that Israel is threatening to move in there it's already launched strikes uh with scores dying overnight on the outskirt of Rafa uh whether or not this military operation pushes further into Rafa is the big question so much at stake not just for those civilians but also the more than 100 hostages uh from Israel that are being held hostage in Gaza right now that was Ben fulan there reporting from Israel I want to bring in now Dalia dasak she is a senior fellow at the UCLA burkel Center for international relations she is currently a full bright visiting scholar in Sweden at Lund University she joins us now from Sweden it's good to have you with us Dalia you know so far we've heard from Hamas that it will not agree to any deal unless that it gets a guarantee that Israel will pull out of Gaza and stop the fighting Israel has rejected that so are these negotiations working on non-starters well I think there's still attempts to get a breakthrough I'm sure this is the highest priority for secretary blinkin on this current trip uh there is a real need to put a halt to this fighting um at least for a shorter term the US still continues to oppose a a permanent ceasefire but there needs to be a stop and the hostages must get out so it isn't looking good at the moment but a lot of sure is happening behind the scenes uh and hopefully there will be a breakthrough yeah it's not looking good let's talk a moment about Optics here we we've got Anthony blinc coming to the Middle East at the same time on the very same day you've got the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Ned Yahoo saying or talking about total victory over Hamas are these two men um talking past each other well uh prime minister NATO's comments are certainly unhelpful uh it is uh going to be impossible to get a deal um if if he continues to take this kind of stance of course he's taking a lot of these stances for domestic audiences it's very clear that he has uh you know a lot of pressure from his right flank not to give in not to have any pause in this war the Israeli population is mixed uh more than half of the population really focused on getting the hostages out as a priority um but a but a large part of the population still very supportive of continuing this campaign until Hamas is significantly degraded and cannot threaten Israel again so it's a real Bond um but there is an urgency given the humanitarian catastrophe it's highest on the US agenda highest on the regional agenda that is very much backing a ceasefire as soon as possible do you do you think that Anthony blinkin may be do trying to do the business of a lame duck president and and I asked that because you know we were hearing that we could see that all of these parties in the Middle East just buy their time until the US election in November waiting to see if there's going to be a change in the white house um so that really makes Biden's work even that much greater doesn't it well there's always that a political context but I have to say this is really a strategic issue and um the region cannot wait until the US election there is really as your reporting just demonstrated dire conditions on the ground in Gaza uh Israeli hostages uh by last count I think 136 we don't know how many are still alive uh still uh in prison in Gaza uh the urgency is of highest order so I I think it's important and you know I'm sure there are preferences in the region uh but this is really a strategic question not a domestic one and secretary blinkin this is his fifth trip to the Middle East since the terror attacks back in October it seems each time that he has come over to the Middle East the stakes have gotten even bigger excuse me and that's where we are right now I'm thinking about these you know these tit fortat attacks that have been going on between Iran's proxies and the United States how much leverage does the United States have right now considering it wants to prevent an escalation of the violence it's extremely worrying situation uh and is the other uh very high agenda item I'm sure on secretary blinken's visit to contain this conflict and the record so far has been mixed unfortunately uh despite this us response to attacks over 160 attacks on its forces in sah Iraq uh and now intervening against the houthis in the Yemen uh theater uh these attacks are continuing we just had another attack last night on us-backed Kurdish forces in Syria that were fighting against Isis uh it's extremely worrying and hard to know if this is sustainable and everybody talks about calibrated controlled strikes and the US certainly is not looking for a war with Iran which is why these retaliations happened uh in this Syrian and and it's going to likely be contained in the Syrian Iraqi theater not in Iran itself it doesn't look like Iran is looking for a full-scale war but it's very hard to keep this situation controlled when uh proxies and militia forces are so unpredictable and already the US is much more involved than it had intended to be so it's it's worrying D DK with the UCLA burkel Center for international relations joining us tonight from Sweden we appreciate your time and your analysis thank you thank
