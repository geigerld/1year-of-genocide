well the Hamas run health authority assess fresh Israeli air strikes have killed dozens of people in central Gaza officials also say strikes of the weekend killed nearly a 100 Palestinians Sheltering in a makeshift camp near Han yunas Israel says the latest T the latest attacks targeted the leadership of Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attacks our next more than 9 months into the war there's no letup in Israel's bombing campaign in G this is the aftermath of a strike in newat which hosts one of the territory's most crowded refugee camps me and my other sister were saying our mareet prayers when suddenly bombs fell on us there was nothing happening they told me your brother's children died in hospital oh Abdullah my brother the Israeli military said that over the previous 24 hours its Air Force struck quote approximately 40 Terror Targets in Gaza including sniping posts Hamas military structures and buildings rigged with explosives but locals say the victims here were civilians a whole family died the mother the father and the two children and also Mahmud who worked in the Civil ad Administration it's not the first strike in newat on Sunday Israeli war planes hit a un run school there that was used to shelter displace Palestinians it was the fifth out of six schools to be bombed in N9 days other camps for displaced people have also come under Israeli fire at the weekend the Palestinian health Ministry said more than 90 people were killed and hundreds more injured in gaza's declared safe Zone al- maazi as Israel tried to eliminate two top Hamas commanders it was one of the deadliest strikes since the beginning of the war in the US the state department had this to say about it they do have the right to Target militants um does that justify attacking on civilian no that's what I'm just saying we we do um uh but no of course it does not justify any attacks on civilians we don't want to see any attacks on civilians we don't want to see any civilian deaths so but civilian deaths there were doctors at the nearby NASA Hospital said they were overwhelmed with bodies and injured people after the strike on al- maazi an account backed by the UN Agency for Palestine refugees we saw toddlers who were double amputees uh children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment one mother I talked to told me that um she was told to move to Rafa because it would be safe there and then she was told to move to masasi because it would be safe there and unfortunately for her and her family that was not true Israel maintains that terrorists are hiding in civilian structures and areas and that it takes steps to minimize civilian casualties recent scenes from Gaza smogs and hospitals suggest otherwise well the Israeli military declined DW's request for an interview now Robert Goldman is a professor of law at American University in Washington D.C he's also faculty director of the war crimes research office and co-director of wcl's Center for human rights and humanitarian law welcome to DW Professor Israel says those deadly attacks on safe zones and schools are legitimate because they were targeting Hamas militants what do you say well it will depend on the particular circumstances obviously you cannot directly attack civilians the law of War however contemplates that civilians may become wounded or even killed uh as a consequence of an attack against a lawful military Target uh we have over 38,000 deaths reported by the Ministry of Health of Hamas uh that's a somewhat misle leading figure in the sense that it includes Hamas Fighters as well as civilians who have directly participated in hostilities so even if you subtract 20% it still is a very very high civilian toll that said this is an extraordinarily difficult military environment it is a densely populated area uh and the way Hamas has been fighting uh in this and this in past conflicts uh it is well established that they are using civilian structures they have used hospitals they have used tunnels 400 miles of tunnels uh below structures and so forth uh in order to hide combatants uh uh to build uh weapons and uh to use it for moving their combatants around around uh so it's an extraordinarily difficult environment one has to look at each and every one of the attacks and assess look we have this thing called the rule of proportionality and this is comes into play whenever you're going to launch an attack against a lawful Target that's located in the midst of a civilian populations and this rule seeks to protect civilians from becoming excessive collateral damage understood listen yeah go ahead just just because of the complexities that you have outlined there how and when do you think the two parties uh in this conflict can or will be brought to account well as you well know several months ago that the prosecutor for the international criminal court uh issued uh uh requests for arrest warrant for Netanyahu top a top Israeli General as well as the top Hamas leadership uh in connection with war crimes crimes against humanity uh that have been committed uh by uh those parties we have to wait to see whether or not the trial court uh judges will sustain those those warrants and of course the international court of justice has also issued provisional measures requiring Israel to give un needed access to humanitarian relief uh it remains to be seen nothing Hamas is not going to surrender its leadership and the Israelis certainly are not going to do this just as the IC as you know issued a year ago uh a similar kind of Warrant uh for Putin in connection with uh war crimes committed uh in in Ukraine uh that's not going to happen happen soon this is this is very clear if it ever really does happen right the issue is trying to mitigate civilian damage and harm in the ongoing hostilities i' like your your your thoughts on um what the UN has been saying that they're saying that Israeli strikes are systematically violating rules of War Israel's mission in Geneva of course has rejected the un's findings as factually legally and methodologically flawed so in a situation where even the experts can't enter the territory who can investigate this well you do have the IC uh who have a prosecutorial team you have other non-governmental organizations and so forth who are expert uh on International humanitarian law uh that are investigating you would not have a request for arrest warrants uh if the ICC prosecut torial team was not reasonably confident uh that they had a evidentiary basis to prosecute a case what is very difficult is trying to prove that for instance the Israelis uh launched an indiscriminate attack that is an attack against a lawful Target in the knowledge that it would cause disproportionate collateral damage this is extraordinarily hard to do it is is much easier to prove for instance uh offenses like what Hamas did which triggered the war on October 7th that is going in and massacring unarmed civilians that is uh undertaking acts against people who are under your Authority and control that is different from an aerial bombardment or going into urban Warfare situations where it will require knowledge of what was the information available to uh Israel the commanders at the time of the attack what precautions did they take what weapon did they choose to to use at their disposal that could have mitigated right uh uh civian casualties thank you for walking us through that Professor Robert Goldman of the American University of Washington College of Law Delight to be with you
