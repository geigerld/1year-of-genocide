Israel's Army Chief Hai halevi has warned that the war with Hamas will last for quote many more months in a televised address tevi said Israel is fighting in a complex environment with no magical Solutions or shortcuts the remarks come as the Israeli military intensifies operations in the Gaza Strip where the death toll is approaching 21,000 unidentified human corpses wrapped up lined up and laid to rest in a mass grave it's become a common site in Gaza the Hamas run Health Ministry claims that Israeli forces returned the bodies after first taking them from morgs and Graves to check there were no hostages among them Israel says it is now fighting on multiple fronts not just inside Gaza this footage reportedly shows the Downing of a quote hostile drone by an Israeli fighter jet over the red sea Iranian backed houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the drones which attacked the Israeli Port City of aot as well as cargo vessels in the areas the Yi houthi Armed Forces confirmed the continuation of their operations in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea against Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine as International pressure mounts on Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined three prerequisites for pce in an article for the Wall Street Journal the destruction of Hamas the demilitarization of Gaza and the deradicalization of Palestinian [Music] Society his words are the closest yet to a tangible vision for an end to the war but with increased attacks from Hezbollah from the North and the houthis from the south the conflict appears to keep on escalating our correspondent Yan Philip Schultz is standing by for us in Jerusalem y Philip Israel says it's fighting a multi-front war against multiple adversaries how worried are Israelis that this war could still escalate into a larger regional conflict people here are worried uh Israel's defense minister stressed that Israel is already fighting a multif front war and he mentioned seven sectors throughout the region as you know fears regarding a regional escalation have been there since the beginning of the war but a few incidences in in the past days have even increased this fear once again at the so-called blue line between Israel and Lebanon there have almost been daily battles between Israeli the Israeli Army and the powerful Iran backed hisbah militia also other iran-backed militia such as the houthis in Yemen have intensified their attacks especially in the Red Sea uh region and a senior Iranian official was killed close to Damascus and Iran has all already said that it will take revenge so a lot of incidences and people take them very seriously and they are worried Israel's military Chief has suggested that the war could last for many months Yan philli what are the implications of that well the future of Gaza is completely uncertain from a human humanitarian perspective the continued fighting will obviously mean even more human suffering we are already talking about a quarter of the population Starving in Gaza according to new UN figures and from a political perspective there's also no plan inside prime minister Netanyahu said that Israel should have what he calls the overall security responsibility of Gaza for the foreseeable future and she also spoke about uh the demilitarization and complete deradicalization of the Palestinian Society but many observers have already replied uh that this is not a very realistic not a very workable plan and that they are concerned that the continued fighting will make a political solution just more complicated yeah Philip thank you very much that was our correspondent Yan Philip Schultz in Jerusalem the United Nations has repeatedly warned of an increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the war torn Gaza Strip now the UN has appointed a humanitarian coordinator to boost Aid to the territory following a security Council resolution sigid KAG a former Dutch Deputy Premier and mid East expert will begin her role as senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza in January anuary her task will be to coordinate Monitor and verify humanitarian relief deliveries since Israel began its Siege of Gaza its over 2 million residents have faced severe shortages of water food Fuel and Medicine enter the for more on this we can talk now to Sama Hadid she is head of advocacy Communications and media at the Norwegian Refugee Council and joins us from Sydney uh thanks for being with us s what can we expect from the un's new relief coordinator for Gaza how much can she do to improve the humanitarian situation there the establishment of this coordinator role is welcomed um but I think that her uh Powers around this will be limited she has to have the support of course of Israel uh and she will face uh difficulties and and problem s and challenges uh in doing this role uh but this is why we're urging all uh parties to the conflict and states to support her uh to urgently scale up aid aid needs to increase uh to support the desperate population in Gaza and I think the priorities would include increasing fuel to support hospitals bakeries water pumps uh but also uh allowing commercial Goods to enter Gaza to restore the markets to support the starving population but the only real meaningful way to scale up Aid is to have a ceasefire in place because Aid workers cannot operate under the current conditions they cannot do their jobs effectively and safely whilst being bombed and shelled on an ongoing basis and so that's why we support the UN secretary General's call for the need uh for an urgent ceasefire which is crucial to scaling up a right now you mentioned hunger in in the Gaza Strip well according to the UN a quarter of the population in Gaza is starving how much Aid is being delivered to the territory at the moment the aid that's being delivered at the moment is still minimal it's not enough it's nowhere near enough to meet the dire needs we're seeing across Gaza and now with the reports indicating that there is a high risk of famine in Gaza uh we urgently need Aid to be scaled up but I think that it also points to uh the way in which Israel is using starvation as a weapon of the war of of this War uh which is prohibited under international law and we have yet to see any real condemnation from government allies of Israel on the way uh that it's using starvation um and it this is leading to a catastrophic situation uh on the ground where civilians are not only being bombed to death but are now being starved as well and so this needs to end and needs to be condemned talk to us about displacement you work for a refugee Council nearly 2 million people have been displaced within Gaza already during this conflict what what will happen with gaza's population if this war drags on for months what we fear is that uh with now Israel's further expansion of its ground operation in southern Gaza that more and more people will be uh driven out of Gaza pushed towards the Border uh of Egypt um and will be pushed to move across borders uh to seek uh safety uh from the atrocities taking place in Gaza Israel's continued bombardment and its Siege uh it's wide widespread destruction of Gaza has made Gaza unlivable and this is forcing uh people to to move towards tiny Pockets uh in the South where safety is also not guaranteed what's also worrying is that most recently the Israeli Prime Minister has made comments suggesting that he would facilitate uh the migration and transfer of Palestinians from Gaza and this raises the risks of uh forcible displacement and forcible transfer of the population from Gaza which would be a serious breach of international law and an atrocity crime uh any attempts by Israel to deport or permanently displace Palestinians from Gaza must be prevented and condemned s thank you very much for talking with us that was s Hadid head of advocacy Communications and media at the Norwegian Refugee
