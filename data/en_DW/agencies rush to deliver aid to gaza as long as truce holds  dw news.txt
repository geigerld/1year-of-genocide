now as the truth holds un agencies are scaling up Aid deliveries to Gaza some 450 tracks carrying supplies such as fuel water and Medicine have entered the besieged territory in the last couple of days they are the largest humanitarian convoys since the start of the conflict and include the delivery of ambulances to help with evacuations from alifa hospital in Northern Gaza many whove been displaced by Israel's military operation are using the rest fite in fighting to search their bombed out homes for belongings and the bodies of loved ones free from the threat of air strikes Abdul aiz alar has returned to the site where his home once stood in southern Gaza he searches through the rubble looking for anything which could keep his family warm in the weeks and months ahead we want to take advantage of the truce we've spent the past 43 days in shelters where there were no services and we were exposed to rain and cold it was extremely cold our house is destroyed but we want to find some of our stuff to be able to keep ourselves and our kids warm with the truce now in effect Aid agencies are scaling up the delivery of assistance the UN says some 200 trucks the biggest humanitarian Convoy in more than a month crossed into Gaza from the Rafa border crossing with Egypt on Friday it included almost 130,000 L of fuel many Gins lined up for hours near the border crossing waiting to fill their empty canisters with the skies above the besieged territory free from Israeli warplanes for the first time in 7 weeks others are traveling north to check on their homes the relatives they left behind and in some cases to bury the dead we hope the agreement between Israel and Hamas now in force will bring respite to the people of Gaza and Israel and some relief to the hostages and detainees who will be released and to their families we hope it allows grieving families to honor their dead and bury them with dignity and we hope that this humanitarian pause leads to a longer term humanitarian ceasefire for the benefit of the people of Gaza Israel and Beyond but Israeli war planes have already dropped leaflets warning gazin not to leave the South saying that the war is not over and that it's very dangerous to return to the north the focus of its military campaign there is a possibility the pause could be extended if the two sides agree to another exchange for now Israeli soldiers remain St along the border with Gaza waiting to receive orders James Elder is a spokesman for Unicef the United Nation's International children's emergency fund he's in southern Gaza and told us about the situation for children there yeah hi look it's Gastly it is exactly that it is a graveyard I I said that based on all the reports and everything we'd heard from colleagues on the ground a couple of weeks ago and now that I'm here I can't actually believe it's worse than I imagined and as you hear from those words I imagined the worst I've been at a hospital today again the wounds of War I see in children are things I haven't really seen at least not not the sheer number of children a bus load coming down from the north children who hadn't seen medical care for three or four days the just smell of Rotting Flesh on that children with horrendous burn marks with with with wounds of War mortar wounds this is consistent this is in a hospital of course tens of thousands of people spread across this area outside looking for water looking for food and this is as you rightly said in your report this is the respite this is meant to be a good day because we are getting Aid in there aren't bombs Landing but still for people who've endur this for seven weeks it remains hellish and you can see you can see the fear you can see the trauma written all over their faces journalist ham baloa was in Gaza until recently he joins us now from the Jordanian cap Capital am man hello ham we've seen images of Aid tracks entering Gaza including fuel tracks what more can you tell us yes um in um the third day in a row that uh eight trucks are coming into Gaza um uh 200 trucks expected to enter today as the previous days we um Gaza received um a bit less than um 100 200 trucks in the first day and the second day uh yesterday but today is like expected more trucks to come in including um Fuel and and cooking gas it's in a bad need in in Gaza Hamas IIA complained that Israel was not allowing Aid to reach Northern Gaza has the situation changed well it's not clear yet I mean yesterday Hamas said that the delivery to the to the North was U wasn't as agreed upon in in the ceasefire agreement um according to the ricent in in Gaza they said um some trucks were delivered to the north areas seems like some areas are blocked so they couldn't reach um today they are expecting and it will be more clear um where the trucks will go and what items will be uh delivered so there's continuous talk about possibly increasing the 4-day truce or extending the 4-day truce between Hamas and Israel what will that mean to the lives of people in Gaza this is badly needed everybody I talk to um on social media everywhere gazans are looking for extension or even like for a complete cease fire they they they experience long time of of of suffer U many of them they lost their houses or uh L of the family members or their children so they want to bury them they want to go back for their businesses uh it's very important for the Lea of Gaza that the war to be over or at least to be extended in case that um um there is extension that means will um they will get more Aid and more more fuel um the problem is that with the items that coming through ra is limited it's not all items that used to come to Gaza mainly water um some food and and medical supplies right journalist hm Bala in am man thank
