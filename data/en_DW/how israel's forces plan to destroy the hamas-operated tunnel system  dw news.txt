if Israel launches a grand offensive into Gaza its forces will have to deal with a sophisticated network of tunnels under the territory uh these are used by Hamas and other islamist groups uh perhaps hundreds of kilometers long the network is known as the Gaza Metro one of many Israeli air strikes on Gaza this one targeting gaza's tunnel Network according to the Israel Defense Forces or IDF destroying the tunnels used by the militant isra group Hamas has long been a priority for Israel's military the network runs underneath Gaza connecting its cities running to the border with Israel and also connecting the strip with Egypt the tunnels let militants store weapons launch attacks and are believed to contain Hamas command centers gaza's tunnels are also lifelines to the outside world passageways for importing essential Goods as well as Weapons Under a long-standing Israeli blockade this animated video released by Israel shows what they supposedly look like inside militant islamist Hamas has been developing the tunnel Network since they came to power in 2007 recently Hamas claimed the tunnel network is 500 km long Hamas and other jihadist groups use tunnel exits basically holes in the ground to launch rocket attacks on Israel the launchers are then brought back underground that makes them nearly impossible for Israel to see or Target Israel has tried bombarding the tunnels in 2014 in 2017 and 2021 to destroy the network without success but with significant civilian casualties the tunnel network is reportedly woven underneath marketplaces apartment blocks and hospitals let's pick this up with Kobe Michael who's a senior researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security studies he joins us from Tel Aviv welcome to DW um so how has Israel figured these tunnels into their planned for the presumed coming ground offensive good evening um the only option to eliminate to destroy to demolish uh this huge infrastructure is by uh uh Ground Force operation ground ground force entrance to the to the Gaza strep uh it cannot be totally eliminated from the air and um and this is exactly the next stage of uh of this war and uh it will take a while I mean it's not a piece of cake it's not a Six Day War it's going to last weeks even months but uh the first stage that I assume that will last something like two weeks will deal with the most significant centers of gravity of these uh of these tunnels of this infrastructure and later on uh we will have to continue to clean the entire Gaza street from the north till the border with Egypt in order to finalize the issue and to accomplish the mission right okay so we have a situation where we're essentially talking about Urban Warfare uh going house to house uh Street to Street uh Complicated by the existence of these tunnels from which um Hamas uh militants can just pop up and uh launch any number of surprises uh at uh Israeli forces this has been described by many uh people um looking at this situation as just a a trap waiting for Israel to walk into yes uh Hamas is waiting for us um they took into consideration that after such a a barbaric attack there will be a ground force um inance and U they prepared in advance stps uh I believe that they believe that they know what is the at least in generalities what is going to be the Israeli mod operandi and our job is to surprise them and to do something that they do not expect us to do right and this is the reason that um we have to accumulate very accurate intelligence we have to exhaust them we have to remember that they are uh 14 days under the ground it's not so easy to be such a long period of time under the ground they are exhausted and they will be more exhausted and we will come we will come with uh our surprises and uh I believe that at the end of the day uh all of this infrastructure will be demolished right so and and and a further complicating uh factor is that we we are presuming that the hostages are being kept underground in these in these tunnels uh near hamama Mass control centers uh waiting for uh Israeli troops uh to perhaps kill them in their efforts uh to destroy uh the herass infrastructure yes you are right and this is something that um dramatically complicates all the operation this is by the way I think one of the reasons that we are not there yet because I believe that the the Israeli strategist in the IDF think about very creative ways to rescue hostages but there will be there is no doubt I mean not all of not all of the hostages will be or will come out in alive and we have to understand with whom we are dealing we are dealing with barbarians murderers ER and uh at the end of the day they should then they must be eliminated all of them from the first to the last and um and the very same time Israel has to do all the efforts together with the International Community in order to pressure Hamas and Hamas must understand that the civilian offers are liable and not asset and if um the the very wrong principle of selection will be realized here it will be terrible because the idea that Israeli citizens that hold another citizenship will be uh distinguished from the other Israeli citizens it's something that cannot be tolerated I don't want to take you to the Holocaust okay it's enough that to go back to an 1976 but it it this is something that cannot be done this is something that will weaken us Hamas thank you for joining us and outlining that for us Kobe Michael with the institute for National Security studies good night good
