the 4-day truce between Israel and Hamas has been extended for another two days that's according to the Qatari foreign Ministry qatar's one of several countries mediating between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of hostages taken in the Hamas Terror attacks of the SE 7th of October several groups of hostages have been exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in recent days the release of hostages by Hamas on Sunday means that 39 Israeli women and children have now been freed under the truce deal Hamas agreed to hand over 50 hostages in total during the 4-day truce under separate agreements Hamas has freed another 19 uh during the truce most of them Thai citizens who were working in Israel and abducted during the Hamas attack Israel says more than 240 people were seized by Palestinian militants on October the 7th at least 180 are still being held in Gaza those already released have been reuniting with friends friends and families the truce between Israel and Hamas has given Garen some respite from the fighting and bombardment we're here now from one extended family that made its way to a Garen beach for a visit that was all too brief a chance to breathe without the smoke and stench of War there is space at this beach for the AL sulan Family so different from their space at a facility for displaced Gins for a brief moment in time children can play the fear of violence set aside but not for their parents reflecting on who and what has been lost since the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks on Israel that spurred massive Israeli retaliation we came to the beach to take a breather and to change the depressing and uted environment we in people come to the beach to relax to swim for their children to have fun take food with them but we're so depressed we're on the beach but we want to cry one family member though has finally gotten a chance to fish during the truce and hopes he can keep the clan fed for longer the uncertainty goes well beyond the end of the truce the Al Sultan family likes so many on this bit of gazen Beach don't know if they have homes to which they can return When the fighting truly ends let's pick this up with our Middle East analyst shaie ranis welcome back to the studio uh shaie so Phillis in what else do we know about this extension well it was the formula that was agreed upon uh and it is happening we know that the Americans have also confirmed that we have an official statement from the White House we know Biden was speaking to the qataris himself to the prime minister of Qatar in order to ensure this extension um so it's going to be another 48 Hours of ceasefire more trucks more Aid coming into Gaza Strip more uh Israeli hostages released 20 of them at all in total and in exchange Israel will release 60 prisoners um Palestinian prisoners kept in Israel prisons all right and um both parties as we've been uh hearing all day both parties seem to be open to this extension in one way or another so why has it taken so long well first and foremost there's a lot of Suspicion a lot of Hil a lot of lothing between the sides and nobody wants to be too obvious you know nobody want to seems too eager uh everybody's trying to toughen up their positions uh but also there's always you know on the Israeli side they feel like Hamas is trying to always play games and sort of manipulate them you know today there's been a bit of a mixup not more than a bit of a mixup with the names we've seen that the second day have almost brought to the collapse of the deal s with the names this is the the names of the hostages to be to be released today correct I mean uh Hamas keeps claiming it doesn't have access to all of those held in Gaza that some of them are held by other organizations in Gaza mostly the Islamic Jihad uh some of them are also held We Know by by families by by Clans that are you know strong Clans in Gaza so Hamas is um claiming it doesn't really have control over all of them uh it did manage to say now it says that it managed to get a hand over at least 20 more of those children and mothers this is also the category we're talking about there's many people held in Gaza there's a difference to who we're talking about soldiers men they're not part of those deals um because they're also not part of the prisoners exchange um it seems like now it's finally Hamas is willing to bring 20 more of those children and and their mothers um and so so Israel of course is interested in releasing as many hostages as possible um and again we always need to be very careful everything here is so fragile and everything can collapse at any moment uh but hopes are that this uh extension is going to be agreed upon very very soon and 20 more because 10 each day on this two-day extension so it's it's hostages plus um Aid coming in and are we looking at this the same three to one uh Palestinians for for Israelis correct and this is the framework that was you know worked on already when this deal started but not nobody wanted to give it too long you know again because we're talking about the hostility the dip hostility within the two sides you know everybody said okay let's take it one day at a time let's see where it takes us even after this extension there will be still 23 more children and mothers left and and women left in Gaza so good chances we will try to see the the both Kamas and Israel going for another extension to bring those 23 out the problem will start what what once we start negotiating the is the side start negotiating the next category of hostages mainly the men uh the solders soldiers UMAS sees a soldier anybody who's ever served in the military forces even if they're 70 years old and they have not you know they're out of active duty for 50 years so that would be a different category that will require far more rigorous negotiations and um it's going to have to worked out some kind of different framework and will will that those talks already have started because you know you don't have to be a genius to see that this is a predictable process correct we know the Americans are pushing there uh we know all sides kind of want to talk about it Israel claims it's uh adant to go back into uh the offensive they want to work through the military options they have because they and they've been quite clear haven't they we we've heard from the the military spokesman when this is over we will exactly we will start the bombing campaign Isel Works under the premise that it's only the heavy pressure that they've put on Hamas in the bombardments in Gaza so far that have brought Hamas to agree to the deal so far and they want to make sure that they get better deals you know better better conditions to release the rest of the hostages and feel that the only way to get that is through ground maneuvering is through military operation in the southern part of the Gaza Strip right the uh what has the the public response been so far to this series of releases well these are days of you know Israel's uh National mood is so it's like it's like an a never- ending roller coaster you know with every delay everybody's you know everybody is so uh taking it so emotionally these hostages that campaign for their release have became nationally wide so popular people take it personally even those who are not in direct contact with the hostages there's in general a a a support for for extending the truth in order to bring more of them home but there's also a bit of a concern that the international pressure will be so big that Israel will be forced to stop fighting and this is a big fear in Israel okay thank you for that for now uh DW Middle East analyst shie resigns thank you so much for more we're joined Now by journalist Sami so in Jerusalem Sami the truce has been extended what happens next so the truce uh will enter now a phase of two days uh in which Hamas will be releasing uh along these two days 20 prisoners again we're talking about both women and children uh this time they will have to be get they will have to get them from various organizations families and so forth who are holding them at the same time Israel will be releasing prisoners that are held in Israeli prisons again belonging to the same category of both women and children and uh more trucks will be coming into the Gaza Strip especially to the north bringing Aid Sami this deal came through very last minute why has has it been so challenging to extend the agreement well with Hamas is saying that they had difficulties with finding some of these hostages because they're not held in in the hands of Hamas the groups that we've seen being released so far were held by Hamas in fact one of the leaders of Hamas in gansan met them and spoke to them in in Hebrew and the ones that are going to be released in the coming days many of them are being held by other factions uh there was also disagreements in terms of the the trucks coming up to the north of the Gaza Strip and the also in terms of the Palestinians being released uh but after all the both the karies and the Egyptians were pushing pushing hard to make this happen could this truce eventually lead to a permanent ceasefire yeah well if we judge the words [Music] of one of the Hamas leaders who was interviewed today on a jazer he said that his organization would like to extend this truth and that he would like to have other uh categories being released that means not only women and children but of course then we're talking about a a different kind of ratio is expected that Hamas will be demanding a higher number of Palestinian prisoners to be released we know that Qatar Egypt very much would like to extend this ceasefire uh at the same time Israel has said that it wants to go back to its military campaign and the question is how will it be able to continue with its campaign when 80% of gazans have already been displaced according to unra figures how will they be able to wage this campaign when they say they want to topple Hamas in these kinds of conditions that was samial in Jerusalem thanks Germany says it will provide millions of Euros to help rebuild the Israeli communities destroyed by the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks German president Frank vadin Maya made the announ during a visit to Israel's kib just a few kilometers from Gaza which was one of those targeted a difficult trip but a necessary one this is how German president steinmeier described his visit to Israel a trip which left him searching for words when he visited a kibuts destroyed by Hammer terrorists on October the 7th the ruins behind us they are the Silent Witness of what had happened here and uh it's not easy to find the words to describe what we heard from those who have the knowledge and who were and those who were witnessing the Deeds the murders the killings the rapes of the Hamas here on the 7th of October but Stein Meer the country's head of state also wanted to show Germany support with more than words he said the parliament in Berlin the bundestag would provide financial assistance worth €7 million EUR next year to help rebuild the kibuts some of the kibot residents showed their gratitude for Germany's solidarity and also a vote of confidence in our ability to rebuild our lives um giving us um something to dream of and to look forward to so we can have hope that we will have a a future and it will be a good future Stein meire as well as other German officials have shown their steadfast political support for Israel in the war at the same time schan Maya stressed a long-term solution must also include more future prospects for the Palestinians the German president is set to continue his Middle East tour with a short visit to a man and
