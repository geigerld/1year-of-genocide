Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the intense phase of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza is quote about to end speaking on Israeli TV Netanyahu said the Army is close to completing its current ground offensive in the southern city of Rafa but maintained that the fighting won't stop until the group behind the October 7th Terror attacks no longer controls Gaza he also warned more Israeli forces will move to the border with Lebanon where fighting with Hezbollah has escalated did Tanya Kramer has more for us from Jerusalem Tanya where does all this leave us in the war well prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave this interview you have to say a rare interview to a local uh TV uh Channel a right-wing Channel as it is known here where he was saying basically that the intense phase of the war is winding down and he also indicated that the Army is close to completing its offensive in rafar the southern city in uh Southern uh Gaza but without giving a timeline or without giving even more details but he also said the war is actually uh not over this would mean uh he said that fewer troops would be needed in Gaza and they would be redeployed uh to uh Northern Israel he also said in that interview uh that he was prepared only for a partial uh deal an agreement that would see a ceasefire a PA in fighting including then also the release of some of the hostages uh as he said but that the war will not be ending until uh Hamas is removed from power now these comments he made were very uh sharply criticized here especially by uh uh groups that are representing uh the hostage uh families saying that he would therefore abandon uh some of the hostages that remain uh in Gaza and uh prime minister the prime minister's office then issued a clarifying statement that they would not abandon the hostages that is actually Hamas who's not uh agreeing uh to the deal but it's very it seen as problematic as there's no incentive right now for Hamas to agree to such a deal that has been stalled that's a ceasefire hostage deal that's on the table because their main demand was always to get a clear timeline for When The War uh will end to enter such an agreement ant what about the situation at the border with Lebanon fighting between Israel and hasah has increased in recent weeks can you tell us where things stand there now well absolutely and there was always uh you know the the understanding in Israel that once the uh offensive in rafar in Gaza would be coming to an end then the attention of Israel would then uh turn uh nor to its northern border and as you have rightly said uh there has been a lot of crossb fying actually since October 8 hollah has joined uh the War so to speak but this has been intensifying in uh recent weeks we seen more attacks going deeper into Israel by Hezbollah but also attacks by Israel deeper into uh Lebanese territory against uh Hezbollah Israel wants to push Hezbollah back from its border uh tens of thousands of Israelis had to leave the area have left homes and uh you know cities and uh uh villages uh in this area there have been displaced there and this is something that Israel cannot accept so we heard Netanyahu saying that he would look for a diplomatic solution there are some efforts underway but if there's no diplomatic solution he would look uh for another way and of course there is the concern right now that if there would be an Israeli attack on Southern libanon this could actually go into a wider uh uh War um with Iran potentially joining and its militias across the region Tanya thank you as always that is DW's at Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem
