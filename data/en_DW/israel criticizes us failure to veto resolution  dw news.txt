the UN Security Council has passed a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the first time the Breakthrough comes after the United States abstained from the vote after vetoing previous efforts over the last five months the resolution also demanded the immediate release of all hostages still being held by Hamas the group that committed the October 7 Terror attacks against Israel the draft resolution has been adopted as resolution a milestone moment at the United Nations security Council 14 Nations voted in favor of the resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza for the first time the United States refrained from vetoing the agreement instead abstaining directly opposing a request from Israel not to do so this resolution tion rightly acknowledges that during the month of Ramadan we must recommit to peace Hamas can do that by accepting the deal on the table a ceasefire can begin immediately with the release of the first hostage and so we must put pressure on Hamas to do just that Israel's planned invasion of Rafa is causing major concerns for the US its biggest Ally an Israeli delegation was du to travel to Washington this week to discuss Alternatives but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called off the trip after the security council's decision and Israel's defense minister yuav Galant already in the US shows no signs of acknowledging the ceasefire call we have no moral right to stop the war in Gaza until we return all the hostages home if we do not reach a clear and decisive decision in G it may bring us closer to war in the North in Gaza the security Council vote brought some hope to many this marks a crucial step towards halting Israel's actions the US must leverage all of its resources as it's both the primary and ultimate advocate for Israel while the ceasefire vote brought hope in Gaza without Israel's support it may end up being a symbolic gesture rather than a practical solution for peace now Rosa fredman is Professor of law conflict and Global development at the University of reading in the UK her research focuses on the UN especially questions related to Human Rights and I asked her if she was surprised that today's ceasefire resolution passed I think most of us were surprised that the resolution was tabled in the first place the United States had tabled a resolution on Friday which did not pass and was vetoed by Russia and by China and very swiftly the 10 members of the security Council who don't hold a veto who are not permanent members who are elected for 2-year terms table this resolution one of the shortest resolutions in the security council's history which had three key messages and the surprise was not that it passed but that it was tabled so swiftly in the first place and why do you think the US didn't vote it down this time the three key messages are ones that have Global recognition there maybe a few states that don't agree with one or two of them but globally there is consensus that there needs to be a ceasefire not a permanent one but for a short period of time a CE far during the month the holy month of Ramadan there is global consensus that these hostages who have been held in captivity for nearly 170 days should be released including the babies and also the elderly and the sick and there is global consensus that the people in Gaza in this humanitarian catastrophe must receive Aid specifically food Aid to stop a famine so this this resolution had to pass because there wasn't a single country in the UN Security Council who could say that they didn't agree with those three key messages okay so now it has passed um I understand that this is legally binding but can Israel simply ignore this decision well it's legally binding and a lot of what the UN does is legally binding but the security Council has these added extra enforcement Powers so it can send um sanctions embargos no fly zones to implement its its resolutions the decisions that it makes any country can of course ignore what the UN says but it would ignore it at its Peril both its Peril in terms of having those implementing enforcement Powers against it but also the Diplomatic um the trade the all of the other bilateral in between states that will sort of that will occur so countries might turn around and boycott uh a country that that ignores the UN Security Council resolution we saw this in terms of Iraq we saw this in terms of Yugoslavia Rwanda um so if Israel does ignore this this resolution it will do so to its detriment the problem is that Israel's uh adversary in this is a terrorist group and the terrorist group will ignore anything that's tabled at the United Nations because it's not a sovereign state and because it doesn't care what the global Community says so long as it continues to be funded by Iran or by other countries that support its aims so what the United States said after the vote was really crucial it said that all countries at the security Council must use their power to put pressure on Hamas to actually abide by the terms of this resolution and specifically to hold to the ceasefire and specifically to release a hostages Dead or Alive of whatever age and of whatever ability okay so Israel has indicated that it will carry on regardless but it it it as you say it has cover in this in as much as as a state we can say yes you must do this but Israel can around and say well what about them what about Hamas are you going to punish them if you punish us well the ceasefire will hold for as long as both parties adhere to it so the minute that one party breaks it the other party will will point and say well they broke it they fired a rocket into Israel or They carried on incursions into Rafa and they will use that as an excuse more importantly perhaps is that the United States and others of Israel's allies hold the key to the Iron Dome the Iron Dome prevents Rockets from falling down and killing many if not most of Israelis and those Rockets aren't only coming from Gaza they're also coming from Lebanon from Hezbollah which is another terrorist organization which is funded by Iran if Israel doesn't abide to the terms of this resolution and if its allies then don't continue to fund the Iron Dome then this could be a very significant moment for the the continuation of the state of Israel thank you for walking us through that so clearly professor professor Rosa freedoman from the University of reading in the UK thank you well let's bring in Aaron David Miller who's a Middle East analyst and Senior fellow at the carnegi Endowment for International Peace he previously worked at the US state department for 24 years serving six secretaries of State as an adviser on the Middle East welcome to DW will this ceasefire resolution prevent Israel from from continuing its plans to go into Gaza look this resolution uh is certainly not shameful as the Israeli rep described it but it's also not very effective it's going to change nothing on the ground and the reality is today was not a in my judgment was not a good day either for the United States or Israel we had a un Security Council resolution that essentially cannot affect and Advance what the president really wants which is to fundamentally see a deescalation in Gaza a cessation in Israel's mil military activities freeing the hostages ins surging humanitarian assistance that's so desperately needed by 2.3 million Gaza who were essentially besieged this resolution will will accomplish none of that and Israel's response to this resolution which was to politic uh the Prime Minister has already begun his re-election campaign uh to criticize the United States and refuse to send a delegation to discuss whether there are alternatives to a ground campaign in Rafa that was also fundamentally counterproductive neither what the US did today or what Israel did today is going to alter one iota of the conflict that we're watching and has been ongoing for six months the only thing that will do that is an Israeli Hamas negotiation which produces a six- week pause which might might create the time and space to fundamentally change and alter the Dynamics in Gaza but today won't do it either what US the US did or what Israel did so it's so as from what from the analysis that you've just given us here you seem to be saying that that that the UN is really irrelevant to what's going on on the ground the UN can do a lot it has agencies and expertise with respect to humanitarian assistance and and in Middle East it's demonstrated a pension for for peacekeeping and another other conflict areas but in terms of a ceasefire you think it has cannot it cannot alter the behavior of the two major combatants to this conflict and the reason we have it's going on for six months is because no outside power is willing and or able to fundamentally change the battlefield dynamic between what Israel wants and what Hamas seeks to achieve that should be apparent to everyone right so do you think then so so given everything that that you said it it's and and you talked about uh uh um Benjamin Netanyahu essentially politicking now on on reelection everyone the the Israelis get stuck in their um as Silo the US doesn't change its position until and unless there the that um President Biden is removed those two Dynamics don't change this this sounds like unless something major happens perhaps militarily everybody stays where they are I think frankly the only party or parties plural that seemed to be in a hurry to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas certainly not Israel and it's certainly not Hamas the parties that are displaying the greatest sense of urgency and it's politically inconvenient to recognize are the parties that are external to these conflicts I've been around Middle East negotiations for a very long time they tend to have two speeds slow and slower and in order for them to succeed each side needs to have urgency and an achievable goal that will somehow fundamentally address their concerns I see no way right now uh to do any better than a six-week pause Hamas wants to survive they'll keep 50 hostages even if 45 are released the Israelis are determined to obliterate Hamas as a military organization and to kill its senior leadership I don't think either side has abandoned those goals and in view of that whether it's Germany or the UN or the us nobody is willing Andor able um to fundamentally alter the the uh calculations of the two combatants that's why this conflict's gone on for six months that that's clear help us understand um Washington's thinking what was it about this resolution that made them not use the veto which they have used three times against similar resolutions it's a very good question I think on one hand uh there is a certain exhaustion of having to uh somehow fundamentally try to alter or veto for un Security Council resolutions I think the United States wanted to send a signal it sent a signal there's no question about it that is very unhappy that it may even be angry at uh at the current government of Israel and some of its policies uh I think political pressure is building mainstream Democrats the so called uncommitted in a very close election which could be determined by three or four states under 100,000 votes in November the uncommitted um those who for any number of reasons including the administration's policy on Gaza may choose simply not to vote so I think all of these things combin but the ultimate objective is having the opposite effect that's the problem it's not advancing what Joe Biden wants and the only thing that can deliver that which is to literally change the pictures in Gaza break the battlefield Dynamic create predictable corridors to Surge humanitarian assistance and maybe just maybe after a six week pause try to extend that somehow the only thing that's going to do that uh is is what's happening in Doha nothing in New York or at the UN can bring that about okay that's a a f fascinating very interesting and rather Bleak analysis but we thank you for it Aaron David Miller at the carnegi Endowment for International Peace thank you so much thank you for having
