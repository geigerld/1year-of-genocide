the Israeli Army says it's investigating the conduct of some of its soldiers after a wounded Palestinian man was tied to the hood of a military vehicle during a raid in the occupied West Bank the Israel Defense Forces confirmed the incident in Janine after video of it circulated on social media the man strapped to the Bonnet of this Israeli army vehicle barely moves Witnesses in the Israeli military say he was injured during an arrest W raid in Janine but that's where the coroporation stops the Israeli Defense Forces say the man was a suspect wounded in an exchange of fire his relatives paint a different picture mahad was here Hashim was on the bed and my uncle Majid they opened the door and started shooting we saw it with special forces maahad got up and was about to run but he was shot in the legs and in the hand the family say they repeatedly requested an ambulance for mujahed AI but none came we told them we wanted an ambulance for the wounded person in the room they told us to bring him to them we got him outside and for about an hour or half an hour we kept asking for an ambulance then we called one 15 minutes later two Jeeps came and they got him in here they told us to turn around and not to look they put him on the hood of the Jeep and then we were told that they'd handed him over to the government Hospital an Israeli military statement provided to the Reuters news agency said the individual was transferred to Medics for treatment but it didn't give an explanation for a glaring detail in the video that the army vehicle drove past two ambulances without any apparent interaction it's led to accusations mujahed azri was being used as a human shield asum shielding in action that's what the UN special reporter on the occupied Palestinian teror teritories wrote on X further accusing Israel of turning international law on its head Israel frequently cites human shielding by Palestinian militants as a cause of the huge death toll in Gaza and for civilian casualties inflicted during its operations in the occupied West Bank in its statement the Israeli military said its soldiers had violated military protocol in Janine and that it would invest at and deal with the incident meanwhile Health officials in Gaza say at least 39 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes in the north of the territory Israel says its fighter jet struck two Hamas military sites in Gaza City it's the latest deadly incident as Israel continues its campaign to crush the Palestinian militant group some carry away the wounded while others pick through the rubble searching for survivors after a residential Block in al-shati was hit by a deadly strike this is one of the oldest refugee camps in the Gaza Strip people were going about their business some were at home all of a sudden fighter jets just struck the whole area was wiped out highrise buildings were reduced to Rubble Witnesses said the strike hit two neighborhoods and flattened several apartment buildings and nearby houses Health officials in Gaza say they expect to find more bodies following Saturday's strikes on Gaza City the whole area was targeted it was like an earthquake as you see homes were destroyed there are still families under the rubble some of the were transferred to hospital and now we're rescuing the others who are left under the rubble the situation is tough due to the lack of tools and the lack of fuel for ambulances the Israeli military said its war planes struck infrastructure used by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza City area Hamas led the October 7th Terror attacks against Israel now despite growing International pressure Israel has vowed to continue its Gaza offensive until Hamas is wiped out we should mention tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets across Israel in one of the largest mass demonstrations yet against the government of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as in Jerusalem demonstrators in Tel Aviv demanded new elections and a deal for the release of hostages still being held by Hamas it's the latest in a string of weekly protests in Israel against the government's handling of the war in Gaza let's get the latest from Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya that video has been released on social media the Israeli Army has confirmed the incident what more do we know so far well as you said this video has been widely circulated uh on social media showing an injured Palestinian young man strapped to the hood of dis military uh Jeep this happened uh nearby the uh Northern Town of Janine and the occupied West Bank as far as we understand and the Israeli military said that the men was injured during a raid in this area and an exchange of fire now according to the news agency uh Associated Press the family had asked the army that they needed an ambulance but instead the Army had put him on the hood of the military Jeep strapped him there and then drove away he he was later we understand uh transferred uh to a Palestinian ambulance and then uh taken uh to a hospital the Army also said in a statement you quoted them that uh the forces violated uh orders and uh procedures that there would been investigation but it's still to see what comes out of this investigation there and that of course comes on the back top of uh also conflict in the occupied West Bank we've seen a lot of military rats arrest rates and also set violence uh in the occupied West Bank Tanya every weekend now seems to bring hundreds if not more Israelis onto the streets to protest against the Netanyahu government this weekend was the biggest according to organizers so far and netanyahu's government appears to have no effective rebuttal to them well I mean the government doesn't seem to be uh too bothered uh by them uh as well um and we've been seeing it you rightly said the the last Saturday night this was one of the largest demonstration now in Tel Aviv but we also saw large numbers coming out uh to the streets uh in Jerusalem but also across uh uh the country across Israel and this comes after a week of disruption as some of the protest organizers uh have said we've seen uh during the week uh Every Other Day protests or blocking the roads uh uh in front of the knesset the Israeli Parliament as well now after October 7 after the attacks said there was some sense of unity there were protests and demonstrations to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza right now there are over 100 hostages that remain uh captive uh in Gaza but now we are seeing more and more also the anti-government protesters out in the streets or they're combining forces in some cases so yesterday again uh protesters called for the release of the hostages from to the for the government to come to an agreement that's on the table but also uh for uh new elections and uh this is what we have been seeing here of course in the past weeks and that comes on the back top of an ongoing War as we've seen uh in the report in Gaza with air strikes and bombardment continuing throughout Gaza but also in Israel heightened tensions in Northern Israel uh in the uh crossb attacks with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon okay Tanya that is uh Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem many thanks
