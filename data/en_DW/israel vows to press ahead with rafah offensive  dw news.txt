Israel says that it is still planning a military offensive in the city of Rafa in southern Gaza and that's despite the fact that it has already withdrawn many of its troops from the area allies including the United States have warned Israel against mounting this operation but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that it's necessary for the fight against Hamas air strikes on Rafa seen from Israel which has for months said they would be followed up by a ground invas prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not softened his line we will complete the elimination of the Hamas brigades including in Rafa there is no force in the world that will stop us but 6 months into the war Israel now faces strong pressure from its main Ally the US to rein military operations and not to mount a fullscale ground Invasion into Rafa where more than a million people live in close conditions we have made clear to Israel that we think a full-scale military invasion of Rafa would have an enormously harmful effect on those civilians and that it would ultimately hurt Israel's security Israel has two ways to root out Hamas a fullscale ground campaign or a more targeted one a fullscale Invasion would probably look like what has already happened in other parts of Gaza in urban areas like Han Yunis and Gaza City further north from Rafa an air campaign combined with tanks and troops on the ground at a potentially catastrophic cost to civilians Israel has said it will evacuate civilians to elsewhere in Gaza but is given no specifics this kind of ground Invasion would further antagonize the US which has conditioned future Military Support on how Israel treats civilians in Gaza but Israel has also shown it can mount targeted operations earlier this month Commandos recovered the body of elad kir who had been taken hostage on October 7th these raids rely on precise intelligence rather than overwhelming Firepower which path Israel chooses may come down to politics in the US President Joe bid faces significant pressure from the left to restrain Israel while at home Benyamin Netanyahu faces a public that overwhelmingly wants to defeat Hamas once and for all well I'm joined Now by Colonel Mark KY and he served over three decades in the US Marine Court he's now a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in Washington DC colel it's good to have you with us on this Tuesday we just to start by asking you can Israel defeat Hamas without entering Rafa yeah to that unfortunately is probably no uh there's been suggestions that they might surround the city and then use targeted attacks on identified uh strongholds but that will take a long time the Israelis can't find them all Hamas has been very good about digging in and hiding so if Israel really wants to do what it says it wants to do that is destroy Hamas unfortunately they'll have to go in on the ground and does that mean also um accepting the fact that there will be thousands and thousands of civilians whose lives will be endangered per who perhaps also whose lives will be killed and unfortunately that's what would happen we've seen that happen in the other big cities Gaza and K Yunis would likely happen in Rafa and it's exacerbated by the fact that Hamas is willing to use civilians as human Shields to protect its military forces the Israelis might try to move civilians out and be careful about its use of Firepower but if it goes in there's no way to prevent large civilian losses we have reported now for for quite some time the Israeli Prime Minister announcing that an offensive in Rafa is is in the near future but it still hasn't happened um what does that tell you then the fact that this ground defensive still hasn't begun well it it says two things first Israel has been mopping up in Central and Northern uh Gaza it's also been distracted by things like these drone strikes missile strikes from Iran and then the Israeli response so it hasn't really had a chance to focus on Rafa but it is true that right now doesn't look like the Israelis are massing the forces they would need to capture the city in fact all that's been happening for the last couple of weeks in Gaza is what you might call skirmishing most of the action has been elsewhere and the fact that we haven't seen this offensive begin in Rafa what do you think that means for Hamas is it given Hamas time to prepare for it and maybe to to refortify its positions well it does but Hamas has had 20 years to fortify its position so another couple of weeks is not going to make a lot of difference they probably are laying in uh weapons and Munitions although the Israelis are trying very hard to prevent any military supplies from from getting in mostly I think the Hamas is waiting and uh seeing what the Israelis will do they've also been infiltrating forces further north getting them in to K Yunis Gaza City Israelis are constantly skirmishing with Hamas forces that pop up uh so to speak behind Israeli lines and you know considering what we have seen in the last six months would you say that the operations by the IDF are we approaching a point when Israel will be able to say with conviction that it has defeated Hamas that it's on the road to defeating Hamas well if the Israelis do take RF up or do squeeze it they can claim that they have defeated Hamas and it's an important distinction between defeated and destroyed the Israelis have talked before about destroyed but that's almost impossible uh there'll be enough of Hamas left that they can reconstitute but defeat that is possible the tough question though is okay what happens after the Israelis finish with Rafa either they occupy Gaza which they tried before and was very unsuccessful and they don't want to do it and the United States certainly doesn't want the Israelis to do that the ideal solution would be some sort of Arab peacekeeping Force but Arab countries don't want to take on that responsibility they also don't want to be seen to be suppressing Hamas so the day after Rafa is a question up in the air and we'll be talking about that in a couple of weeks yeah I'm I'm sure we'll be talking about that for quite some time to come that's for sure Colonel Mark Canon as always Colonel it's good to have you on the program good to get your analysis thank you thanks for having me on the show
