following an attack walking for hours to seek [Music] safety we fled the morning she was born she and her mother didn't rest she didn't even get breastfed our journey it's a journey of Torment the West Banks Health min says dozens of babies are at risk of death in alifa the hospital of shifa is the main hospital in Gaza Strip it lacks oxygen it lacks it lacks electricity it lacks Fuel and also the Israeli occupation power is threatening the uh medical staff to to leave there as Israel intensifies its operations in Northern Gaza it says doctors patients and thousands of displaced people who've taken Refuge at hospitals must leave saying Hamas militants are using the facilities as cover Israel denies that its forces are attacking alifa Hospital the World Health Organization says it's Gravely concerned about the safety of those still inside the hospital Ahad alandari joins me from Oman he is the regional director for the World Health Organization thank you so so much for speaking to us again what are your colleagues in Gaza telling you about the situation at alifa hospital today thank you very much CLA for giving me the opportunity you know we are getting reports from our office there in Gaz that they have not really managed you know to get any communication for the last 24 hours with their teams there in shifa hospital but according to the reports you know there are still um attacks of the hospital building and the surrounding of the hospital which led for example the the last attack last night you know led into casualties and deaths among those people who sheltered themselves in that hospital as well as damaging the ICU with one patient died who was under ventilator and the service is really collapsing there because of the lack of the fuel as well as because of the direct attacks you know of some of the buildings there there is no clean water uh to run the services as well as no electric you know they are operating on torches they are operating with no anesthesia and they are really facing a very bad situation there in the hospital now the Israeli military says that there's been a lot of misinformation coming out of Gaza I'd like to take a listen to what their spokesperson um Danielle hagari said last night about alifa Hospital Dr alari it would be great if you could listen in with us and I'd like to get your thoughts on what he says in just a moment there is no s i rep there is no Siege on the shifa hospital the east side of the hospital is open on elad street for the safe pass of gazans who wish to leave the hospital we're speaking directly and regularly with the hospital staff the staff of the shifa hospital has requested that tomorrow we will help the babies in the pediatric department to get to a safer hospital we will provide the assistance needed Dr Al manari uh can can you confirm what the IDF is saying there is there safe passage out of alifa hospital for those uh who wish to leave uh there are a few points that I'd like to reiterate and reemphasize on in fact based on all un agencies and as well as credible nonan agencies there is no place save in Gaza all places in Gaza are under direct attacks by the Israeli forces all Healthcare facilities you know are under attack by the forces as well and the surrounding of these facilities evacuating patients from the hospital is right is like issuing a death certificate because first of all you know all hospitals are you know partially functioning those hospitals which are still functioning partially functioning these hospitals are suffering from you know severe shortage of medical supplies severe shortage of fuel with no electricity and no clean water and in addition to that the bed capacity in the remaining hospitals is reaching 180% of their normal bed capacity so there is no place at all for even one single bed to receive a patient number two patients in a shifa hospital especially those under you know ventilators and especially children it is really like issuing premature death certificate for them because it is not possible to move them from you know the machines you know keeping them alive um the place you know or the roads are not safe and in fact some of those people who fleed the hospital the civilians were under attack so I don't know on what basis you know Israeli forces is saying they are communicating with the staff in the hospital asking them to evacuate it is unfair to evacuate T of patients from this hospital so you're describing a very dire humanitarian situation but just to make clear um from what the IDF has said that there is no Siege of alifa hospital is that is the World Health Organization also able to confirm that that that people who are able in a position to leave can actually get off premises there is no way to get you know patients or staff or even those who are Sheltering themselves in the hospital to leave the hospital because of the insecurity and direct attacks of the surrounding of the hospital and this report in fact it is not only wh report it is report of all un agencies including msf including you know red Cent Red Cross uh reports so it is it is not just un reports or minister of Filth official rewards okay thank you so much for speaking with us as always that's uh Dr Ahmed Al mandari from the World Health Organization many thanks we appreciate your time thank you my pleasure we're joined by DW's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem from more now ton medical staff in gaza's hospitals are describing alifa hospital as under bombard can you tell us more about what is happening there well I mean this is what we're getting from reports from Gaza obviously there are residents still in the area and from the medical staff you know with through through phone calls telling what is going on right now there at shiffer hospital they're saying there has been heavy bombardment air strikes uh in the area in the vicinity of the hospital alifa the largest hospital in Gaza where you said you know many residents of Gaza had also sought they will be safe uh in the compound of this hospital but now um you know medical staff and the the um directors there of the health official saying that basically Al shifa uh hospital is shutting down they're starting to lose patients uh they cannot provide the services anymore we also hear that from other hospitals uh in the north uh and uh wh said they're very worried about the situation they're grave concerns about what is going on that they had lost contact to their focal points at shifa hospital also we're hearing this from Doctors Without Borders msf they also have stuff in the hospital uh you know calling for the protections of those Hospitals now the Israeli Army has said they are confirming there's fighting going on in the vicinity of the hospital that they're not targeting the hospital itself although the Army has always said that they are um allegedly uh you know command centers of the Armed groups underneath the hospital that's why this hospital is such a a focus for uh the military but of course this situation also means for patients or for people in the north of Gaza with all these hospitals being you know where there's a lot of fighting going on that they have no place to go to in in need if they need of help they're describing a dire situation indeed Anon I want to ask you about some news coming out of Israel Israeli media reporting progress in a deal to free some 240 hostages believed to be held in Gaza it's been about 5 weeks since their abduction and Little's known about their Fates we're going to come back to Tanya in just a moment but first this report they want action across Israel thousands of protesters took to the streets on Saturday they wared their government to secure the quick release of hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7th I don't think any other country in the world would have that women children baby civilian Innocents who are being kept as hostages um in Gaza right now and for 35 days not one person from the Red Cross has been allowed to visit with them and let us know um that they're okay and give us a sign of life from any of them at another much smaller demonstration a group of Israeli activists called for an end to the war in Gaza we come here to ask for ceasefire I think this is right now the only demonstration of Main Jewish Israelis who are asking to stop the massive bombarding of Gaza to stop the ongoing transfer in the west bank and to start finding peaceful solutions for the situation in the past couple of weeks using this War the government has taken power into its own hands and disallowed any form of protest against the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Gaza and against the war and working towards a solution today we are here to protest also against that demands for a ceasefire have been growing from citizens across the world and also from world leaders on Friday French president Emmanuel macron said there was no justification for the civilian casualties in Gaza and called on Israel to stop its bombing and day after day what we saw is a permanent bombing of civilians in G those remarks have not gone down well with Israeli Prime min Benjamin Netanyahu regarding French president mcon I think he did good things he came here he sent a floating hospital it's good but if you're asking me about macron's remarks he made a severe mistake it was a factual mistake and a moral mistake it is Hamas not Israel preventing the civilians evacuation Israel is telling them to leave while Israel's leadership is Eden that it's not changing its strategy there are many voices at home who believe a ceasefire in Gaza may help bring back hostages so let's come back to Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya as we've heard Israeli media reporting that dozens of hostages could soon be released under a possible deal can you give us any further details there well basically these are con these were reports in Israeli media that came up on Saturday night they're talking about a possible deal that might be on the table but nothing is confirmed here it's where all unsourced reports saying that a deal could include up to 80 hostages among them women elderly and the children that are being held in Gaza they could be exchanged uh in return for um women uh Palestinian women prison that are held in Israeli prison as well as Palestinian miners that are held in in Israeli prisons but again nothing has been confirmed of that sort so far but um you know hostage negotiators are saying or sources close to them that they need a ceasefire for that to move uh those hostages to get them out of Gaza at least a short-term uh ceasefire but we also hearing again in a televised in a press conference by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he said again um that there would be no ceas fire unless all the hostages are basically released so we have to wait and see what's going on there behind closed doors whether there is a breakthrough uh Qatar is uh is working on that as one of the mediators Egypt so we have to wait and see if there's a breakthrough in the coming days and this all taking place as uh on Saturday we saw protests across Israel calling for the hostages release what are these demonstrators asking of the Israeli government well I think it's a very frustrating and very worrying situation for many family families and the relatives of uh the hostages they are coming out in the past weeks they came out on several locations across Israel not just reminding the government it's so important to keep this on the agenda the government is saying and the Army as well it's one of their priorities obviously to bring the hostages back home but families are worried about the fact that Israel is pushing ahead with a ground operation in Gaza and that might harm the hostages that are being held in Gaza and they're demanding more action more information from the government to bring uh the hostages home Tanya thank you very much for that that's DW's Tanya Kramer reporting from
