Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing that his country's Army will enter the southern Gaza City of Rafa regardless of whether a ceasefire deal is reached with Hamas speaking at a meeting with the families of Israeli hostages Netanyahu said Israel would not end the war until all of its goals had been achieved including eliminating Hamas battalions in Rafa many had hoped a ceasefire agreement would avert a rougher ground incursion which Israel 's allies including the United States and Germany have warned against let's get more from DW's correspondent uh in Jerusalem Tanya ker Tanya is Benjamin netanyahu's stance on Rafa jeopardizing the possibility of reaching any kind of deal well that's also being discussed uh in Israel between those who are supporting such a deal that is uh currently uh being worked on through mediators Qatar and Egypt uh in Cairo and where a response by Hamas is actually uh uh waited for at the moment uh so and those of course who are opposing uh to end the war and those who uh have said that Israel should not be guided by International pressure and among them are also members of his own uh cabinet some of the far-right members of his cabinet but prime minister Benjamin netan has said it time and time again himself that uh he he thinks that the military needs to go into Rafa uh to uh destroy Hamas as he puts it and also to achieve a full victory in this war something that many Israelis are not actually believing in anymore at this point in time and his critics have said he should not have said that now uh as a public statement is it is a crucial time while those mediators are uh trying uh to get such a deal uh uh together and of course it's also devastating for uh the families uh and relatives of those hostages that remain uh in Gaza and of course we should not forget it just comes a couple of hours before um uh US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is expected to arrive in Israel and his priorities also to push for such a deal uh as you say uh blink will be in Israel or is expected to to visit Israel soon does the US have enough leverage to pressure Israel not to attack Rafa what influence can he bring well I mean his main goal is as he had said is to bring uh both sides uh first and foremost together to engage uh indirectly obviously and to come uh to a deal uh and uh you know to get to at least the temporary uh ceasefire this is actually to prevent such an operation or ground operation uh in Rafa and the Us and other countries you said it have made it very clear that they oppose such a uh a ground operation in Rafa where over 1 million Palestinians that have been displaced multiple times are uh seeking uh some sort of shelter they said there needs to be at least a credible plan to bring those people to some sort of safety there's also the question of Aid because most of the aid is still going in through the Rafa Crossing this is another very important point on uh blinken's agenda that more humanitarian aid needs to go uh into Gaza it's still not enough um although Israeli officials saying that Aid has been increased but Aid organizations say it's not enough and also we will see him certainly talking more about on a regional uh level he just came from Saudi Arabia uh to to prevent any further escalation also on a regional level DW's Jerusalem correspondent Tanya ker Tanya thank you many had hoped agreement on a ceasefire could avert a rougher ground incursion which Israel's allies including the United States and Germany have warned against the United Nations relief Agency for Palestinians or anra warns that while more Aid has been getting through any rougher military operation could severely disrupt vital distribution efforts the crossing at Rafa a vital Lifeline for gazin that could soon be under threat famine is looming for more than a million people here the UN estimates billions of dollars in Aid are necessary in the coming months Israel says Aid is flowing over the last few weeks the amount of humanitarian Aid going into Gaza has significantly increased in the coming days the amount of Aid going into Gaza will continue to scale up even more food water medical supplies shelter equipment and other Aid more of it is going into Gaza than ever before so far Aid has entered Gaza via land and air often using the Egyptian Port of Elish freight trucks then head for the Rafa Crossing Israel has announced it's temporarily opening other Crossings at Ares and the so-called G 96 which allow Aid into Northern Gaza without a dangerous drive through the conflict Zone the Us and other countries have been airdropping aid for months now and the US is building a floating Aid Pier off of gaza's Mediterranean Coast that will allow ships to deliver Aid directly at a cost of more than $300 million but the United Nations world food program says that getting food to people who need it is complex effect especially given ongoing air strikes and shelling we don't have enough trucks so under the current circumstances where we don't have um safety where we don't have enough trucks coming into Gaza to deliver where we have one checkpoint for now going into the north with only a few trucks going in we're not operating at the scale that we would like the efforts that are already underway would be severely disrupted if Israel does mount a full-scale ground offensive on Raa making deliveries even more dangerous for Aid workers and Gins alike and I'm joined Now by Sam Rose from anra that's the UN relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees welcome to DW thanks for your time uh Israel's prime minister Netanyahu Benyamin Netanyahu is saying the planned offensive on Rafa will happen no matter what can I ask for your reaction to that statement yes thanks for having me on I mean we're hearing the news live as as as you are this this breaking news and obviously it's extremely extremely concerning for for us for the humanitarian Community but most importantly for the for the people of Gaza and the people of Rafa in particular there has been a palpable sense of anxiety here over the past few uh few days as this deadline has got closer and closer and if indeed these reports are confirmed uh we are extremely concerned about what the immediate and and longer term future holes for people here Sam you're in Rua can you give us a sense of what it is like there the conditions you spoke about the sense of uh anxiety how are people coping with now the shadow of this planned offensive hanging over them the conditions are desperate the conditions have been desperate here for for for several months we have one and a half million people living in a tiny Slither of land here most of them have have lost every things many of them are living in tents or in knitted together you know tents made of bags of flour they they have almost nothing we're living through extremely poor sanitation conditions extremely poor health conditions there are regular bombardments that are that that pepper the day that pepper the night a constant sound of drone drone drone Israeli drones overhead that just torment people who have already been through so much and and on top of this that they're dealing with the most uncertain future we already know the situation is catastrophic here if the incursion and if the operation goes ahead it will be far far worse we're looking at wide scale destruction and really a multitude of of casualties that's on the on the ground here for people inside Rapa then we have major questions about where they will go space for them to to to set up shelter and how we as the humanitarian Community will be able to assist and protect him on that point Israel is saying that it's preparing to evacuate Palestinians from Rafa can you talk to us about the logistics of that I mean would it even be possible we've seen what's happened in in Northern Gaza we saw what had happened in in canun several weeks several several months ago now when it comes to to northern northern Gaza the situation here is is completely different both in terms of the scale uh the order of magnitude we're looking at almost 1.5 million people who are living here and also the destination uh you know they're being if indeed this do does come to pass they'll be pushed into areas that have already been subject to Savage bombardment over the past several months and and and the other important factor is that that Aid has been getting into Gaza at far far far lower volumes than we would love but Rafa Kum Shalom the Border area here has been the lifeline for that trickle of Aid we know that it isn't enough it's led to the worst uh deterioration in food security conditions anywhere we've seen in in the world in the recent past and and what that means in terms of people going to an area where we cannot secure Aid we cannot provide for that it it it it doesn't bear thinking about what the consequences of something like that will be and it's very very hard if not impossible to see how it can be done safely without major casualties without major loss of life s the US is putting pressure on Israel to increase Aid to Gaza but again what happens to Aid deliveries if there is this EV offensive uh we're talking about absolutely I mean as we know Rafa K Shalom has been the main entry point for Aid new and complimentary Terminals and entry points are being set up but they are yet to be to be open this is in eras at the North and and and and the pier and the the the jetty off the sea they are are yet to be fully functioning we have yet to see DET to receive details of how they will function in terms of how the aid will get from the ships safely into the hands of the organizations that need to distribute it around Gaza and we're not we're also not seeing the quantities and the volume of Aid that are needed to to to meet the the the needs of all the people who will be fleeing who will be on the run if this indeed happens and and and let's not forget it's not just about trucks of Aid coming in it's about F fuel it's about water it's about electricity it's about the basics of life that go beyond what you can put on a truck Sam Rose from anra in Rafa Sam thank you so much uh for your time thank you and for more we can go straight to Cairo now to speak to journalist Karim El goari uh kareim is there a realistic chance of a deal soon well there was a optimistic atmosphere yesterday um with Hamas official saying there's no major issues in the way also the Egyptian negotiators saying that there are important Israeli concessions now the Hamas delegation left Cairo in order to negotiate this new Israeli proposal among them eles and Israeli delegation that was originally planned to come to Cairo today deferred this visit until there is a written answer from Hamas when it comes to substance through the media we don't have anything official it seems that the Israeli proposal agrees that if Hamas releases 33 uh hostages there will be a release of hundreds of Palestinians in Palestinian prisons and uh 40-day truth but they talk about several phases the is when they stick Point comes in the second phase Hamas wants to have guarantees for a permanent ceasefire and that the Israeli Army withdrawals from the Gaza Strip now it seems like in the Israeli proposal there's talk about sustained calm uh whatever this means but the problem is that the demands of Hamas of uh permanent ceasefire and of the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the Gaza Strip of course this all directly contradicts with the Israeli War objective of destroying ham that is the reason why this all is so difficult you've made very clear there how many details how many nuances are involved in these negotiations yet diplomats are being fairly open about their optimism where is this sudden momentum coming from I think it's pressure on all sides pressure on Hamas of course they want to avoid under any circumstances and Israeli military offensive to Raa and Israeli Prime Minister Nan is Under Pressure also from his ally the US to agree to some kind of ceasefire not at least because US President Joe Biden himself is under pressure by the protests in the universities in the US and all this leads to that there is some movement here in this negotiations okay um US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is now in Jordan he's expected to visit Israel next will he be able to push for more aid for Gaza well he said says there is more Aid coming in in the last days but he says it's by far not enough and he says something like we need to improve the de conflicting for humanitarian workers uh I I I love American semantics so I think to translate it he says basically we need to make sure that the Israeli Army doesn't kill humanitarian workers who hand out the aid and to make sure that the aid gets to all the people I talked to an member of an NGO here in kir international NGO who is working on the issue to get Aid in um she's saying that to get the aid in that improved in the last uh week but the problem is that lots of this Aid doesn't reach the northern Gaza Strip accessibility is still a big problem and uh she is saying the only thing that will solve this problem at the end is going to be a ceasefire that will be the ultimate relief for the humanitarian situation in the Gaza State Karim thank you so much that's kareim El goari in Kiro okay
