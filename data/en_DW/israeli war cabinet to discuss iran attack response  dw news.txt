Israel's war cabinet is to meet for the third time in three days as it considers its response to Iran's First Direct attack on the country Israel's military has been showing what it says is part of an Iranian ballistic missile retrieved from the Dead Sea following the strike it says Iran launched 110 ballistic missiles towards Israel at the weekend in addition to drones and medium-range missiles now most were shot down Iran says its strike was in retaliation for what it says was Israel's uh attack on a an Iranian consulate building in Syria and governments around the world are calling for both sides to show restraint with Iran's president Ibrahim RI warning that any response by Israel would have extensive and painful consequences let's look at this with mayor jaad Dana who's an Iranian Israeli political analyst and lecturer at the rman University in Israel he joins us from Tel Aviv welcome to DW so the world has has been calling on Iran and Israel to deescalate but you tweeted recently that Iran's attack has given Israel a valuable opportunity what did you mean well um the Islamic Republic of Iran since uh 197 since 1991 has been uh paying different uh proxy groups to kill Israelis um groups such as Hamas isbah Jihad islami and in fact um one of the reasons why the oo peace course failed is because of Iranian regime's support for extremist groups uh so every time Israel withdrew from occupied territory there were there were more suicide Bings in Israel from Iran supported groups and this is one of the reasons why eventually Israel is turned against the peace process so for many years the the Israeli government has been looking to uh to punish the Iranian regime for its support of these groups for paying billions of dollars to different groups to kill Irani to kill Israeli citizens this is why I have to say this is why Iran is in desperate need of investment itself but that's another issue but for the Israeli government it's a it's a top priority to protect its citizens okay and now that the Iranian regime has attack has attacked Israel directly then this is the opportunity for the state of Israel to to exact the price to exact the heavy price from the Iranian regime for not just because of its support for not just because of its attack but but it's three decades long uh project of supporting anyone who wants to kill an M Israelis so what do you believe the heavy price that the state of Israel should exact from Iran is well these are these are different the different conversation these are there different issues for example attacks against Iran's military infrastructure according to for according to foreign news sources during Mr naali Bennet there was an attack for example against the Iranian drone base in kman sha somewhere between 100 to 200 drones were destroyed um these such such as these attacks but right now whether they would happen I'm not so sure a range of options let's let's move on because do you is it your belief that a military response is Israel's only option I think it's very important look uh Phil you know I'm from Iran originally I would love to see peace between Iran and Israel uh but the Iranian regime is the only regime that denies the Holocaust in in the world this is the only regime that calls for the elimination of the state of Israel and the killing of its people there is no option for diplomacy here the Iranian regime does not believe in diplomacy doesn't even believe that Jews have should have their own state so there is no other option but to uh to uh to send that you know to it's basically realism it's international relations School of realism Israel has to show strength against the Iranian regime otherwise it will continue supporting groups that want to kill Israel is in fact Phil according to Wall Street Journal New York Times some of the Hamas people took part in the October 7th Massacre were trained in Iran and also some of them in Syria and the Iranian supervision that's speculation that we can't get into here let's try let's look at what the Israeli forign Minister Israel Kats has been doing today he's launched what he calls a diplomatic offensive calling for sanctions against Iran and answer in two parts if you wouldn't mind do you think one that request will be heeded and two what effect do you think more sanctions on a country that's already heavily sanctioned will have um I'm not sure if it will be heed I don't have enough knowledge on European diplomacy to be able to tell you but I can tell you that uh if the irgc for example Islamic revolutionary guard is sanctioned then this would be a huge blow to the Iranian regime because it uses the irgc's massive economic Empire to finance attacks and this would be a setback what it will happen that will depend on on European politics and that's something that is not my subject of expertise okay that's good talking to you thank you so much for taking us through that mayor Javid danfa in Tel Aviv thank you now governor ments around the world are calling for restraint as Israel weighs its response to last weekend's attacks by Iran European Union foreign ministers are holding hastily scheduled talks to discuss the volatile situation in the Middle East Israel's allies are trying to strike a balance between standing in solidarity with Israel and curbing further fighting in the region air defenses destroyed these Iranian drones over Israel last weekend now Western powers are watching closely as Tel Aviv mulls its next move tan says the attacks were self-defense after a suspected Israeli strike on its Embassy in Damascus but countries ranging from Kenya to the United States and Germany have condemned Iran the Iranian regime launched an unprecedented attack against Israel this weekend and has led the region to the edge of the Abyss Iran stands isolated Israel is asking its allies to Target tan with more sanctions adding to those the US has long had in place and the European unions raft of travel bans and embargos over allegations of Rights abuses in Iran nuclear proliferation terrorist activities arming Russia and aiding and abetting the Syrian government some experts say to little effect they're already sanctions now against Iran uh including on drones for example the building of drones well that certainly hasn't stopped uh the Iranians to you know produce hundreds of them I cannot sufficiently stress how how um we're on the knife edge of big geostrategic changes many now fear Israeli retaliation could spark an even wider regional conflict prompting Western leaders to ask Tel Aviv to exercise restraint the US has warned it won't take part in a military counter offensive and the EU is calling for we want to continue our work to deescalate this is something because we said very clearly not only on in the aftermath of what happened last week but already before that the regional escalation will benefit no one and this is one of the main objectives of our efforts to make sure that there is no further escalation because this is bringing us to the brink of a new unforeseen situation in the Middle East unforeseen and unpredictable with Gaza still under bombardment hostages still caught in the crossfire and the humanitarian situation still dire Mary Eisen served in the Israeli intelligence community and retired from active duty in 2004 at the rank of Colonel she's now managing director of The International Institute for counterterrorism welcome to DW uh Colonel Eisen um what do you think Israel's next move should be Israel has to respond in some way when I say respond this is about the initiative the Israeli public I don't in that sense it's not about us and what we want it's about what the perceptions are in the greater Middle East um Iran attacked us directly we need to do some kind of not retaliation but response initiative so that Iran does not define the rules of the game right so is this is this do you think then likely to be another of the sort of graduated attacks everyone is saying that when uh Iran attacked Israel it it gave you so much uh notice and sent over these slow drones so that Israel would be ready to blow them down so that honor was served on both sides Iran was seen to respond and Israel was seen to uh do something about it no well one person got got got injured but no major damage was done is that the sort of thing that you're expecting uh from Israel it's kind of interesting that everybody takes for granted that the Israeli intercepting defense systems would stop the 99% that it did I have to tell you as an Israeli I did not know that they would stop 99% and I don't accept the premise that Iran did this because they thought that they weren't going to injure anybody they fired in over 300 projectiles and in that sense this is about making a statement I don't understand why everybody thinks that Iran didn't think that they would do damage they sent in heavy duty cruise missiles suicide drones and I remind us all they supply all of the Weaponry that is fired daily into Israel from his Bala from thetis that doesn't come from nowhere right so I don't think that the Israeli response is about just showing face it's about a real Attack that Iran did and it's about deterence within the Middle East so do you therefore expect uh Israel's response uh to be escalatory I think that Israel needs to be on the initiative I think that Iran should not Define the rules of how you act not against Israel and not in the world we're talking about a regime that is acknowledged as an enemy authoritarian um regime that exports not just terrorism ideology ideas they call not just for the destruction of Israel they want to do much beyond that and so it's not about the retaliation per se it's about Iran not defining the rules not for Israel not for the rest of the world Iran says that the S Saturday night's attack on Israel is is in keeping with its rights to self-defense after Israel's deadly bombing of Iran's Consulate in Syria can you see why they would say that I think that Iran is exceedingly good at trying to frame the information Warfare where they are a legitimate member of the International Community and I'll ask all of the viewers right now is a country that calls openly Kam you can show him also the supreme leader calls openly for the destruction of the state of Israel he didn't do that after the April 1 to attack he does that every single week in his weekly sermon a country that exports capabilities ideas ideology weapons all of the different things that we're seeing in the Middle East this is not just something of self-defense Iran has been attacking Israel and participating in the war against Israel for years not since April 1st with the alleged Israeli attack against their um um Iranian revolutionary guard um fighters who were inside Syria do you think uh Benjamin Netanyahu has uh lost control of this war when you consider the original Hamas strike that blindsided Israel so-called Mr Security in 6 months one of the greatest military powers in the Middle East still hasn't achieved its goal of destroying Hamas and rescuing the hostages and now Iran has had the nerve to attack Israel directly rather than through its Proxes is Mr Netanyahu the right man to lead this war so you asked about netan and I'm asking you again about the premise in that sense of what you said I'm here inside Israel right now and that's turning the horrific attack that Kamas did against Israel being about prime minister nany I'm not a supporter of prime minister Netanyahu and he knows that and yes he has sold himself as Mr security but the Colossal failure of October 7th is not only Nan's and I would even go so far to say that the policy of any alternative government when it comes to Security will not be very different from prime minister netan he has additional people within the government everybody likes to quote the extreme elements but those are politicians making statements they're not necessarily the ones who make the decisions in the security cabinet that horrific attack on October 7th is not just about the Israeli failure it's about the ideology of Hamas it's because we erroneously thought that Hamas was on a different route we me I made that mistake not just prime minister Nan as an expert I say that and because of that I do think that we are trying as hard as we can to attack Hamas and we're not destroying it in that sense because we're both trying to acknowledge and understand the loss of life that is happening within the Gaza Strip because of the way that Hamas built themselves so there is no easy resolution it wasn't about solving it taking 250 hostages is what a terror Army does there is no easy way out of it must view the hostages as collateral damage as bargaining chips they don't see them as human at all thanks for joining us Mary eizen from counterterrorism
