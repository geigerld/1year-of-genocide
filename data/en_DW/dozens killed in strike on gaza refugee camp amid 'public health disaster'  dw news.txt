gaza's hamus run Health Ministry says at least 70 people have been killed in an air strike that hit a refugee camp the attack Came As the World Health Organization visited gaza's largest hospital again finding facilities overwhelmed by the number of wounded meanwhile Israel released new footage of what it says is part of hamas's underground tunnel Network they let weapons ammunition and emergency rooms Israel's military says this winding network of tunnels is where Hamas oversaw the attacks on October 7th soldiers reportedly also found the bodies of five Israeli hostages killed by Hamas while in captivity in the headquarters which is located dozens of meters underground we found weapons infrastructure for the production of weapons Laboratories where weapons were produced and emergency rooms where the commander of the headquarters ahed rondor led the fighting on October 7th against the state of Israel Israel says it will now move its focus to Southern Gaza in its War to eliminate Hamas which is recognized as a terrorist group by the EU and the US the push comes as a fresh round of air strikes hit residential homes in the magazi refugee camp killing dozens of people there during a visit to alifa hospital the largest medical facility in Gaza World Health Organization officials issued the most dire assessment yet of the humanitarian situation [Music] there I'm back in Al the largest hospital in Gaza for the third time this week where it's still a case of absolute misery with people still on the floors it's almost impossible to walk critical cases doctors and nurses absolutely scrambling people crying out that they need blood for their sons and daughter who are dying there's almost nothing that this team can do the wh stressed that there is still an urgent need of fuel medicine food and water and that a real risk of famine was looming ever larger and our correspondent Yan Philip Schultz joins us from Jerusalem now yeah Yan Philip let's first talk about that air strike on the refugee camp what more do you know about it there are reports that more than 70 people died in in this heavy air strike on al- magazi refugee camp uh this is information provided by uh the Hamas controlled Health Ministry but local journalists uh journalists have confirmed the uh report elag gazi is a huge Refugee site in the central part of Gaza but Israel has also intensified its military campaign in all other parts of the strip there are reports that uh more than 160 people have died over the weekend uh uh journalists on the ground describe horrible scenes of uh panicking families and once again completely overwhelmed medical facilities and Yan Philip you were in Bethlehem yesterday where as many of our viewers know for centuries Christian pilgrims usually celebrate the birth of of Jesus but this year no no celebrations why is that uh representative from all churches said it's impossible to celebrate at the moment with all the destruction around and indeed it was a very very Grim atmosphere no tourists no lights no big Christmas tree no children buying candy uh from Street vendors the marching band that usually accompanies the legend patriarch with joyful music uh passed by in in complete silence which was really a very uh intensive scene and um Everybody agreed it's impossible to celebrate the only installation was a nativity scene that showed Jesus being born in the middle of Destruction and rubble and just to I imagine that must have been an incredibly moving thing to to see but to step back to the look at the bigger picture of this conflict reports were hearing that the Israeli is maybe thinking of stopping or slowing their military campaign are they founded reports what are you hearing well what is sure is that the United States have once again increased pressure on Israel uh to what they say carry out more targeted attacks President Biden stressed once again the importance to protect civilians and there are local media reports regarding a new proposal from uh Egypt uh the Israeli government is discussing this proposal at the moment um according to local media sources uh it contains several steps uh including uh temporary Truth uh then the release of more hostages and new peace negotiations but at the same time prime minister netan once again stressed that Israel will carry on the war until the complete destruction of Hamas however long it will take all right DW's Yan Philip Schultz in Jerusalem and we're going to talk live now to the who official we just saw in that report it's Shan Casey who is the emergency medical team coordinator who is joining us from Rafa now thank you Sean um we just watched you there visiting the biggest medical complex in Gaza the alifa hospital tell us more about what was going on there when you visited thanks so this was my third visit to Ala in in about a week and what I've seen is uh a similar situation in the emergency department with just hundreds of patients streaming in pretty constantly patients being rolled in on stretchers along the street uh patients being carried in by their family members being brought in on Donkey carts um and even on trolleys uh hundreds and patients on Journeys on the floor uh family members desperately crying out for assistance and a very very small team of doctors and nurses only five or six doctors five or six nurses and some volunteers from the community some paramedics medical students nursing students uh trying to care for these patients but it's absolute chaos and absolute misery um and and what makes it even more challenging is that the hospital itself has been directly struck and there are 50,000 I was told when I was there two days ago 50,000 displaced persons living in the hospital building so I walked across the surgical Ward uh you can see the dark stairways that we went up and down there are people everywhere living in the stairwells living in the operating theaters um the whole building is occupied because people view it as a one of the few safer spaces there's no safe place in Gaza not anywhere in Gaza at the moment um but it's it's considered one of the safest so it's extremely crowded it's extremely full we delivered some medical supplies uh some fuel uh we have a team going up again uh tomorrow to deliver more fuel uh and to establish some some kitchens with World Central Kitchen to hopefully be able to provide food for patients and staff uh but what we've also seen is uh a rising level of desperation um really people's dignity has been stolen uh they are just crying out for food and water um desperate for assistance that's very slow to come uh so it's it's a it's a really disheartening and sad situation well let me just ask you a question about something we can't see in those pictures but that you talk about in your report which is the risk of infectious dis diseases uh how dangerous is it to have all those people gathered in the hospital area in a situation where I guess the drinking water is hard to come by How concerned are you about a major infectious disease outbreak we're very concerned about the possibility of an outbreak I mean what we see in all of these videos and it's very obvious is a lot of trauma right a lot of gunshot wounds blast injuries people bleeding with broken limbs burn cases and things like that but behind the scenes what you maybe don't see as uh in such a shocking way is the cap settings um even just behind me in this building if you look out the window there's thousands of people living in makeshift shelters um that are planks of wood with plastic tarpine over them in the hospital there's 50,000 people crammed into a building there isn't enough water actually most of the groundw here in Gaza is salty uh so much of the water isn't actually pable uh and so there's no sanitation facilities uh in many of these spontaneous uh camps or shelters and so we have serious concerns about the risk of communicable disease infectious disease and as well I mean people who need routine care pregnant women who need anti-al care people with diabetes people with chronic conditions they're not getting access to services in most of Gaza right now about 80% of the health system is not functioning can ium very minimal on what you were saying about new mothers um who have had well I guess The Misfortune to be giving birth during a war we understand there's um problems getting well breastfeeding um there there's there's not powdered milk there's a risk of malnutrition is that the case is that a concern how do you help these people absolutely absolutely I mean there's there there's nobody that I've met in the hospitals of Gaza or in the streets of Gaza who hasn't told me about the need for food and water that they're hungry that their children are hungry um that they they can't find food but they don't have money to buy food if it's available there are some places actually where food is being sold but nobody has money to buy it um people you know when there's food trucks that uh are able to get through uh they are offloaded by desperate crowds almost instantly um so the level of desperation is enormous and for pregnant women and and and young babies it's even more acute and real quick if you don't mind uh as you know the security Council uh voted to allow in some more humanitarian Aid is it anywhere near enough so there's two sides to this one is getting more Aid into Gaza so across the Rafa Crossing through Kem Shalom uh across the Crossing into Gaza the Gaza Strip then there's the other challenge which is getting it to the last mile so getting it to the people who need it the most particularly you know now we've got about a million Place persons in Rafa in the southern part of Gaza there's increased hostilities in the area just north of here in communis um and in the middle area uh there's there's lots of active fighting so it's very difficult the road conditions are awful every time we do a convoy to the north we have have punctures we have check we have delays and the people who are getting the AIDS are the people who are able to rush the trucks actually so people with disabilities and older people have even more difficulties facing that it's it's it's very difficult to to get to that last smile understood well thank you for your time and your good work Sean Casey The Who emergency team coordinator in Rafa Gaza thank you and sticking with that story let's go now to hea Tibi who is the country director for the NGO care in the Palestinian territories and is joining us from rala um tell me is your organization able to provide any relief to people in Gaza at the moment good morning dear and uh um it's a very hard time but still there are uh possibilities of interventions and actions de delivery of Aid in the south of Gaza but not in the North my colleagues coordinate with wh with other un agencies other International organizations and humanitarian organizations very limited quantities of interventions for instance care is focusing on medical supplies and hygiene kits and this is what we continue to do but again very limited amount and and quantities to hospitals and to people and just in terms of what the International Community the world Community is doing the United Nations security Council passed a resolution to boost more Aid and 120 trucks I hear Yesterday entered Gaza on Sunday is that enough to change things it is it is good change the increase in the number of trucks entering Gaza is good but if you can imagine thate before the war the number was higher part of it would be commercial part of it would be humanitarian all of Gaza now is under humanitarian need uh I'm pretty sure that you heard about the uh food security report that was released uh last week late last week that shows that Gaza is is now having between the highest stages uh a catastrophic famine stage uh whereas the numbers that are coming from Gaza are almost three times higher than any previously implemented assessments carried out by the same tool that was used unfortunately that gives an a an Insight of the number of people who are starving who are unfortunately dehydrating couple of weeks ago we said we are very afraid to reach that situation we arrived it 120 trucks don't include only food or water But it includes everything so you can imagine how much this is limited compared to the number of people in need and mind you we are talking mainly about the south in the north the numbers are extremely uh um the families are living very harsh conditions worse even than the South because of the very very limited eight assistance that enters to the north and a final quick question if I may you mentioned people starving we've reports of K children losing the actual will to thrive the keenness to eat they stop speaking or eating because of the immense psychological trauma are you worried about that how can you help those kids this is one of the hardest questions that you asked me and it feels very harsh because we have seen this unfortunately this is happening to one of my colleagues children and everyone is trying to help they are trying but it's it's impossible we feel traumatized with what we are seeing on the on the screens and living it for 80 days almost now is something that is very very worrying one of the the major areas of intervention after War when ceasefire is attained is going to be psychological support to help people survive not forget but survive what they have gone through unfortunately okay Hiba Tibi thank you so much for sharing your insights country director of NGO car and you and with the war raging in Gaza Pope Francis has appealed for peace in a solemn Christmas Eve Mass at the Vatican the pontiff made numerous references to violence and War during his address in St Peter's Basilica without directly naming Israel or Gaza Francis said Hearts around the world were in bethleem he'll lead traditional Christmas Day prayers later on Monday morning
