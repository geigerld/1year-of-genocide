now tensions between Israel and Iran have turned the spotlight on teran's nuclear capabilities the West accuses Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons which it denies Isfahan is at the heart of Iran's nuclear program this conversion plant is located outside the city powered by three Chinese supplied research reactors it produces fuel for Iran's civilian nuclear program these images were shot in March 2005 one of a rare occasions the world got to see inside deep underground in The Wider province of Isfahan is vetan uranium enrichment facility Western Nations say Iran is operating a secret weapons program here Tano denies it is developing a nuclear bomb in 15 after long negotiations Western Nations struck a deal with Iran to stop it becoming a nuclear power Tran got relief from sanctions in return for accepting limits on its nuclear activities with courage political will mutual respect and Leadership we delivered on what the world was hoping for the following year a new president moved into the White House in 2018 he made good on one of his election promises I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal without us participation the agreement quickly unraveled Iranian Engineers got back to work and progress has been Swift the UN nuclear Watchdog says Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons grade levels these facilities are attempting targets for opponents of the Iranian regime in 2010 a computer virus crippled operations at nans no one has ever accepted responsibility but many believe a virus was developed by the US and Israel nans was again the Target in 2021 for power went out here setting enrichment back by months Iran called it an act of nuclear sabotage and blamed Israel back in the present day footage claimed to have been shot at the Isfahan facility Tran says the site here is safe and and damaged following Israel's strike all right let's get more from Rafael grai he's director general of the international atomic energy agency the iaea welcome to DW Mr grai how close would you say is uh Iran to producing an operational nuclear bomb well uh here I think we have to clarify something uh there is a normal assumption when when we talk about uh break through times and and how close or how far the country can be uh to assimilate uh that metric with the amount of time required to have the ne the necessary amount of enriched uranium which is at the moment uh estimated assessed as As a matter of weeks rather than months uh but that does not mean that Iran has or would have a nuclear weapon in that space of time and I think that is a important clarification to be to be made um a functional like you say a functional nuclear warhead requires many other things independently from the production of the f iile material in this case the uranium including perhaps being being tested so while we say that the situation is uh is a situation that warrants our alert because of the enrichment at almost military levels um we cannot be deriving from that the direct conclusion that Iran has now a nuclear weapon but why would Iran be enrich ing uranium to near Military levels if it doesn't want to produce a nuclear weapon well that is a fair question and it's a question that many are asking at the same time Mo motivations or um objectives or goals are a matter of of of speculation and Iran of course the public line is that they want this material for medical or rather civilian purposes is not very clear why these amounts and at this speed need and at that level would be required from that but since that is not technically impossible this cannot be uh argued back uh but what is clear and what I have been telling my Iranian counterparts time and again is that of course this activity raises eyebrows and um compounded with the fact that we are not getting the necessary degree of access and visibility that I believe should be necessary so when you put all of that together then of course you end up with lots of question marks so if you're not getting the level of uh access that you would ideally like to have it could be the case that as we are talking right now Iran is effectively developing a nuclear weapon and you would not know about it well I I wouldn't be so sure about that what may be happening is that uh Iran could be you know producing uh parts for centrifuges uh and other ancillary equipment of this of this type which would of course have a repercussion in their in their General capabilities but I cannot uh be speculating about that we do not have any information of that type that there is because this is what you're pointing at that there is an active nuclear weapon program as we speak that would be incorrect that would that would be misleading that being said um there are doubts Iran has not clarified a number of findings the agency made in Iran about activities for example taking place in in in places on sites that were not supposed to be nuclear sites so we have a number of questions why did we find traces of enrich uranium in places that are now a farm or a parking lot what was there where is it now so these questions and at the same time at the same time we have lost and your introduction was very graphic in that regard we lost after this famous 2015 agreement the jcpoa was abandoned uh we have lost a number of um accesses and visibility and monitoring that for us is is very important and this has been at the center of this dialogue that I have been and I am still trying to conduct with Iran right I'm trying to understand the risk uh that all of this poses to the world essentially and this is where the Israel Hamas War comes in because this as you've seen has increased tensions between Israel and Iran do you think that the longer this war goes on the greater the risk that Israel could potentially attack Iran's nuclear facilities well I I I I hope hope not I have said a few days ago in the context of another conflict we are dealing with which is the one in Ukraine and referring at the security Council to the situation in saporia that uh you know attacking nuclear facilities is an absolute no go um it it is contrary to international law by the way but um it is something that is completely unacceptable and on top of that what we see is a tendency a very warison tendency really um of many not only the Iranians but others as well to brandish the Menace of attacking nuclear facilities or even dropping nuclear weapons as it happened with with Gaza as you remember in the beginning of the conflict so I believe that this this normalization of talk about nuclear weapons dropping nuclear weapons getting nuclear weapons is absolutely deplorable we have something that is called the nuclear nonproliferation regime which may not be perfect granted but it has um allowed uh us for the past 70 years almost to um avoid nuclear war and to avoid situations that will be completely out of control and we are getting closer to a situation where this could happen if we start um sapping the the nonproliferation regime in this irresponsible way now Mr grai at the at the weekend it was reported that behind the scenes Iran is in contact with the United States to resume nuclear negotiations can you confirm this well I think there are some contacts and and it's perhaps it's a question for the United States and not for me or for Iran uh what we uh are always trying to promote is dialogue we hope this dialogue takes place uh and what we are interested what I am interested in is the dialogue between us the Ia and Iran because there are many things that need to be to be clarified and it is for this that we are going to be traveling to tan soon and what will you be what is the message you'll be bringing uh to Teran with you because so far in this conversation it appears that the Iranians aren't being absolutely as honest as you would like them to be which leads me to wonder what is the message you bring to them well you use the world honest which is perhaps too much for me to get into this area what I would say is that Iran should cooperate more and this is this is clear so more than a message I will be there to try to put these things back on track if they want to be believed and I don't have a problem with that because we don't have an an anti anti-iranian agenda but what we say is we we we need to verify we need to be able to have unfettered access we need to have the possibility to see what we need to see if they don't have anything to hide as they say so vly why they are not cooperating with us in the way they should so this more than a message will be I hope I sincerely hope will be a serious conversation to put things back on track because we are not on track as we should at this moment we'll leave it there for the time being but thank you so much for joining us today Rafael crosy director general of the international atomic energy agency thank you so much thank you very much
