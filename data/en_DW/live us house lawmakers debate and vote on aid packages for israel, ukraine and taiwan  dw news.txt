the amendment amendment number one printed in part e of house report number 11846 offered by Mr Jimenez of Florida pursuant to house resolution 1160 the gentleman from Florida Mr Jimenez and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida Madam chairman I yield myself uh such time as I may consume the gentleman is recognized thank you madam chair be it through technology transfers or Monet monetary Investments we must stop funding our own destruction through tacid support of the pla's technological advancement this amendment requires that the annual China military power report to provide an assessment of the prc's developments and critical and Emer emerging Technologies relevant to any advancement of the P pla capabilities any involvement in the ccp's Civil military Fusion program or any involvement in the development of the ccp's state surveillance initiatives this amendment also calls on the Department of Defense Department of State and other in agency partners to list all Chinese companies involved in the development of this critical technology and determine if any us technology components are used by these companies or if any US capital is invested in these companies this is critical information to have American dollars and Ingenuity should not be building the ccp's Techno to totalitarian surveillance State and should not be funding its gross human rights abuses we must recognize the risk of support for entities involved in X's civil military Fusion program and understand why any technological development made in China on the Civil side instantly goes to support military advancements right now Americans usually unwillingly are funding the people's Liberation Army paying for things like aircraft carriers fighter jets artillery shells and facilitating a mass surveillance and oppression of the Chinese people I think the bottom line from my perspective is that the CCP is an adversary and you don't defeat an adversary or deter an adversary by shoveling billions of dollars into their military and Technology programs every time we allow this to happen we are closing the capability gap between our military and the pla giving the upper hand to our greatest adversary the only country with the intent will and capability to reshape the international order and that's China I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and with that I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from Florida reserves the balance of his time does anyone wish to speak uh in opposition to the amendment the gentleman from Florida is recognized I would like not now to uh to yield two minutes uh to the uh gentleman from Illinois the the ranking member of the select committee on the CCP Mr chrish Chris gentleman from illino the gentleman from Illinois is recognized for two minutes close enough Carlos thank you I rise in strong support of this amendment which requires the China military power report which the Department of Defense puts out each year to include a new section on the prc's development of critical and emerging Technologies through its military civil Fusion strategy the CCP has effectively combined its civilian and Military sectors meaning that American Investment into China often Finds Its way into the hands of the people's Liberation Army we simply cannot allow this to happen by tracking the prc's development of critical Technologies as well as any American support for these efforts this amendment will help prevent the power of American innovation and financing from fueling the continued growth of China's military power I urge strong support and yield back the gentleman from Illinois yields back the gentleman from Florida is recognized you have one minute remaining uh Madam chairman I yeld 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas the chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee Mr McCall all thank the gentleman for his amendment I support this amendment I believe it will greatly enhance the department of defense's China military report by increasing our understanding of critical and emerging technology sectors which is the central feature of the Great power competition that we have with China and I thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment and I yeld back the gentleman from from Florida has one minute remaining thank you madam chair and uh in closing the PRC is the only competitor with the intent the will and the capability to reshape the international order we must stop fueling our own demise with that I urge support of this amendment and I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman you back those in um the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida those in favor say I I those oppose say no in the opinion chair the eyes have it the amendment is agreed to it is now in order to consider amendment number two printed in part e of house report 11 18- 466 for what purpose does the gentleman from Iowa seek recognition Madam chair I have an amendment at the desk the clerk will designate the amendment amendment number two printed in part e of house report number 11 18-4 66 offered by Mr nun of Iowa pursuant to house resolution 1160 the gentleman from Iowa Mr nun and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa thank you madam chair I yield myself as much time as I may consume the gentleman's recognized Iran is the largest sponsor of State terrorism their tactics of Terror know no bounds and they will stop at nothing to destroy our strongest allies in the Middle East indeed a week ago today we saw them unleash a barrage of weapons intended to kill thousands Christians Jews Muslims no discretion in between but for a 99% repulse rate by Israel America and our allies we stood firm this is in the kinetic world as an Air Force officer we've done this many times but we must also combat terrorism at its source its funding as a Counter Intelligence officer I Know The Enemy must be fought on the battlefield but behind the scenes we must also commit to crippling them with their lack of ability to gain financial services that they then Supply the funding for Hamas Hezbollah houthi Rebels and the irgc my Amendment will require the US government to diligently review all of Iranian assets above $5 million to accurately understand where their funding is coming from where it is going and who is benefiting from it right now Congress lacks critical information surrounding us treasury's non-enforcement of current sanctions that allowed more than $80 billion incit oil sales alone to come into the country and this amendment requires transparency so Congress and the American people never have to hear about billions potentially being transferred to Iran through the press and not through this Administration this amendment also gives Congress knowledge that we require to effectively ensure oversight and draft targeted legislation to ensure the Iranian regime doesn't have access to the funds necessary for it to finance Terror finally this amendment holds Iran accountable for their direct funding of terrorism ensuring that Iran does not have access to the financial assets to enable their reign of terror throughout the Middle East and to those right here in the United States I urge my colleagues to support this amendment Congress must be aware of Treasury Department's relaxation and non- enforcement of current sanctions on Iran today and this amendment should be implemented immediately thank you madam chair and I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from Iowa reserves for what purpose does the gentleman from New York seek recognition I Rise to claim time and opposition to this amendment the gentleman is recognized for five minutes the treasury Department opposes this amendment because they believe the reporting time is so so short and the requirements are so honorous they believe it's so honorous that they will have to pull people away from doing the important work on finding illicit actors that should be sanctioned and make them work on this report there is also concerns about bus business confidentiality here and I'm guessing if there were more time we could make changes in this bill we could work together to make it more workable and strike a deal here but given that this is up or down vote on the floor for an amendment now I must oppose with that I yield back the balance of my time back the gentleman from Iowa has recognized thank you madam chair I appreciate the gentleman's comments I would State the Constitution establishes Congress as a co-equal branch time delays alone cannot be the reason to not move forward immediately and with that I would yield my time for 30 seconds to the chairman uh Mike McCall from Texas for his great work in defending Israel and supporting a sanction regime in Iran I think the gentleman from Iowa for gent gentleman from Texas is recognized thank you madam chair I I I I thank the gentleman from Iowa for this amendment and I support this amendment it enhances congressional oversight as you talked about under article one we have a responsibility over restricted Iranian assets and accounts including those in Qatar and Iraq for too long the sub Administration has not been transparent with the Congress and the American people about sanctions uh and the like and and reporting that to Congress so I think this is a good step forward and I yield back the uh gentleman uh from New York the gentleman from Iowa was recognized thank you madam chair I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from the great state of Arkansas Mr French Hill gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for thank you madam chair thank you Mr nun thank you chairman McCall b stand in support of this amendment we have to counter Iran's illicit use of funds any way we can to stop their reign of terror and their attack on our Ally Israel key to that is stopping their evasion of sanctions These funds go directly to attacking our friends and partners and Iran uses new and creative ways to do that this amendment from Congressman nun ensures that we're stopping funds at The Source by instructing the treasury to examine the source and benefactor of all Iranian assets over $5 million I stand in report and I stand in support of the underlying bill I yield back gent back the gentleman from Iowa is

I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of Representative nuns legislation the revoke Iranian funding act that this came out of in the wake of the appalling terrorist attack against Israel it's clear that we must work to confront Iran and its surrogates in the region with a strong sanctions regime Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world spending its money on terror on developing nuclear capabilities on taking hostages to use for bargaining purposes and on funding the criminal irgc among other Provisions this Common Sense measure would provide transparency on which sanctions authorities the president is failing to exercise and where we can continue to cut off Iran's funding I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment I yield back the gentleman's time time has expired the you madam chair I recognize my colleague and Wing Commander Mr Don Bacon from Nebraska for 30 seconds the gentleman's recognize I stand in support of this amendment we have to be clear I Iran is our adversary they've killed 609 Americans in Iraq they've fueled and energized or armed the Hamas that conducted the attacks of the 7 October they armed the hasbalah they armed the houthis we should go after all of their assets we should choke every dollar that we can cuz dollar they have fuels terrorism I stand in support of Zack dun's Amendment thank you the gentleman from Iowa is recognized for 45 seconds thank you madam chair today we stand at a Crossroads on a precipice the result is the effect of an Iranian regime that is directly threatening not just our allies in the Middle East but has access to funds that directly threaten us and so while I respect my colleagues on the other side of the island I would ask that they come forward at this important juncture to make sure that these funds are restricted from the use of terrorism that flows directly to harm those American soldiers who lost their lives just months ago fellow veterans and combatant arms I thank the

needed military assistance to Israel and Ukraine during their time of Crisis we'll Provide support for Taiwan as it confronts aggression from the Chinese Communist party and will provide support for the US military forces operating in Europe the Middle East and Asia including the critical replenishment of American stocks of ammunition America's greatest writer Mark Twain is reputed to have said that history does not repeat itself but it does sometimes rhyme tragically the past two years have produced Echoes of a dark time in world history the 1930s in the 1930s evil regimes bent on aggression domination and even genocide took their first steps down a dark road that would eventually lead to World War tragically the Democratic West turned inward then standing idly by while fascist regimes began to take aggressive actions against their weaker neighbors there was time then to put a stop to aggression if only we had had the fortitude and the wherewithal to stand firmly on the side of Freedom today we're seeing uncomfortable parallels to that dark time in Europe Vladimir Putin launched an unjust and illegal invasion of his Democratic neighbor Ukraine in Asia and the Pacific the Chinese Communist party encroaches on its neighbors and openly threatens the continued self-determination of Taiwan a nation which continues to show the world what a free and Democratic China could look like and in the Middle East Israel faces attacks on multiple fronts beginning with the horrible terror attack launched by Hamas on October 7th and continuing with an unprecedented direct aerial assault launch by the Iranian regime over the weekend these events do not take place in a vacuum Madam speaker they take place in regions around the world critical to American National Security they threaten our friends and partners around the globe and threaten the continued safety of democracy the security of our fellow Democratic states is our security and protecting their security is undoubtedly in America's national interest some of the greatest American leaders are the 20th century recognized his fundamental reality I think of Franklin Roosevelt calling on America to become the great arsenal of democracy to defeat Nazi Germany and I think of Ronald Reagan reminding us that the preservation of a peaceful free and Democratic Europe is essential to the preservation of a peaceful free and Democratic United States Madam speaker peace through strength cannot be delivered through appeasement we cannot wish our way to National security and we cannot thrust our heads into the sand while aggressive Nations threaten their neighbors today's measure is not only about safeguarding the ideals of democracy and peace but it's also Central to our own National Security the actions we take today will be seen and heard around the world Vladimir Putin is watching xiin ping is watching the Iranian mulls are watching what will we show them will we show them that our commitment to security does not stop at the water's edge will we show them that we know that the security of our friends and our partners around the globe is our security or will we fail to take action and in doing so give these Powers the same gift we gave to the fascist powers in the 1930s I know which I would choose I know what I would show our adversaries these tyrants and dictators that just as in Ronald Reagan's time the United States stand committed to the common defense that our commitment to our friends and partners stands both now and into the future I urge all members to support the bill and I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from Oklahoma reserve the G woman from Conneticut is recognized Madam speaker I rise in strong support of the indopacific Security Supplemental Appropriations act which will provide our allies in the Indo Pacific region with the support they need to cter China's aggressive and adversarial posture the post-world war order us leadership and our historic and strong allyship with Japan Taiwan South Korea and the Philippines have created enduring peace and prosperity for much of the region retreating from Asia under the guise of putting quote America First would be a colossal mistake and would yield the fate of democracy and freedom in the Western Pacific to the whims of an autocratic communist government of the People's Republic of China China is expanding its military capabilities at a rapid pace and is using its influence to suppress the centers we have already seen rollbacks of once's Ironclad rights and freedoms in places like Hong Kong this bill provides $3.9 billion to support Taiwan and other allies and to replenish our own equipment stock as well as $3.3 billion for the Aus trilateral security partnership the world is watching and waiting to see if the America that they know is ready to stand for freedom and democracy and against tyranny it is up to us to show them that America their trusted Ally is right here and that we have their back we must demonstrate that our word can be counted on J is watching our friends in Taiwan Japan Korea and the Philippines are watching I reserve the balance of my

Housing and Urban Development of the Appropriations Committee Mr walmac for four minutes the gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for 4 minutes Madam speaker preserving the safety security and prosperity of our nation is arguably our most important duty there's a new axis of Evil On The Rise around the world and just like the terrible original this group is bound together by their desire to subjugate their people and Destroy freedom and democracy all around the world they want to end American leadership and prosperity the second half of the 20th century was the most prosperous in our nation and that Prosperity was underpinned by relative peace increasing our strength and the strength of our allies is the only Avenue to peace and this package does just that I want to thank speaker Mike Johnson for his courage and his leadership and my good friends chairman Cole chairman Calbert and chairman Diaz Bard for putting this package together together and putting it on the floor Madam speaker I was in the Army National Guard for over 30 years and a significant part of that time was spent training to fight and win against the Red Army in the F to Gap well there's a new Red Army today and they're inching closer to Central Europe but this time we have a democratic country in Eastern Europe in their way all they need are weapons and training and that that's among the bills in the package that we provide today that this body will vote on without this package Putin will continue his March of death and destruction without this package our own Army will have to cancel Combat Training Center rotations the training events that keep our forces the greatest in the Free World and during those 30 years I was deployed with my Battalion to the Sinai in Egypt and standing on the Egyptian side of the Rafa Crossing I saw first and the death and destruction of Hamas I also saw our greatest Ally in the region Israel defending itself this package today proves or provides Israel the tools it needs to destroy terrorists killing and capturing and raping its citizens our friends need our help and without this package our Navy our Navy will be without critical air defense Munitions required to protect our sailors these air defense assets enable and the control of our seas another dictator is marshalling his resources and planning to upend the free and open indopacific region that has contributed so much to American Prosperity this package makes important investments in our defense capabilities to deter this aggression without it we will produce fewer submarines we will produce fewer anti-ship missiles and underfund the requirements of our commanders in the region and Madame speaker AR canons are at the Forefront of producing the critical Munitions from tomahawk missiles to standard missiles to Naval Strike missiles all funded in this package yes Arkansas like many other states is the forge of the arsenal of democracy so today's vote seems pretty simple to me

Supplemental bills and the fourth bill that is full of strong conservative policy priorities as we stand here today a strategic military troa of evil sits Over the Horizon marching towards the destruction of the values that we and our Democratic allies hold so dear we can either turn our heads away and hope to appease this great evil or we can stand with our allies and confront this nefarious Scourge history has taught us that appeasement does not work and it was attempted not that long ago through the failed obam Clinton reset with the Communist KGB Thug Putin that Administration believed that Putin Putin could be uh satiated with Georgia and Crimea they were wrong and today Putin's appetite has only grown now he wants all of Ukraine tomorrow mova the baltics Poland Madame chair history repeats itself I'm remind that reminded that in 1947 Congress provided military and economic support for Greece and Turkey keeping them out of the hands of the Soviet Union and today this Congress has the chance to do the same by supporting these bills that confront the troa and fully fund our security commitments to support Israel Taiwan and Ukraine which are confronting existential challenges to their very existence the only way to stand up to Putin and others like him in the words of Ronald Reagan is peace through strength that is why every that is what every member voting yes on these bills is standing for today this bill supports that principle two-thirds of which will be spent here at home through investments in the US defense industrial base to replenish our military equipment the supplemental also provides critical security assistance to help ensure that Ukraine has the training and weapons it needs to stop Putin such as traditional artillery rounds and air defense systems please take note of this this bill requires a clear strategy from the administration that defines and prioritizes US National Security interests in Ukraine it also includes unprecedented oversight and accountability requirements including robust funding for our Inspector General and end use monitoring of us defense transfers also also economic assistance to Ukraine is subject to extensive extensive burden sharing and transparency requirements including the unprecedented cost matching by our European and other allies Madam chair in addition for the first time ever this bill requires that the funding we provide to Ukraine for economic assistance be subjected to repayment to the United States of America in some Madame chairwoman this is a critical bill

Munitions to fight back against tyranny against Putin's tyranny Vladimir Putin's greed aggression and unyielding pursuit of power have led to Grievous loss of life and humanitarian Devastation the cruelty against innocent civilians at the hands of Putin and his crings is devastating and we know very well that Russia's invasion is not only a threat to Ukraine's physical security but also a threat to the very core of Ukrainian and Global democracy Putin is betting that he can Outlast the will and the determination of Ukraine the United States and other Western allies some in this body seem inclined to prove him right we must prove him definitively wrong it is completely misguided it's an affront to our nation's history and our heritage to suggest that we would put be putting America First by retreating from the world stage we put America First by demonstrating the power of American leadership that we have the strength and the resolve and the heart to fight for the most vulnerable people protect their freedom and preserve their dignity this bill will provide $14 billion for the training equipment weapons Logistics support intelligence and other supplies and resources to support Ukraine's military it will provide nearly the same amount for us the United States to replenish our own equipment stocks it also provides $9.5 billion in forgivable loans to support the Ukrainian economy and 20.5 billion for the US Armed Forces to assist in Ukraine with Mission support intelligence support pay equipment and other resources if Ukraine does not receive this support which it requires and needs to defeat Russia's outrageous assault on its Sovereign territory the legacy of this Congress will be be the appeasement of a dictator destruction of an Allied nation and a fractured Europe gone will be the post-war order that has kept Europe free and prosperous gone will be our credibility in the eyes of our allies and our adversaries and gone will be the America that promised to stand up for Freedom democracy and human rights wherever they are threatened or wherever they are un under attack our allies are facing existential threats and our friends and foes around

America for leadership and asking do we still stand behind our belief in democracy and our we the world power that we Acclaim at this moment we have the opportunity to stand for democracy and for world order with no drop of Bloodshed by American troops without our help a democracy is certain to fall to a murderous Marxist socialist dictator I recently toured Ukraine my eyes have witnessed the remnants of the barbaric unadulterated terrorism that's taking place there and my ears have heard the numerous testimonies of the unthinkable acts by the Russian army Putin through his words and his actions have made clear that our world's security our nation's security is at risk Ronald Reagan also said there is sin and evil in the world and we're enjoined by scripture and the Lord Jesus to

behind America's national security priorities to get us to this point Madam speaker I rise today in strong support of the legislative package that is before the Congress for months the National Security priorities of the American people has been obstructed by protin extremists determined to let Russia win a bipartisan Coalition of Democrats and Republicans has risen up to work together and ensure that we are getting the National Security legislation important to the American people over the Finish Line house Democrats have risen to the occasion President Joe Biden has risen to the occasion traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion we have a responsibility not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans to do what is necessary to defend democracy wherever it is at risk and the best interests of the Free World that is what this legislation represents we have a responsibility to push back against tyranny we have a responsibility to push back against totalitarianism we have a responsibility to push Back Against Terror and we have a responsibility to stand with our Democratic allies throughout the world Israel is a democratic Ally Ukraine is a democratic Ally South Korea is a democratic Ally Taiwan is a democratic Ally Japan is a democratic Ally we have a responsibility to stand with our Democratic allies throughout the world we also have a responsibility to push back against our adversaries Russia is not our friend the Chinese Communist party is not our friend Iran is not our friend we have a special relationship that exists between the United States and Israel it's a relationship that is anchored in shared values and shared interests our commitment to Israel's security is Ironclad Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish and Democratic State and safe haven for the Jewish people who have faced centuries of persecution throughout the years the events of October 7th make clear that Hamas must be decisively defeated for the good of Israel for the good of the Palestinian people for the good of Peace in the Middle East for the good of the Free World Hamas must be decisively defeated at the same time there are other urgent priorities we must do everything possible to make sure that we are freeing the hostages so they can safely return to their families and do everything possible to Surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza so we can help out Palestinian civilians who are In Harm's Way Through no fault of their own we must surge in food surge in medicine surge in humanitarian assistance that is what this package will help accomplish with more than billion doar in humanitarian assistance the events of October 7th and the suffering of Palestinian civilians in the theater of war are heartbreaking any person of Goodwill should come to the conclusion that we have to find a way to achieve a just and Lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian people and the only way for that to happen is for us to truly commit to a two-state solution when the moment presents itself with a safe and secure Israel living side by side in peace and prosperity with a demilitarized Palestinian state that provides dignity self-determination for the Palestinian people let us recommit to accomplishing that objective the humanitarian assistance in this legislative package will also allow the United States to be there to support people who are suffering all across the world including millions in Haiti and millions in the Sudan dealing with famine and starvation in a war torn environment this legis of course will allow us to stand with our allies in the Indo Pacific in the face of continued aggression from the Chinese Communist party to make sure that freedom and democracy and these values all across the world will continue to be triumphant this legislation will allow us to support the bravery and the the courage of the Ukrainian people who Against All Odds continue to stand for what we as Americans believe in in February of 2022 we were told that Ukraine would likely Fall in a week and that Russian troops would be in ke in a week but The Bravery the courage the resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of the most powerful military in Europe has proven to be consequential in partnership with American support and that of our NATO allies but the Ukrainian people have taught us something that in the face of an incredible military apparatus that they were confronting Against All Odds that when a people believe in Freedom or Liberty or democracy that can overcome even the mightiest of militaries and so we've seen them despite the prediction that they would fall in a week inflict more than 300,000 casualties on the Russian military significant portions of the Russian Navy wiped out in the Black Sea more than half the territory that had initially been seized by the Russian military recaptured by Ukraine Against All Odds but the protin obstruction that has stopped this National Security legislation from advancing to the floor until this point risks all of the progress that has been made which is why it's so essential for us to do what is necessary to stand with the Ukrainian people let me close with this observation that this is a moment to choose this is a moment to choose we can choose democracy or autocracy we can choose Freedom or tyranny we can choose truth or propaganda we can choose Ukraine or Russia we can choose zalinski or Putin we can choose a democratic Ally or a sworn enemy this is a time to choose the American people have always stood on the side of democracy and freedom and Truth which is why we must stand on the side of the Ukrainian people we will stand with the Ukrainian people today we will stand with the Ukrainian people tomorrow we will stand with the Ukrainian people until Victory is won [Applause] the chair will remind all persons in the gallery that they are here as guests of the house and that any manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings and is in violation of the rules of the house gentleman from Florida is recognized like to yield one minute uh for the gentleman from Florida M Waltz Mr Speaker my colleagues and I have led the charge on stopping Putin in the face of Biden's too little too late strategy but before we go any further we have asked for four simple things a

half years into this war we still don't know what success looks like is it Crimea is it all the dboss is it hold what you got we don't know because President Biden won't tell us and the American people we must close the US border and defend it as a matter of first principle it's not an either or but it is a matter of priorities we hear the EU and NATO are doing all it can baloney they can't do more because only 11 only 11 out of 31 are contributing the bare minimum uh to its defense and if they won't do it now Mr Speaker then we'll when will they and most offensive if we drive down the price of oil below $50 a barrel Putin's war machine is done I can no longer in good conscience Mr Speaker ask the American people to dig deeper behind a blank check behind bad St policy we just can't afford it anymore gentl time expired the general lady from Connecticut is recognized chair I yield two minutes to the gentle woman from Ohio the ranking member of the energy and water subcommittee

the job for those who may naively think America can sit on the sidelines and seek isolation please know this old adage if you take no interest in foreign affairs Foreign Affairs will find you recall Pearl Harbor December 7th 1941 83 years ago the United States caught in a stuper of isolationism closed its eyes as the rest of the world fed into deep conflict there is no killing field on earth like Ukraine Millions upon Millions upon millions of innocent people have died at the hands of deadly dictators Lenin Stalin and now Putin if Putin is permitted to conquer Ukraine he will will not stop there he's promised that support from the American people will ensure victory for Ukraine with the Free World giring Liberty Shield recall the ancient words of Ukraine's poet laurate taras shenko who

working together in a new axis of Evil to harm our alliances and undermine our national security nowhere is this more important or apparent than in Ukraine China North Korea and Iran are eagerly aiding and aeing Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine because they know a Russian Victory there will seriously undercut American credibility and deterrence and leave our allies exposed a Russian Victory will emboden Kim Z and the ayatolla to confront South Korea Taiwan Israel and ultimately the United States in a new and in fatal ways and I fear Putin will use victory in Ukraine as a springboard to invade Eastern Europe we can't let that happen we must restore restore American deterrence that starts by passing security supplementals with that J from Florida reserves the general lady from

organizations funded by the United States who facing danger and violence are supporting refugees vulnerable people women and children I was deeply moved by their stories and their commitment the

more if the United States continues to fund this effort the EU will not muster the political will to do what they should yes Russia is a strategic adversary of America but it is a bigger threat to our European allies NATO Nations now many are not doing the required 2% of GDP on defense Europe must act with greater urgency we've heard a lot about Church Hill and Chamberlain if may I point out

Ukrainian citizens on a daily basis the Ukraine military faces a severe shortage of ammunition ammunition to protect their citizens and their sovereignty and why because for months this house has remained silent but today that changes today we will pass this legislation we will provide security and economic assistance to Ukraine we will replenish depleted stocks of us equipment here at home and we will join and show the Baltic Nations Romania and Poland that we stand with them along with our European and NATO allies together we will support the Ukrainian people in their Fight For Freedom we will make it clear to author authoritarian nations in America will always stand up for democracy here at home and around the world I urge my colleagues to support these bills and I yield back Mr

they have used Ukrainian civilians as human Shields they've committed horrible acts of sexual violence and they have abducted tens of thousands of Ukrainian children the history of atrocities committed by tyrants against Ukraine is a stark reminder of the moral duty we have As Americans to stand with our friends and allies against tyranny and opposition for those in our country who don't think what's happening in Ukraine has anything to do with us Putin doesn't just want parts of Ukraine he wants to end the postor war II order that has underpinned freedom and economic prosperity in

our history in moments like this our country has been called to act and it did called to stand up in the fight for freedom and in the face of tyranny and to be the arsenal of democracy but in recent months we have not met this challenge it's been said it's never too late to do the right thing well we're coming really close as we've been handcuffed by extremists and appeasers now the pipeline to Ukraine is almost empty should we F now failed to send additional Aid Ukraine will lose this war and in Putin's eyes it will be just the beginning of its efforts to reconstitute the Soviet Union in action risk not just the fate of democracy but the possibility of drawing our own country directly into war so today it's particularly important that we heed the voices from the past from President Ronald Reagan as he espoused the Reagan Doctrine that we will always defend our friends and allies against Soviet aggression from President Kenny saying we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of Liberty and finally in his last Inaugural FDR who reminded us we have learned that we cannot live alone at peace that

to remind my colleagues that appeasement never works Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan both understood as President Reagan said and I quote we know only too well that war comes not when the forces of Freedom are strong but when they are weak it is then that tyrants are tempted it is time to be Resolute let's heed the lessons of history and support this bill finally I want to thank speaker Johnson for his principled leadership and his fortitude in moving forward with this bill in the face of daunting obstacles his resolve is a testament to his strength of character I also want to thank chairman Cole ranking member deloro for their leadership on this bill I urge a strong wrong yes vote and with that I yield back the remaining part of my time the gentleman yields all time for General debate has expired pursuant to the rule the bill shall be considered for Amendment under the five minute rule the amendment printed in part A of the house report 11 18- 466 shall be considered as adopted and the bill as amended shall be considered as read no further Amendment to the bill as amended is in order except those printed in Part B of house report 118 466 each such further Amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report by a member designated in the report shall be considered read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent shall not be subject to Amendment and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question it is now in order to consider the amendment one printed in Part B of house report 11 18- 466 for what purpose does the general woman from Indiana seek recognition Mr Speaker I have an amendment at the desk amendment number one printed in Part B of house report number 18- 466 offered by Mrs spars of Indiana certain house resolution 1160 the general woman from Indiana Miss sparts and a member opposed shall each control 5 minutes the CH now the chair now recognizes the gentle woman from Indiana thank you Mr Speaker and I yeld myself as much time as I may consume um I have held um a very principal position on Ukraine and unfortunately this position is not very shared with a lot of people in Congress is unfortunately you know we have the false choice of of the saying that Ukraine doesn't matter to America or support Ukraine with no question ask with blank checks and both these positions are not good in our national interest and both of this position are not good in the interest of the people of Ukraine and um unfortunately this Monopoly of narratives prevailing in our government in our society and in Congress so my amendment is actually very simple and I know this is just we're doing this amendment just for the show and no one is going to put pass any on the floor we still will go with blank checks and slash funds and unfortunately the strategy failed the American people President Biden failed the American people on the border on National Security Congress failed the American Security President Biden and president zilinski failed their Ukrainian people they were not ready before the war started they did what didn't have good strategy When The War started slow walk the eight and really didn't fight and deter Putin to go further and now we have a very significant war in Europe and and I said you know unfortunately this supplemental doesn't just have a lethal Aid it's had other parts and they will go further and unfortunately no one is going to be taking our amendments so because we have presentations and circuses but decisions already made so my amendment is actually very simple it just says we shouldn't have blank check and let President Biden have presidential drawdowns increase from 100 million to 8 billion including loans from 4 to 8 billion so we generally giv true blank check to President Biden of 16 billion Congress forgot you know that we should do our jobs we shouldn't create this loopholes for presidents doesn't matter who the president is to be able to do what they want to do this is our job to to over see this funds so very simple Amendment this emergency that we created now go to the point we're giv billions dollars Congress and not doing its job we have the power of the purse for a reason so all it does this amendment eliminates for Section that increasing and it's a true blank check because when we say that presidential draw down goes from 100 million to 8 billion almost or from 200 to 4 100 million from 25 to 50 million we really don't even know what he's going to do he can do whatever he wants with that and that is a big problem because this emergencies are dangerous but also you know what the problem we have right now that this in case of this emergencies you know we actually don't have ability even to ask the questions and Congress hasn't been asked one question that's why we have such a major catastrophe around the world whether it's in the Middle East whether it's Ukraine and and that's why China Russia and Iran are moving and we're doing a lot of presentation with blank checks and slash funds and no policies and so I would urge my colleagues to think maybe for a change and give this amendment consideration which I have a very low expectations and I also would consider as I said to support lethal Aid with border security but unfortunately that didn't happen and it's sad for me to see that we still don't take this war as serious as it should be because generally only 13.7 billion actually go to security assistance directly to Ukraine from this 60 billion plus another 8 billion slash fund so we're talking almost $70 billion plus another 8 billion of loans whoever they go to so we're talking about almost 80 so I have a problem with that and I reserve woman reserves for what purpose does the general woman from Connecticut Mr chair I claim time in opposition to this amendment the gentle gentoman is recognized for 5 minutes this war is an existential Conflict for Ukraine as important it is a test for the United States and United States leadership one of the best tools we have to get the ukrainians what they need is presidential draw down Authority this allows the United States to send equipment from our stocks to the front line in a matter of days there isn't time to delay this amendment would cut that Authority from $7.8 billion to 100 million it ties our hands and yes it hamstrings the Ukrainian military to do the job that they need to do to defeat Putin we all lose if Ukraine succumbs to Putin's ambitions and it will not stop there Putin in 2016 asserted that Russia's borders do not end this is a quote do not end anywhere Russian officials just this spring have threatened Finland Romania Armenia Estonia Lithuania and malova removing the best tool that the United States has to exercise in terms of a moral Clarity and responsib ability that we that we can have move quickly to arm our allies would be a grave mistake please vote no on this amendment and I yield back the balance of my time the gentle women reserves the gentle lady yielded back the Gent how do I have remaining gentleman has 30 seconds okay thank you Mr P I just want to highlight we increasing blank check from 100 million to 8 billion and we don't even know if it's spent for Ukraine or not just a blank check of 16 billion to President Biden purely blank check and I consider hope that my colleagues will support that because we need to stop slash fund and blank checks we will never win against aggressors if we continue congress not do its job i y back the gentleman General woman yields back uh the question is on the amendment offered by the general woman from Indiana those in favor say I those opposed say no in the opinion of the chair the NOS have it the amendment is not agreed to I request a recorded vote purpose is a general lady from Indiana seek recognition I request Y and nays do you reest a recorded vote recorded vote okay so pursuing to Clause six of rule 18 further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana will be postponed it is now in order to uh consider amendment number two printed in Part B of house report 11 18- 466 for what purpose does the general woman from Georgia seek recognition Mr Speaker I have an amendment at the desk the clerk will designate the amendment amendment number two print it in Part B of house report number 118 d466 offered by Miss green of Georgia pursuant to house resolution 1160 the gentlewoman from Georgia Miss green and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes the chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from Georgia Thank you Mr Speaker my Amendment today would drive uh the amendment uh the bill for Ukraine take each dollar amount in this act is hereby reduced to zero you see the United States taxpayer has already sent $13 billion to Ukraine and a lot of that money is unaccounted for this is a continuance of a sick business model that the American government continues the federal government continues to fund the military-industrial complex and this this is a business model that requires Congress to continue to vote for money to continue to fund Foreign Wars and this is a business model the American people do not support they don't support a business model built on blood and murder and War in foreign countries while this very government does nothing to secure our border the American people are over $34 trillion in debt and the debt is Rising by over $40 billion every single night while we all sleep but yet nothing is done to secure our border or reduce our debt inflation has driven out of control Americans are suffering every single day they can hardly afford their grocery bills they can can hardly afford gas in their car they can hardly afford rent and now mortgage payments are well over $3,000 where they were only just over $1,700 three years ago the youngest generation young adults don't even think they're going to be able to buy a home in their lifetime and today in Congress the most important thing that this body thinks should be done is to send another $61 billion to a war in Ukraine that the American people by 70% % do not support mind you this comes on the very heels of Monday being April 15th tax day where every single American had to scr up their money and send their dollars in to the IRS or some of them had to file extensions because they weren't ready and didn't have the money to pay their taxes but today this body says the most important thing we can do no is not reduce spending that's not it not to do anything to drive down inflation oh no we can't do that for the American people it's not to secure our own border that is invaded every single day every single day by people from over 160 different countries no don't secure the American Border let everyone in we have over 1.8 million known Goda aways we don't know who these people are and yet you have members of this body talking big and tough about oh we have to defeat Russia oh we have to protect Ukraine but yet all of you are unwilling to protect the American citizens that pay your paycheck pay the pay the light bills in this building and pay for this entire federal government for what for nothing Ukraine is not even a member of NATO Ukraine is not a member of NATO but the most important thing you hear in Washington DC is oh we have to spend Americans hard-earned tax dollars over to Ukraine and keep the money going to continue to murder ukrainians wipe out an entire generation of Ukrainian men so that they widows they are fatherless orphans there are not enough men to work in their Industries oh but you really support Ukraine wow what kind of support is that it's repulsive you know shame on the American government shame on the American government if we support our military support our military we should be funding to build up our weapons and ammunition not to send it over to foreign countries to kill foreign peoples and if this body was worth what it claims to be what it is every single one of us would be demanding peace in Ukraine between these countries peace for these people so that no more of them have to die but you never hear anybody demanding peace no no no no peace is the last thing Washington wants because it doesn't fit the business model this is a business model that they say continues our economy protects American jobs what a disgusting business model we should have a business model that builds up our American companies and American jobs to Serve American interest and our military and our government should care about protecting the National Security of the United States of America and the Americans that pay their hard-earned tax dollars to fund all of this America last America last that's all this is every single day America last gent gentle woman's time has expired I yield gentlewoman yields for what purpose does the gentle woman from Connecticut seek recognition Mr chair I rise in opposition to this amendment strong opposition to this amendment which would eviscerate is recognized for Bill five minutes thank you in the postor War II construct the United States is a witness to the World on the values of democracy and freedom these values have provided the United States of America with strong allies across the globe it has helped our partners in Europe and NATO to support Ukraine against Vladimir Putin's unjust War if we do not provide Munitions Ukraine will fall and Putin will be emboldened and the green amendment allows Putin to control Europe abdicating our leadership role and Promises Promises to our allies cannot happen we must support Ukraine's defense the world prior to World War II was unstable with authoritarian fascist leaders seeking power and voting no on this amendment will ensure that history does not in fact repeat itself I urge all of you to vote no I reserve the balance of my time gentle lady has the only time two minutes to the gentoman from Minnesota the ranking member of the defense subcommittee Miss McCullum gentoman is recognized for two minutes thank you Mr chair and I thank the ranking member I rise in very strong opposition to this amendment cutting the funding in this bill would be devastating to zero out our support for Ukraine would only embolden Puttin more as I said earlier murdering civilians on a daily basis is what the Russian government is up to as well as holding thousands of Ukrainian children as captives as ranking member of the defense appropriation subcommittee I know the funds included in this bill will provide Ukraine with the vital support they need to defend themselves if this amendment were to pass we would set send a signal that the United States does not stand against Putin's campaign of death and destruction in Ukraine we absolutely must stand against Putin's aggression if Putin is allowed to succeed in snuffing out Ukraine's democracy it will put our allies in the Balan States Poland Romania and other NATO Partners at Great risk the funds in this bill also strengthens America's national security by supporting our operations in Europe backfilling our own military stocks so that we are prepared I strongly urge a no vote on this amendment and Mr Speaker I yield back the gentoman uh yields back gentoman from Connecticut so chair I yield two minutes to the gentleman from Washington the ranking member of the armed services committee Mr Smith the gentleman's recognize for two minutes thank you Mr Speaker I want to focus on one argument of the sponsor of this amendment who's basically saying that if we pass this bill we are advocating the killing of ukrainians that that is a uniquely demented way of looking at this war Putin invades Putin as we speak is bombing and killing Ukrainian civilians and the only thing that is reducing the number that he can kill is the ukrainians ability to fight back so to look at this from a pure Russian propaganda standpoint they invade they bomb they kill and it's our fault for helping the ukrainians defend themselves that is the argument here against supporting Ukraine and it literally makes no sense if you want peace give the ukrainians the strength to stop Putin he is the one that will not come to The Barking table right now because he thinks he's winning he thinks he can go all the way to Kei he thinks he can take the whole country if we give the ukrainians the ability to stop him that forces him to the table it makes no sense to say that giving the ukrainians the ability to defend themselves is what's killing them when it is very clearly the Russians that are killing them and I would also note that no president has added more to the deficit in one fouryear or the debt sorry in one four-year term than president Trump and I didn't hear a single Republican complaining about the debt or the deficit during that period of time the ukrainians need our help to bring peace to stop Putin to stop what he is trying to do also to miss mccullum's point this also helps our industrial base we Face a dangerous World between Russia Iran China North Korea all of whom are working together by the way if we don't help Ukraine stop Russia that helps Iran that helps China that helps North Korea this is about our national security which I am quite confident that whether asleep or awake the American people also care dearly about please defeat this amendment and support Ukraine and support United States national security interests thank you I yield back gentleman yields General woman from con Connecticut recognized speaker I yield back gentlewoman yields back the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Georgia those in favor say I I those opposed say no no in the opinion of the chair the NOS have it the amendment is not Mr Speaker for what purpos do the woman from the gentle woman from Georgia secret I ask for the A's and nays the gentlewoman ask for a recorded recorded vote pursuant to Clause six of rule 18 for the proceeding on the amendment offered by the gentoman from Georgia will be postponed the chair understands that Amendment Three will not be offered it is now in order to consider amendment number four printed in Part B purpose does a gentle woman from Florida seek recognition thank you Mr Speaker I have an amendment at the desk the Kirk number four print it in part B of house report number 18- 466 offered by Mrs kamik of 1160 the gentoman from Florida Miss kamik and a member oppos each will control 5 minutes the CH the chair now recognizes a gentoman from Florida thank you Mr Speaker I yield myself as much time as I may consume G woman is recognized thank you Mr Speaker I rise in support of my amendment to HR 835 which would eliminate all non-military funding in this Ukrainian Aid package breaking this down a bit that would mean cutting nearly 10.5 billion with a B from this whopping $60 billion Ukrainian Bill to date American taxpayers have already given $113 billion to Ukraine since Russia's Invasion this new spending $60 billion is designated as emergency spending mean it Go meaning it goes straight to our national debt a national debt that grows every single second to the tune of $8 billion every single day since Russia has invaded Ukraine in February of 2022 there has been robust debate in Congress in this chamber about the United States role in the war now while we here in this chamber disagree on the role that we should play there is one thing that I hope that we can agree on we as the United States Representatives should not and I repeat should not not forsake our own National Security in favor of another Nation we should not secure the borders of Nations abroad while simultaneously ignoring the very real and very dangerous border crisis in our own country while we should debate the merits of providing funds for weapons and equipment to defeat Russia in this conflict funds that fall outside of immediate narrow and lethal Aid should not warrant the same urgency or consideration all told sections of this bill that are not lethal Aid come right to about $10.5 billion with the bulk of it going to support the Ukrainian economy not the American economy the Ukrainian economy and anyone who is living under Biden's economic plan right now knows that it sucks we need to be clear this is emergency spending again going straight to our national debt full stop and again we are borrowing $8 billion a day over the past 20 years Congress has designated 12 trillion doll in emergency spending with these funds in the bill that are not designated for military purposes the American people are resigned once again to absorbing another 10.5 billion do to support Ukraine and their economy while simultan simultaneously adding the debt to our 34.7 trillion national debt that is simply unacceptable we are robbing Peter to pay Paul and the American people are once again left holding the bag you cannot stand here on this chamber's floor as a representative of the American people in the people's house and sincerely say that you have done everything possible to look out for American National Security and American Economic Security if we don't narrow the focus of this bill we have to adopt this amendment and by the way while I was speaking we have added another $5.5 million to the national debt I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and I reserve gentleman reserves for for what purpose does a gentleman from Florida secret I claim the uh time of an opposition if you would the gentleman is recognized for five minutes Mr chairman I rise in opposition to this amendment from one of the people that I most admire and again a dear friend and a colleague from Florida this is clearly a well-intended Amendment and frankly when I was listening to her presentation there are so many things that I agreed with what she said um but it would strike all funding in the bill except for the foreign military financing and so as I mentioned there's so many things that I agree with what you said I agree for example that over time the United States needs to we must Focus its effort on really intelligence and essential Military Support I totally agree with that she also talked about how we need to narrow the scope I would argue that unfortunately the amendment needs to be narrowed a bit should have been narrowed a bit um because it would be really really counterproductive the way it's written at this time and let me respectfully explain why first the amendment would zero out zero out funding to keep us Personnel us Personnel in our Embassy in Ukraine safe I don't think that's something that we should be doing right now uh also the funding to enhance the US government's presence in order to conduct oversight which is something that I've been clamoring for a lot of us have been clamoring for uh uh begging and pleading and working for well this would eliminate that as well uh and by the way it would eliminate including for the oversight of the military portion of the assistance now secondly it would eliminate funding for the States Department the state departments and usaid's Inspector General from whom we require unprecedented oversight plans but then obviously we need to give them the resources for this critical work because we have to have oversight and that's something that I know that at least on my side of the ow we all agree on regardless of what you believe our role should be in in Ukraine and again unfortunately as I mentioned this would eliminate that the funding for that third it would also eliminate funding for investigations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine and as well as assistance to help secure Ukrainian nuclear facilities and we've seen those in the news under Threat by the Russians and also the funds for uh potentially clearance of Russian mines and finally it would eliminate economic support for Ukraine and that is something that the sponsor of this amendment is is really focused on but I would argue even there that is essential at this moment right now look it's pretty clear that Putin has been targeting farmlands and infrastructure energy infrastructure road infrastructure and Ukraine's uh industrial base and by the way he's doing that for a reason you see crippling Ukraine's economy and Putin knows this has a direct impact on Ukraine's ability to stop Putin so now as chairman of the state of foreign operations subcommittee I can assure you that not only do I understand the sponsor of dis amendment's frustration I get it I share it but that's why again we need to have the language that's currently in the bill I understand her concern and her frustration because of the lack of transparency and strategy on the funding that has already been provided so that's why this is very clear that's why this legislation includes many of the critical oversight and burdens sharing priorities that I'm very proud originated in the fy4 State Foreign operations Bill these include unprecedented co uh cost matching requirements so that other donors step up they must step up the bill imposes layers and layers and layers of conditions on the funding including for uh inperson monitoring for example this bill requires I know novel concept a strategy that must be developed and submitted so that Congress can evaluate the execution of Aid and its alignment with us National Security interests another significant change by the way from the Senate supplemental is a requirement in this bill that the economic support to Ukraine be repaid transforming assistance from a grant to alone I am so grateful to the sponsor of this am Amendment for her work I appreciate the intent of this amendment but we cannot afford to Short change our oversight funding our Diplomatic Security funding and other strategic priorities so for those reasons with uh again great admiration and respect for the sponsor of this amendment I must I must urge a no vote on this amendment and I reserve the balance of my time gentleman's time has expired the gentle woman from Florida is recognized thank you Mr Speaker and uh let me just Begin by saying the feeling is mutual I have tremendous respect and admiration for my colleague from the Sunshine State um and I hear loud and clear the critical elements of this bill that have been deemed necessary heck I deem them necessary the American people and the representatives in this chamber we demand fully accountability and transparency however there are multiple poison pills within this text that the American people and certainly not my constituents back home support for example 300 million for international narcotics control and law enforcement what about the 100,000 plus people every single year in America that are being poisoned by fentanyl where is the funding to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States what about the 25 million for transition initiatives what about the 60 million for diplomatic programs I noticed that my colleague again who I deeply respect he mentioned that part of that is for security but what about the rest or the 481 million for Refugee and entrance assistance we have a border crisis that has resulted in one of the most egregious Public Health Public Safety humanitarian and National Security crises in American history we are approaching over 10 million illegals Crossing into our country being quote unquote paroled which is just a fancy way of saying Catch and Release into the United States approaching 2 million Goda ways we have a massive crisis here at home and if America is not safe and secure here at home we cannot help our partners abroad I urge respectfully that my colleagues put America First and adopt this amendment with that I yield the gentle gentle gentoman from Florida yields um the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida those in favor say I I those oppose say no in the opinion of the chair's that the no have it the amendment is not agreed to speaker I request a recorded vote a recorded vote

Daily with strength and resolve knowing they are likely next the United States is not on the sidelines in these conflicts our service members are under daily attack in the Red Sea standing watch along NATO's Eastern flank and being routin routinely challenged in the Indo indopacific five American dra flag draped coffins have returned home in the past 6 months when we go to war we go to war with what we have there is no time to forge new alliances no ability to reconstruct abandoned production lines and no Hidden Reserve of fully trained and ready troops this is the situation our allies and partners in Israel Ukraine Taiwan and other indopacific nations face today it is a situation ourselves May face sooner than we think XI Putin kman and terrorist leaders will not back down unless met with a strong and Resolute America standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our constellation of allies and partners these bills provide the funding necessary to defeat and defer DET our enemies while the bills carry the names of other countries there is one nation that I care about above all others and that is ours these conflicts have exposed the fragility of our defense industrial base and dire need to invest in factories shipyards assembly lines that manufactures the instruments of Our National Defense in recognition of this fact over 59 billion across these bills go into our defense industrial base including 3.3 billion to supercharge a submarine industrial base 29.5 billion to replenish our stocks of us defense systems and services provided to Israel Ukraine ukine and Taiwan 1.13 billion to expand procurement and Munitions each conflict has its unique needs and addressed by the in these bills including 5.2 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome David sling and procure the iron beam

across the globe are being asked to operate at a war time Tempo to track respond and engage emerging threats these bills provide the resources necessary to support their operations with 11.3 billion for current US operations in Europe 2.4 billion for our forces in the Middle East who are under daily attack Mr Speaker we have been complacent for far too long as our allies and partners and our own service members have been under attack this Congress has a solemn obligation to our military to provide them with the resources they need to deter and win our nation's Wars Douglas MacArthur once said that the history of the failure of War can almost be summed up in two words too late when conflict occurs we will fight with what we have and who is with us Mr Speaker I encourage my colleagues to vote Yes on these bills to ensure our military Readiness and revigor American defense industry I encourage them to vote Yes to reinforce our Israeli Ukrainian Taiwanese and indopacific allies and partners I encourage them to vote Yes so that future Generations May write on what we did here today they weren't too late thank you and I reserve the balance of time the gentleman reserves the gentle lady from Connecticut is recognized speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume the gentlewoman is recognized Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations act which will provide Israel with desperately needed Aid to respond to the horrific October 7th attacks and protect itself from Iran and its proxies what happened in Israel on October 7th was horrifying on a recent trip to Israel I saw firsthand the remnants of the violence that innocent people were subjected to including the site of the Supernova suut Gathering the Gathering at which it was a music festival that Hamas attacked kibot Beret and the homes where so many were massacred and hostage Square where I met with families of those taken hostage by Hamas the United States has not forgotten October 7th and today we are providing the aid Israel has needed since the day Hamas terrorists killed innocent Israeli civilians in the worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust just last weekend Israel was openly indirectly attacked by Iran I applaud the role of the United States in providing Israel with support in its defense against that attack but while we must ensure Israel can stand strong in the face of adversaries like Iran that seek its Annihilation we must also ensure that every step possible is taken to protect innocent life in Gaza and Elsewhere on my trip we also went to kbet Zuta a Palestinian Village in the West Bank where settlers destroyed homes and a school on the trip we were also briefed by Gaza uh from Gaza by humanitarian organizations including unra which have lost hundreds of staff to the violence to that end I have called from an immediate ceasefire of at least 6 weeks to facilitate the safe delivery of Aid to civilians in Gaza we must protect Aid workers we must open additional Crossings to bring in at least five 00 trucks a day and ensure that food is never used as a weapon of War innocent families are in danger children are starving and civilian casualties are mounting not just in Gaza but in Conflict zones all around the world the more than 9 billion dollar in humanitarian support in this bill would make sure that we are not leaving gazin the ukrainians the sudanes the Haans or the rohinga behind we must pass this bill ensure Israel has the resources it needs to defend itself and that much needed humanitarian Aid can flow to millions of vulnerable people around the world I urge your support and I reserve the balance of my time the gentle lady reserves gentleman is recognized I yield to the gentleman from Georgia a member of the Appropriations Committee Mr Clyde for one minute the gentleman's recognized thank you chairman calber I will always stand with our greatest Ally in the Middle East Israel but I rise today to express my serious concerns with a very flawed supplemental in November I supported the First Security Supplemental for Israel which was financially paid for and would have provided weapons and equipment for Israel's fight against Hamas the cost was offset by resending Democrats unprecedented expansion of the IRS today we are considering a vastly different Bill one that is all borrowing another 26 billion of debt with no recisions the legislation also contains 400 million for FEMA which has nothing to do with supporting Israel and over9 billion dollar for humanitarian Aid in Hamas controlled Gaza and the West Bank a report from the Heritage Foundation stated the problem with Aid diversion to Hamas and other terrorist groups plagues all International and non-governmental Aid organizations operating in Gaza it is therefore highly likely that us taxpayer funded humanitarian Aid to Gaza including some of the aid in this bill would again be diverted to support further Hamas attacks against Israel why would we knowingly be sending money into the hands of Hamas in any Bill if we are feeding Gaza we are feeding Hamas therefore with great disappointment I cannot in good conscience vote for this bill and I yield back gentleman yields back gentleman reserves G 8 is recognized chairman I yield two minutes to the general from Maryland the ranking member of the financial services and general governments subcommittee Mr hoer gentleman is support of this legislation all of the bills will address the issues at hand I often say thing but waiting to do the right thing comes at a cost we saw that cost in Israel this week as an embolden Iran launch an unprecedented attack on our Ally for Ukraine the cost of our inaction is great if incalculable it is measured in Ukrainian lives towns and territory lost for 478 days congress's words of support fell silent on Ukrainian ears deafened by the air raid sirens artillery bombardment and drone attacks today we act we act to make it clear to the world that America is still the defender of Freedom democracy and international law as well as our friends and allies and the opponent of tyrants and terrorists I urge my colleagues to vote Yes vote Yes to show Jews in Israel America and beyond that this Congress will always stand up for their safety vote Yes to demonstrate to Russia Iran North Korea and every other authoritarian desperate and to terrorist everywhere that America remains committed to defending Freedom here and around the world let our bipartisan support for our allies endure in the months ahead whether it's to S secure the release of the 134 hostages held captive in Kaza or to turn back Putin's criminal Invasion the voice of resolve and opposition to tyranny must not be muted nor should it be delayed let us pray that the majority that speaks today will remain loud and clear for all to hear gentleman Reserve gentle lady reserves gentleman is recognized I yield to the gentleman from California Mr Mento for one minute gentleman is recognized Mr Speaker Ukraine and Israel are in growing danger of running out of arms and ammunition while China casts a hungry eye on Taiwan history warns us of allowing aggression to grow unchecked and of how quickly events in an unstable world can unravel proplate spending is exhausting our resources and damaging our economy but as Reagan reminded us defense is not a budget issue you spend what you need to spend and although the defense of these besed nations is one step removed from our own it would be a very good thing to keep it that way I regret that the three military aid bills are LED up with about20 billion of economic handouts but we are out of options and we are out of time I'm afraid that's the price we now have to pay for months of dithering in this house without these bills today we and the world risk a future butcher bill that is incalculable I yield back gentleman reserves gentle ladies recognized speaker I yield two minutes to the gentle woman from Florida the ranking member of the military construction and Veterans Affairs subcommittee Miss waserman the gentle woman is recognized Mr Speaker It is incomprehensible that the Israeli hostages captured on Sim Castor are still in hamas's captivity as we approach Passover iise to finally provide long overdue Aid to our Ally Israel as she fights to defend herself against threats on multiple fronts on October 7th Hamas launched a massacre that led to the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust Hamas murdered raped and captured Israelis Americans Jews Muslims mlims Christians and people from dozens of countries Hamas broke a ceasefire and declared war on Humanity since that Bloody day Hamas terrorists have promised to carry out the attack again and again I recently visited Israel for the third time since October 7th I saw the realities of hamas's dedication to annihilate Israel I will never be able to unsee the images at the Nova Festival site where Hamas massacred hundreds of young people the road leading towards the site is littered with burn marks where cars with PE people fleeing for their lives were burned alive on the spot you walk into the festival site and see hundreds of memorials to the innocent victims who were murdered in Cold Blood at kabut kafar Aza we saw homes riddled with bu bullet holes and burned to the ground with people still in them this is what Israel is up against this is what Israel must defend against maniacal terrorism dedicated to the destruction of not just the state of Israel but of all Jews Israel fights not only to destroy hamas's iran-backed military capabilities but to the clear message to our adversaries who seek to erase the Jewish State you will not be successful President Biden leader Jeff and Democrats have fought for months to send this critical security assistance as well as life-saving humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people who are also victims of Hamas a vote against this bill is a vote to deny that Aid I am proud to support this vital effort to help Israel in this existential ballot battle and Aid civilians and I urge my colleagues to join me to free Gaza

at a most critical juncture do we take a step back watch our allies fall and allow Terror to spread or do we stand strong as leader of the Free World and stand up for our allies and take on our

question that under the Biden Administration the world has become a Tinder Box conflict erupting ac across the globe our allies are under attack China Russia and Iran are engaged in an Unholy Alliance seeking to undermine and destabilize the US Israel and the Free World We are the leader of the Free World it requires us to lead we cannot abdicate the responsibilities that come along with it the

solution for peace he doesn't respect our urges not to invade Rafa he disputes with the US and Aid groups have said about famine taking over in Gaza and he launched an attack on Iran after the White House told him not to if he's not listening to us on matters of International Security how can he be trusted with more offensive weapons enough is enough I support the people of Israel who don't want

will be spent in Sudan where 18 million people face acute food insecurity due to Civil War it'll be spent in Ethiopia where we've seen the highest casualty war of this decade 500,000 Tans have died and now Millions face famine it will be spent in eastern Congo where 7 million people have been displaced by War it'll be spent on the 1.1 million rohinga in camps uh are there due to ethnic cleansing
