and the leader of the lebanon-based Hezbollah militia has promised retaliation over the killing of a Hamas top official in Beirut on Wednesday Hezbollah blames Israel for the attack although there has been no claim of responsibility Israel generally doesn't comment on strikes in other countries but officials have previously said they would Target Hamas leaders wherever they are Hamas is classified as a terrorist group by multiple countries waving the Hamas flag protesters in ramala vo their support and anger the city in the occupied West Bank was the hometown of Sala aruri the high ranking Hamas official was killed in a strike on Beirut on Tuesday this is crazy hysterical Revenge Revenge because Israel feels and is experiencing a kind of defeat and therefore it knows full well that there's no victory for it Salah aruri was Deputy to hamas's leader Ismael Hana and the groups ke liazon with Hezbollah in Lebanon since aru's assassination in the suburbs of Beirut Israel and Hezbollah have continued to fire at each other across the border an almost daily occurrence since Israel's war with Hamas began the political party and militant group is backed by Iran and considered a terrorist organization by the US Germany and some Sunni Arab countries Israel has not officially claimed responsibility for the strike on Beirut but Lebanese security sources said it was caused by an Israeli drone Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate calling it a serious assault on Lebanon if the enemy thinks of waging a war on Lebanon we will fight without restraint without rules Without Limits and without restrictions Israel knows what I mean the is yours Israel's main Ally the US has said it was not informed before the blast in Beirut Washington is now urging restraint to keep the war contained wanted to before we don't want to see it widen Beyond Israel and Hamas and again we're going to keep working with Partners in the region to prevent that from happen Hezbollah has so far refrained from escalating Beyond border skirmishes with Israel but this attack in the heart of Lebanon has raised fears of an allout War and the Israeli Army says it's on high alert and ready for any scenario I asked our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem where Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon are inching closer to a fullscale war while both sides say at least that they're prepared for any uh scenario uh Israeli military analysts here believe that uh they don't want to go for a fullon war just yet but of course this is speculation and anything can happen uh at this uh Point we've heard the Hezbollah leader Hassan nraa saying that the killing of Hamas Salah Al Ari should not go unpunished he also also said that uh in his speech they will fight if Israel will extend the War uh uh to uh Lebanon uh we heard uh from the Israeli side the chief of staff her halevi he was touring the northern border uh yesterday he was saying that the military is in a very high State uh of Readiness but he also stressed that the Focus right now is uh on uh Hamas so we've seen of course since October 7 uh many cross cross B attacks uh the tensions have been rising constantly um around the blue the so-called blue line between uh Israel and uh the southern part of Lebanon also this morning there have been Aid sirens in uh Northern uh Israel but uh of of course we also understand uh that there at the moment diplomatic efforts underway there reports that the US Special enoy amamos hin who has been uh the go in between between Lebanon and Israel is expected uh to be uh in the region and uh uh trying again to mediate uh between Lebanon and Israel and we had Israel's decision this week to withdraw some of its troops from Gaza does that mean its fight against Hamas has now shifted to targeting Hamas commanders outside uh the region well I don't think it has completely uh shifted in that way uh Israel has said since October 7th that they will go after the Hamas leadership wherever they are including uh in uh countries or including of those that are abroad of course the main focus is uh to find uh the Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sina what uh Israel has said that they will uh withdrew some of the uh reservists from Gaza that have been fighting now in combat or other functions in the past 3 months they will be uh going for further training they will be able to go uh home there are also economic do domestic considerations going back into the workforce there will be a bit of a shift but again uh uh what we are hearing from military officials the focus is on the fight in Gaza on Hamas and this will continue uh for many months but also of course uh we are hearing that the preparations uh at the northern border are in full force uh you should not forget that uh uh the northern border with Lebanon um that there are many many uh Israeli residents that have been evacuated uh from their Lo from their uh places from uh uh um locations in the northern border also for the last couple of months and this is a situation that is not sustainable uh for for Israel in the long term okay thank you for that Tanya Tanya Kramer in
