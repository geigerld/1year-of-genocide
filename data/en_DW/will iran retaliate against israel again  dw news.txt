We Begin tonight with Tan's response to a suspected Israeli air strike on Iran both more muted and restrained than the world expected Iranian officials say that air defenses were activated at a military base and nuclear facility near the Central City of Isfahan us officials say Israel fired at least one missile in retaliation for an extensive Iranian rocket and drone attack last weekend flashes Mark the sky above Iran and what's alleged to be an Israeli attack Iran State media reported loud sounds being heard near the city of Isfahan the area is home to important defense facilities and a large nuclear Center the attack prompted flight diversions across Iran by Daybreak the incident was being downplay play the state media reporting the city was calm and emphasizing that nothing was out of the ordinary there were some uh loud sounds that were heard in the east of the city of esvan and this was related to the air defense system as uh we told you and our viewers before uh triggered by the presence of uh three small drones that were present in that area other than that nothing has happened everything is back to normal us officials have reportedly told media that Israel is behind the incident its War cabinet has been debating its response to a largescale Iranian missile attack last weekend Iran said it had retaliated to a presumed Israeli strike on Iran's Embassy in Syria which killed 13 People Israel hasn't acknowledged the is foran attack but its national security minister indicated he thought it didn't go far enough posting the word feeble on social media Oman condemned the suspected strike while Egypt urged restraint from all parties the EU and other Regional leaders are also calling for calm we have to do all everything possible that all sides restrain from the escalation in that region um we have seen the massive attack with drones and missiles round about 300 uh by Iran on Israel um it is absolutely necessary that the region stays stable and that all sides refrain from further action a ple for Israel and Iran to deescalate in hopes of keeping this latest Middle East violence from spiraling out of control all we've had team coverage of this story tonight I'm joined Now by our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem and Benjamin Alvarez Gruber in Washington DC Tanya let me start with you what are Israeli officials what are they saying about these reported strikes well we haven't heard any comment officially at least from uh the Israeli government or the military we reached out to them early in the morning to the military um and uh basically what we know is mainly from uh Iranian State media but also from uh reports in the US media quoting us officials that indicate that Israel had indeed carried out this strike now what's discussed here in Israel that is if this appears to be an Israeli strike it needed uh to uh carry it out uh for its deterrence after the uh large Counterattack by Iran which was in itself a reprisal to the uh alleged uh Israeli attack on the consulate uh compound in Damascus on April uh 1st now it appears to be uh uh Limited in scope and there more and more details of course coming out we don't know you know what more about the target we don't know more about the scope but this is also seen to keep it wag at the moment to deescalate and already escalated uh situation and we also hearing from Iranian sources that they might look the other way saying there is no need for an immediate retaliation and something like that could also be uh you know seen in in this from the Israeli side yeah yeah muted to say the least Benjamin what are we hearing of anything from us officials about what happened overnight what tan just mentioned there that us officials said that the US was informed before this attack is something that secretary blinkin did not address when he was asked several times earlier today at this G7 foreign Minister's meeting in Italy but he said and that's something that he has stressed that the US was not involved in any offensive what US officials have been saying is that the targets were not nuclear H that this was as tya just said also a scope not a really big attack but of course we're getting far more information from us officials and what we get from the administration we're still waiting to hear from the Pentagon also to see if there more briefings from the state department to give more information on and what the US position is on the strikes in considering this muted response that we are getting from Israel about events overnight what does that tell us about the sort of pressure that Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under right now domestically in the wake of the attack from Iran last weekend well I think there was a lot of pressure uh on the war cabinet to react and we've heard it even before that Counterattack by Iran last weekend took place that uh Israel had said any direct attack from Israel on uh from Iran on uh uh Israeli soil would be uh met with a a response from Israel so this was also then debated of course over the week in the war cabinet and there was a lot of pressure especially by the farri uh cabinet members but also by you know the right-wing cabinet members of the security cabinet and the war cabinet um to to respond uh and to respond decisively as well but also a lot of pressure from uh Israel's allies first and foremost United States but also other Western leaders to uh respond cautiously as not to drag the country into uh a wider conflict and I think it's also interesting that there were some polls out from uh you know about the uh Israeli public here saying that they were also concerned kind of split in the middle uh how Israel should respond but also over 74% in one of the polls of the Hebrew University saying uh that they do not want basically uh a Posen attack that might undermine Israel's security Alliance you know to keep this momentum of support international support in light of this attack but also you have to see that U many here are woke up at that time you know to a new reality a a kind of new order here because that was a a direct confrontation coming out of a shadow war that was always between Iran and Israel and right now of course because at this point in time we don't know what will happen next I mean there are maybe signs for deescalation but it could also go the other way what about the proxies and also the war of course between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is also ongoing and Benjamin that's what the Biden Administration wants right um whatever happens they want deescalation to be the word that's right and not just words but also actions and now that we have an upcoming vote on the House of Representatives on the Security Supplemental for Ukraine for Israel and for Taiwan many are pressing on the Biden Administration to do more to do more headlines and also to talk to both of them to say that a deescalation is needed right now all right Benjamin Alvarez guber in Washington Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem to both of you thank you well now I want to bring in Ali fat NAD he's a political scientist and director of the center for Middle East and Global Order right here in Berlin Mr Nan it's good to have you with us so as we heard there from our correspondent you know we still haven't gotten official confirmation from Israel that it was behind this attack let me just get your opinion what's your read was this an obvious Israeli attack well I mean there is little probability that uh you know those attacks were carried out by any other state so there's a higher likelihood uh and also we have some reports citing us officials uh that are quite clear that Israel has been carry carrying out the strike there has been International worry that an Israeli retaliation for last weekend's attack would definitely escalate this conflict and then the counter response coming from Iran would make it even more of a bigger crisis but that hasn't happened how do you explain this this muted response on both sides well I think at this point in in time no one has an interest um uh you know to U provoke an allout War um this is certainly true for the Iranian side uh given also the nature of last weekend's attack on Israel uh you know the kinds of weapon systems that the Iranians have used and also what has happened um you know today or last night um is also in my view an indication um that uh uh Israel did not uh choose uh a fashion of attack that could provoke Iran to uh further escalate and what instead seems to have been the case um I mean of course by now we don't have any confirmation about the exact nature of the attack and also the targets and also the damages uh but it seems seems that this was a demonstration of power from the uh Israeli side uh a signal sent to Iran that you know Israel can cross Iranian uh defenses uh perhaps at will and this has been a demonstration of power from the Israeli side uh signaling that uh if need be uh you know Israel could easily uh Target Iran in a forceful forceful way and espe of course Iranian um military infrastructure the Iranian media been reporting that drones were shot down near the Iranian city of Isfahan what would make this city um a a Target I mean um you know near esfahan there are a lot of military um you know uh complexes but also nuclear facilities uh but um talking of the Irani reaction it's quite uh visible uh that the Iranians have no uh you know appetite for escalation uh they've been downplaying uh this attack uh to a uh quite ridiculous level uh in terms of saying that you know only three drones were you know uh shot and were intercepted by the Iranian side and from uh all we can gather so far this attack has been you know uh much more than that but the Irani side is uh trying to uh you know keep keep it low to downplay it if not to belittle it uh that is also to not to have the pressure to respond uh which is again in contradiction to what the Iranian side via the head of the IC the Islam Revolution guard had announced uh you know just following uh the Iranian attack on Israel as a new equation from the Iranian side which would uh uh you know which would suggest that any um uh attack from the uh Israeli side on Iranian assets would be met uh with a with with a response from inside Iranian territory so uh given the fact that this new equation doesn't seem to hold uh this signals that uh those have been you know warnings rather than a change of uh strategy and the Iranian side is still very much worried that an allout War could you know uh uh could evolve out of those tensions and uh in such a scenario this would also be very much destabilizing for the regime in Iran do you think the regime in Iran has is realizing that maybe it's misread or miscalculated uh the position of other Gulf States and that maybe they were counting on full support in a conflict against Israel and that is obviously not what they're getting uh I don't think so that this was part of the Iranian calculation that um you know they're going to be supported by the uh Gulf Arab Gulf States um you know against Israel but the position of the Arab Gulf States is quite clear they're very much interested uh you know in bringing about a deescalation because stability for them is vital uh politically but also economically and so they fear any kind of escalation in the region uh especially involving Iran um they've seen that Iran could be uh you know very damaging to their nuclear uh sorry to their economic viability to the kinds of attacks that we've seen in the Persian Gulf region against the UAE but also against the main oil facility uh of Saudi Arabia in September 2019 so uh you know at least since then uh they're extremely worried uh about destabilizing activities of Iran uh and um given their understanding of uh relative reduction of us support they've chosen the way to seek accommodation with Iran but currently of course they do whatever they can uh toward deescalation Ali hatah NAD director of the center for Middle Eastern Global Order we appreciate your time on this Friday evening thank you I asked DW's uh Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca rites whether there has been any confirmation that Israel was behind this attack no we've had no official uh confirmation we have reached out to the Israeli military they haven't confirmed to us or to anybody whether or not they were indeed the perpetrators of yesterday's retaliatory or this morning I should say is retaliatory attack uh that is something I wanted to preface going into this in that pretty much everything that we know and the picture that is becoming clearer as this day progresses we know from unnamed sources what I can tell you is that some us officials have confirmed to the mainly Us Media that Israel did carry out this strike that's been backed up by unnamed Israeli officials that told the Washington Post that Israel carried out this attack uh that it was a message to Iran we know uh that the air defense system in that Isfahan area in Iran was triggered and was and went off and we've seen that video circulating of what certainly looks like interceptions but that's pretty much what we know so far as I mentioned Israel still yet to comment and it's likely that that isn't going to change it certainly seems that Israel that this is indeed an attack from Israel that not commenting is part of the strategy they most often don't comment on these types of military strategies but particularly with this one it appears or at Le analysts are saying it could be part of the plan that Israel wanted to Counterattack that they said that they had no choice but to Counterattack but they didn't want to perhaps humiliate Iran or force them to now to retaliate again uh that is certainly the pressure that they were put under by the International Community particularly the west Western allies the US Germany the UK EU uh to really kind of try to deescalate this situation and that appears to be the situation that we're looking at uh we've heard from a senior Iranian official telling the Reuters news agency that Iran has no immediate plan to retaliate so for now uh you know certainly it's hopeful in the region and across the world really that this is not looking that it's going to escalate for the moment uh though this region remains very hot and nothing can be guaranteed here in this volatile area Rebecca Isfahan in Iran is home to sites that are associated with the country's nuclear site uh would that make it a potential Target you think it's very difficult to say certainly probably uh you know we know that Isfahan does have a large Airbase we know that it has a major missile production complex and as you've mentioned as in that report several nuclear sites now we have had confirmation that none of the nuclear sites were hit or damaged the atomic energy agency confirming what we were hearing from Iranian State TV on that uh it was more likely that it was that military base or a military base in the area that was the Target and that could suggest that it was a tit fortat uh attack because it was in fact a military base or an army uh a military base in Israel that was struck by one of the missiles that came in Iran's Tory attack on Saturday so you know we could take take that from from from that that it is a tit fortat attack but certainly none of those nuclear facilities being damaged in this attack Rebecca R is there reporting from Jerusalem thank you very much Rebecca for more of this let's uh get in military expert Marina Manan from Kings College London Marina there is no official confirmation yet that Israel is indeed behind this attack what do you think good afternoon Gard well if we look at the world news and specifically the US News um a lot of us officials have said that Israel might be behind the attack and that um the Israel authorities had informed the United States last minute that they would launch this attack um so given the targets given the timing today is the 85th birthday of Ayatollah h it would seem like um it could have come from Israel it is very symbolic now what do you make of the scale of this attack it's quite moderate isn't it it is very interesting if we compare it to the Iranian attack last uh Saturday evening Sunday Sun Sunday morning it seems like both countries are in a deescalation spiral so um Iran made sure to launch an attack that wouldn't give Israel enough pretext to counter attack or at least to launch a very serious attack that could potentially damage Iranian nuclear program or its air bases now the Israeli attack uh is trumping that essentially robbing Iran of a good strategic choice so it is interesting that both countries feel the need to respond but to respond in such a way that it avoids a broader war against both countries now Iran says that they intercepted several drones what do you know about Iran's defense capabilities well uh last year no this year actually um in February there were two new air defense systems um introduced one is Aman which is a medium um Range high altitude for ballistic missiles and uh the zash which is a um low altitude AA defense system and these have been upgraded especially the later one um they're very mobile they're working 360° so these are the official statements by the Iranian defense Ministry we don't know how well they work and apparently um one of the systems the Amon one is also capable of shooting down drones um and these have been presented essentially because of the growing tension with Israel so we have the the specifications on paper of these two air defense systems how well they work we we don't know it remains to be seen but apparently they have been working on these flying objects which um some believe to be quad copur launched inside Iran have been shot down by Interceptor missiles so we cannot say that Iran doesn't have any air defense capability certainly given the circumstances and given the sanctions they are working on their air defenses understanding how crucial it is possibly getting some input from their allies such as Russia now let's have a look at the Target uh region why would Isfahan be targeted does that send a message in itself yes it is very symbolic in itself indeed on the one hand we have the um uranium enrichment facility there and on the other hand there is also an air base there which FS the very very old still USM made F14 tomat aircraft uh purchased before the Iranian Revolution in 1979 so it would seem like it is a hint uh presumably by Israel to say we can reach you too and we know where your nuclear facilities are there is no damage to either one but even considering the fact that the Israeli intelligence knows where those bases are located and has a cap ability to reach them um not asan to say stay away from attacking us because the next attack could potentially be much more serious in the sense that one of those two objects could be damaged or destroyed if not to all together the Pense analyst Marina Miron there for us thank you very much Marina let's now bring in bam Ben talbl he's a security Analyst at the foundation for defense of democracies uh in Washington and joins us from there now if Israel is indeed behind this attack would it be a rather restrained or a forceful act pleasure to be with you great to be back again uh in essence there may be a trend line here that Israel is connecting because if what is reported uh is true Israel has used smaller quadopter drones which many are alleging was involved in this attack near Isfahan both in 2022 in a drone storage facility in kmana in Western Iran as well as in 2023 January if I'm not mistaken near a missile production facility uh around the city of Isfahan uh by that trend line alone it would look like a likely foreign culprit would be Israel but once you layer in the fact that even prior to the missile and drone barrage Israel uh sustained but largely intercepted uh on April 13 and 14 the Israelis had promised to strike Iranian soil if Israeli soil was struck so this is in my view most certainly a retaliation but a contrasting retaliation whereas the Iranians launched uh a volley of almost 300 projectiles including land attack cruise missiles ballistic missiles and one-way attack drones uh causing very little damage uh if indeed this is the Israelis and all signs May point to that despite the lack of official confirmation from within Jerusalem uh there is a sharp contrast as to a limited scale uh perhaps a more precise or effective military strike so is this attack then designed to not provoke any further uh reaction by Tran indeed as much as I think the strike might be aimed at resetting deterrence given that this is more in line with previous methods of the Israeli Iran Shadow War previous you could say rules of the game that were established through behaviors uh in the four plus Decades of the Israel Iran Shadow War this is also designed to Tamp down incentives to escalate you've already seen Iranian State media uh hyping up the fact that isan feels normal uh this morning uh despite the the firing of the air defense uh air defense assets earlier in the morning around 56 a.m. tan time 56 a.m. Iran time if I'm not mistaken uh so they have an incentive to slide down the escalation ladder while that may put an end potentially in the short term the tit fortat directly between Iran and Israel on their territories I don't think at all ends both their strategic and ideational competition as well as the Islamic Republic state of D of death Israel because after all uh it is still supporting a multif front War uh against Israel which is now still fighting Hamas the lowest of lwh hanging fruit in Iran's Terror network uh in Gaza now do you think we will see any further actions uh by Iran or have they sort of said what they wanted to say the Israelis may have been also seeking to test the new or change stated Doctrine uh as annunciated by Islamic revolutionary guard Corps Commander Hussein salami after their missile barrage against Israel where he said if Iran or an Iranian interest is struck be it inside the country or outside we reserve the right to respond overtly and kinetically I'm paraphrasing uh but from Iranian soil so this could be aimed to test that Doctrine because as you know there were also explosions reported but on confirmed in Iraq and in Syria as well those are places where Iran has lots of Shia militia assets as well as weapon storage facilities so it could be designed to get Iran to uh test that Doctrine as well rather than just deescalate in safe face bamal there foundation for the defense of democracies thank you very much and we can cross over now to the journalist Christen hellberg she's an expert on the Middle East uh christen this drone attack on Isfahan do you think this actually is Israel's retaliation well we still don't have a 100% clear picture but it seems that Israel opted for something that H it has allegedly done before War which is a covered drone attack by the mosad from either inside Iranian territory or from one of the neighboring countries which could be the Kurdish region in Iraq or the Republic of aaban and Israel has done this allegedly before there were several such attacks in 2022 in 2023 so if this is the case then Israel pretty much followed the old rules of the game I would say instead of taking the conflict to a higher level and this would be a rather symbolic answer I would argue with a clear message saying that we can hit Iran anytime anywhere even without having to fall back on a larger direct strike now what do you expect to happen uh next another tit fortat response by Iran against Israel is this going to go on I think we are seeing a limited but a very well calibrated tiit for Tad you know we had the direct attack on Israeli territory so Israel had to fight back and hitting Iranian territory directly this is pretty much the equation that Iranian officials were talking about last week but if this is it if there's nothing more to follow from the Israeli side then then I think that nobody is aiming at a further escalation at this moment because this attack definitely leaves the Iranian regime with the option to not retaliate because they don't feel compelled to react to this and the fact that the Iranian regime offici offals and the Iranian TV as we just saw are kind of down downplaying the whole attack points in this direction we had the senior official saying that there's no plan for an immediate retaliation so for now it doesn't seem um that we are heading to a further escalation at this point will this have an effect uh on the war in Gaza you think well I think there is one real danger here that in return for this moderate rea towards Iran the Israeli government could now demand a free hand in Gaza and it could stick to its planned offensive in Rafa which is something that US the US does not want to see and we have heard that there were talks yesterday between us officials and Israeli officials discussing these plans in Rafa and to prevent this which is something that Washington wants to do I think that the US allies and other Western allies for example Germany should increase the pressure on the war cabinet cabinet on nany by for example withholding weapons of war at the moment to Israel until further notice and I'm not talking about air defense systems that obviously Israel needs to defend itself against Iranian aggression I'm talking about for example munition that would be used in Gaza in a war that according to un bodies human rights organization international law experts does not comply with the rules of the international humanitarian law so I think at this point to avoid a further um offensive in Gaza uh the US and for example the German government should make their support somehow conditional it has worked out concerning the humanitarian Aid that is being brought in all a larger scale and it should um it should be used this kind of pressure and this conditionalizing of support for the Israeli government should be used as well now to prevent an escalation and to prevent this offensive in ra which would be a catastrophe for the people within Gaza the journalist Chris her there thank you very much
