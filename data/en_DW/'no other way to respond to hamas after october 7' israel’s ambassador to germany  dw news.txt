Israel's military says its soldiers have discovered a tunnel shaft used by Hamas militants at alifa hospital in Northern Gaza Israeli troops released an unverified video of the tunnel entrance after they took control of the hospital Israel's attacks are controversial since hospitals have special protections under International humanitarian law unless they are being used for a military purpose this says Israel is the Smoking Gun that proves Hamas has been using alifa hospital for its operations after a second day of raids on gaza's biggest medical facility the Israel Defense Forces said they uncovered a tunnel shaft and a vehicle containing a large number of weapons IDF forces found a tunnel shaft in shifa hospital and teams of Engineers are currently uncovering the infrastructure there we also found a vehicle that had been prepared for the Massacre on October 7th but didn't leave we found many weapons in it it comes after footage was released showing caches of weapons Israel says were hidden around the hospital Hamas continues to deny the claims describing them as quote repetition of a false narrative since the conflict broke out Israel repeatedly claimed that Hamas was using Gaz and hospitals for military purposes and as the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens International condemnation has gotten louder and Israel has been under increasing pressure to offer definitive proof of these claims but in a situation as tend as this and with daily reminders of the civilians suffering in Gaza it's not clear that this new evidence will lighten that burden well in a few moments we'll be hearing from Israel's ambassador to Germany but first DW correspondent T ker joins us from Jerusalem uh to give us the latest T the Israeli Army is reportedly still at the alifa hospital uh compound what's the latest well the Israeli Army released a statement on Thursday evening saying that they are conducting still targeted searches on the uh alifa uh compound it's the largest hospital so they say it will you know it takes time uh they released those videos uh that you mentioned in the report showing reportedly a tunnel shaft inside the compound and also a vehicle loaded with weapons they also said they're operating into other hospitals the rantisi hospital and the aluts hospital um but this is the latest update we have this is from Thursday night there's no new update as to uh what exactly is happening right now there in the hospital we only know there is a communication blackout as well in Gaza right now as the fuel ran out for the generators to power up the communication system that's was confirmed by the Palestinian telec company uh palel and we also know from the humanitarian organizations they're very very concerned about the situation of course in the North in those hospitals uh while these uh Army uh operations are going on in the hospitals there are patients there in alifa the medical staff and also uh many uh um internally displaced people they were looking for shelter there thinking they are protected and uh organizations like wh world the World Health Organization is saying that many of the hospitals are running out of service uh they cannot provide services injured people cannot come to the hospitals there's air bombardment going on uh uh and the ground operations so there's no really safe space at the moment uh for residents neither in the north but also in the South there are also reports from air strikes on uh the southern area where many people residents from the north were told to go as a safer space but air strikes are also reported from the south of the Gaza Strip now Israel says it has recovered the remains of two hostages held by Hamas what more can you tell us well they announced this morning that they uh found the remains of a 19yearold soldier uh she was uh uh doing her her service on October 7th was taken hostage uh to uh Gaza they found it in a structure as they say adjacent to uh shiffer hospital now transferred the remains to Israel uh where the funeral will take place uh today as well as on Thursday night uh they found the remains of another hostage uh a woman in her 60s from kibuts beri her husband was uh killed on October 7 she was taken uh to Gaza and uh apparently killed in Gaza uh so this is a very worrying sign for many families and relatives there actually uh is a big March underway uh through uh Israel they are they say they're arriving uh this Marge of relatives and supporters of the hostages uh 239 still held in Gaza in Jerusalem on Saturday night to demand answers from the government uh why are they not progressing with a potential hostage deal to free the hostages uh now we're hearing reports that isra forces have carried out overnight raids in the occupied West Bank do you have any more information on that briefly please yeah there have been uh many raids since October 7th we've seen this already in the past year but they have intensified and one main focus is the Northern West Bank Town of Janine and the occupied West Bank uh there have been also a drone strike uh uh at least three militants or three people have been killed there uh we are seeing more and more activity of the Israeli Army and uh also according to Y AA at least 186 Palestinians have been killed uh in since October 7 in the occupied West Bank as well as four Israelis that have been killed tww correspondent T ker they're reporting from Jerusalem thank you very much now I want to welcome Ron prha to the uh Studio Israel's um ambassador to Germany thanks for making the time to join us here on DW news there's a lot to discuss and uh I'd like to begin with disc current the current events in Gaza do you anything first of all do you anything more about the uh remains of the hostages that have been found no but U I Just Want U everyone who basically looks at us to understand the amazing challenges that we have so we have two goals here in this war one to really dismantle Kamas infrastructure and its leadership and the other to get the hostages back home to navigate there is absolutely problematic because we can't really go after the tunnels we can't go full steam ahead we have to be very cautious and as you see until now we're nearly five weeks after the 7th of October we still can't identify all the bodies just think of what what what they really passed so those are challenges that we're dealing with as we speak moving and of course you saw not just hospitals but mosques Schools they're really using and abusing everything that you know Western civilizations basically see as you know something which is absolutely normal uh I'd like to come back to the current events in Gaza your prime minister has said that Israel is now unable to minim civilian casualties and accusing Hamas of preventing civilians from M moving to safer locations uh does that mean that Israel will now give up on protecting civilians absolutely exactly the opposite as you see we're working slowly and cautiously and we are going from room to room house to house Department after department just think who would basically think that in an MRI scanner Department you'll find kalashnikov's hand grenades I mean this is not exactly a usual equipment for MRI scanners so I would say that yes Kamas is abusing we're giving safe havens Hamas is shooting after its own people we basically giving you know Fuel and leaving it out before hospitals Hamas doesn't allow humanitarian Aid comes in you saw the the footage Hamas doesn't allow its own population to take food and medicine and water out of those uh cars that bring them in you mentioned the safe havens there but the uh IDF chief of the general staff today said uh that they are nearly finished uh in in the north of Gaza will direct their operations to other areas of Gaza I would assume that means the South an area that you or Israel has said to be a safe haven uh are people in the South safe and will they stay safe yeah Safe Haven is a safe haven yes we will we are now moving over to the South part of Gaza because we are we basically completed the issue in the northern part of Gaza but the safe haven in contrast to Kamas that basically breaches everything that it says and acts in a barbarian way I mean there's no way for me to again you know basically say what they what they did H we we really really make sure that the population is that goes out to those safe havens is going to be safe but still there there's attack in there will be attack on the south there will be bombardment on the on the south I mean how can you still call that a safe haven well if they move out in places which we Define a safe havens they're going to be safe inside those uh places where Hamas command and control centers and everything else I I would suggest they move out of there we ask by the way look at us you know this is a war zone okay we ask people to move out we give them and say hey if you don't go out this place is going to be attacked we do everything according to the most that we can in order for you know innocent people not to be hurt but we have to understand we have it with not just a terrorist organization but you know they are they are barbarians there's no other way to describe it and we have to deal with that in order to protect at the end of the day Israel and Israel will never be the same as before the 7th of October we'll never go back to having Kamas or anyone else on our borders can B that can basically have the opportunity to uh H to butcher Israelis and we come we come to to that in the second I still want to stay on the subject of the of South Gaza I mean there's already at least a million people there in in in a very small area and it now to me it feels like they're being squeezed further and further and further uh in into places and the humanitarian situation on the ground already is dire well the only thing I can say about that that uh we are doing the best that we can I think we see more and more H also on the international side and the Egyptian side with you know field hospitals we're allowing everything but as you see as we speak Rockets are still flying out towards Israel from the south those places that where they have rockets and they have weapons and they have infrastructure we will go after them we will make sure because no one no country can live with something like that and the leadership and's infrastructure will be destroyed would there have been another way after October 7th to deal with Hamas H the answer to that is unfortunately no we tried you you're now talking to someone who is the director general of Israel's Foreign Service when we disengage completely out of Gaza we took out 22 settlements out we left Gaza completely we took out also four settlements in the West Bank to show that there's political Horizon there's not one Israeli or one set in Gaza and we gave people working permits because we thought that doing that would basically create some perspective the same ones that went out to work in the kibuts Drew Maps where the families are where the children there's a dog there's a door and a a window and they went the Kamas came with very very good maps of where are the kindergartens so they themselves were part of this we tried containment we tried containment the same way that people in Europe had you know a vandal handle you know and this didn't work containment doesn't work why doesn't work because the ideology we trivialize the ideology when they said we want to basically destroy Israel we want to throw Israel we can't allow Jews to live there we trivialized it no we will never do that again and I hope also in Europe in the west people will not trivialize the ideology that now you see in many parts in Europe uh Israel's government has come under attack it is a not only from outside Israel but also uh from within do you think the Israeli response would have been different the retaliation would have been different had Israel had a more left leaning government say here thank you for the question the ab the answer is absolutely no Israel as you know we are discussing this is a vibrant democracy and in the sense there's no one in Israel left or right Kamas didn't really make a diff you know a for Kamas it wasn't a difference if you a conservative Jew a secular Jew if you're left or right many that were butchered were basically dedicated their lives to making peace with Palestinians the answer is absolutely not and what I'm really proud of is that now when Israel is really under attack people come together Israelis that went and climbed the I don't know mountains in Nepal or we're out in the you know in Goa in India all come back to the units when we're United there's no one we're unbeatable uh let's talk uh about the international reaction and the the support or the the waning support uh for for Israel at the moment there's an opinion poll this month here in in Germany that the majority of Germans for example are critical of Israel's uh war in in Gaza uh the international opposition that you are facing even from your friends uh does that bother you no because if after a massacre like that in the 7th of October a people in the world cannot understand why Israel has a right to defend itself then wow and having said that the German government from the president to Chan schs to Vice Chancellor Hab to the foreign minister defense minister from day one the only side someone decent can be is on the side of Israel we see that support very clear on in in the German system and yes I think there's a gap between the government and part of the population but I also see that there is an understanding here in Germany when you see what's happening here on the streets you know demonstrations in Essen you know of saying they want a new califi and here in Berlin I think there's an understanding that if you don't deal with this ideology and these people today you will unfortunately cry tomorrow uh turkey's president re T erdogan is in Berlin today he has called Israel a terrorist State and Hamas Freedom Fighters do you think Germany is still right to host him you know I I I'm not going to give advice to Germany to host or not I think that the German government is going to do the right thing but it must be heart to stomach and and but you know this is uh Germany the thing is what do you say to him and I think that you know when you hear Eran talking know he's the last one to preach us you know in the way he hosts the Kamas terrorists and uh I think that H turkey being an amazing an important strategic country in the region onean is on the wrong side of history and unfortunately uh one should also clearly tell him that uh now let's come back to uh the future of of Gaza uh over Netanyahu has said that Israel will control the overall security of Gaza after the war does that mean that that's been it for self-governance of the Palestinians in Gaza no I think it would be fair to say that netan and no one in Israel think that we should politically basically control Gaza but militarily we should be able to go back and every time someone puts in a rocket or something else we will be able to really control that how do you do that that's hard but we won't allow this military Machinery this Terror state to be again with weapons rockets and this has to be structured differently but then how how you going to do this without a constant military presence in Gaza ER we H as you s as you saw we H we have a we don't have a constant military present in the West Bank and we're still able to do that H I think we everyone who who really wants peace in this region let's try and think about it okay this wasn't coincidential we were coming near to peace with Saudi Arabia there's no coincidence that basically Kamas operated who do we see working we see thetis foren proxies of Iran we see kisala up in the north basically conducting nearly war against us we see Hamas those who really want peace should understand that only taking out Hamas and creating a regional Corporation H in the region maybe with Arab countries uh like the Saudis like the Emirates like Jordan and Egypt we will be able to build a structure that in essence will allow us to move to the next stage and just think logically we left Gaza what interest do we have in Gaza we left Gaza never to look back into Gaza and they if you know it's going to be quiet in Israel it's going to be quiet in Gaza it's a very simple equation that people should think about and at the end of the day all people who really want peace have to understand that Hamas cannot stay with its Terror infrastructure now the uh let's go back to um and distinguish between Israel and the Jews especially here in Germany there's been a wave of anti-Semitism uh on social media on the streets uh uh everywhere uh and also in here in in Germany uh do you see a link between that current military operation in Gaza and this rise in anti-Semitism logically you would say that there's a link but if you look back before the 7th of October you saw you know the way synagogues the way just think simple stuff you know synagogue Jewish Schools they're all protected you don't see you know churches or Moss being protected H there's a lot of anti-em mytic um actions taking place it has no connection with the 7th of October what is amazing for me that after the 7th of October it even you know rose up but the fact that Jews here in Germany and not just in Germany in Europe don't feel safe going to the esan or talking in Hebrew or putting a keepa someone we really have to work together so that does not happen and I think yes you see more anti-semitic incidents taking place but if you look back there were many before the 7th of October so I don't see a direct link here for pro then the Israeli ambassador to Germany thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us today there's a lot more to discuss but we have to leave it there thank you thank you very much thank you for having
