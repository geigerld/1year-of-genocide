the international court of justice has ruled that Israel must act immediately to prevent a genocide in Gaza it was responding to a case brought by South Africa which accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza the court said that Israel must do more to protect civilians there but did not Grant South Africa's request for a ceasefire the full case is expected to take years before a final ruling that Israel must take measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to the members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip the court further considers that Israel must take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of Life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip Israel must also take effective meas measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence related to allegations of Acts within the scope of Article 2 and article 3 of the genocide convention against members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip and let's give more we are joined by DW's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem so what's the reaction in Israel well there just has been a statement now it's a Friday afternoon the country goes into the weekend so we' been just hearing from Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he gave a statement so let's have a listen to what he had to say Israel has an inherent right to defend itself the vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish State and it was justly rejected the charge of genocide leveled against Israel is not only false it's outrageous and decent people everywhere should reject it and the eve of the international Holocaust Remembrance Day I again pledge as Israel's prime minister never again Israel will continue to defend itself against Hamas well he also uh spoke about that uh Israel will continue uh to provide or make it possible for humanitarian aid but uh he said in this statement um you know that it was uh the charge was rejected that is certainly not what most people would read into it of course the icj has uh stopped short of ordering provisional measures pertaining to uh a ceasefire but it has it it has said it seen merits in the case so this case will continue of course this could take uh um many years for a final ruling but it has ordered Israel uh to implement provisionally provisional measures um among them to ensure you know of not killing or causing bodily harm to Palestinians but also to ensure to provide the basic needs of Palestinians now in the statement as I said prime minister Netanyahu uh continues in saying they doing so but the question is you know will they change course and anything will they also comply to another measure it needs to implement to report back to the court in in a month time there will be certainly be more pressure also by Israel allies so that Israel will comply to these measures and on the ground of course there's also the question now while Palestinians are saying in reactions at least some accountability uh when it comes to Israel's actions of course what does it mean for Palestinians in Gaza for uh the civilian population there uh will it change anything for them in the ground and we've been hearing in this hearing you know the very detailed description of a very dire situation uh for Palestinians uh in Gaza and with the winter with the really cold coming into the region um you know it's still to see what it will change for them right now on the ground ananya Kramer with a view from Jerusalem thank you so much and we have the view from Johannesburg where DW correspondent Diane Hawker is standing by what's the reaction where you are well the initial re reaction has actually come from South Africa's international relations Minister Ned Pand who was speaking on the steps of the heg she went to the court to hear the outcome and one of the things she said was that she was thankful to the court for dealing with this matter expeditiously let's listen to what El she had to say I believe that in exercising uh the uh order there would have to be a ceasefire without it the order uh doesn't actually work I would have wanted a c no way that I'm going to say I'm disappointed I hoped for it but the fact of delivering humanitarian Aid the fact of taking measures that reduce the levels of harm against persons who have no role in what Israel uh is combating for me requires a ceasefire and I now the minister um speaking there um after her Department put out a statement in which it said that the decision at the icj was a resounding victory for South Africa we're also expecting to hear from South Africa's president s Raposa who was amongst ANC delegates who are attending ANC leadership meeting today we've seen videos on social media um showing ANC uh party members many of whom are members of government rejoicing with this outcome um singing uh struggle songs and saying that this was a a resounding victory for the thec Le government I think from the perspective of many South Africans this um ruling is a very positive ruling um we know that in South Africa uh particularly in the major cities there' have been regular protests in support of the people of Palestine and of course there is a feeling amongst many South Africans that there is a a connection between South Africa and the Palestinian territories one that was fostered and and nurtured by our former president Nelson Mandela and one that many South Africans have taken on to this day feeling that there's a need for us to to speak up and feeling that there's a need for for the South African government to act when it sees um you know wrongdoing what the the decision will mean in Practical terms we'll still have to see of course there's still the issue of the report that will have to be submitted and it does seem like it will be a long continuous legal battle um that South Africa will be involved in receiving those reports from the the icj and then responding and commenting on them but for the most part the feeling in South Africa is one of of Happiness one that South Africa has done the right thing and that it has uh um achieved an international Victory speaking up on behalf of those who are disenfranchised DW's Diane Hawker in Johan B thank you and let's get more with Marco longobardo he is a reader in international law at the University of Westminster good to have you with us um does the ruling come as a surprise to you thank you no the ruling didn't come as a surprise I think it's a clear victory for South Africa who got obtain an an order on provisional measures that recognized that there is a a serious risk of a genocide in the Gaza Strip it would been quite unlikely to obtain a an order on ceasefire because the court in this case has only jurisdiction over genocide and the use of force by Israel is not strictly linked to a genocide claim so the court EXC right sorry to interrupt you there um but I you know people are just looking at the face of it here and and and you know perhaps some people were expecting whether or not we were going to get a verdict on on a ceasefire today the court did not order to Halt Israel's military action in Gaza and Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already said that Israel will not stop its offensive in Gaza so what good is the verdict then can you just break it down for us a bit yes the verdict wasn't on whether Israel has committed or not genocide in Gaza was about their risk that during the legal proceedings that are ongoing to establish this H the rights of the gazan population would have been affected through a genocide and so the court ordered some measures to protect the rights of the gazan population pending the Judgment one of the measure that was requested was the ceasefire the court decided to give more discretion to Israel to H comply with the order not committing a genocide preventing genocide without spending out a duty to seize the military operations clearly if Israel decides to stop the military operation that would be the best and quickest way to H protect the rights of the Palestinian population but the court didn't go that far because its jurisdiction on this case was limited to the genocide question um one thing that the court did do it did um established that it had jurisdiction to hear this case we know that um Israel's attorneys had um you know basically motioned to have it thrown out and now the this interim ruling is is part of a case a larger case as you've highlighted there brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza so can you just walk us through the step-by-step process um because we obviously did not have a ruling on that today so what sort of timetable are we looking at what can we expect now in the next year yes the case will be quite long it's based on the genocide convention and it's about Israel committing genocide in Gaza Israel not preventing genocide from being committed Israel not punishing people responsible for genocide and Israel not addressing incitement so it's a complex case the next steps would be the Merit phace it is quite likely that the that Israel would decide to challenge the jurisdiction of the Court we have to remember that today the jurisdiction was only found as a preliminary ruling on an emergent issue the interim measures but we could expect a stage on whether really there is jurisdiction uh by the court I think the jurisdiction is quite sound and then a longer Merit stage consider that the two completed the genocide cases before for the court that we had so far lasted one 14 and the other 16 years so are very long proceedings and because of this it's very important that we had provisional measures ordered urgently Dr Marco longobardo reader at the international law at the University of Westminster thank you so much for sharing that legal expertise thank you and joining us here in the studio is Middle East analyst shaie rosanes shaie it was quite interesting actually to hear their reactions from Netanyahu also the reactions of from the South African attorney as well neither really seemed terribly satisfied um with with this ruling does that say something about it yeah the court managing an unbelievable new one decision that took only 10 days to to achieve to actually make each side win a little bit but also lose a little bit Israel is in a way uh happy for the fact that it was not forced to seize the fire that was the main point that Israelis were looking at will they be forced you know to Halt uh the fire having not gotten that uh measure is somewhat of a victory for Israel but then at the same time as we heard Nan the very fact that the court did not miss dismiss the charges you know that it's saying there might be Merit to the allegations of South Africa that for itself is is a blow for Israel at the same time you know we look at South Africa look at the Palestinians you know the South Africa as a voice for the Palestinians finally feeling that they have a voice that they are being seen that there might be a chance to stop this war or to somehow give Justice and protect the rights of the Palestinians for dignity for Freedom um and and we've seen you know the dire conditions in in Gaza so if you talk to people in Gaza they hope that the court might finally give them some of the of of the Justice I've been waiting for for over 100 days let's just drill down for a second and what exactly the court is asking for here's just one aspect of it and I'd like to just read it out it says that um Israel is required to prevent and punish the direct public incitement to commit genocide it was really interesting to hear um the court actually read out some you know pretty prominent quotes from high ranking politicians including the Israeli president the minister of defense for example essentially to paraphrase calling for the destruction of Gaza do you think that Israel is likely to abide by this particular aspect well um you know interestingly enough the Israeli judge who's part of the 17 judges panel was actually supportive of these measures uh that was 16 to1 the only one against it was the Ugandan one so we also see within Israeli ranks within Israeli Society those who are against those statements um and there's a lot of inner criticism of whether these very you know there's a difference between what you say as a political pundit and what you say as your at your role as a as a political also as a as a leader of the country and we've seen that with with uh defense minister galland who already responded saying I will not they take lessons IM morality from no one especially not the heg but but we do know that there's great support for the war but at the same time Israel is very attuned to criticism International critic criticism International Community needs and it's been willing to cooperate with this court which it has not done before so I believe they will take a good listen and will examine the the measures and will try to comply as much as they can how do you think Israel's allies are looking at today because I mean you know we have heard the resounding message from the Allies which is Israel of course has a rights to its defense a right to respond but we've heard increasing criticism about how Israel has responded there there's a lot of distaste forre um the number of civilians who have been killed corre I'm sure there's a sigh of relief in the white house for example today hearing this response uh of the Court these measures because they've been pushing very much for more humanitarian aid for Israel to scale down its operations um we also in Europe we've seen that and miraculously this this court has managed to bring all sides including China and R Us France and so many more other countries to a unanimous vote on these measures so the world very much wants to see less um less violence in Gaza Israel is aware of the fact it cannot ignore those uh those those the world anymore and I'm sure we will be seeing it in the next weeks unfolding DW sh rosanas thank you you're
