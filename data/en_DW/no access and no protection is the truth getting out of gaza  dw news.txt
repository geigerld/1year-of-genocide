well nearly 100 French journalists have signed a petition demanding access to Gaza and protection for journalists covering the conflict for years journalists have been unable to enter the Gaza Strip without permission from Israeli authorities now they can't enter at all we'll hear from Rebecca rits in southern Israel again this time on the challenges facing her and other reporters as they try to uh record events in the territory this is the spot where Crews from all over the world come to set up to try to get the story out about what's happening in Gaza it's been dubbed the hill of Shame Shame because although it's about as close as we can get to Gaza at the moment it's still around about 2 km from the border from here you can see with a zoom lens some of the activity happening in the northern part of the strip you can see aerial bombardments and you can hear outgoing arti arery from the Israelis into the strep you can sometimes see tanks and even hear combat fighting on the ground but it's frustrating for so many journalists here and and brings about a bit of professional shame that they're not able to get inside the strip and tell people stories or bear witness to what's happening with their own eyes I'm covering this conflict 30 years or something uh so I think that this is the worst war ever that I am covering now uh it's uh yeah it's not uh so good to me as a reporter to uh be in the border line uh to cover this conflict it's very difficult now to uh to get real information from Gaza and from the other side as well it's a war it's a war also in the media and We Know It the weight of getting accurate information out of the Gaza Strip lies heavily on the shoulders of those few journalists many of them gazin who were inside already working inside the Gaza Strip on October 7th many of them have now sadly died in this conflict and those that remain are dealing not only with the deteriorating humanitarian conditions and fear of bombardment but also of unspeakable losses themselves that's Rebecca RS in southern Israel Christopher rash is from reporters Without Borders so welcome to DW How concerned are you that foreign journalists can't get into the Gaza Strip yes IO from my side as well and of course we are very much concerned I mean since the blockade Israel imposed 16 years ago the journalist cannot enter the territory without author authorization uh and now Israeli authorities don't allow journalists to enter the Gaza Strip at all the only possibility would be through the Rafa CR Crossing in the South but this is closed um on a on a general level I mean the work of journalists is essential during times of armed conflicts like these we just heard from the colleagues how dangerous it is and how sad they are that they can't inide to report um timely reporting helps ensure the respect for international human rights and humanitarian law and prevent further violations and also it can be essential and life-saving in times of conflicts so so we need independent reporting from inside the strip but we need also much more protection and and this is just so difficult right now okay so we've heard and you've reiterated that war is a dangerous business doesn't Israel have a duty of care to keep non-combatants like journalists out of Harm's Way yes of course in rsf in our point of view and from our perspective um they have Israel has the responsibilities uh to protect much more and and this is why we um just filed a complaint two days ago before the international criminal court U detailing possible I I repeat possible um war crimes um while targeting civilian areas and with these targeting also targeting and uh eventually killing um Palestinian journalists um I understand that the Israeli government says um are on the point that the Hamas Liberty hides their their positions in civilian areas but uh still there is a responsibility to take as much protection and Care um as as the Israeli Army can right I'm slightly confused by your answer because on the one hand you say that you want to get into what is clearly a war zone uh and that uh uh Israel is impeding that so you want to get in and you want them to protect you while acknowledging that they have a duty to keep you out of Harm's Way well again I would imagine Israel would argue the safest place for you is not to be inside a war zone sure and I understand the confusion you see me slightly smiling but that that's the way of uh conflict reporting you know I mean I trust the season colleagues that are in Israel right now and um I mean the French colleagues signed a petition I think by 150 people signed it to go inside I think they they can trust we we can trust them to take the risk and we need this reporting we need the reporting to be as safe and secure as can be but we need the reporting because otherwise Gaza will turn to an informational black hole and we we we can't want that I understand that the war in is shaping up to be the deadliest single event for journalists for decades how many journalists have been killed I mean obviously the numbers are hard to really Point down but um and there are I mean rsf is not the only um International pressre oranization watching in the conflict I mean all all are our numbers are at 34 killed right now um and this would be I mean Wars are especially deadly when the when they begin but the first two three weeks of this war is the deadliest of any armed conflict in the world for media Professionals in this in this Century uh we have 12 people 12 journalists confirmed to be killed in connection to their work there is one in Lebanon one in Israel and and 10 in Gaza and until now we have 34 in total but we need to determine whether they are have been killed in connection or because of their were given right and I'd like to focus on one in particular um this is Roy's journalist Isam abdalah he died in air strikes in southern Lebanon that also wounded other journalists and reporters Without Borders I understand believes that these journalists were deliberately targeted yeah we believe that they have been deliberately targeted we have investigated this incident uh it was on Friday October 13th around 6 p.m 6 in the evening and um from what we know from what we see there was um a team of journalists actually there were two groups of people one team of journalists consisting of seven people is abdalah being one of them and they were clearly visible on a on an kind of ele elevated area they had press signs on them they had a vehicle a car with a big press sign on it they were in the area for like an hour and there was according to our research an Apache military helicopter by the Israeli Army hovering around and probably monitoring and still they have been targeted uh the Liber as we think because they have been targeted twice 367 seconds in between and um I mean of course we have to be very much careful with accusations but from the the the the pieces of information we were able to gather this looks like it a bread strike and what has Israel said about your accusation can you repeat that sorry there was a in the line what has Israel said about your ACC yes I can hear you now sorry I'll say it again what has Israel said about your accusation yeah we have yet to hear an official reply but immediately after the strike they declared that they were story and they were looking into it and we hope this investigation continues so if true would this do do you believe this would constit constitute a specific crime if true this would be a war crime which would have to be uh determined I suppose by the uh the ICC um we thank you for joining us and outlining that so clearly Christopher rash media relations officer for reporters Without Borders Germany thank you thank
