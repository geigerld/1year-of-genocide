meanwhile attention is also focused on Iran which has in recent days warned that thean backed proxies in the region could attack Israel unless a ceasefire is agreed Iran's role in supporting proxies in the region such as Hamas and Hezbollah is well known it's all centered around a rivalry between Iran and Israel that goes back decades just days before Israel was attacked by Hamas Iran's supreme leader made his opinion of Israel clear this cancer Israel will definitely be uprooted at the hands of the Palestinian people themselves and resistance forces across the region Israel has long accused Iran of supporting the Hamas terrorist group following the attack Israel issued strong condemnation of tan Iran backs Hamas I think that 90% of hamas's military budget comes from Iran it funds it organizes it leads it trains there's no Hamas without this support system just like there's no Hezbollah without Iran Israel and Iran actually had close ties until the Iranian Revolution in 1979 after that supreme leader declared Israel an enemy of the newly formed Islamic Republic despite hostilities a period of relative calm followed the year 2000 brought a change when the iran-backed militia Hezbollah took control in southern Lebanon right on Israel's border since then Israel and Hezbollah have had regular clashes Hezbollah is one of Iran's proxy militant groups in the region through through these groups the Islamic Republic has formed what it calls a ring of fire around Israel Hezbollah in Lebanon on Israel's northern border Shia militias in Syria and the houis in Yemen to the South and looming large are Iran's attempts to create its own nuclear weapons a threat to Israel and the entire region and joining me now for more is Dr Ali fatah NAD he's director of the center for Middle East and Global Order here in Berlin and author of the book Iran in an emerging New World Order from Ahmed NAD to Rohani Dr fatah NAD Israel has stated its aim is to quote destroy Hamas but can that happen without Israel addressing the support that Hamas gets from Iran well that's a very good question in terms of the Israeli aim to annihilate Hamas we have to distinguish between hamas's military capabilities and its uh you know its ability to wage war in the future uh and uh between and uh Hamas is a political organization as a social movement I think uh the former uh would be uh the Israel's main name but it's going to be very complicated given um you know the the the comp ations that are inherent with the ground offensive uh but at a at a larger picture of course Israel has to address Iran uh the Iran problem so to speak because Iran is a major supporter of Hamas and uh is probably uh also is going to continue that support so we're going to see um if uh in the wake of the current War we're going to see a much more robust Israeli and perhaps American posture Visa Iran when it comes to it to Iran's expansive Regional policies do you think Israel makes a distinction between Hamas as a political party and Hamas as a terror organization simply because in the European Union the US UK Hamas is a terror organization period no absolutely I mean this is the priority that Israel has to address first of all Hamas as a terrorist organization as a military organization but of course Hamas is quite different from you know dases the Islamic State or Al ala because it has a kind of social base that is not to say that is extremely popular in Gaza uh we know from surveys that have been conducted just prior to the prior to October 7th that a small uh part of the uh gazen population is supporting Hamas and are happy with Hamas and the great majority are not but of course Hamas is part of the Muslim Brotherhood and is such is an organization that is beyond a mere terrorist organization whereas the means it uses are primarily connected to terrorism the longer Israel's war against Hamas drags out do you think there is a risk that the Iran Israel rivalry transforms into open confrontation between the two well um as I've stated before um Iran is uh probably not interested in uh provoking a great war with Israel and perhaps also the United States because this would pose a tremendous challenge to regime uh security and stability so the Iranian side fully knows that this is why we've seen that they they were reverting back from their initial belligerent rhetoric after October 7th just a few days after that um from all top officials from the president the supreme leader the rgc chief uh so they have all said the October 7th attack has been uh done by by Palestinian resistance only so this is a sign of concern within the Irani leadership that uh a larger congration uh may occur at which end there is a direct military confrontation which is too risky for Iran but but short of that Iran I think going to continue using its axis of resistance the kind of militia Network it has from Hezbollah uh to uh groups Pro Irani groups in Syria and in Iraq all the way down to Yemen with the houthis in order to make an Israeli operation um against Hamas uh much more difficult the Iranian government doesn't recognize Israel's right to exist and supports militant proxies in the region how much support is there among Iranians for this policy well there is a tremendous Gap uh when it comes to the issue of Israel and Palestine between State and society as you have rightly suggested the Islamic Republic has been a sworn enemy uh of the state of Israel since its very Inception in 1979 uh because of uh you know it's uh because of the regime's anti- Zionist ideology but it has been you using and abusing the Palestinian cause uh in order to project power uh in the region but also beyond in order to Proclaim itself as a guarantor of uh Palestinian rights whereas in reality of course the picture has been much more complicated but after four Decades of regime propaganda on the issue of Israel and Palestine we see quite a strong societal backlash um that uh you know a large part of Iranian Society do not believe anymore in Main in the main pillars of the regime's propaganda be it the anti-woman pillar be it the anti be anti-americanism or being being being uh anti-israeli so on all those front we see a huge difference between the regime and society and we've seen uh you know um a lot of societ backlash over the last um you know uh few weeks in Iran from various groups from students all the way to football fans uh that are also at the same time quite cognizant of the fact that the regime uh is using this kind of this uh War um to its own purposes and at the end of which it's Irani society that going to suffer this this way or the other do you think uh one is is reaching a stage in which it's going to become increasingly harder for the Iranian government to justify this continued expenditure on its proxies in the region at a time that Iranians are going through dire economic difficulties uh because of this we see since actually Iranian involvement um uh in Syria after the Arab Spring we see that the elite has been cognizant of this societal opposition to its Regional adventurism and so it has uh you know calibrated its rhetoric accordingly for instance in the case of Syria it has told the Irani people that first of all it's a war on terror secondly they're going to be some economic dividends so none of which has been uh really true and um and also we see that there has been a prominent uh protest slogan since at least the 2009 movement uh from the Irani protest movement uh which is uh neither uh neither Gaza nor Lebanon my life for Iran so there is a tremendous skepticism from Iranian Society Vis A this kind of regime preference to engage outside borders in order to project power only we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today Dr Ali fat naad thank you so much thank
