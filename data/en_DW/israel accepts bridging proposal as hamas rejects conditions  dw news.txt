ceasefire talks aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza are continuing in the Middle East the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin arrived in Egypt earlier on Tuesday where he met with the Egyptian president abdal fat LCC Lincoln says Israel has accepted a bridging proposal Hamas the militant group that committed the October the 7th Terror attacks says the latest version of The Proposal goes against what they were offered in early July Kareem El go is a journalist joining us now from Cairo for more on this story kareim Hamas saying that the current proposal on the table goes against earlier agreements made can you tell us more yeah well it seems that they're not very happy with what Anthony blinkin calls the bridge bridging deal uh they say we had an agreement in July with the Biden proposal at that time and in this agreement there was a an agreement that there was a two phases of exchanging Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners first in a six month six weeks period of a ceasefire that then is extending to a permanent ceasefire um now they say in this bridging proposal um there is new demands by netan packaged with Anthony blinkin and bringing this proposal the main points Hamas is unha happy with is that there seems to be no more guarantee for a permanent ceasefire in this package this is to be negotiated in a later time and the second thing that they are not happy with is uh that there is not a full withdrawal by the Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip they want to remain in at the Egyptian border to the Gaza Strip and also in the middle in the Gaza Strip in a corridor that divides the Gaza Strip into our northern and southern parts so Hamas isn't happy with this package what about the talks happening between the Egyptian president and US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin well um not much leaking about talk the Egyptian president SCC before emphasized the danger that this all might escalate into a wider conflict something he agrees with with the US um for sure Egypt is not happy about the what is sprinted British proposing the permanent presence presence of the Israeli Army at the Egyptian border to the Gaza Strip and at the Rafa Crossing um that's something that also was reiterated by Netanyahu again that this is a demand he will not move away from uh Egyptian security sources are saying that there might be a Readiness by the Hamas and the Egyptian side maybe for um International Presence at this border but also that limited to six months but as I said there's really not much known about the details of this negotiations okay so where does all of this leave the prospects for peace right now well I mean for sure we have very very difficult negotiations ahead of us Hamas is I don't think going to accept uh that there is not a full withdraw of the Israeli Army and that there's not some kind of guarantee for a permanent ceasefire and as you heard yesterday um US president uh Joe Biden in the Democratic Convention he promised that he will deliver on ceasefire in the Gaza Strip in the exchange of hostages and prisoners but of course for that he needs two sides not only Israel but also Hamas and Hamas right now is not very happy kareim Al goari journalist in Ciro Kim thank you so much for your insights you're welcome
