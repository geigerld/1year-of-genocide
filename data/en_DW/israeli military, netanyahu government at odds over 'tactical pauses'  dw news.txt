US President Joe Biden has used his address for the Muslim ID holiday to uh to press for a ceasefire in Gaza Biden said a pause in fighting was the best way to save civilians from the horror of the conflict in Gaza itself another nine Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike the attack came after the Israeli military said it would Implement a daily tactical pause along a road in southern Gaza to allow Aid deliv race praying among the ruins Palestinians marking a somber Aid in Gaza where over 80% of the population is living in displacement this family Sheltering at a un School in K

wake up and sleep to the sound of strikes disrupting a relative calm an Israeli air strike hit the B Camp killing a number of people including children according to a nearby hospital what did this girl do to you Netanyahu shame on you on the Israeli side of the Kum Shalom Crossing with Gaza a trucks were spotted after Israel announced a tactical pause in fighting near Rafa to facilitate deliveries the 11-hour pauses apply to 12 km stretch that's the main gateway for humanitarian Aid into the territory the Tactical pause announcement came a day after eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast near the far southern city Israel's Drews minority held a funeral for one of them Captain Wasim [Music] Mahmud the preparations for Eid have become preparations to receive hundreds of people here to offer condolences and prepare the funeral with the latest fatalities Israel's military has recorded a total of 310 deaths since the beginning of its ground offensive in OCT over while gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed after 8 months of a devastating War the Tactical Paws fall short of a complete ceasefire called for by the International Community including Israel's closest Ally the US well for more on this we're joined Now by our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem Rebecca it seems seems Israel's military and its government don't really see eye to eye on the issue of tactical pauses what more can you tell us yeah that's right Terry so we heard this announcement early yesterday that this pause this tactical pause along this humanitarian route would be coming into effect immediately in fact the message said that it was had already come into effect and was already uh had already happened on Saturday um you know we we weren't sure immediately whether or not this was coordinated with the government but very shortly after this announcement was made it was met with furious a furious response from some members of the far right Coalition Benjamin Netanyahu yah's Coalition that uh there were there were many far-right parties and particularly national security minister itamar Ben he came out saying whoever made this decision was a fool uh and that it was evil the Finance Minister betel smotrich came out and said that this would undo all the good work that they've done uh against Hamas and this would take away from their victories uh so and shortly afterwards we heard reportedly from the prime minister's office that Benjamin Netanyahu was Furious about this decision and that he had not been party to it uh the latest that I've been able to ascertain from the Israeli military is that they have maintained this statement uh and we certainly heard from people on the ground eyewitness reports saying that yesterday was a relatively calm day uh in Gaza and that there had been fewer air strikes and and fewer on the ground fighting or or less I should say uh so you know we believe at this stage that it has been the military didn't confirm with me that it was completely carried out and that it would continue but they said that this statement they stand by it and they're maintaining it so whether or not just how long it will last we still don't know because as we've seen uh the government is is countering what the military are doing and they're saying they're unhappy with it so it may well uh end but at the moment it it does appear to be ongoing so pause ongoing uh how much could these if there are more pauses how much could these pauses actually help people in Gaza Rebecca well it's certainly you know been welcomed this news has been welcomed by uh the International Community by humanitarian organizations who uh were told coordinated with the military on the route and some of the details uh about this pause they have long been calling for more humanitarian Aid to be allowed in we know since the operation began in early May that the number of trucks that were already insignificant and not enough to uh fulfill the requirements inside Gaza but they were uh before the operation were hovering around 160 170 a day they dropped after the raer incursion to just a little under 70 a day so huge drop eight agencies saying that 500 trucks a day need to go in to Gaza in fact 600 trucks really need to go into Gaza but before the war 500 trucks we're going through and it's not a lot of numbers but it does show you the difference uh of of Aid you know the amount of Aid that needs to go in versus what's going in so obviously Aid agencies say this will make a huge difference but it won't solve the problem overall there are still many other issues when it comes to Aid distribution includ including criminality desperate people uh you know trying to piler what Aid is coming through on those trucks so there are getting this Aid in we know the 300 Mill dollar jots as it know as it's known this pier the US built Pier has barely been in operation since uh since they finished that a few months ago and so the the only way to get Aid in is through these land Crossings the few Aid drops that have been coming uh into are also woefully inadequate so hopefully uh you know obviously Ada organizations are hopeful but they do say this is not going to solve the crisis on its own Rebecca thank you that was our correspondent Rebecca rers in Jerusalem well for more on this we can talk now with Shaina loow she's a Communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council which is active in the Gaza STP she joins us from Jerusalem Shaina do you think these tactical pauses that the Israeli military has announced will help civilians in Gaza well Terry I think it's it's important that Aid be able to actually reach the aid agencies once once it enters Gaza but whether or not these tactical pauses will allow us to be able to safely distribute Aid to all people throughout Gaza is unclear and and unlikely considering that Israel has been very clear that these tactic so-called tactical pauses will only occur along that um small Corridor what we need in order to really make an impact and and start to meet the growing needs in Gaza the continuously growing needs in Gaza is a complete ceasefire so that we can guarantee the Safety and Security of Aid workers and people coming to seek Aid at distribution points we need uh a scaling up massive scaling up of the amount of Aid that's coming in which is woefully inadequate we've been conditioned at this point to be cheering on these Tiner uh cosmetic changes and not and and and forgetting to continue to push that we need much bigger things a ceasefire safety for humanitarians and a scaling up of Aid so you say that more these Arrangements need to be made elsewhere in the Gaza Strip they shouldn't just apply to that area down in the South how freely can Aid workers move around the Gaza Strip at the moment it's very very difficult for Aid workers to move around the Gaza Strip and and be assured of their safety the notification and coordination system deconfliction system with Israel is broken sometimes it takes hours for us to get approval to move and by the time that uh we've gotten approval it's it's too late in the day either the place that we are going has been closed it's after dark when our staff is not able to move everything is just taking far too long staff members are getting delayed at checkpoints eight humanitarian agencies simply cannot function under the current circumstances uh to any uh any impactful degree now Reef uh relief supplies are piling up at many border crossings I understand how how quickly can those supplies be brought to where they are needed most well this tactical pause along this route will allow for us to be able to go and get some of the the aid that has been piling up on the Gaza side of the crossing once we're able to receive that Aid and and take account of what exactly it is that we've received then we can start immediately going and distributing at the sites we've already over the last several weeks been been visiting new ID P sites sites for internally displaced people uh assessing the needs of course everywhere in Gaza there's tremendous need so once we're able to access that Aid we will do our best to try and distribute it as quickly as possible what about the kind of Aid that is getting into Gaza and should be getting into Gaza what kind of Aid is most urgently needed in Gaza right now the most urgent aid of course is food and medicine as we see that that more than half of Gaza is on the brink of starvation that famine is is looming if not already um present in parts of Gaza so we need food and medicine but on top of that with so many people displaced since Israel announced it its Rafa operation in May and started issuing uh the so-called evacuation orders calling on people to leave we have a huge need for shelter materials people are sleeping in in tents people are sleeping in makeshift shelters with whatever salvaged material materal they can find and many people are just simply sleeping on the streets because they have nowhere uh to sleep and and so shelter materials are essential wash uh Water Sanitation hygiene materials are needed because there's a sewage problem there's a sanitation problem basically everything is needed in Gaza at this point but of course given the number of people suffering from food insecurity we need to see a massive scaling up of food into Gaza Shaina thank you very much for talking with us that was Sha of the Norwegian Refugee Council speaking to us from Jerusalem
