the international court of justice in the ha has ordered Israel to stop its military offensive in the city of Rafa in southern Gaza the United Nations Top Court described the humanitarian situation there as disastrous and ordered Israel to allow unhindered access of Aid Israel has repeatedly said it has the right to defend itself from Hamas militants and is unlikely to comply with the ruling God also ordered Israel to report its progress in applying the measures within a month mon the ruling was in response to a request from South Africa though the court has no way to enforce its decision the ruling does add further International pressure on the Israeli government here is the president of the Court Naf Salam the court considers that in Conformity with obligations under the genocide convention Israel must immediately hold its military offens and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in H or in par let's look at what this might mean with Mark Weller he's professor of international law and international constitutional studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK welcome to DW Israeli citizens suffered terrible atrocities on October the 7th last year is the government of Israel argued in court that it's taking exceptional measures to min minimize harm to the civilian population in Gaza today's ruling does seem to indicate that the court sees things rather differently well Israel is of course entitled to the right to self-defense in response to the horrible atrocious uh events of the seventh of October but the right to self-defense is not unlimited and it can never transgress humanitarian law the law that surprise that supports the Dignity of human persons human beings in any circumstance even in war and the court has now spoken for the third time in just a few months which is unprecedented ordering Israel the first time uh not to do anything which could constitute acts of genocide against the people of Gaza the Palestinians the second time it has ordered Israel to ensure that there is full humanitarian access and now almost unprecedentedly it has ordered a state claiming to be in the middle of a self-defense operation to Halt a major element of that campaign it's rougher offensive okay so let's pick up the two you you mentioned there uh two previous rulings there nothing that constitutes genocide and full humanitarian access today's ruling uh required Israel uh to uh provide verification or to allow verification uh of humanitarian access which seems to indicate that the court does not believe that Israel has complied with its earlier ruling well it certainly hasn't complied uh in the sense that the court has found that the situation has gotten much worse and therefore very unusually it has made yet a further ruling in this case and the court is very very concerned about the future of those individuals who were sent to Rafa as a safe place by Israel to escape the consequences of the fight and who are now being displaced from there without adequate measures have been taken to ensure their survival in other places and the court has noticed that no such adequate steps have been taken okay so there we have a problem don't we because the court rules uh do something about humanitarian access the court rules today uh against uh Israel and says stop what's going on in Rafa and let us check that you've complied with our earlier ruling we heard yesterday from an Israeli government spokesman who was quoted as saying no power on Earth will stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza the court can rule until it's blue in the face where's it or else well uh how many Legion does the pope have as was famously asked the court doesn't have an army to enforce its wishes it could have an army if the UN Security Council were able to exercise its role because the UN Security Council has in principle the power to enforce judgments of the court but of course with the US veto that is not possible and therefore it is the very very significant diplomatic pressure you saw the indictments by the international criminal court in relation to Mr Netanyahu a completely SE we should say and those uh have been backed up now yet again uh in addition to their individual responsibility by these actions directed towards the state of Israel and it really makes the Diplomatic space for Israel much much more difficult to maneuver in Israel has been arguing we have been a model of humanitarian law compliance but with all of this evidence those arguments ring increasingly Hollow as most people who watch television of course already know okay once you have these authoritative findings from the highest judicial bodies in the world it is much more difficult for Israel to maintain its position that it is in a modest way defending itself does this ruling impose any duties or obligations on any other signatories uh to the court to do or not do anything I'm thinking of the United States amongst others who it could be argued are is or are supplying Israel with the wherewithal to carry out the activities that the court has now prohibited fny you should say that as of course you hinting at Germany is at present subject to a case in the international court of justice where nicaragu has argued that the continued provision of Arms by Germany to Israel violates the genocide convention and for a state like Germany which Prides itself as a model of compliance with international law um on the one hand but which also wants to remain a very strong friend of Israel that is a real huge dilemma coming up for it the United States uh will will not likely uh consider uh the court in relation to its arms exports which are of course quite massive uh the United Kingdom may be in a different position because under its ministerial code it cannot uh license uh the export of weapons uh if these weapons are likely to be used against against international law or certainly in favor of a campaign of genocide so these various pronouncements again make the space to maneuver for Israel and for its allies uh significantly smaller doesn't end the conflict but it is another piece in the Mosaic uh which will help I think persuade Israel ultimately to try not to isolate itself entirely from the International Community and just a final word on genocide because today's ruling is a part of a broader lawsuit brought by South Africa last year accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza just explain to us briefly what impact today's decision has on that well this is part of that case it is the third interim action by the court to protect the people of Palestine during the many years it will take the court to give the actual ruling as to whether or not genocide has taken place so this action does not actually Prejudice the finding of the court at the end of that lengthy period of legal argument as to whether or not genocide occurred remember the Bosnian case where most thought uh we were faced with a significant campaign of genocide and after many years of deliberation the court found that sanit was genocide but the rest of this Dreadful campaign of crimes against humanity didn't quite measure up to that high legal standard that's very clear Professor thank you so much for walking us through that Professor Mark Weller from the University of Cambridge we have Team coverage of today's ruling from Israel and South Africa I'm joined by our correspondents a Ibrahim she's in Jerusalem and Diane Hawker who's in Johannesburg to both of you welcome a let me start with you have we seen or heard any reaction from the Israeli government we've heard sort of individual reactions from members of government and the opposition so let me just walk you through what we've heard so far we've heard from Benny Gans uh he's a minister in the uh War cabinet and after the ruling was issued he said that Israel would continue its quote just and necessary war against Hamas to return its uh hostages and he said that his country is committed to fighting for the hostages for their return and the security of its citizens anywhere and and that includes ra so that gives you a hint uh into uh the kind of discussions that may be happening in the war cabinet right now there's still that commitment and focus on Rafa we've also heard from B smotrich that's the far-right Finance Minister in Israel who said that uh Israel I'm paraphrasing now Israel um stopping the fight in Rafa or the fight for Rafa is the equivalent of Israel sort of forfeiting its right to exist um and so there's a definite uh uh sign from the far right that they um you know would reject this ruling but that's unsurprising we've also heard from y Leed that he's the leader of the opposition and normally a fierce critic of uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he also rejected the um the ruling and said that the icj did not make a connection or perhaps strong enough of a connection between the release of the hostages and the stopping of the fighting that is not wholly ACC accurate because judge Salam today as he announced that ruling did of course talk about how disturbing it is that Hamas still holds hostages and called for their release we haven't heard from uh senior members like the prime minister or the president yet but we can't expect to hear from them soon and it will be something along these lines that we've just heard and you can also expect even harsher criticism as the Prime Minister it's sort of become a habit whenever Israel faces this Challenge from International institution accusations of anti- ISM and anti-israel uh uh propaganda sort of uh are the first thing that the Prime Minister comes back with we haven't heard that yet but that's very very probable all right Diane let me take this to you we spoke with a legal scholar earlier today who said that this ruling was definitely a clearcut win for South Africa what have the reactions been there well the South African government is definitely taking it as a win uh we heard from the uh Department of intern relations earlier on they put out a video statement from the director General there um saying that this was a groundbreaking ruling and he's essentially saying that South Africa intends to continue uh with this uh uh process that they have currently started they will also go to the United uh Nations security Council now that this ruling has been made and look to the security Council to take some steps that in a way bolster that ruling zann Dango also um you know saying that although the the icj didn't use the word ceasefire that the effect of what they have called for is a de facto ceasefire which is something that South Africa has been calling for uh for several months now so definitely seen from the South African government perspective as a win for their cause and also an opportunity to continue to collect additional information for their case going forward DW's Diane Hawker in Johannesburg and DW's a Ibrahim in Jerusalem to both of you thank you I'm joined Now by Michael Becker he's assistant professor of international human rights law at Trinity College in Dublin he is also a former legal adviser at the international court of justice it's good to have you with us Mr Becker let me just ask you is this an outright victory for South Africa that brought this case to the court well it's certainly the case that South Africa received just about everything that it requested from the court this time around we know that South Africa has gone to the icj multiple times seeking provisional measures this kind of urgent interm relief and has asked each time for the court to order Israel to suspend the military operations up until this point the court declined to take that step to go that far and so the fact that the court has now intervened in this way or ordering Israel to suspend military operations in at least in the Rafa uh part of Gaza uh is a is a pretty uh extraordinary development for South Africa and it's also pretty extraordinary I would add that that the court has ordered Israel to allow unimpeded access to un fact-f finding bodies or commissions of inquiry this is also something that parties in multiple cases have requested before and the court has always been very reluctant to order so that also suggests an extremely high degree of concern on the part of the Court how much then of a defeat is this for Israel well it certainly adds to the list of of defeats that I think Israel has experienced in this case along the way uh Israel all along has uh urged the court not to take this step making the argument that this would uh leave Israel unable to defend itself when it's involved in an ongoing conflict uh but this really means that the court has found that there is simply no other way at this point to preserve the rights at issue in this case the rights of the Palestinian population in Gaza not to be subject to acts that might meet the legal definition of genocide uh I do think that the court the order just came out haven't had a chance to completely comb through it in detail but as far as I can tell the court didn't say anything about what this leaves Israel with the ability to do uh but I think it can't really be construed to mean that Israel is no longer allowed to defend itself if Israel suffers future attacks so if Hamas for example were to abuse what the court has ordered here by using Rafa as a staging area to launch rocket attacks uh at Israel this court the court Court's order isn't going to stop Israel and I don't think it's intended to stop Israel in that particular circumstance so really one would hope that this also incentivizes Hamas to enter into what is a de facto ceasefire well it's interesting that you say that um you know as well as I do that Israel has already declared that it will not comply with any orders to stop its military operation so at the end of the day what difference will this judgment make well that's true and I haven't seen the immediate Israeli response yet to this decision but uh we can probably expect a message of of defiance um in terms of what the court has said today and you're right I don't I don't know that this is going to have any kind of immediate impact on how Israel is carrying out the offensive in Rafa it might be wishful thinking but perhaps behind the scenes this does create a kind of offramp for elements or constituencies within the Israeli government who are urging uh for a change of course but I don't think we'll see anything along those lines in terms of the public narrative coming from Israel yeah we we're still still waiting for official reactions from Israel let's talk about South Africa for a moment South Africa's request for a ceasefire it was just one part of a broader lawsuit filed late last year accusing what does today's ruling what does it mean for for this overarching case right so this kind of set of provisional measures request so this is the fourth time that's out that Africa has returned to the court since filing that case at the end of December last year all of the decisions and determinations that the court makes along the way in responding to these requests for interm Relief these are without prejudice to the case on the merits and so it will still you know it's going to be years away after the court the case has been fully briefed and fully argued that the court will have to decide that underlying question has uh Israel uh violated the genocide convention has it breached its oblig ations under that treaty those questions remain unresolved and it wasn't for the court today to make any kind of determinations about whether what has happened in the past constitutes genocide or necessarily even what's happening right now whether that constitutes genocide this is all about a risk this is about a forward-looking risk and so South Africa has been able to persuade the court that there is a serious urgent risk that unless the court intervenes uh something that might constitute genocide could actually take place and that's what the court has um relied upon in seeing that it's legally uh Justified to issue these measures Mr Becker what does this ruling mean for countries that support Israel and of course I'm thinking of the United States here um for example with with weapons and other military aid um are they on slippery a slippery slope right now I think that was already the case since the Court's order in in in March um and this really does put the uh the Biden Administration in in a difficult position the Biden administration had already suggested that uh if Israel were to proceed with the military offensive in Rafa that this would be kind of a red line for the US uh and we did see that at least certain some limited shipments of weapons were withheld uh but the US seems to be uh taking kind of a very equivocal position on whether what's happening and Rafa constitutes that major military operation that they objected to I think the Court's order today then puts further pressure on the Biden Administration to say enough is enough uh now is the time for uh Israel to step back and find a different way to manage this conflict Michael Becker assistant professor of international human rights law we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us and helping us analyze this story this breaking story here the the the court ordering Israel to stop its military campaign in Rafa thank you thank you
