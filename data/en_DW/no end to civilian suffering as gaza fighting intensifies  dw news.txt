in Gaza fighting between Israel and Hamas is intensifying at the moment the north of Gaza are seeing some of the fiercest battles of the war so far in the South hundreds of thousands are fleeing fighting in the city of Rafa for them there is Little Shelter to run to there is no end to grief and Desperation in Gaza relatives are mourning victims of another attack outside a hospital in the city of Dar albala it hit a nearby refugee camp my uncle's house was targeted last night it was directly hit there were only civilians in the house it was hit in a baric way by the Israeli Army I lost my grandmother my uncle and my aunt in this barbaric attack these are civilians what did they do wrong being killed or wounded is not the only danger that Palestinian civilians are facing across the territory their daily struggle is to find food water and other basic supplies life is unbearable there's no water we bring water from near the sea we walk 5 to 6 kmet and bring four to five containers of water and it's built on the road these trucks are transporting much needed Aid that's been delivered through a US built pier in central Gaza eight groups say it's nowhere near enough for a ravaged territory on the verge of famine we need water we need food we need a decent Life to Live we want to return to our homes we want tents we find nothing to live in all countries live a decent life except us almost the entire population of Gaza is dependent on humanitarian Aid to survive but Israel's restrictions on Aid deliveries are still in place and the fighting continues Israeli operations in the southern city of Rafa have been in the spotlight recently but the patterns of violence and struggle for life are repeating themselves across the territory I'm joined Now by bik sladin a journalist in Tel Aviv bik I wonder what's the Israeli government's response been to the pictures we're seeing the pictures the world are seeing from Gaza right now well at least officially according to the coordinator of government activities in the territory which is the body that is responsible for the delivery of the aid uh 160,000 lers of fuel and Diesel as well as food and Medicine went through went enter entering Gaza through the temporary peer uh the body is also saying that 1,000 trucks entered Gaza Strip through the Ken Shalom Crossing in the south and also the newly opened AAS West AC crossing the north uh today France also announced that uh they are or they have delivered Aid that is following other countries of course but still uh perfect of course and we've heard that but from people that I talked to and also from the photos and videos that we see the markets at least in the central part of Gaza ST which is where the humanitarian area should be has now sufficient amount of thus the prices are down again that's what they are telling me at least but there are two problems that the Israel is dealing with right now first of all the fact that the Egyptian doesn't want to open the Rafa Crossing that doesn't want trucks to enter through that Crossing which is a major thing and also the activists that block the way of trucks that drive through Israel and even burn them uh uh and take also the aid because they don't believe that Aid should be delivered to the gas and to Hamas um moving on Former Defense Minister Benny guns has threatened to resign from Israel's war cabinet unless concrete plans for postwar Gaza are made what leverage does he have at this point well I guess this is Major news in Israel basically means that the unity government is in the brink of collapse Nat doesn't wanted to of course because he is very comfortable on the current situation it is very comfortable politically it's also every decision that he takes right now will be actually described as a decision for the unity government and it's not a political decision or not well I just need to um address that doesn't mean like if guns actually leaves in three weeks it doesn't mean that the netan government will collapse immediately after all he has 40 64 excuse me MERS uh and it does but it does definitely mean that this is beginning of the end because Gallant andish they Min and other members could also be against the Netanyahu government and this shrinks the whole coalition to 62 which means that the if the uh demonstrations did intensify after such a move we could have seen an early election in Israel balik sladin thanks so much
