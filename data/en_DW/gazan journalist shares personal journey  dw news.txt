getting reliable information out of Gaza has become increasingly difficult conditions for journalists are dangerous and only a few people have made it out of the territory Garen journalist hajam baloa is one of them and we'll talk to him in just a moment first though here's a short profile including a few images he recorded from his journey out of the territory ham baloa a longtime reporter and DW contributor since 2012 he's covered many conflicts between is is and Hamas but he says this war is like nothing else he's experienced he's had to strike a balance between objective reporting worries about his family and his personal feelings as a gazin this is footage he took of his neighborhood for him it was clear he could not return the area has been under Fire since October 7th the day of hamas's Terror attacks on Israel ham moved South and kept trying to get the news out amid power outages and with no internet he took this photo of a boy struggling to stay in touch ham took with him just a few keepsakes like this leaflet dropped by the Israeli Army warning people to flee the north he caught the leaflet from a rooftop in a refugee camp on November 3rd he took this footage of his long wait at the Rafa Crossing to enter Egypt and then made his way to Jordan one of the few lucky ones to get out he says he feels guilty leaving his wider Family behind as well as all the other Gins who have nowhere to go well hajim belala is now safe in Jordan's capital Aman and joins us now welcome back hajim um how do you feel about being out of Gaza now it's a mixed feeling to be honest um um I'm I'm happy for myself my family as well especially my children that we are out and safe we are not under bombardment as we used we are uh able to reach water and and and and have uh good food um but in the same time it's very hard for me to uh to leave um um my my rest of the rest of my family or extended family brothers and sisters and father and the journey itself what was that like and and how was it at the Rafa border crossing the journey was very tough and very hard we I learned about myself being on the list around 4:00 a.m. um the day I left on November 3 um um I moved out of um of the refugee that I stayed at anat refugee camp in the central Gaza strap I uh I was struggling to uh to get some gasoline for my car to be able to drive as I was um out of it um luckily the day before I secured 4 lad with a very high price um that made me able to drive down to Rafa uh where I arrived there about 7 um 7:30 in the morning and till about 700 p.m. in the same day I crossed out of the Egyptian terminal plus 6 to 7 hours driving to Cairo um till we stayed there for um uh for a week then uh last Friday I came to a man here the um what you said there about having to get the the the petrol that's just a very Vivid reminder of even if you get the good news that you can get out your your troubles are only just sort of starting given the the the conditions that are in the territory at the moment well the situation in Gaza is is very hard I'm still attached to the place but because of two things main mainly is like because of my family are there my house is there probably it is destroyed uh as it's part of the the grand Invasion area um secondly because I am a journalist and I'm keeping an eye on it and I'm still reporting um um and I'm you know trying to do my best from here from Aman communicating with people and there the situation is miserable uh um just like half an hour ago there is um a new Blackout um as the telecommunication companies announced um no longer uh ability to uh operate the the the stations and the towers so uh we are not able to communicate with OD people there or even they can't communicate with each other right and so um I I know it's uh that you're still in touch with people and things are getting worse or are people just sort of uh resigned to uh to a a terrible situation continuing to be terrible well it is terrible from day one um but I mean as the War continued for longer time things are getting harder uh little availability of goods little availability of water uh uh uh people run out of of cash um prices raised up um some some items like to uh four five times or even more in some um in some some items um uh people are uh more people are killed more casualties uh hospitals are not able to treat patients um there is a huge load uh I'm I'm communicating with people it's very hard to connect them even with the availability of communication in theory but reaching them with with a lack of electricity and and and and uh um um and signals you know like it's very hard I I try like 20 times at least to reach uh someone in Gaza um there is no internet um uh today I talked to my brother there and he says like the prices at least for for the food uh four times than it used to be when I you were there tell me how people as you talk to to people uh in Gaza how do they regard Hamas is there widespread support or or anger at them well uh in Gaza people are divided um uh I'm not telling a secret there are some voices criticizing Hamas and climing it for what happened uh and they say that out loud on and on social media whether videos or texts I saw many tweets many posts on on Facebook and and some some um uh on Instagram um some uh WhatsApp groups uh I talk to people personally when I was there or now when I'm out I'm I'm talking to people still some people are criticizing Hamas but in the same time there are other people who are supporting uh uh what they call it resistance and they blame Israel this is what Israel is not this is because of Israel is doing it maybe they are not supporting what happened on on October 7 and and but still that they blame Israel for what's happening right now in Gaza okay thanks for that ha and good talking to you as ever um glad you're safe um I look forward to speaking to you
