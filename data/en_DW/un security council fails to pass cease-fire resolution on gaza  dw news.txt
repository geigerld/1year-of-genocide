I'm Phil Gail welcome to the program the UN Security Council has failed to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza Russia and China vetoed the resolution which had been put forward by the United States the measure called for an immediate and sustained ceasefire tied to the release of hostages held by Hamas it's the fourth time the council has failed to pass a vote calling for a ceasefire here is the US ambassador to the UN let's be honest for all the fiery retoric we all know that Russia and China are not doing anything diplomatically to advance a lasting peace or to meaningfully contribute to the humanitarian response effort colleagues there is obviously another resolution that some of you would like to be considered but in its current form that text fails to support sensitive diplomacy in the region worse it is it could actually give Hamas an excuse to walk away from the deal on the table let's go to our Washington correspondent Stefan Simon welcome Stefan so Russia and China vetoing this un us sponsored ceasefire resolution um was this expected no actually it wasn't expected you know uh the staff uh of the US ambassador to the UN worked and diplomats in the state department and the White House here worked for weeks on the on a draft on the text for this so I think before they brought this to the UN Security Council they were actually at least largely hopeful that it would pass perhaps because as you mentioned four times now including this one that the security Council failed um uh going forward with a any resolution three times of uh those four times the US vetoed now it's China and Russia and of course the feeling here in the US is that Russia and the and China did this not as we just heard from the Ambassador US ambassador to the UN did this for actually diplomatic reasons but to put the US in a box to basically let's say Stick it to the Man um they want a unconditional ceasefire the US was and that is by the way a major shift in their policy already uh I have to really emphasize this this was a major step forward the US now calling for a immediate and sustained ceasefire that was officially not enough for the Russians and the Chinese all right well given that massive change of us position it it it does sound hypocritical for the US now to criticize uh the the likes of Russia and China for vetoing when as you say uh they have vetoed three times themselves why is it different why does the you why does the US regard this as being different uh from those other three times when they uh were the veto well from a US pers perspective this is a major leap of the Biden White House and the US Administration to call out Israel and say like listen you need to stop your what you're doing basically in not allowing enough humanitarian Aid into Gaza we need a ceasefire we need it now immediately and it needs to be able to be sustained that means indefinite it needs to be indefinite as long as we need the Us and other partners need to put more aid push massive Aid needs and S and satisfy those massive eight needs in Gaza the CIA director William Burns is as we speak now in Qatar actually um you know negotiating working on a deal with Hamas for a hostage release that is still very imperative for the United States should be for Israel too you know Mr blinkin is in Israel right now it's not it doesn't seem to turn out being a good day for us diplomacy here but again the US is going compare to what they did before or what they were able to and willing to say before the extra mile now saying sustained and immediate ceasefire and lots of lots of Aid immediately into Gaza it's not going to happen via the un uh Security Council and Via a resolution you may want to say does that actually matter if the UN and the UN Security Council um adopts a resolution which says that or is it more more important for the US and others just to push forward with Aid into Gaza to help those people there in a very very very difficult situation well that's not for me to decide okay so uh briefly then Stefan um where does the how does the US proceed from here I think the US is for the time being done with pushing any resolution it will in the un uh but uh diplomatic effort will continue and I think the Biden Administration has to also for political reasons here within the United States remember we have a presidential campaign presidential elections this year and the Biden Administration needs some success on this topic Gaza Israel war uh because of American uh Arab or Arab American voters uh so they will push forward that's why Mr blinkin is in the Middle East that's why the CIA director is in in Cutter and that's why the US meditation as a whole will push forward to get their agenda through and get a ceasefire into Gaza okay Stefan zimmons in Washington thank you so much all right we want to go now to Tel Aviv I'm joined by Myra zanine of the international crisis group she's a senior analyst focused on Israeli Palestinian issues and Regional conflicts it's good to have you with us Russia and China vetoing this us sponsored resolution what do you make of that did did you expect this vote well I think uh it's it's pretty clear that the US is trying to at least appear to be doing something on the front uh of the Israel Gaza War but uh in effect the US has not called for a ceasefire permanent ceasefire which I think everybody understands at this point is necessary because of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza uh Russia and China of course have their own interests uh in in vetoing or abstaining or going against the US resolution politically but either way the resolution itself did not call for a ceasefire without condition which is I believe what many of the members were looking for and and the fact that this us back resolution failed to pass in the UN Security Council can Israel now claim this as a a sort of Victory well Israel claims plenty of Victories when it can the icj South Africa hearing the fact that it didn't uh actually re call for a ceasefire or uh uh decide that Israel was actually committing genci side only the potential was claimed as a victory by Israel um you know so Israel could certainly claim this as a victory Israel still has full us backing for this War uh and it continues with its offensive and continues to make threats as about Rafa as
