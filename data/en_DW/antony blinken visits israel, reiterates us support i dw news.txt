US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has told Israel that the US will always be by its side blinkin made the comment at a press conference after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv blink's words come as the UN says nearly 340,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Gaza with fears of a humanitarian crisis growing as Israel continues to launch air strikes against the territory Israel says that it's hitting targets linked to the terrorist group Hamas in retaliation for its unprecedented attacks over the weekend that killed at least 1,00 people in Israel meanwhile Palestinian authorities in Gaza say more than a thousand people have been killed there from Israeli strikes President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil Hamas is Isis and just as Isis was crushed so too will Kamas be crushed and Hamas should be treated exactly the way Isis was treated they should be spit out from the community of Nations no leader should meet them no country should Harbor them and those that do should be friend I say to you I say to all of us the there will be many difficult days ahead you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but as long as America exists you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side let's bring in senior International correspondent funny faar who is in Jerusalem funny tell us a little bit more about the message that blink Inn brought to Israel what we have seen in the press conference play out is basically what we have heard before the arrival of us Secretary State blink already which is a clear sign of support that the US stands stands side by side with Israel now uh blink basically saying that Israel is going to get whatever it needs to defend itself is of course a clear encouragement for Israel to do what it takes for them from their perspective to uh take out Hamas and make sure that that militant group that terrorist organization that's being defined as a terrorist group by the US by the European Union by Germany by so many other countries that they really get that support however exactly this sentence by uh secretary of state blinkin is also a question uh whether that support by the us is going to quell the violence actually or rather widen the violence here in the region and just from a very israelian perspective here what people are really wondering about whether the rhetorics that were displayed there by uh Mr blinkin whether that's going to bring some pragmatic solution there when it comes for example number one to the hostages that are being held captive since Saturday since Hammer militants um Unleashed this terrorist attack an estimated 150 people are being held captive among those a lot of Americans as well from a Palestinian perspective of course people ask themselves whether the US is able to do something to increase the diplomacy with Egypt and Israel to make sure that before Israel is going on with the next step to start its H ground offensive which is really appears to be quite imminent that Palestinians can leave Gaza but through through which channel really because the only border and there's conflicting information whether the Rafa Crossing between Egypt and and and Gaza is open or not but uh the question really is whether people can get out and if they cannot whether at least humanitarian Aid can get in so despite the fact that as expected of course the us being a very strong very important Ally for Israel and beside the fact that Mr Mr blink has expressed his support people from all different sides here wonder what his visit will actually going to have a Fallout uh for Israel for Gaza and The Wider region funny um linkoln also arriving with a message of deterrence both for uh States and other actors in the region uh he will head to Jordan uh we understand tell us a little bit more about um what he wants to convey in the region so as it is laid out as a Middle East Tour to say so because it doesn't end here in Israel as he just pointed out in fact uh Mr blinkin wants to visit the leaders of Jordan King Abdullah II and also the uh leader of the Palestinian authorities so Mr Abbas uh on Friday now all these diplomatic undertakings of course are also way for the United States to show that first of all they do not want to go back to square one uh one may recall that before all of this started on Saturday uh the US was really pushing for Israel to normalize uh in some way of the other ties uh with Arabic countries for example Saudi Arabia so uh the US is trying to show with these diplomatic meetings that the United States is in Israel but at the same time also signal towards Iran for example they should not get involved in to in this entire conflict funny forar in Jerusalem thank you and US President Joe Biden says his administration is working to secure the release of Americans who are among the hostages taken by Hamas Biden says he spoke again to prime minister Netanyahu and urged Israel to observe the rules of War he said the US would help to make sure that Israel has all the help it needs in the days ahead we're going to continue to work closely with our partners in Israel and around the world to ensure Israel has what it needs to defend its citizens and cities and to respond these attacks as I said yesterday my commitment to Israel's security and the safety of the Jewish people is unshakable the United States has Israel's back LW special correspondent a Ibrahim joins us now live from Washington DC a haer President Biden is again throwing us support behind Israel but also urging some restraint what's being made of that in Washington it's a message that we've heard the US president make for the second time Jared yesterday when he addressed uh the nation in a in in that speech where we saw secretary Anthony blinkin on one side and vice president camela Harris on the other he said that um you know democracies have to abide by rule of law even in situations like this uh where there is a war he said it again today at a meeting with Jewish uh Community lead leaders at uh the White House U and this this message of restraint um is you know as we see the the the offensive on Gaza increas in intensity and as we see the picture of the toll that this is uh taking on uh civilians not just President Joe Biden but we've also heard uh the UN secretary uh General uh you know urging uh Israel in its um offensive to to to weed out uh uh terrorists in Gaza to take into consideration the lives of uh innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip it's a very densely populated area we also know that the US Administration is trying to work out some sort of humanitarian Corridor that would allow civilians uh to exit the Gaza Strip but that is something that is still in uh in in a very uh early stage of negotiation we also um we know that 22 Americans have up until the this point lost uh their lives uh in this flare up of violence but there are also believed to be hostages uh within uh the the hostages that were taken in the uh to Gaza that are US citizens and so of course uh that is also a concern for the US Administration moving on to another Point Aya now of course one of the big fears since the attack on Saturday has been any involvement by Iran which supports Hamas so President Biden sent another warning to tan tell us a bit more about that we heard him today uh name Iran directly in the past couple of days we've heard from the president and also from the Secretary of State time and time again saying that uh players countries in the regions should not take advantage uh of this situation to advance their own geopolitical interests uh that was always seen as a veiled uh warning to tan which is known to known to have supported Hamas uh in the past um but so far there is no evidence according to the US Administration linking Iran tan to this uh latest terror attack uh but the administration officials remind us again and again that they are you know there's support flowing from tan to Hamas but the evidence they haven't ruled it out but they just don't have it uh at this point Thank You DW's special correspondent a Ibrahim in Washington Aya thanks now President Biden was speaking after meeting with leaders of America's Jewish Community many American Jews have close ties to Israel and are deeply upset about what happened DW went to meet some of them and hear what they had to say [Music] these are days of mourning for the American Jewish Community the United States is home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel on this night at the nation's capital hundreds gathered to seek comfort in one another it's communal and we're all grieving together and we're all crying together the music I think one of the rabbis said we need to sing and I thought yeah everybody here has an attachment to Israel like we for example our children go to camp with Israeli counselors one of them was killed we learned this morning so you know everybody's been touched by it and it's uh it's just a very difficult time no there's no question the American Support is crucial and the president has been unequivocal in his support in some ways he's I think set the tone for all all politics and and and every corner of the United States um by using his his position and being so Resolute together together Israel is America's closest Ally in the Middle East the US was the first to recognize Israel's statehood and it was on those close Ties That President Joe Biden Drew upon in his message of unwavering support for Israel so in this moment we must be Crystal Clear we stand stand with Israel we stand with Israel and we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens defend itself and respond to this attack there's no justification for terrorism to that end the US has dispatched its Navy's newest and most advanced carrier the USS Gerald R Ford to help W off an escalation of the conflict Advanced Weaponry has landed in Israel as well but beyond the necessity of supporting a strong response analyst Barbara slaven says she hopes that behind the scenes calls for restraint and the importance of preserving civilian lives are being made the Biden Administration has done a good job so far of condemning the uh atrocities that were committed uh calling them pure evil in this hour of Israel's extreme need um I am hopeful that there are also private messages that are being sent to the Israelis uh not to let their desire for vengeance overcome both their morality and their strategic thinking uh because there is going to be a need to pick up the pieces when this is all over and there have to be interlocutors for the Israelis uh the United States and others to try to restore some kind of calm and to project some kind of positive future for the Palestinians going forward otherwise uh we are going to see this uh this horror movie over and over again for now although the ongoing Horrors weigh heavily on the hearts of the Jewish Community there's an attempt here to Stand United in sorrow and grief but in Hope For Peace well International reactions to Hamas hamas's attack in Israel and the Israeli AAL bombardment of the Gaza Strip have shown the widely differing views of the conflict around the world let's have a listen anger in Indonesia at the staunt support Israel is getting from the US hundreds of members of different Islamic groups gathered outside the US Embassy in Jakarta to protest demanding an end to the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip as oppressed people Palestinians must defend their country striving for their nation's Independence is a duty therefore the Palestinian people's resistance against Israel is justifiable on the streets of taka in Bangladesh more protests around a thousand members of an islamist group chanted slogans for the [Applause] Palestinians Palestinians must have their rights and lands returned to them they must be compensated all those who were killed in the past should be compensated According to Islamic Sharia law we demand an end to the nighttime attacks on Palestine there have also been Pro Palestinian demonstrations by religious groups in Pakistan Jordan and thousands of miles away in South Africa support for Israel is strong too showing the Deep divisions being exposed by this conflict support of Israel like here in Australia at a state level such a traumatic week for all of us but we're so aware how much more traumatic it's been for the people of Israel and our hearts are broken for what's gone on and we send our prayers every minute every hour every day to the people of Israel and all the people that have been lost and that are injured and kidnapped it's just the most horrific situation in New York the city with the largest Jewish community in the world outside of Israel many gathered in solidarity and in Rome thousands remembered the Israelis guilt in the Hamas attack I hope they find a peace agreement because this situation is not good for any of us I hope it will end as soon as possible because two populations are suffering and Israel is truly suffering an aggression never seen before here in Chile people held a vigil for those Israelis who lost their lives as the world grapples with a conflict that shows no sign of
