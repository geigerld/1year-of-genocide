Amos Gilead is a retired Major General with the Israel Defense Forces and an intelligence and Military expert and I asked him earlier what steps he expected Israel to take next no I'm not assessing what the Prime Minister will do I think that uh we need to keep our privilege of course to to have the right operation in due time anyway we are in war with Iran Iran using PR Proxes in order to attack us from all sides of Israel and Iran itself is very hostile not only to Israel to the whole region and to the Western Civilization if I may say and there threshold nuclear power so generally speaking Iran is very hostile Rogue State and it's one stage of this ongoing struggle that's the way we need to see it me should respon or not sorry what should a response look like then without risking a major regional conflict what does it mean first of all we have been attacked I mean we need to respond but in due time and in ways it will serve our national security interest it does not mean we need to react immediately we can take time we can be tolerant we can be I mean it's a matter of wisdom also yeah we don't need to do what they are expecting us to do that was am gillad speaking to us earlier well Marina Moran a military analyst from King's College in London also gave us her view on what could be Israel's next steps good day Nicole it's a very difficult question because we don't know how Israel will react and indeed on the one hand we have a lot of international pressure most notably from the United States but also from Germany the United Kingdom on Israel to basically not respond and the Allies made it very clear that they will not be involved in any Counterattack on Iran on the other hand um for Benjamin Netanyahu now this is a huge problem because he has hardliners which are important to his political future who are saying that israels has to resonate throughout the Middle East Israel has to respond and to respond heavily in order to reestablish its own deterrent which has been eroded after the October 7th attacks so it it's a very difficult situation specifically because if Israel is to retaliate heavily against Iran there is no certainty that the Allies will come to help a second time and of course um it also puts into question the allegiance of of um the gulf countries who have allegedly helped um Jordan has helped we know that but some of the others like the UAE and Saudi Arabia they tried to kind of distance themselves from this but still they provided intelligence and so they will have to be choosing between Israel and Iran in a sense of course they are no friends of Iran but this will be a very difficult situation for them giv the power dynamics that exist in the Middle East yeah so it remains to be seen which way Israel goes yeah but behind closed doors you know whatever analysts you speak to it seems like neither Iran nor Israel seem to be all too interested in an allout War this looks like we're in an eye for an eye situation though with neither side wanting to be seen as weak how big do you consider the danger of this spiraling further out of control well the problem here is that Iran didn't want an allout War it wanted to withdraw the red lines and this strike which many said oh it was a strategic failure for Iran was actually a very smart strategic move because without causing any destruction it managed to withraw that red line now for Israel Israel cannot afford a war right now because it's already at War and it depends on the support of the Allies most notably the United States in order to achieve its objectives in Gaza so neither of them want a war but neither of them want to risk their reputation and specifically Israel which believes to be surrounded by enemies and we don't know how far the Abram Accords will go in this sense because um because of the October 7th attacks everything has been put on hold so Israel has to demonstrate its strengths in order to deter those potential enemies such as Hezbollah for instance or ansara the hoodis in Yemen to not attack Israel so there can be also a miscalculation for instance imagine that attack that Iran launched would have led to death of civilians on Israeli soil if not everything had been shut down so there is a risk of also the these unknowns that could lead to an escalation without either side Wan one yeah a rather big unknown is Iran's nuclear program we know that it is evolving we don't really know where it stands how much should that factor into Israel's calculations here well I think it will factor in a lot if we remember that Israel has already made an attempt to undermine it um back then when launching stock net but um the problem here is that this time Israel might be more tempted to strike directly at military targets and nuclear facilities within Iran and for Iran of course this is exactly why Iran doesn't want the war because it wants to finish its nuclear program develop nuclear weapons in order to have a solid deterrent against Israel and against the United States so certainly that will be something that is factored in that being said we don't know how Iran will respond then should Israel launch any direct strike on Iranian nuclear facilities or maybe there will be a more covered way to try to undermine it we're joined Now by Yogen hot he's the foreign policy spokesperson for the opposition conservative CDU in the German Parliament thank you so much for joining DW Mr Hunt Germany always says it has this profound historical responsibility to Israel's defense and yet it didn't join the US UK France and Jordan in helping shoot down these Iranian drones and missiles over the weekend now should Germany prepare to do that if tensions keep Rising first of i' like to state that uh we we are very much impressed about the way the israelian were able to um defeat that attack from the night before last night together with allies from different countries but also from some AR with some Arab states we talk about Jordan probably also Saudi Arabia were supporting that and that is a huge political progress and this is a huge political Capital now for Israel on its side to see that there are friends also in the Arabian World Arab world that are supporting Israel in its need for defend and therefore Israel should have all into account not only saying what is our answer but also having in mind what others uh uh um see on that all right back to my question though does Germany exactly do should they take on a more active role in helping Israel defend itself in these kinds of attacks uh I would like to ask that our government probably we can do it behind closed doors because not everything can put on the table probably in in public speeches but from my point of view first if Israel is asking for armed and AR Armament and ammunition from Germany Germany should stay to its commitment and deliver weapons to Israel to make sure that Israel is able to defend itself second if Israel sees uh the chance that Germany can support um Israel by defending and maybe to be well repair in case that something like happened two nights ago can happen again Germany should be open-minded on that and the do bundus should be involved as it is necessary with the Mandate we have two options we have this friger in the Red Sea um the Frat hessen she's now close to going back to Germany due to the systematic of that mandate but we also have um air fueling capabilities in Jordan with the German Armed Forces German air force both probably is maybe feasible but there if there is no demand from Israel we should not use that in that way probably it's better for Germany to have a role that way we replace um um needs of of short shortage from our allies like UK or great or or us in the region or in Europe because if they fight for for Israel that we can replace that what they are doing in the region on other fields for example in the anti- Das mandate we have if Israel asked for for more support from Germany for example by by reinforcing that frig that you mentioned that is already in the Red Sea would you willing to be the person to put that forward in the bundes would you actively push for that among friends it's uh clear for me that we should take every um demand of Israel to us serious and that we should judge on that in a way prob ID idly in a way that all Democratic parties since the do bundist support that and I can state that I am open-minded and I think Al my political group CDU is open-minded to every concrete um demand I didn't see that at the moment but I will not exclude that for for the future among friends all should be put on the table and discussed all right that was foreign policy spokesperson yugen hot for the CDU and the German bundist talk thank you so much for your time and we can dig a Little Deeper now with Middle East expert Daniel G Daniel welcome to the show so how much has the status quo in the Middle East changed over the past couple of days over this weekend well I think it has dramatically changed but still it's following certain rules which is quite interesting um the Iranians notified uh the Arab neighbors and made sure that the US would be notified in time they they gave is the time to prepare for this but nevertheless the Iranians took an enormous risk they they jeopardized the life of hundreds of Israeli citizens probably because they could not rely on the Israeli air defense to fend off this attack um on the other hand the ball is now in the Israeli field uh the Netanyahu government uh announced that it will respond and I think it will it will take some time because it's not in a hurry to responds because it's been basically Victorious at the moment and not only it it it managed to defend off this attack but but also politically it managed to to Rally around the flag again to unite the Allies behind Israel and you see like uh I mean the statements of Yogen har indicate that very much it seems to me almost as if Germany and large parts of the western Camp are almost relieved about this crisis to happen because it it takes away the attention of the from from the Gaza war from the ongoing War that's uh that's that's costing the lives of Palestinians every day the dramatic situation in the West Bank and now everyone who found it more and more difficult to to to sell their position on Israel to their own public to their own constituency can now say we stand behind Israel in this in this existential crisis for the country so this unprecedented attack could end up playing into netanyahu's hands is what you're saying absolutely I think he I think he he he even provoked this you know Netanyahu is is really the master of the game here he he he has a tendency towards brinkmanship since recently like the years before he has been in international politics for a long time and he always tried to avoid a confrontation but in the last couple of months he has been like pushing for this he has been provoking the Iranians and he was of course ready and he knew that the Iranians would respond to this um and uh I think he managed to take the risk to achieve the effect uh and at the same time uh it didn't cost a single Israeli life so far so uh we see that he's really playing this masterfully and though everyone involved knows this uh they're still like supporting him at the moment yeah so the Allies are are back on his side right now but they are urging restraint all of them nobody wants to see an allout war in the Middle East who has the leverage to actually get him there or is it really also not in netanyahu's interest to see this spiraling out of control um out of control that's exactly the point um all the conflict parties are trying to push this really to the boundaries and to push the boundaries but to make make sure that they're not losing control and they could lose control if the escalation went too far and everyone is is is is who is involved knows about this I think the US are really returning to the role of a powerful broker in the Middle East because ironically let's say in this confrontation with Iran the US almost is in mediating position the US seems now strong and powerful and influential uh but they're not a conflict party I mean of course indirectly they are on the side of Israel but they appear to be a more mediating power but we should look a bit at the role of the Arab states also in the region because I think the Arab states are playing an interesting and also constructive role like to the majority regardless if it's uh Saudi Arabia Jordan or even Iraq who made it abundantly clear that they do not want a regional escalation because they would be the ones who would suffer from it and they don't want to distract the attention away from the plight of the Palestinians and of course they are very much acting in their own self-interest and they want to stabilize their own power and they need stability and they need quiet for that a lot of um leaders are now calling for sanctions on Terran to kind of ramp up the pressure can that really make a difference in all of this well if you talk about a lot of leaders then you're probably referring to a lot of Western leaders um and I think the global reality is a bit a different one than from what we've seen 10 years ago when the Iran nuclear deal was struck I think at the moment we're in a situation where Iran not only for the first time in its history has something that comes close to to military ally which is Russia and others um and we have a global reality in which large parts of the global South are actually not on the Iranian side but consider the Iranians as being in the defensive here and I think this this the the Iranians have been have been benefiting from this change of narrative on the global level to a great extent and they have China and other Global players the brics countries that are willing to not if not to support Iran but uh definitely not to condemn it so when you talk about sanctions you have to be very specific the the Western sanctions have been very strong and uh on on Iran and the and trade has gone down to a pretty minimum level at the moment and then if you talk about sanctions you should also ask the people in Iran who are not at all involved in the politics of this regime what they think about it if you really want to suffocate the Iranian economy more than it already is ask the human rights defendants the women that have been rising up two years ago if this is in their interest I doubt that to be honest but this they shouldn't give any Prejudice on a careful study about the impact of San that was Daniel G thank you so much thank you
