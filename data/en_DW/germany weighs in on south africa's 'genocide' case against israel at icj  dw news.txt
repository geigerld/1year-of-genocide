after the first two days of hearings at the international court of justice in the ha Israel continues to defend its military operation in Gaza as an act of self-defense in response to the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks a South African delegation argued that Israel's offensive was going beyond that to them it's an attempt to destroy the Palestinians as a people claims that amount to genocide now the German federal government says it will request to join the case as a third party in support of Israel Berlin says there is no basis for South Africa's accusations well for more on this story I'm joined by DW political correspondent Julia selli Julia great to see you so Germany wants to join the trial as a third party how could that affect the court case well jining as a third party doesn't mean that Germany will then be directly uh implicated in the case in the dispute but it allows Germany to to bring forward written statements and to participate in the oral proceedings and that would mean that Germany could bring forward its own legal interpretation of the case and of the convention on genocide now it also is not uh an obligation for parties that join the proceedings to state which side they're on but we've heard clearly from statements made by the German government that Germany is taking part to stand on the side of Israel and is against the accusations brought by South Africa we heard from a government spokesman that uh Germany rejects these accusations and says that they are baseless and Germany also sees this case as uh politically instrumentalizing the convention on genocide and we've also heard similar strong statements coming from the economy Minister Robert habek who was in Israel on Thursday and let's have a listen my personal and political opinion is that one can criticize the Israeli military for using harsh measures in the Gaza Strip however that does not constitute genocide those who would commit genocide or desire to do so if given the opportunity are Hamas the annihilation of the state of Israel is on their agenda so we can understand the slogan from The River To The Sea as not meaning that Jews should leave Israel by boat but as an Extinction fantasy accusing Israel of genocide is a complete Distortion of victims and perpetrators in my view and it is just wrong right Julia so very clear statement there from Robert habc tell us why is Germany getting involved in this case at all well our countries that signed the convention on genocide can take part in proceedings as a third party and in uh this case we don't see this as the first case that Germany joins proceedings they've done that recently in a case brought against against Myanmar uh for accusations of genocide uh against the rohinga and also Germany joined the case against Russia for its war and Ukraine and in those two cases Germany uh supported the accusations of genocide in the case of Israel it is not and we see that Germany wants to stand by Israel being one of Israel's strongest allies uh right now and also though there is a sense of historical responsibility on the side of Germany given that the genocide convention was born out of the atrocities of World War II as a sign of never again and also out of uh the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust so Germany sees itself as responsible to ensure that the convention is interpreted correctly in the way that Germany sees it correctly so it wants to also take a principled stand in this case thanks Julia for breaking that down for us tww political correspondent Julia
