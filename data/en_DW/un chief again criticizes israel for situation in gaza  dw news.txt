United Nations Secretary General Antonio gutieres has once again condemned the Hamas attack on Israel he has also criticized the high number of Civilian casualties that the Israeli Army offensive is causing in Gaza there are violations by Hamas when they have human uh Shields but uh when one looks at the number of civilians that were killed with the military operations there is something that is clearly wrong the highest number of killing of children by any of the actors in all the conflicts that we witness is the maximum in the hundreds we have in a few days in Gaza thousands and thousands of children kills that was you Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez speaking earlier I'm joined Now by Mark Weller he is a professor of international law at the University of Cambridge he's also served as a un mediation expert Mr Weller it's good to have you with us you are aware like many that numerous NOS have accused Israel of committing war crimes by attacking civilian areas now Israel says it's hitting Hamas military targets that it has warned civilians and told them to go south to avoid being hit and yet we know civilians have been killed what does international law say about this international law demands that any party to a conflict must apply what is called the principle of distinct you must always be able specifically to Target the combatants of the other side and keep safe as much as possible the civilians what the UN Secretary General uh has just said is that on the face of it uh if Israel has lost let's say 30 or 40 of its service members in this conflict and on the other hand 10,000 civilians have died that the balance uh that should exist between protection of civilians and Military gain seems to be out of hand in this instance we know that Israel has used the right to selfdefense um to justify the attacks that we're seeing many Western countries have also supported this how far is the right of self-defense applicable the right of self-defense applies it is clear that the attack of the 7th of October launched by Hamas entitles Israel to respond even through the use of force but that use of force must be targeted specifically at Hamas and its Fighters at the threat of further terrorism which Israel is entitled to remove if necessary forcibly the fact that Hamas itself uh will have committed a grave war crime through the atrocities of the 7th of October does not mean that the civilians in Palestine have lost their status as people under the protection of humanitarian law that means that Israel must not undertake strikes against targets uh where the civilian injury is excessive in relation to the military gain that this kind of attack brings and that I think is the principle criticism that in this case even if it is alleged that uh there are uh Hamas operatives hiding under buildings or someone somewhere else uh that that doesn't relieve Israel of the obligation still to minimize damage to civilians even if that means it will be more difficult for their soldiers to engage the Hamas Fighters but if it is true that Hamas is embedding itself in areas that have that are densely populated with civilians then any attack is going to inevitably result in civilian deaths right most uh Advanced militaries and this does certainly in include Israel uh actually have targeters lawyers who sit and consider whether any particular attack is lawful and the balance in each case has to be made if there even if there is some sort of amas infrastructure under a particular Target uh we're not quite persuaded that that is always the case when buildings are targeted sometimes it looks like retaliation but even if that is the case that doesn't relieve Israel of the duty of protection of civilians it can't just say that these are human Shields they are not willing human Shields who place themselves in this danger there are civilians who do not lose their entitlement to protection or at least uh Israel has to ensure that the damage to civilians so-called incidental damage or injury is not out of proportion to the military gain that any particular operation brings and that seems to be something that becomes problematic as this conflict continues and as the actions of the military uh by on the side of Israel do seem to be disproportionately affecting civilians and you know what you say there you're you're speaking about proportionality we know that the Geneva conventions say that Warfare must be guided by the principles of proportionality can we speak of proportionality with more than 10,500 Palestinian death if we are to believe what the Gaza health authority is saying yeah I think few people doubt that there are extraordinary numbers of Civilian deaths and that is why the UN Secretary General has pointed to this imbalance uh between the alleged military benefit that Israel claims it is pursuing in any particular attack and the evidently disproportionate civilian injuries that result and that is one of the principal criticisms of Israel and I think it's correct to be critical and the other one is to deprive civilian concentrations of that which is necessary for the survival uh depriving uh the civilians of food of water of hospitals of energy uh cannot really be justified Israel says well otherwise Hamas might take over some of those supplies but the answer to that is that the icrc the UN or other agencies could Safeguard and ensure that only civilians benefit and um the present practice of displacing a million people into an area that itself is subject to attack and then denying humanitarian supplies to those civilians which you have driven out uh that is also uh very difficult to justify earlier I spoke to hin kadori a Palestinian journalist in Gaza City and I asked her to describe the situation there right now um I'm in the middle of I'm in the center of the Gaza City right now it's dark um all I hear is explosions I really don't know where these explosions are but I assume they are in the north northern area of the C TR we're talking about Baha jabalia and these areas I can see like thunderstorm but this is not Thunder this is like and explosion um uh erupting um uh the situation today has been um catastrophic to be honest we have been uh listening to a lot of appeals from different citizens callings that they have been injured in different areas in the Cal strip and no one is is is being able to to rescue them no one's being able to go and help them uh we got appeals from people in schools people uh that have been uh like their houses have been bombed people were under the rubble no civil defense no ambulances were able to to rescue them or to transort them transort them the hospital um it's dark right now it's night and everyone in the Gaza there are 2.3 million power in the Gaza right now uh hating the fact that it's night right now and it's dark and there's a lot of explosions happening right now all right for more now we want to cross over to journalist Sami suul in Jerusalem Sami what are you hearing from the Israel Defense Forces about their operation in and around Gaza City yeah well I can tell you that the Israeli military is very content uh with the progress of this campaign and they're talking about very good cooperation between the ground forces and the Air Force and the artillery and at the same time you have both regular Army and reserve duty soldiers in big numbers and and they're saying that things are coming along smoothly true that they face resistance uh no one is has been surrendering they haven't seen any Hamas Fighters surrendering but they say that in all the different battles that they've had so far they have been winning and they're now exposing also tunnels and the IDF spokesperson has exposed um recordings and evidence so they say that Hamas has is using ambulances and different facilities for their Fighters you say that the Israeli military is content with where they are right now in in Gaza what about the Israeli public Sami are are they satisfied with the way that their government is handling this conflict I think when it comes to the to the Gaza Strip uh the the public here in Israel is definitely supportive of an aggressive uh approach and uh even Benny gun who kind of like was in the opposition and is now in the war cabinet H he's same line together with Netanyahu and this is kind of like the the bulk the majority of the Israeli public uh and what they want to see is the kind of destruction of Hamas they're talking about elim ating the threat and they don't want to be stopped and therefore all the talk about ceasefires is something that they see as something that could threaten the forces on ground Sami there are reports that Qatar is trying to mediate for a possible release of some of the hostages what can you tell us about that yeah well the reports are uh we have different kinds of reports we have also reports coming out of Qatar we have reports coming out of Egypt uh also the Egyptians have some proposals According to some reports we're talking about the release of 50 and other reports talks about the release of 12 hostages half of them American uh and and we're talking about a a ceasefire of 72 hours but I can tell you that the Israeli military and the Israeli government they're not interested in a ceas fire and they've made it very clear in statements this evening uh the ID of spokesperson said that they're not interested netan said that there is no ceas fire uh so at this point of time it's difficult to see that this is actually going to happen journalist Sammy so with the latest from Jerusalem tonight Sammy is always thank
