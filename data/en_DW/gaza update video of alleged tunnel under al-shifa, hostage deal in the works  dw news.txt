the Hamas ran Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 12 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike in the Palestinian territory a spokesman for the ministry said the strike hit the Indonesian Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip the report comes after Israel's military carried out another night of operations inside Gaza explosions and flares were seen in the south of the region Israel's Army says its missile defenses system also shot down a number of Rock it's coming from Gaza the Army says it's stepping up its operations by targeting additional neighborhoods now let's get more on this with DW correspondent Tanya kma joining us from Jerusalem Tanya has Israel reacted to reports of the strike on the hospital today we have not seen a statement yet on the strike of the hospital where uh we we've seen some footage that reportedly shows heavy fighting around uh the Indonesian hospital that is in the north heavy fighting has also been reported uh from other areas as Israel's Army is uh reportedly moving uh you know even deeper inside some of the neighborhoods uh broadening uh the uh also the operation uh of the ground forces but of course air strikes are also uh continuing they also have been reported air strikes in the south of the Gaza Strip uh namely in Rafa this is the city on the southern end of uh the Gaza Strip and we are also hearing you know about the humanitarian situation by United Nations agencies they're saying that about 1.7 million people out of the 2.2 million residents in the Gaza Strip are now on the Move have been displaced uh most of them many of them I have to say went to the South for safer areas but air bombardment of course there is also uh ongoing and there's also concern now for another matter because you know there's colder weather now we've seen also pictures coming out of Gaza pouring rain and many people are there in shelters that are overcrowded so this is of course also a concern for the humanitarian uh stakeholders there um which is already very dire um until now now uh the hostage negotiations seem to be underway have you heard anything about any progress on these negotiations well there have been a lot of reports in the past days uh also we've been hearing uh from Qatar from officials there saying uh that there are ups and downs uh in the negotiations but that the sides are edging closer to a potential deal but nothing seems to be really tangible right now so it's only a speculation how such a deal are could look like qat is the main mediator between uh Israel and Hamas and also United States and Egypt are a stakeholders as we understand in these negotiations so we understand from some reports there could be up to 50 hostages mainly women elderly and children that could be released uh they should also be uh uh that's a demand we understand by Hamas a a pause in hostilities because they also have to get all the hostages safe uh uh out and we also understand that Hamas is asking but these are all unconfirmed reports I have to stress uh that uh all female prisoners and children currently being held in Israeli prisons uh should be released but again you know for the moment uh we know that negotiations are ongoing but it's unclear uh when they will materialize into a deal DS Tanya K there reporting from Jerusalem thank you Tanya Israel has released video it says proofs that Hamas militants used gaza's alifa Hospital in connection with the October 7th Terror attacks it says the footage shows hostages being brought into the hospital Israel's Defense Forces have also released a video of a tunnel running under the hospital officials from the Hamas ran health authority deny that alifa sits at top a Hamas command and control center the Israel Defense Forces have released this footage they say shows a tunnel under Gaza alifa Hospital the IDF says the 55 M long shaft ends with a blast prooof door but did not say what is behind it this footage has not been independently verified the IDF also released video of what it says are hostages taken from Israel entering the hospital the footage appears to to be date stamped October the 7th the day of the Hamas attacks the Israel Defense Forces has a moral obligation to bring everyone everyone of our hostages home we will not rest until we do Hamas was hiding and murdering our hostages in chifa hospital Hamas was building Terror tunnels underneath shifa Hospital ham is designated as a terrorist group by the US and EU among others military experts say the way Hamas operates makes it difficult for the IDF to provide proof of their operations Hamas denies Israel's claim that they have used the hospital as cover for a military command center a claim that the hospital staff also deny this footage was released by the Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry after the raid on shifa since October 7th thousands of gazin have fled to hospitals in the hope of finding protection from Israel's bombardment Israel's attacks on alifa have drawn Global condemnation the World Health Organization has called it a death zone doctors say Israeli troops smashed medical equipment and are restricting their access to water unfortunately we lost two patients overnight this night uh so it's to like you know nonhuman place to live in it's totally full of rubbish waste everywhere we are not allowed to get out of the buildings the Israelis keep uh you know just promising that they will provide us with more and more but it's not happening International groups including the World Health Organization say Israel's order to evacuate patients is a death sentence some of those who have tried to leave the area have come under attack including a doctor's Without Borders Convoy many patients and staff are still stuck inside alifa with little to know water food or medicine and for more of the humanitarian situation in Gaza Let's cross to Margaret Harris she's the spokesperson for the World Health Organization Margaret the who has been in alifa supporting evacuations there what's the situation there so there still remain over 250 patients and 20 health workers at alifa and they all all are desperate they all request immediate evacuation because the hospital can no longer function in any shape or form as a hospital no food no medicine no water um and as you heard the description of the waste filling the corridors because they can't go outside for fear of being harmed uh so we we're working today to get the rest out the priority is going to be G is being given to the 20 to dialysis patients those are people who need to have hemodialysis every few days to clean the toxins from their blood cuz they're in kidney failure and without that they will die and there are also 50 patients with spinal injuries uh and again they are people who need complex care which is not in any shape now available at alifa but also need very complex uh and careful moving to ensure that you don't make their conditions worse so that is what we're doing now and and and I would just like to also say we re reaffirm our respect for the extraordinary dedication and professionalism and humanity and courage of the health staff who stayed there they've continued to care for their patients under unimaginable conditions now there have also been reports of strikes at other hospitals in the Gaza Strip uh what's your team there telling you so we're hearing the reports as well uh that currently there are reports we are only hearing from the media so we you know we we have a verification system but again no attack on a hospital or health care it is never acceptable and what I'd like to make absolutely clear this is not acceptable Health Care can never be a Target it is a neutral Safe Haven or should be still Israel says that Gaza that that Hamas is using hospitals what do you say to that so again you know I'm not going to go into he said she said our job is to look at the hospital we know what happens above ground what we see above ground was the largest most advanced Hospital in the strip which has now been reduced to a not a building a non-functioning building um where Healthcare cannot be provided currently uh uh and we know that what was going on before was Advanced Health Care and that's it we've seen um some more un a trucks Crossing into Gaza from Egypt has that made any difference yet it's a glimmer of hope we want to see much more we need a huge amount of Aid to come in we particularly need the fuel to come in because we need the hospital generators to be powered we need the sewage systems to be powered we need the water and sanitation to work as I'm sure you know the the rains have come the winter weather has come so the problems with the failure of the sewage system to work because of the lack of power will lead to massive outbreaks of of waterborne gastrointestinal diseases which we are very very concerned about the wh's Margaret Harris there thank you very much thank you very much for having me
