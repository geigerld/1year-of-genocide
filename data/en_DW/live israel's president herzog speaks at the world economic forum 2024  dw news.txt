good morning president herok it's an honor to welcome you not the first time in Davos at a very critical time for Israel and across the Middle East looking at your efforts in Israel allow me first to commend your lifelong commitment to driving positive change for your country you have successfully bridged and connected the gaps among diverse groups in Israeli Society by identifying always common ground and shared values you have also been in the past an out very outspoken about your commitment to creating a lasting peace with the Palestinians at the same time your leadership has been instrumental in advancing your Count's relations in the Middle East and Beyond notably you made history as the first ever Israeli State visit to the United Arab Emirates in January 22 just one year ago Mr President the atrocities by Hamas on October 7th shook the world to the Core and we will be interested to hear from you how your country sees the conflict going forward and what updates there are on the release of hostages top of our mind is also what steps are being taken to maximize the protection of civilians and the delivery of humanitarian Aid Mr President thank you again for being during those tough times with us and we look very much forward hearing from you after your speech we will have a a conversation with my colleague bur and the president of super economic form thank [Applause] you thank you very much uh Professor schab Claus uh very welcome uh Mr president you've been uh in Davos uh before but that was uh before the atrocities of 7th of October the terror attack uh that really hit Israel uh very very badly so maybe uh let's start Mr President uh with you sharing uh who is uh the site guys who is the feelings now among uh Israelis uh let's start there our world was shattered on 7th of October I can say that we were celebrating a Jewish holiday the Feast of the Bible the Torah and um we were awaken into a huge shock which didn't we didn't comprehend fully and we haven't comprehended yet as a nation it was 6:30 in the morning Sirens all of a sudden blew up in the Silence of the morning of a holiday where people are on vacation little did we imagine that we will see such terrible Horrors that we will see something that Humanity hasn't seen for Generations that we will see something that has hit the Jewish people in the state of Israel in the highest numbers of Jews being killed since the Holocaust and these are the facts meaning we have seen a ities barbarism sadism rape chopping of Heads Burning of families in one of the houses that was burned there are Barbed wires around a whole block of Ash this is a five people family and most of all the hostages this is kir BAS kir today is celebrating one year to his birth exactly a year ago he was born to his parent parents Shiri his mother and his father yardan and his brother arel and his whereabouts are unknown we know he was kidnapped by Kamas we know that these barbaric terrorists have taken him and his mother and his brother and his father was in a different place we know that they are going through hell and we don't know their whereabouts and the enemy who supposedly Advocates that he has a cause in life is basically advocating jihadism celebrating and glorifying Terror celebrating and glorifying the Abduction of kir bibas and from here this incredible World stage I call upon the entire universe to work endlessly to free fear and all the host hostages that are there about 136 by now no thank you very much uh Mr President thank you uh for sharing this also as Professor Schwab said in his introduction to you and I known you also uh as a man of Peace you always uh being uh someone that has said that we need uh peace in the Middle East and the war is still uh ongoing in Gaza how do you see an end of this war war and also that's probably related uh to the situation for the hostages there are 100 hostages probably left yeah we have 136 hostages who are there including four from the 2014 War um including Muslims including women foreign Nationals a young young girls older women Holocaust Survivors or connected to the Holocaust so you have from one year old to 85 year old people of Peace many of them were Advocates of peace or dead lifshitz was a major advocate of Peace he would work in Gaza these communities who were burned and and and uh ruined and brought to ashes were communities that advocated endlessly working for peace with the Palestinians so if we look at the on a birds eye view of the of the war that we are seeing it's it's not only between Israel and Kamas I will deal with Israel and Kamas but the issue is and the world has to face it point blank with no ifs and buts there is an Empire of evil emanating from tan spending billions of dollars in arms and money and people's well-being to derail the entire stability of the world and the region they've attacked the United States forces two nights ago openly they have proxies all over the region quietly lurking to undermine any peace process and any stability of the world and that is exactly what we are seeing and they have to be faced by a very strong Coalition Hamas is one major element of this jihadist Isis type culture who has decided to launch a war against the well-being of the only nation state of the Jewish people butchering and murdering Jews and Muslims alike in the most barbaric way and we have to uproot them and enable a better future for the Palestinians who are our neighbors we don't shy away from the fact that the Palestinians are our neighbors but if you ask an average Israeli now about his mental or her mental state nobody in his right mind is willing now to think about what will be be the the solution of the peace agreements because everybody wants to know can we be promised real safety in the future every Israeli wants to know that he will not be attacked in the same way from north or south or east you have kisala in the north armed up to its neck by Iran financed by Iran and simply firing ongoing and killing civilians and killing soldiers and going to war with Israel and then there is the world tends to fall goes on but the truth is that we are fighting a war for the entire universe for the Free World I always say if Israel was not there Europe will be next because these barbaric jihadists want to get all of us out of the region and want to get all of Europe out of its place as well and United United States is next to so so this war is something of an essential element in the history of human kind M Mr President um the war in Gaza has now gone on for 100 days uh and I think Israel is not immune uh either to the international criticism on the humanitarian situation uh in Gaza so there are uh 2 million people now living under very very uh tough conditions and many of them didn't support Hamas so what is your message to those that are also no suffering because uh they didn't even support Hamas so I have a message to the to all our neighbors first of all and especially to the Palestinians I've been advocating and calling for peace with our neighbors for years I said it in my speech in a joint session of Congress on the 19th of July just before before the war terror is the main impediment to moving towards peace you cannot accept Terror directly or indirectly you cannot justify it has to be totally stopped and out of the question and the problem is that there are societies there are people when they support Hamas they support Terror simple barbaric Terror against lgbtq or against any other human being or against anyone who is Jewish Israeli or the like this has to be a clear message to the world terror is unacceptable now we therefore went to war because we see a war machine of a humongous structure right in Gaza huge cities of Terror underneath a a tunnels that are higher than the size of the New York Subway system that means billions of dollars that had they gone to life above ground we would have the most beautiful region in the world and move to peace but instead they opted to go to Terror it was taken over byas in AUD in 2007 after we pulled out of Gaza unilaterally to the last toota and from then on it became a platform of Terror for Iran and it's all its proxies and from then on we had thousands of missiles on our head and from then on WE reached this barbaric moment on this October 7th and now we go in according to our right of self-defense and in every house you find Terror equipment you pull up in a in a in a Liv in a bedroom you pull up the bed you find a missile a missile hundreds kilometers they can shoot everywhere you go they can press a button and you have missiles on Israel like we had this week we pulled out from the center we had missiles so we have to understand if we have the right to defend ourselves it's an inherent right to go catch the terrorist clean up the houses and bring back their citizens that is what we are trying to do I'm not shying away from the human tragedy in Gaza and you want to know something we care we care we B it it it it it is pain for us that our neighbors are suffering so much but how else can we defend ourselves if our enemies decided to entrench themselves in an infrastructure of Terror of unbelievable size and scope it's a very complicated battle everywhere we go in shops in living rooms in bedrooms in schools in school in schools you see we had even Isis Flags in schools and symbols I presented to the world Hitler's book mine C in in living rooms and a recent brochure that we found is directive by Hamas how to run Summer Camps summer camps for children titled you have to instill in them the values of jihadism and resistance which means Terror so let's agree if the world wants to keep the world order of post World War II in a decent manner it has to fight Terror and support fighting Terror and look at the htis because here in the world economic Forum the HTI issue is number one priority because it raises the cost of living for every family in the universe a little tribe of 50,000 people amased with weapons of an Empire I don't think Norway has such weapons ballistic missiles cruise missiles drones what the hell is going on here what is this what is we are unraveling a hug system of evil that the world has to unite and say we know it's difficult what we are with Israel to get the things done and I'm very um I welcome very much the fact that there is a an international Armada and Coalition fighting the hoties because it's an issue that makes clear that Terror cannot be acceptable anymore so Mr President um some people uh would say that uh was a mistake in 2005 uh when Chon pulled out of Gaza and also opened up for elections and uh then Hamas came uh to power but then of course this also has led uh to uh less momentum also for a two-state solution because Hamas has been there if you look at it uh in hind side should that have been handled differently also from the Israeli side I owe you an answer also on the humanitarian issue we'll come back I can okay cuz I I will be happy to relate I would say that when we look and my vision is towards the future we've tried many many Alternatives in our dealings with the Palestinians we tried agreements and we tried unilateral steps we tried a lot I think now is the time that it the demands also must be presented to the Palestinians to show that they really mean a vision of peace that requires revamping and reforms in the Palestinian Authority and we cannot go back to the same good old ritual of a fighting Hamas and God forbid returning to another round of battle we have to offer a future both to Israelis and Palestinians and off a future that we can live together that Gaza can be well managed and looks for forward to the world like our agreements in the regional the regional agreements like the Abraham Accord have projected real prosperity and a real bright future so Mr President what would you say to those that say that Israel let Hamas uh then uh win those elections and accepted it there I understand a lot of the criticism about that clearly and on the other hand because it's becoming now a major political debate issue I would not want to allude into that I would just say that it is clear that we have to support those who extend their hand for peace and are willing to go with us to a brighter future we cannot accept a vision we cannot however let's take the Palestinian Authority for that matter okay cuz Hamas is out of the question we have to make sure that they do not glorify teror that they do not teach their children to hate and hate Jews and Israelis it cannot be that way and therefore they must be faced with that as well but otherwise of course we have to go and negotiate with those who have always um been potential Partners in the for that so how do you see uh the end game of this war in Gs I know um it is hard but War needs also uh to end do you see then uh the PA and Fatam PLO taking over the responsibility uh of Gaza or do you see still Israeli IDF forces being in Gaza or is it too early number first of all you have War right now Israel has pulled a substantial part of its forces in the northern region and our focus is focused mostly on the southern uh where we we assume that some of Kamas leadership is there we um should see a horizon of a coalition of Nations who are willing to commit to rebuilding Gaza in a way that number one enables safety and well-being of Israel number two enables safety and wellbe of the Palestinians and brings a future a different future to Gaza you you need strong Western forces you need strong Regional forces and I'm sure there will also be a dialogue with Palestinians from Gaza and Palestinians and the way the Palestinian Authority how is that cooked into a formula that makes sense is exactly the issue that's being discussed right now all over the world in very very in intimate and discussions we all understand there has to be a vision and I think part of it should be also going back to the normalization process of Israel and its neighbors in the region I think it's part of a package and but that requires to support Israel's efforts to undermine the capabilities of Hamas and it's still there Mr President let's come back uh to the humanitarian situation problems getting humanitarian support uh through the Rafa cross others are closed you wanted to elaborate on that I think there is a immediate need urgent need for food water medicines uh and of course uh you also want to make sure that this comes to the civilians uh in uh gasa and it's they that benefit from that so we are committed from day one to upgrading and assisting the humanitarian Supply to Gaza as much as possible first let's remind our dear audience here that from day one Israel according to the rules of international humanitarian law identified safe zone so that the citizens who are uninvolved can move there so that we can go in and uproot the terror infrastructure that we are unraveling now in huge quantities however there are dire situations that need to be met naturally under War zones and as such from day one we have committed to the entry of convoys of trucks carrying humanitarian Aid I myself went to the nitsana Crossing with the media to see how we are screening these trucks today we can screen up to 400 trucks a day that means about 20,000 tons of goods a day unfortunately from nit it has to go to Rafa and Kim Shalom which is another passage we've opened up despite the risk of ter order there unfortunately so far the International Community did not manage to meet the ability to get to 400 trucks a day usually or around 200 trucks a day there was was a peak last week of 3115 we are doing our best our best to enable entry of huge quantities of humanitarian needs to Gaza there are also about six field hospitals two Marine floating hospitals that we've enabled water supply which we've enabled including desination project of the United Arab Emirates who been extremely uh helpful in in the humanitarian situation as well now the big problem apart from that is how do you deliver the food the supplies all around the Gaza Strip without being shot out fired out in one of the main roots or humanitarian routs underneath we've unraveled huge tunnels of Terror so that was stopped so we need an alternative route and we are working on it closely with the United Nations and all the other agencies closely I would also add that parallel to that many Israelis are asking themselves in many debates and correctly so how come such huge humanitarian Aid goes in and kir bias and all of the other hostages are not even getting any help at all in any way form or manner now we are praying that the medication that is is being supplied with France and Qatar and the international agencies and others in Gaza will reach them but that's only the beginning Israelis are asking themselves how come the uh the hostages are not getting anything so I I'm giving you an interesting information that three two days ago I've held an in Intimate closed meeting with represent resentatives of the Red Cross in Israel and in the region who came to a meeting um with families of hostages and hostages who have returned back to discuss the met the dire medical situation of the hostages real D medical situation real danger clear and present danger to our hostages uh that meeting was H very emotional was very interesting we went into indepth discussion about the mechanism of how the Red Cross operates and how it can help under the limitations of this war zone and its ability to have a dialogue with all parties concerned I hope it will enhance further the ability to help the hostages it doesn't depend on us we have a very cruel sadistic enemy who has taken a decision to try to torture the Israeli National psyche as well as the hostages themselves no thank you uh Mr President and I think uh the future of the hostages and their freeing is a key element also it is in um ending uh the Gaza War but by the way it's an important comment clearly the solution and the release of the hostages is a key element is this crisis people must must not forget it Mr President um we known each other uh for decades and I know you always been uh also a man uh that has been advocating for peace and uh you even have been advocating for a two-state solution when that was uh not uh the key topic uh in uh Israel today we saw this um terror attack um on on the 7th of October hitting Israel uh very hard uh and uh it is um a terrible situation but then reflecting on uh on the situation where the last decade there has been no momentum for the thinking around the two-state solution because the argument has been that you know we go to Abraham's Accords things looks also uh better with the neighbors uh do you think that one one underestimated uh the impact of not having a political uh process for a two-state solution and there is no new momentum for that I know it's premature and you said that yourself and I do fully respect that because of of the war but there needs to be a path also for peace in the future and the path that you were on resulted uh in this of course the polarization in Israel made all so Israel more vulnerable because wasn't ready for this the focus was maybe somewhere else I know there's a lot of so you raise many topics here the Israeli political system is always a very um interesting uh I would say full of debates and arguments on so many topics of the day and various agendas I would not hit in hint in any way directly or indirectly that this terror attack is connected to any political process the Hamas has always objected to any political process with the Palestinians I think it comes from sheer jihadist ideology that wants to eradicate Jews in Israel it's under their Charter and it's under their belief and perhaps at times we will may have been naive enough to think that um Hamas May tame itself or May change its course it hasn't parallel to that and and separately from that all together there are many questions that Israelis are asking themselves are withdrawals Justified did it prove itself these are legitimate questions um is it true is it really true that the Paradigm is necessarily only withdrawal or pull out or things like that when you pull out you get Terror that's what they saw we pulled out of Gaza we got Terror it's a it's a paradigm that's clear we got 10,000 missiles on our head from the moment we pulled out there was Terror before but we have to admit there's Terror afterwards so these are questions that are legitimate to us nonetheless looking for the big picture in the future of course it's a must that we must work as hard as possible to find new ways and means to have a dialogue with our neighbors the Palestinians and offer a future but for that the basic question of every Israeli will be especially after October 7th what guarantees our well-being and safety this is a big thing this is an emotional stage we're in and I think that when Nations come forward and say two-state solution they have to first deal with a a preliminary question which is a core question question for human beings are we offered real safety what will be the safety what's the outcome of any process and can we guarantee safety for ourselves and our people but Mr and I must tell you in the last two years before the October 7th there was a huge wave of Terror that the world ignored and mik and me we went going to beving families who have suffered horrible Terror attacks and nobody gave a damn in the world so we have to understand that's why I'm saying guys terror is off the world has to fight Terror with no mercy in order to Hope and to bring real hope for the future well thank you Mr President some would also argue then that it was the situation the lack of process that led uh also uh to this at least it's it it is a fact that it took place so it needs to be a different situation moving forward you're saying Hamas cannot be a part of it but there were also warnings from ramala and the PA to let Hamas then uh be uh conducting the leadership uh in um in Gaza of course but let me then uh go to the there's a question why the the PA never wanted to make an effort to get back to Gaza but we can argue about it for a long time but um of course Israel cannot be in a situation you're saying where there can be again missiles and Terror being uh coming from Gaza and uh also of course not uh from the West Bank but looking then at how can security be guaranteed uh in the future because it wasn't guaranteed uh in what we had it wasn't perfect either and now you have to look into the future and the Arab peace plan uh was saying when it was launched that all the Arab countries would then recognize Israel and they would also contribute to a situation where they can guarantee that there were no um Terror or and the security of Israel is that something that uh the regional context and also supported by the US and the EU that you will contemplate after this is is that the way to move forward so the regional context is an axis for development progress it's an access for a better Horizon for all parties concerned and clearly the Saudi option as part of it as the whole normalization process is a key to the ability to to exit from the war into a New Horizon it's still delicate it's fragile it will take a long time but I think that this is actually an opportunity to move forward in the in in in the region toward a better future I view that as a very important development I encourage all parties who are discussing the option of normalization with Saudi Arabia I believe it is a game changer and it follows suit with the courage of Nations such as Egypt Jordan and the Abraham Accords Nations such as the United Arab Emirates Morocco the kingdom of Morocco and the kingdom of Bak it will mean a world change and let me add that actually the trajectory before October 7th was the vision that was presented by President Biden at the G20 Summit which is the corridor the connectivity between Israel and India which means a connectivity between Europe and the South a China Sea which means con connectivity between United States and Australia through a different path which which is not the Pacific this is the Grand Vision that Vision has been derailed by an Empire of evil and will go back undoubtedly in my mind because of the desire of Nations to move to peace we are a peace loving Nation we want to get to peace Israelis are striving for peace we care for our neighbors but we are not willing to be attacked and we want to preserve the well-being and safety of our nation Mr President uh this shows uh also um perspective for peace and Reconciliation in the future and I think you always been a leader that has been arguing for this but do you think uh there will be a majority in Israel in theet that will uh share this Vision when this war is over I think that the the it is for the Israelis to decide because our nation is a democratic Nation with strong pillars of democracy and spirit of debate is very strong and these are legitimate debates 247 we are immersed in this tragedy and in the debate as to how to exit from it what should be the solution we understand that the particles of the solution are complicated you dealing with many political clocks and considerations of Nations but I say from the onset the basic values of Israel are peace and security we have to answer both and I think that the Israeli public has always shown its maturity when they know that they get something for real Israelis lost trust in the peace processes because they could see that to terror is glorified by our neighbors it's a key element in the discussion you cannot shy away from it and on the other hand we of course not shying away from the of course not shying away from the fact that there are 5 million Palestinians and we will have to find ways and means to deal with the issue and get to a future but first and foremost for that in order to change the atmosphere we need to get the hostage back we need to prevent Terror from recurring and we should move on a trajectory of normalization in the region and in the middle of this South Africa brings Israel into the international court of justice in hey what is your reaction to that so South Africa is outrageous in its Behavior its attacks on Israel are outrageous they basically support the atrocities or and barbarism that we have seen on October 7th they are supporting the the sexual H gender based violence that we have seen and we are calling upon the entire universe to take action on that they are supporting the barbaric sadistic attacks on innocent civilians violating a recognized International boundary and the and and it's a game of hypoc hypocrisy that South Africa um is using the uh convention against genocide which was brought and enacted by the international family of Nations following the worst atrocity of humankind which is the holocost against the Jews in World War II against the state of Israel which is a nation state of the Jewish people defending itself under international law I hope and we all hope that our case was heard well by the justices of the international court of justice in the Israel presented an indepth and a very eloquent and convincing case and I hope that our case will be heard loud and clear and decisions will follow suit and I call upon the entire International Community to stand with Israel and reject this claim thank you Mr President uh last question we do hope to be able to wish you welcome back to the absolutely we're always in a Year's uh time I was identified as a global leader of tomorrow already 30 years ago so you you weren't so wrong you know Professor Schwab always has a had a good uh nose for uh then identifying a future uh leaders last then question related to in the year what is uh your hope and aspiration for where we are when it comes to Israel Gaza your relationship with the Palestinians the Abrahams Accords and also the regional uh cooperation in the air what what are you working towards so look Israel is a country that is benefiting the world with so many incredible ideas and initiatives there in the crowd there are people here who have brought forward the most incredible inventions and Innovations doing good and helping people I will tell you a story last year in puim it's like the Halloween of of the Jewish people in the celebration of puim M and I went to a shed Hospital in Jerusalem to the children's nephology department and uh we go in and in the corridors and there are little rooms and we go into each room in one room there were allra Orthodox parents with their kids with their babies in another room there were Orthodox Zionist orthodo in others there were seculars in others there were Palestinians and Israeli Arabs and there was an incredible mixture of all religions and belief in the last room I go in there is a mother a father and a baby and I could see she is Arab and I asked her where are you from and she said I am from Gaza I asked her in Arabic where you from she said I'm from Gaza she was very shy with a little baby and I said to her in Arabic I'm the president of Israel and she she was quite shocked that the leader the head of state walks into a room and we just spoke and I said to her I bless your child and I hope he will live in peace this child must and the family must have been brought to the hospital by volunteers from the the kibuts around Gaza who used to volunteer and take them to treatment and I believe this is the vision that we have to project people want to live together and they want to live in peace they are the coexistence in Israel of so many lives and beliefs including between Palestinians and Israelis is immense but we cannot allow forces of evil who want to ruin this vision and want to drive us into the abys we can't allow them to win thank you very much oh thank [Music] all
