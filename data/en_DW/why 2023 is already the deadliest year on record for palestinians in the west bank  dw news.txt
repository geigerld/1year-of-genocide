As the world’s attention is set on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, violence has been escalating in the occupied West Bank, with Israeli forces carrying out raids – and a spike in settler attacks against Palestinians. Even before the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas militants, existing tensions meant 2023 was already set to be the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the West Bank.

And support for Hamas appears to be growing. One protest I went to in Ramallah – the West Bank’s biggest city and a stronghold of support for the Palestinian Authority – people flew Hamas flags and openly chanted support for its wing commander Mohammed Deif, a man at the top of Israel’s hit list. Hamas has called on its supporters in the West Bank to get involved in fighting Israel. So far we have not seen that happening.
