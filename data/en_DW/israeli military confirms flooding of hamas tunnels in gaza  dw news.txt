the Israeli military has confirmed that it has been flooding tunnels used by Hamas under the territory the Army said that it was channeling quote large volumes of water into hamas's tunnel network but claimed it was making sure groundwater wasn't affected Israeli media reported in December that Israeli forces were testing using seawater to flood the tunnels experts warned that doing so could permanently damage freshwater supplies for gaza's 2 3 million residents and risk the lives of hostages still being held by Hamas let's get more on this from Mike Martin he's a former British army officer and Senior fellow in the department of War studies at Kings College London Mike the Israeli Army says some of the tunnels that belong to the hundreds of kilometers of tunnel Network are being flooded in an attempt to flush out Hamas militants and destroy the tunnel structure can this actually work good morning Michael uh ye yes in in a in a fairly ruthless approach it's it's very simple um you can pump in sea water as you said in your package all you need is a a fire hydrant something that every fire department has and and you can run that for 24 hours and it is as simple as it sounds water flows downhill and we know some of these structures are very deep and it fills up the system from the bottom and then either if you're in that tunnel you either drown or you have to come to the surface which is obviously what the IDF wants with this activity many of our viewers know that more than a 100 Israeli hostages are still being held by Hamas some of whom are believed to be in the tunnels doesn't the Army risk drowning the very people they're trying to rescue in a sense actually what we're seeing here with this story about flooding tunnels is a perfect example which describes the Strategic tension that the Israelis have in their War aims they aim to destroy Hamas but also to release the hostages that is repeated daily by the Israeli government but actually it's probably impossible to achieve both of those aims the only time that hostages have been released is when in fact there has been a ceasefire and whilst the war fighting has gone on we've seen hostages killed and so here when they're flushing out a tunnel to perhaps get rid of Hamas supplies or to take on militants obviously the most sensible place for the hostages to be is in the tunnel Network so yes they are exactly put in danger so it's a perfect example of the tension the Strategic tension at the center of the Israeli War aims experts say that flying tunnels is a dangerous option that poses huge risks to gaza's already besieged civilian popul a what do they mean well I think there's two things here what one was what you mentioned in your package which is about groundwater and of course it's only sea water that they can pump in because that's you know obviously gaza's on the coast and that's the biggest volume of water and they need a lot of volume to flush out the entire tunnel Network that will seep into groundwater and a lot of Garin gets their water from Wells so that's a huge problem but the other problem is what this flooding does is it is it pits some of the Garen population between aerial bombardment and flooding underground inevitably some of these tunnels will have been abandoned or there will be lots of tunnels that aren't being used and some elements of the gar and population will be hiding in them the best place to go when there's excessive aerial bombardment as we're seeing is underground and so by flooding the tunnels it puts the population in between a rock and a hard place Mike we only have half a minute or so but I am curious uh Israel says that dismantling tunnels is a slow process and could take years what sort of push back could be expected from Hamas and do they even have any interest in preserving those tunnels very briefly uh the tunnels are essential to Hamas any fighting force needs a rear area where it can store supplies prep treat casual and in this case as we've heard hold hostages um removing the tunnel network from Hamas um makes it very very difficult for them to continue to fight the people will survive but they will lose all of their military infrastructure weapons supplies and ability to move around the territory unseen that again is Mike Martin from the Kings College London as ever many thanks Mike thank you Michael
