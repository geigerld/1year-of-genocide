well Israel has of course closed its border crossings to the Gaza Strip that means there is only one other theoretical option for Palestinians to leave Gaza the Rafa border crossing to Egypt the Egyptian government is in talks with the US and Israel on allowing humanitarian Aid to pass through but it won't open corridors for Palestinians to leave Gaza well for more on the role of Egypt in this crisis I want to bring in Seth he's advocacy officer at the think tank project on Middle East democracy he joins me from the us tonight Seth it's good to have you with us um do you see a scenario in which Egypt would open its borders to Gaza to allow refugees to escape yeah thanks for having me um I think you know one of the lessons we definitely should take away from uh this weekend is Never Say Never uh as you were saying the the preference I think of the Egyptian government government is to not allow refugees uh to to come into Egypt uh and instead to allow humanitarian assistance to flow into Gaza in the ways that they have done uh in in previous uh sort of escalations uh of violence like we're seeing now um at the same time I also would say you know this is not uh unique to Gaza uh Egypt is not necess necessarily wanted uh refugees coming from Sudan down in its Southern border to its West uh and so I think it's a bit of a pattern uh in terms of Egypt and and you know in their defense uh to a degree they themselves are suffering uh severe economic crisis uh inflation is at its highest levels uh unsustainable debt and so it's a real difficult time to uh be in Egypt uh and so having having a burden of refugees flowing in is something that would uh you know be quite difficult is this though just about economics I mean when we look at Hamas in um in Gaza we could imagine that if the Rafa gate were to be open and you had this flood of Palestinians into Egypt um the government in Egypt could be concerned about the Muslim Brotherhood for example um increasing its strength in the country and we know that that is something that the current President of Egypt would not stand for I mean there there are political and ideological reasons for keeping that gate closed aren't there I think you know the Egyptian government is definitely emphasizing security concerns uh from Hamas I I would say on the Muslim Brotherhood inside the country uh over the past decade they've essentially been decimated uh the Brotherhood themselves for decades at least sort of the the core group have uh you know distanced themselves from violence and been opposed to it you know there's certainly Splinter groups and so forth uh I I don't see a real actual threat uh in terms of that uh at least Brotherhood uh actions inside Egypt now obviously if Hamas operatives were escaping that that's a different scenario but but I don't think it's it's a a real concern in terms of the Brotherhood would you say that Egypt maybe um is telling us that by opening the border and allowing Palestinians to enter in mass that that would harm the Palestinian calls to have its own State I think you've seen some uh some Egyptians emphasize this uh but I think Palestinians themselves have also emphasized this uh the right of return is a major issue for Palestinians uh from 48 to 67 uh and on and on we've seen where uh when Palestinians have left uh Palestine they've not been able to return and so I think it's a legitimate concern among many uh that if they were to leave Gaza they would not be able to return US Secretary of St Anthony blinkin um he is in the Middle East with his team um what can they achieve in Egypt and I'll put it in another way is there any chance of a negotiated settlement which does not include Egypt you know I think the secretary and uh is there now we're seeing the secretary defense is going to be there tomorrow I believe uh they're trying to show uh their steadfast support for Israel uh that uh they have their back no matter what and that's sort of what they've been emphasizing uh I I think certainly you know now that he's announced that he's extending his trip to other countries in the region uh there's going to be other priorities uh helping hopefully uh you know the humanitarian crisis in Gaza um and doing whatever they can on that front uh I I think in terms of Egypt we should expect there to be a role uh there tends to be one there has been one uh in in previous uh moments like this uh but he's also not just going to Egypt uh he's going to some of these other countries the region because they also matter I think one should definitely look at uh countries like the UAE uh and others who signed the Abraham Accords and be expecting and almost calling on them to be doing more part of the Abraham Accords uh when it was sold at least here in the United States was that these countries would now have more of an influence with Israel uh and and now seems to be the time given the vulnerability of civilians in Gaza so Seth minder with the project on Middle East democracy Seth we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you thank you well I'm joined Now by hasham Mahana a Communications officer with the international Committee of the Red Cross from Gaza it's good to have you with us could you just tell us what are you witnessing and seeing right now on the ground there in Gaza first of all thank you for having me and giving me the opportunity to um give you a brief about the situation in Gaza Strip what we can say at the moment is that we have reached the level of um catastrophe at all levels um the U there's a complete blackout across the Gaza Strip which impact directly the households or what's left of the neighborhoods that were not impacted by the uh facilities and um whatever left from the infrastructure of the power water Waste Water Supplies uh it also impacts um significantly the Health Care System entirely Gaza um there are a lot there are a lot of hospitals and Medical Care Centers who are out child out of service and the remaining operational Hospitals now are running only on um generators run by Fuel and they are in limited quantities and are also about to run out um the Ministry of Health and Gaza issued a plee saying that um they are running out they actually ran out of U most items of the medication medical supplies equipment and also now patients are being treated on the floors after their capacity has been sh uh by 100% um and seam let me ask you let me ask you about what we're hearing from the UN the UN says that the number of people in Gaza who have been displaced or made homeless that number has increased inreased by 30% in just the last 24 hours I mean that is that's an unbelievable number there are are there enough accommodations for these people who have seen their you know Apartments blown up first of all Gaza has no shelters as um you know the world uh understands the word of shelter they are basically owner schools and um those who manag to escape Under Fire actually uh are not all inside the UN school they uh managed to reach uh to their beloved ones families friends uh I'm now seeing as one of my friends to be you for example um however those who were instructed to evacuate uh were instructed to evacuate without clear instructions to say haven this is another concern for us entire neighborhoods got destroyed and in a matter of a few hours uh entire families are um you know uh now no longer exist on the Civil registry uh some of the famiies are still under the r of their own households the civil defense could not reach them in time due to the lack of the acquired supplies equipment and also because of the lack of you know safe access yesterday uh the palestin recr society our humanitarian partner lost four of their emergency Medical Teams while they were on their way to conduct that humanitarian Mission risking lives they lost they literally lost their Liv there and we have condemn the act of attacking you know the medical missions in in in in anywhere in any place and in any context this is completely unacceptable and against the international humanitarian law principles uh we have been existing in this uh delegation in Israel and the occupied territory since 1967 and we have never witnessed this level of uh you know spering violence conducting facilities targeting the civilian populations attack against you know the medical missions J including journalists one of the icrc of residents was partially damaged as it was located in one of the heavily bombardment bombarded neighborhoods in the heart of the Gaza City yeah uh this is also hampering you know the the activity of the humanitarian missions in Gaza and we are andc have been in constant dialogue with both you know parties to the conflict to ensure the safe access of the Medical Teams the humanitarian teams as well as to protect you know to protect the civilians and properties hasham let me just ask you um also about the Rafa Crossing that is the crossing the only gate um out to get out of Gaza that leads to Egypt um that gate is now closed we've been hearing though that it's being used to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza um can you confirm that I mean how are you getting medical supplies or food or or the things that are needed how are they being brought into Gaza right now yes um The rer Crossing is the only um Gates remaining open to Gaza STP however it's it's not accessible for any medical missions or humanitarian missions any like so far as announced uh it was directly targeted uh um um a few days like two days ago um we any efforts that would eventually lead to the entry of humanitarian Aid into Gaza strap that includes uh medicine food and fuel enough enough to run uh you know the soul G of our parents and also to help the humanitarian teens and the doctors and nurses and at hospitals continue saving lives let me just let me be let me be careful else let me be clear about this so you're not getting anything from outside through um through that gate or anywhere right now in Gaza so you're saying nothing is coming into the Gaza Strip at this moment at all in terms of humanitarian Aid as of this moment absolutely nothing has entered uh into the Gaza Strip unfortunately okay and are you seeing what we're hearing reports that food and water have begun running out in neighborhoods are you seeing that yes I'm actually witht like I see myself uh some some families trying to reach uh you know the accessible shops pharmacies or bakeries to get food medicine and drinking water um these uh you know supplies are running out of the stores and there is no you know Supply to accumulate or to you know um to cover the Gap uh there is a food crisis in G because you know um egg is not available in the market uh crops are not available in the market we are supposed to be in the middle of the alive harvest season which is an annual celebration and this is also another you know poast of the asaran consequence so we are about to witness also an environmental crisis due to the absence of you know um moretime waste water pump stations to be seen operational we are witnessing actually a humanitarian crisis at all level but on top of that we are witnessing a crisis of Hope andam unfortunately we're out of time but I appreciate you taking the time to talk with us it's important to get this story out to Sham Mahana communic officer with the international Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza thank
