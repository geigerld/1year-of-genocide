Israel says its forces have encircled gaza's City prime minister Netanyahu has rallied his troops telling them nothing will stop their advance and he repeated his warning to people to leave the area world leaders are stepping up diplomatic efforts to ease the siege of Gaza to allow more Aid to reach civilians the United Nations says four of its schools being used as Emergency Shelters have been damaged by the latest Israeli air strikes with at least 24 people killed tww special correspondent AIA Ibrahim is in Jerusalem and I asked her for an update on Israel's offensive in Gaza well it's just important to remind our viewers Nicole that we the international press are not allowed inside the Gaza Strip at the moment so any information that we have is information that we have from the IDF or other sources and what they have told us so far is that Israeli soldiers have now encircled God Gaza uh City that's really the heart of the Gaza Strip it's in the northern part of the strip the part that uh Israeli forces have been asking civilians to evacuate from to the South but we do know that not everyone has evacuated either uh they are unwilling or uh unable uh but Israeli forces say they believe that that northern part in in Gaza City and around Gaza City is where a large concentration of Hamas Fighters are to be found we know also that 18 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting since the beginning of the ground Invasion so at least 18 uh soldiers in addition of course to others who have been killed uh since this War uh began we also know from uh uh um the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza that a uh un run School uh near the jabala refugee camp that refugee camp camp that has recently uh been struck uh we know that a school around that camp has been struck as well and at least 27 uh people have been killed that's again according to the um to the health Ministry in Gaza and the strip is run uh uh by uh Hamas and so it is U it is you know it is changing every minute but that is the info that we have from both sides so far yeah and a there are reports again today of rising violence in the occupied West Bank with three Palestinians and one Israeli killed throughout the day let's take a look at the situation there and then get back to you Rescuers rushed to the scene after an Israeli reservist was shot dead on his way back to his settlement home for Palestinians living close by the consequences were Swift and familiar Israeli settlers stormed their Village setting buildings of Blaze it's just the latest outbreak of violence in the West Bank where clashes between between settlers and Palestinians have soared since hamas's terrorist attacks many Palestinians feel like they're being forced out of their homes like in this Village close to heon where locals say attacks by settlers have only gotten worse in recent weeks we used to have problems with them but after the war in Gaza they want to kill all of us After the War Began the situation changed they started attacking our houses and the people inside them the Israeli Army has also become increasingly active in the West Bank since October 7th drastically ramping up its raids with Israeli forces detaining hundreds of Palestinians over alleged terrorist links clashes have broken out frequently often with deadly consequences for the Palestinians dozens of people have been killed according to the Palestinian Health Ministry but with all eyes on Gaza the record violence in the West Bank is at risk of being overlooked a how much of a sense is there that the war in Gaza is spilling over into the West Bank as we heard in that report there really is a sense that with all eyes on what's going on in Gaza because of the severity of the situation there uh settlers in the West Bank may be taking advantage of that situation so according to the un uh settler violence which was already at a record high last year has increased this year from an average of three incidents per day to seven incidents per day and so we're hearing reports of harassment violence and at times uh forced evictions if you will as Palestinians feel that it is no longer safe for them to stay in their homes both the both Germany and the United United States have warned against this and have called on the Israeli government to protect Palestinians living in the West Bank now US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin will be in Israel on Friday what can we expect this will be his third visit to Israel and his second to the region since the War uh began and since the terror attacks on October uh 7th we can expect that the messaging from the Secretary of State will remain the same from what it was at the since the beginning of the war which is that the United States stands by Israel stands by Israel's right uh to defend itself but what we will perhaps be hearing more of is the United States calling on Israel to uh take civilian lives more into account that is a demand that we've heard uh more and more increasingly from the Biden Administration as you know this war enters into its third week and as everyday picture of the constant air strikes on Gaza are reaching uh the world we can expect that there will be an emphasis on the importance of protecting civilian lives uh in uh Gaza the secretary of state will also be going to Jordan after that our viewers may remember that when US President Biden was set to visit uh uh Jordan some of the meetings were cancelled because of the incident uh uh explosion at alah hospital so this is again another uh attempt by the administration to try and find a regional solution to this tomorrow we also know that the head of hasah hassanah will be speaking and so this might also this visit might also be looked at as um as a sense as as as deterrence as the Administration has emphasized time and time again that Regional power re Regional uh uh player should not take advantage of the current situation that was a Ibrahim and Jerusalem thanks for that hundreds more foreign passport holders have left Gaza through the Rafa Crossing into Egypt crowds have gathered at the border but only those on an official list are being allowed to pass the biggest group of around 400 were US citizens today the crossing has been open for the first time since the start of the current conflict between Israel and Hamas desperate to get out of Gaza the rough for border crossing is the only Escape for these families many have been at this bus terminal for hours waiting to have their documents approved and be allowed to board the next bus heading across the border into Egypt I have an American passport my daughter has one too my husband submitted his papers but he still didn't get his passport I'm pregnant how am I supposed to get out without my husband I appeal to anyone I want to get out with my husband and my daughter and I don't know what's going to happen and just about an hour ago you heard it probably a aom came down almost explode everything and I have hard condition you know guy [Music] could so I don't know what's going to happen I'm just the other side several hundred Jew nationality Palestinians foreign National and critically injured Garin have crossed the border Egyptian officials say they will assist around 7,000 people to leave but the process may take weeks we do not have any information regarding the opening of The Crossing in the coming days our operations are being managed on a day-to-day basis we sincerely hope that our Egyptian Brothers will keep the crossing open on a continuous basis especially for those who are severely wounded we have approximately 20,000 injured individuals with thousands of them in critical condition ambulances waiting at the Crossing rushed severely injured Palestinians to Egyptian hospitals with more than a third of hospitals in Gaza not operating at all many more people need urgent care but Egypt remains firm that its medical evacuations will be temporary with no Mass Exodus from Gaza and we can speak now to hea TV she's the country director for the NGO care in the Palestinian territories and joins us from rala and the West Bank hea good to see you now some Aid has been delivered through the ga to the Gaza Strip through the Rafa Crossing we saw there do you know at all how many Gins can benefit from it um thank you so much for for this question I think that over the last days we have he the estimations by the UN on the necessity of constant and bigger numbers much bigger numbers hundreds of trucks on daily basis to uh be able to secure the requirements for the mass uh population that is affected but unfortunately uh the number of trucks that entered is very limited it it of course serves it it is very welcome to serve the the people but the number stays at a very very low and minimal number in the same time f is still not on the on the list for which is very important at least to cover the needs in the hospitals and water yeah your organization has published a report on how specifically women and children are affected by the war what did you find so uh everyone is affected by the war but then there are layers of vulnerabilities that are added for women who women who are pregnant women who are household heading heading the household uh women with disabilities with hearing disabilities with physical disabilities and definitely the children and of course the newborns so the different ages they have and the different groups of women and children they are affected more severely in terms of nutrition um uh being more vulnerable to catch up diseases the spreading ones uh more vulnerable to uh um to the overcrowded shelters related uh potential uh gender-based violence and protection issues um access to Services become more difficult for women who are heading their households in in in the in the during the crisis and War unfortunately women for instance would be as you know the last to eat when it comes or the last to benefit from an humanitarian Necessities that reach the family in very small quantities today when I was on the phone with my colleague uh her granddaughter was crying for food I'm hungry I'm hungry and she told me you know I didn't drink water for 3 days just to save the water for the babies that we have here we have 1.5 uh one one and a half month baby and four months baby and we just try to save the water for them this is the situation unfortunately where they are severely affected unattended kids it's a huge full story also where families are not able to to report their missing kids and unattended kids are not connected to their family so the the situation is really harsh and it becomes even harsher for women and kids of different of different groups Yeah you mentioned your colleagues in Gaza they are working under unimaginable conditions what is it that you can do for them from where you are so all what we we we are trying our best to be connected to our colleagues on daily basis with the blackout of the communication that was a terrifying moment for us what we try to do is to secure as much as we can what we call uh hygiene kits survival kits dignity kits water food these are the colleagues who used to jump to help others now because they are displaced internally displaced and evacuated to the South we find them among those who need who need support as I mentioned they they are unable to access bread some of them they did not eat bread since 4 days now um and and we try our best but the the um the the Commodities are going are going missing from Gaza so we are trying to find for instance Water bottled water drinking water for them and it's not possible they rely could get two gallons of water one of them after long long uh um attempts that lasted for two days was hea Tibi from Care thank you so much and all the best to you and your
