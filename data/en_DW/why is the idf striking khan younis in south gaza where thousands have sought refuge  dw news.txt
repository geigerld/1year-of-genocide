Israel is continuing to bombard Targets in southern Gaza this comes after the United States blocked the un's bid for a ceasefire in its war against Hamas who are considered a terrorist group by numerous countries according to the Hamas run Health Ministry more than 177,000 people have been killed in two months of Israel's military campaign the UN says the humanitarian support system in Gaza is at risk of total collapse more than two months since hamas's terrorist attack and the beginning of Israel's military offensive in Gaza scenes like these keep emerging Medics rushing injured to the hospitals among them many children according to the Hamas ran Health Ministry the latest Israeli air strikes in the southern city of Khan yunas have killed dozens further south in Rafa targets are also being hit many led to the South earlier in the war when Israel told them to leave Northern Gaza we were first displaced from Gaza City to kanun and later to Rafa where should we go now children and women were sleeping peacefully a 52-year-old Woman Who Wasn't carrying a weapon and a 5-year-old child were they launching rockets in Israel the strikes intensify AS Global calls for a ceasefire are intensifying too in New York on Friday the United States vetoed a security Council resolution drafted by the United Arab Emirates that called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as long as Hamas clings to its ideology of Destruction any ceasefire is at best temporary and is certainly not peace and any ceasefire that leaves Hamas in control of Gaza would deny Palestinian civilians the chance to build something better for themselves but many Palestinians fail to understand this argument America is the one sending weapons these weapons have been manufactured in America and in Western countries they support Israel in killing youth children women and the elderly Allah is our savior and will take care of us when America vetoed the ceasefire at the UN they reconfirmed their position against the people who are dying under shelling all day and all night with American weapons the UN says the humanitarian support system in Gaza risks total collapse and most cousins are unable to flee the territory leaving them no option but to seek Refuge under heavy isra fire our correspondent Rebecca rers joins us from Jerusalem hello Rebecca what more can you tell us about the ongoing fighting in Gaza well the the fighting has been ongoing right through even this un Security Council vote for uh a ceasefire we've been seeing a continuous ongoing bombardment of the South as well as a continued push of ground troops uh in further into the center of that southern city of Han yunas we're also seeing a continued bombardment and fighting uh quite intense fighting in the northern part of the strip as well we know that civilians uh are being told to evacuate even further south uh that has been happening um day in day out now for the last several days moving uh from areas in that Han unus area down towards Rafa we know that they're finding it increasingly difficult to find places to go many people saying that they've been displaced now several times and they're not only tired but they're scared and they just have have nowhere to run now the IDF uh says that Hamas have been firing from some of the so-called safe areas though we know from the UN and other International Aid groups that there really is no safe area for civilians in the Gaza Strip but the idea of claiming that in some safe areas as they deem them uh that fire rocket fire has been coming from Hamas and that they've been suffering attacks from those areas uh we're not able to verify those claims though we do know that rocket fire has been coming uh into the southern part of Israel today we've also of course Eddie been seeing the the cross border incursions happening in the North of Israel with the border with Lebanon we know that Hezbollah have been also continuing to fire into Northern Israel and Israel retaliating it's unfortunately uh day in day out we're hearing similar reports and things uh of course predominantly for civilians in Gaza becoming dire and and more dire by the day right and world leaders and Aid groups have criticized the US veto on a Gaza TRS resolution at the UN what is the latest there yeah there's been uh a lot of criticism toward that vote from the that veto from the US Eddie pretty much across the board we hearing from International actors uh a top Iranian Diplomat for example has told the United Nations Secretary General Antonio GES that there's a huge risk of a quote uncontrollable explosion in the region uh following that veto now that's something that Iran have been threatening since the beginning of this war it's not something that seen them follow through on or we've not seen their other actors in the region hezb for example really following through on but it is something that you know everybody including the US other International actors and the civilians of course are very worried about uh we've been hearing from turkey's foreign minister who said that the US really now stands alone when it comes to this issu there's some very strong words there when it comes to Aid and rights organizations we've heard from Human Rights Watch they've said that the US risks complicity war crimes by continuing to support Israel both militarily and diplomatically and medic the the aid group um Doctors Without Borders they've been saying that the security Council in action makes them complicit in the ongoing Slaughter uh that's going on in Gaza as they say so some really really negative responses to that un veto pretty much the only uh positive response has come from Israel who unsurprisingly have thanked the US for their ongoing continuing support right good views Rebecca Rees in Jerusalem thank you I'm now joined by Christian Lind meire spokesperson for the World Health Organization in Geneva hello and welcome sir now with a ceasefire out of the question for now and very little Aid reaching the strip how much worse can the situation get thanks for having me Eddie yeah this is really the question um you you our teams on the ground around and everybody outside always is reporting they they don't think it can get worse uh ever and then the next day is worse again that's exactly what they keep saying uh from the from children and people begging for water uh because the water supply is absolutely sub minimal uh the the water system has been shut off let's not forget that two months ago already so it's not just bombing and shelling it's the water system has been shut off the electricity system has been shut off uh so nothing works anymore without uh without fuel the water supply is uh minimal because the uh the normal water basin underneath Gaza is a salty water which needs to be desalinated and that can't happen without fuel or electricity children or people who normally need at least three liters of drinking water a day and the humanitarian settings we normally calculate up to seven liters per person a day with all the needs including washing uh do now have one to two lers a day and as we all know one to 2 L if it was only drinking water is not enough people are cutting down telephone poles uh we get these reports because they need a little the last piece of wood and try to make any any any stove or keep it warm uh the hospitals are completely those which are actually still functioning or partially functioning are are described as battle zones meaning people lying on the floor bleeding on the floor being operated wherever they can seeking shelter in the same spaces um the Seas breaks everything is going uh to Sham and it's not just that is it the World Health Organization your outfit has repeatedly voiced its concerns about a rise in outbreaks of infectious diseases in Gaza what is being done to prevent that so normally there's a good surveillance system in Gaza uh through the Ministry of Health and the the red Quest and the various clinics and health facilities but that surveillance system has broken down um now we have seen an extreme increase in watery diarrhea already chera to name it not yet because cholera is a specific bacteria but acute watery diarrhea is exactly the same outcome can have exactly the same consequences so you have a an extremely malnourished weak population children under five we have more than 10,000 of cases um in in of this acute watery diarrhea already in children we have caus skin rashes and lice um but also reports of hepatitis hepatitis A Hepatitis E although here is one of the problems that the laboratory is also not functioning anymore so any samples of anything would have to be ported outside to uh to Egypt in order to get tested and then the respective medicine to be brought in uh any any little disease can be cured by antibiotics or by a good surveillance system by isolating people but in the situation right now with people in hundreds of thousands Sheltering and pressed together the smallest zones being injured being uh with diseases um some has said if people don't die through the bombing now they will desire die from the diseases yeah you describe a very dire situation on the ground tell me what do you expect from the International Community at this point look there are there are those who hold the power in the on the ground and that's specifically of course Israel as also the occupying power with specific um resp responsibilities towards the Gaza Strip um they have the power to stop this and all all well understood that they after hammas and those who committed these atrocious and horrendous crimes on 7 October uh uh and they still keep hostages which also need to be released immediately and unconditionally but going after the terrorist organization and going after the whole population without as it looks like now any discrimination anymore um that is not absolutely not acceptable it needs to stop it needs to stop now again not only cutting people off from water and food because there's no independent production of this in Gaza also not letting enough supplies come in um this is this is a crime against humanity Christian linm spokesperson for the World Health Organization in Geneva thank you thank you now Marina is a military analyst and research fellow with King's College London's War studies department and joins us now from Munich Marina uh this battle for Han Unis has become the new focus of the war it seems why is it so important to take for the IDF good evening well it is believed to be a stronghold for Hamas therefore IDF is concentrating its operation on Kan Yunis and it is also believed that there is an extensive network of tunnels underneath the city and so now we're seeing that the north has more or less been clear this and and now IDF is proceeding with the South and the idea is then to expand these areas so to push out Hamas as much as they can probably towards the middle of the Gaza Strip to Central Gaza and so um the idea here is to eliminate as many Hamas as possible with a focus on hamas's commanders now KH Unis is also packed with people that fled from the north of the Gaza a strip how is Israel trying to avoid Civ civilian casualties now well it is very difficult because um the IDF on the one hand has created this grid system so essentially they're warning civilians um to leave those areas where they expect heavy fighting to take place in advance using U media social media um TV messages leaflets and all that um however ever the problem is that even the ADF admits that no area is really safe in Gaza so what we're seeing is essentially um civilians fleeing to Rafa and that's where the the humanitarian agencies cannot provide the necessary aid for so many people fleeing there and other areas are essentially also quite dangerous for the civilians so that's a problem for the IDF where do you get the civilians on the one hand and on the other hand there is a fears that Hamas will leave to those secure areas the so-called secure areas together with the civilians now there are reports of renewed fighting on Israel's northern border with Lebanon as well How likely is an escalation there that is correct and um at the very beginning o of this conflict hollah has stated that it would consider joining the fight when it sees that Hamas cannot cope with the IDF we don't know right now um to what extent Hezbollah is ready to join and certainly does have the military capabilities and to what extent Iran would approve of such actions because that would risk um losing a lot of hezbollah's capabilities if the war spills over so right now we're seeing distractions there on the northern border from hezbollah's side but also other groups in the region such as the yemeni hoodis have uh pledged to Target Israeli or any ships in the Red Sea that go to Israel because there is not enough humanitarian Aid being delivered to the Gaza Strip and we also have groups like Al-Qaeda pledging to kill Americans Brits and Israel is all across the world so it seems like all of these violent non non-state actors are throwing their support um behind Hamas even if they ideolog ideologically don't always agree with a group Marine amiral there thank you very
