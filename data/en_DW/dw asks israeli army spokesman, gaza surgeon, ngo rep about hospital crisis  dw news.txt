Medics say heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas has trapped patients and thousands of displaced people seeking Refuge at a hospital in Gaza the Palestine red crescent Society said their emergency crews at Al's Hospital are facing blackouts and intense shelling in the vicinity the un's World Health Organization expressed alarm at the situation in the alifa hospital medical staff there say it has run out of water food and electricity Israel said it had clashed with Hamas nearby but not fired on the hospital Jason Lee is the county country director I should say at save the children in the Palestinian territories in rala uh Jason the Israeli Army said it has agreed to evacuate babies from the alshifa hospital your colleagues must be concerned some of the babies are in intensive care how is it possible to transport them safely and where are they going exactly the situation we have reached a humanitarian crisis we've had confirmed reports of two babies that have died this morning um that were in incubators and there's 37 other babies at elifa hospital that I at risk it is critical critical that there is a ceasefire an immediate ceasefire this is the only way to protect civilians especially those that are still trapped and getting trapped in hospitals in schools with nowhere safe to go there is absolutely nowhere safe in Gaza right now children are being killed at rate of one child every 10 minutes one child is being injured every five minutes this has to stop we need the ceasefire we need goods and supplies medicines food water going to both North and Southern Gaza and we need to send more Personnel in my teams need to need to to go in we need to find the children and we need to deliver life life saving goods and supplies to them Jason just very quickly here it sounds like what you're implying here is that you're not buying this uh Israeli plan to get babies out of alifa and to transport them safely we haven't heard the details but you're not buying this as an idea it is difficult to do so there are many many patients and babies that are in critical care now I am not a physician but I know it is not a simple way not a simple mechanism to take Patients Out on machines that are life-saving machines that they're on also in situations where there is ongoing conflict there's still clashes there's still shelling the risk of civilians being injured and killed is incredibly High all sides all sides have to meet their obligations under international law and protect the civilians especially children okay the Israeli Hamas War has already displaced thousands of children in Gaza as you know how do they cope with with the trauma and the emotional distress of this war children need to be safe and protected they're 1.5 million people that's 60% of the population that have been displaced they've been displaced to shelters without food or water we need to get them safe which means the ceasefire we need supplies coming in we need Personnel going in to give them the treatment the therapy and the support so that they can recover that they can rebuild their lives it is critical that they that this happens now the long-term mental health and psychosocial needs of children that experience such extreme violence cannot be underscored it leaves a mark on them and they need the support right now you're talking about psychological impacts do you fear that the children who survive the horrors of this conflict will be prone to indoctrination uh radicalization and a perpetuation of the cycle of violence it is critical I mean children can recover unfortunately this is not the first escalation that children in Gaza has experienced all our research shows increasing levels of anxiety depress depression feelings of withdrawal and worst of all a loss of Hope children do not believe that they have a hope in the future in order to restore this we need the ceasefire now to keep them safe we need Personnel going in to give them the treatment and therapy and there must be there must be political will to actually come to a just Equitable and durable peace between Israel and Palestine this is the only way can secure the future of of children within the region but this has to start first with a ceasefire okay that is a Jason Le country director at save the in rala thank you so much thank you for more on the situation surrounding gaza's hospitals I spoke to Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard heck I first asked him if the alifa hospital is under siege by the Israeli military the alifa hospital is not under siege we have encircled and we are closing in on the Hamas inside Gaza City there are IDF forces in the vicinity of the hospital we are not targeting the hospital we are trying to find ways to uh have get the people out we're trying to find ways to facilitate assistance to the hospital sadly Hamas are and their civilians H well uh Dr morwin abusada the head of surgery at the hospital who I spoke to yesterday has today told the Observer newspaper that people trying to evacuate the hospital were shot at and some killed Doctors Without Borders also reports that its staff are witnessing people trying to leave the hospital being shot who's shooting them H for sure it's not the Ida we've H announced ER safe passage from the hospital in addition to the two humanitarian corridors down South we are not targeting civilians we are targeting Hamas anyone coming out ER with no intention of harming anyone will not be targeted by us sadly we've seen Hamas also targeting people trying to move South and their own civilians Lieutenant Colonel you understand if I continue to push back because there are lots of allegations from many corners a surgeon from Doctors Without Borders Muhammad obid says four patients actually within the hospital have been shot by sniper fire was that the Israeli sniper fire I'm not aware of these claims and I do not believe and I can tell you without knowing the the details there is no way the IDF sniper would shoot a patient in a hospital Michael this is not how we operate what I'm curious about is the fact that over and over again the Israeli Army says that Hamas is using these Hospital facilities for cover essentially using uh the civilians there as human Shields what is difficult for people to understand though they can understand and the great uh suffering that Israel had to endure back on October 7th the reason why you've actually started this campaign what they don't understand is how you can distinguish between Hamas Fighters and regular innocent Palestinians in a hospital or on the street how can you say with assurance that Israel is not firing at innocent civilians perhaps people that soldiers might mistake as Hamas militants well Michael first of all This Is War um and we have to also we we don't forget what happened on the 7th of October but I will tell you uh as a military for the last month we've been saying and allowing and doing everything we can in every capability we have because we understand that we're not fighting the civilians we are saying to the people the civilians of uh the city of Gaza to move South we've opened these humanitarian corridors we've done Tactical poses in neighborhoods to allow people to move sadly uh as we've closed in we've come to a sort of uh bottleneck with the hospitals and we're trying to solve it we're trying to solve it Michael H it's very painful for me to see too and not only as a soldier as a father and this is uh the cynicism of Hamas we will do everything we can and we're aware of the situation the dire situation in the hospital there'll be more information coming out today of how we try and intend to make this happen it's very painful that's all I can say this is not something that we enjoy doing let me ask we have to stop let me move to another issue here the Israeli military is offering to evacuate babies from the hospital how do you envis envisage then working so we're we're in contact our civil Administration people are in contact with the hospital and other International bodies we're trying to find a solution I think this thing will be unfold in the upcoming day or two again we are not currently striking the hospital there's no such a thing even with the allegations that are coming out from some of the people that you are talking to so we're aware of this it's h dire and sensitive and we're doing the best we can the rantisi hospital and the N hospital for example have been already evacuated let me ask you this as a followup if I might assuming that those uh kids could be transported safely where could those babies then be taken to for safe medical treatment all of gaza's hospitals are collapsing as a result of Israeli military action again we are not targeting hospitals we are very aware of the situation in the hospitals and there will be a solution of some sort um to be determined okay but that's an offer that's being made today that is a very important news angle that we are seeing in in present terms what is the plan for those babies to be taken from point A to point B and how can you ensure for their safety is that an answer that you don't have at this point as as an information that I cannot share with you Michael you don't have it or you can't share it I can't share with you at this point how this is going to happen Okay what is so strategically important about alifa hospital so they we we've H and we exposed this a few weeks ago we see this as a main Hub of Hamas activity cynically they've been also hiding within and also underneath the hospital I would again quote Abu maruk who said you know we we don't care about our people above the ground ER we care about destroying Israel and they're saying that again and again we cannot have Hamas have the capability to do this again as painful as it is and we're doing everything we can Michael Lieutenant Colonel um Hospital administrators have invited neutral parties to come and see for themselves that they are no as they say militants in or under their Hospital what proof do you have that there are in fact there I'd like to see that uh also what they've come to show I I haven't seen any of these third party entities saying or any of these reports Michael uh we have our intelligence core and uh we have our information on what's going on in that hospital why not allow independent monitors into Gaza in into the hospital to assess the situation in the hospital first of all I think there's International entities that are moving in out of the hospital I think unra have been in the hospital but again that's not in my Lane of responsibility I'm a military man and I all I can do is explain the the the military actions that we are doing international well well you're a military man so you I think you can understand and answer this question let's say that you succeed in achieving the full evacuation of the alifa hospital what will the Israeli military do then are you going to destroy the hospital building we will not destroy the hospital building we will go and see and search and uh take here only on terrorist infrastructure we do not destroy that's not our goal to destroy hospitals the rantisi hospital is in we' they've left evacuated also the NASA Hospital we're only going after military targets it may not be your goal but that's what you're effectively doing peace meal right now you must concede that sir we we are we're not doing that have you we have not stried or destroyed any Hospital Michael okay that's a lieutenant colonel Richard he we will go in in a very specific way and try and uh root out the terrorist infrastructure again Lieutenant Colonel Richard hack Israeli military spokesman thank you for your time thank you for having me for more I am pleased to welcome Dr Marwan abusada head of surgery at the alifa hospital in Gaza it's a pleasure to have you on with us sir uh fuel has run out and operations have been suspended at your hospital give us uh insight into what you and your team are facing at the hospital now and how many people are still there yes we are in okay thank you we are in BC Hospital hospital bombardment and shooting everywhere around us in shifa hospital no one can get out from the shifa and the border of shifa and no one can get inside the shifa now it is very difficult dangerous any anyone who planning to go outside he is exposed to shooting or to bombardment and so on even if you are if you walk inside the Sha Hospital between the building or inside the parking you are exposed to shooting and so on here sh Hospital we are accommodating around 600 patient in all the department and in recovery area of our operation theater and in theal ICU in the notal ICU not moreal ICU in the operating theater we are keeping theal babies and I will show later the picture of that to the media and also we are keeping in the our ICU and this is the fifth time sha was exposed to direct bombardment yesterday it was bombarded for four times the gy and building was comped twice and the in front of the main Administrative Building was attacked and also thean building was attacked that The Barking of it and today this morning the our ICU is directly attacked by bombardment and it was a destruction to the wall and the to the main IC of sh Hospital okay yesterday for that bment five people were killed and many were injured in that moment most of them they are civilian and companies of their relative in this hospital now today in shifa hospital we don't have electricity we run out of water and the fuel no and now we today we move the all the fa 38 fait from there in the metal ICU just to the main theater here in chifa hospital we we can have only electricity in this wall and this is an unsafe condition we are keeping them because yesterday we ran out of electricity unfortunately we lost two lives of there a premature babies we

very very difficult we run off of water also we don't have water electricity fuel this is UN unsafe condition to work it is Doctor can I doctor can I ask you I I feel terrible interrupting you when you are painting what is a picture of of Hell frankly and I think people cannot imagine what you are going through uh but I do want to ask you this the the Israeli military says alifa Hospital serves as hamas's headquarters and that Hamas militants have tunnels leading to it tell us how long you have been working at the hospital and what you can tell us about that I want to make it clear I'm asking you what you can tell us about that doctor yes this is an open invitation to all interational agency and to the isra Army to come to CH hospital and to look for what is what we having in chip Hospital what we have this the displaced people the patient themselves and we have the medical staff who are available in shifa hospital this is a complete lie we don't have we're not hiding any militant group here in sha hospital just but okay we are this a civil institution sha hospital this is a major Hospital in Gaza with a huge number of people how to cope where to evacuate these people I'm doctor I'm going to stop you again and I and I hate doing this but I'm going to interrupt you again because I want to be very clear for our viewers no one is is suggesting necessarily that you or anyone else at the hospital is protecting Hamas or hiding them the argument that the IDF that the Israeli government is making is that Hamas is using you using innocent Palestinians as human Shields and that they are hiding underneath your hospital can you tell us can you tell us without any doubt that that's not happening I know what to the underground you may have the fuel in the underground we don't know what the underground okay on the ground nothing is there on the ground you can't tell I don't know what is in Israel itself they were tunnel in Israel why they did toct okay we don't have any T here the underground we don't see any open for or okay here in the Sha hospital this is a civil organization I can assure you and anyone can come to sh hospital and see what is inside the sh Hospital nothing is clear okay to be clear this is a Civ Institution well then let me let me ask you this then doctor let me ask you this you're clearly very emotional and I think anyone listening to you will understand why but then let me ask you in just very clear terms is it your suggestion then that Israel is making this up for what purpose to bomb innocent civilians no yes yes is C the main building were destructed here in Gaza they are attacking the civilian they are killing the civilian especially the children and the woman of palestinia more than 11,000 people have been killed most of them maybe the whole number is thean is noic people among them the most of them they are children 40 they are children who have been killed what about these children they are children they are militant group okay ask your children who have been killed they are militant group they are safely are staying their home okay Israeli telling us Evacuate the hospital where to go where to go I would like to ask you there is no any institution LGE enough to cope with this huge number of people here and they asked yesterday the people to move to the South theyed the people of the in the South area in the main street of Gaza and yesterday yesterday some of the people after the bment of sh hospital they moved to the school they again attack them in the school and they 15 people were killed in that in that mass school so anywhere you go un say okay I think Israeli all right they need more and more killing of Civilian and especially the children of J and this is thank you so much for your
