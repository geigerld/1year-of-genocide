we begin with some developing news Hamas says it has released two American hostages for what it calls humanitarian reasons the mother and daughter were among around 200 captives abducted by Hamas during its Terror attacks in Israel on October 7th the Israeli Prime Minister's office says the freed hostages are being taken to a military base they've been named as Judith and Natalie ranan and we can now bring in journalist Sami so he joins us from Jerusalem Sami what more can you tell us about the hostages who've been released yeah well Judith and her daughter Natalie they're from suburb outside Chicago and they were visiting family in nalo which is adjacent to the Gaza Strip they have relatives in in that area and they were abducted by Hamas um what we know is that probably Judith has some medical issue and Hamas they say that they released the two of them for humanitarian uh reasons uh the two of them have crossed uh to the crossed the border into Israel um they have been taken to a military base and from there they're going to be taken uh to a military location inside Israel where they're going toet meet their relatives this evening there's going to be a meeting between the two and their relatives and this was also released from the Israeli Prime Minister's office and what do we know about the welfare of the hostages who are still being held by Hamas Israel says most of them are alive now well we don't know much uh we know that they're held both by Hamas and also the Islamic Jihad at the time said that they're holding some uh 30 hostages um we know that there's one video that was released of a a a young woman that is held the hostage in in Gaza and that was released during the week so so Hamas has been trying to show that they are capable of taking care of these hostages but also they're giving out the message that if Israel is continuing uh with their with bombing the Gans of strip they're putting them in in danger uh we know that Qatar is involved in in these talks and they're um the ones who are have been most active in the channel to release those held captive in the Gaza Strip yeah Kar of course with um very strong ties to Hamas what is the Israeli government's outlook on security during the release of the rest of the hostages 200 of them at least can they bring them back without some kind of a deal with Hamas yeah well the the prime minister's office today released a statement and and they said that the government is prioritizing the release of those has held the hostage in the Gaza Strip at the same time they say they want to wage a a military round campaign inside the Gaza Strip H today we've heard assessments that this campaign is going to last for months uh many months H this means that those who are held inside the Gaza Strip could be in in danger and for sure uh there is a a a problem here because on on the one hand the government is saying that they want to release them on the other hand they're saying that they want to exterminate Hamas they want to eradicate Hamas they want to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas and they want to launch a ground offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip now how will the Israeli government be able to both release prisoners and wage this campaign this is the big question that's the big question indeed that was journalist samiul in Jerusalem
