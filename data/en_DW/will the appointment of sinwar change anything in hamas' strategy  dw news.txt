the Palestinian militant group Hamas says it has chosen its top military commander in Gaza as its new political leader Yahya sinir replaces Ismael hania who was assassinated in Iran last week in an attack blamed on Israel Israel believes senoir masterminded the October 7th Terror attacks and has been pursuing him ever since we can speak to our correspondent Rebecca Ritter joining me now from Jerusalem Rebecca good morning will this appointment of senoir ch anything in hamas's strategy I think that's very unlikely CLA we're not likely to see any major changes if anything this could see the Hamas approach become more Hardline Yahya Sina uh the leader of Hamas in Gaza has certainly been the more Hardline leader from the hermas leadership and with the assassination of isma Han who was seen as a if not more moderate and certainly more pragmatic leader and this appointment of sinoa is the central now really the most powerful uh man in the Hamas leadership I think that we're likely to see a more Hardline approach if anything but though uh you know the reason I say we may not see much difference at all is yak sin was already largely seen as the I me to use to coin a term the supreme leader of Hamas anyway he was certainly since October 7 uh you know the go-to person for the final word on all things from strategy to the SE negotiation ations certainly seen as the head of the snake certainly within Hamas and externally so it's unlikely that we'll see any kind of major changes there we are now seeing a centralization of that power and a formalization of that centralization of power if you will but unlikely that we'll see anything uh in terms of a different political or military strategy yeah tell us more about what this means for a possible ceasefire in Gaza will this have implications or for the release of Israeli hostages uh held captive by Hamas well as I was just trying to say I think this it certainly will have implications when it comes to the ceasefire deal but I think it's not surprising that ever since we saw the assassination of isma hania basically pundits within Israel have been saying that the ceasefire Arrangement is effectively dead in the water that you know now with sinoa definitely elected as the Central and most powerful figure in Hamas I think it's unlikely that we will see any kind of Hostage negotiation or ceasefire deal in the the near future the US of course saying that a political Sol solution is still possible and it is still the best way to calm tensions in the region but I I think it's very unlikely that we're going to see any kind of agreement between Hamas and Israel though we know that um Israel says that for its part it's still open to negotiations I think once with now the centralization of power and certainly uh with sinan now being officially the head of the snake I think it's unlikely that we're going to see any negotiations reach a successful uh end any time soon and has there been any other reaction from Israel to this new leadership is it is it more or less what you would expect well disappointment is certainly being viewed as a as a signal or as a you know a kind of message of strength and of defiance towards Israel Yahya Sina has already been on top of Israel's list if you will for some time certainly since October 7th they have said they are going after the is the Hamas leadership and that they will not stop until they are taken down we heard from the uh Israeli military spokesman Daniel hagari in the aftermath of this news saying the only place for yayya sinoa is next to Da referring to Muhammad da the the military leader of Hamas who was killed in an Israeli air strike in July and the rest of the October 7 terrorists are certainly feeling their sentiment there and we also heard from Israeli cats the Israeli foreign minister saying another reason to eliminate him uh and the vile organization from this Earth so you know Israel certainly not changing its tune in fact you know becoming stronger behind its will to eliminate the the the leaders of Hamas Rebecca thank you what does Rebecca riters for us in Jerusalem now 10 months have passed since the Hamas Terror attacks on Israel last October which precipitated the ongoing war in Gaza the October the 7th attacks began when militants infiltrated Southern Israel from the Gaza Strip killed some 1200 people and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza Israel's subsequent military campaign and its stated goal of destroying Hamas has killed 39,0 677 Palestinians to this day now that's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza that's run by Hamas thousands more are reported missing between the rubble and are presumed dead now as the conflict enters its 11th month fears of an allout Regional War are growing at the request of Iran the organization of Islamic cooperation is holding an emergency meeting in jeda Saudi Arabia the meeting will focus on the situation following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismael hania in tan last week meanwhile the US is trying to prevent the conflict from spiraling into a major war Secretary of State Anthony blinkin called on both sides Iran and Israel to deescalate let's take a listen we continue to work intensely to deescalate tensions in the Middle East and to prevent the spread of conflict uh over the past few days we've been in constant contact with Partners in the region and well Beyond in those conversations we've heard a clear consensus no one should escalate this conflict uh we we've been engaged in intense diplomacy with allies and partners uh communicating that message directly to Iran we've communicated that message directly to Israel and we can get more from DW Middle East analyst Shaunie rosanas who's here in the studio with me good to see you shaie as always now we're hearing Anthony blinkin saying that the US is communicating directly with Israel directly with Iran over the tensions in the region that we're seeing right now what do we know what more do we know about these Direct us Iran contacts I'm not sure how I mean it could be that I I would probably that they're somewhat indirect I mean um the Americans have been in touch despite everything with Iran uh before October 7th ever and ever since October 7th but never through direct channels there have been reports about talks going through Oman for example in May uh which they officially denied but there is no doubt that there is a channel of communication there um the Iranians um seem to be still on the fence whether you know on how they are gun respond and the Americans are trying to use this time that they have to try you know and and put some pressure and maybe get the Iranians to understand they will back Israel very strongly and firmly in case of uh you know suspected escalation and maybe trying to incentivize Iran in a way and sort of like not just not just sticks but also offering carrots in order to bring all of this um you know assumed or or expected escalation down or prevent it rather so this is what we're seeing on the other on one hand and you know at the same time um the Americans are sending send in their carriers um into the um Mediterranean to support Israel we know that the commander of centcom the central Commander for the Americans has been in Israel Killa General Killa so they're doing both of this sort of trying to show strong uh you know alliance with in in Israel with its defense but at the same time um in secret channels to sort of maybe just um avoid the whole you know scenario of of escalation that is expected to come um you know maybe that would be the best way you know prevention rather than just deterrence so we're seeing this meeting today aren't we the organization of Islamic cooperation meeting it's happening in jedha today will Iran is Iran likely to find support there probably I mean what we've been seeing in the last week since the assassination of hania in tan is that even uh the countries that are considered to be the moderate Sunni countries like like for example Saudi Arabia who was on the verge of of signing you know a normalization deal with Israel the same thing with your Jordan that has a peace agreement with Israel and is a you know a very uh you know strategic uh neighbor you know in for Israel they've been distancing themselves for Israel saying you know to both sides you know and we know they have had some role in helping um the interception of the previous attack from Iran on Israel in April they've been saying we don't want none of it you don't use our airspace we don't want to be included you know and more than that you know and this is basically a slap in the face for Israel sort of turning the back to Israel saying we don't want to be part of this partially because they're seeing how the war is ongoing and partially also because this is all connected to the assassination of a very prominent Palestinian leader is hania you know Hamas is known as a recognized an or as a terrorist organization in many places but for Palestinians many of them live in Jordan many of them in the region he was a symbol he was a hero um and you know seeing their government support any act standing with Israel you know for not getting being punished for that that's a bit of a you know more stand for them to take 10 months after the October the 7th attacks would you say Israel and Hass are closer to what they originally wanted it's unbelievable it's been 10 months I don't think you know Israelis have expected after 10 months to be where they are still so deep into Gaza far from uh any conclusion you know in the near sight I think you know to to use uh Churchill's famous speech we are we are probably if you look listen very carefully to netan this is maybe uh the the end of the beginning but not the beginning of the end netan seems to be very adamant in going forward pushing very much strongly and in a way Hamas is seeing in the last week some of his you know you know Wildest Dreams being coming true you know since the beginning of you know since October Hamas was wishing for more and more fronts to be opened against Israel with Lebanon with hasbalah with Iran in the West Bank you know at wishing for escalation and it could be that we're on the verge of that which would be for Hamas the best case scenario so I mean 10 months in I'm afraid we're just not anywhere close to seeing an end to this inside unfortunately DW's middle analyst shie rosanis shie thank you you're welcome Anya
