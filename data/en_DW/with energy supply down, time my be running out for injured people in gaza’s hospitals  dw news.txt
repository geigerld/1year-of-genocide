now Hamas meanwhile has told people living in Northern Gaza to stay in their homes that's despite the warning from Israel's military for them to be evacuate Israel has told 1.1 million people to leave that's about half of the population of the entire Gaza Strip our team from German public television sent this report from inside Gaza this Gaza hotel has become a refuge for civilians diplomats and journalists a place of relative safety set back from the surrounding residential blocks in this densely populated area the air billowing with smoke and dust from Israeli missile strikes Israeli media say 3,600 Targets in Gaza have so far been hit fisa is a trained pharmacist she does what she can to treat the injured administering first aid in the hope that an ambulance will come to take the casualties to hospital at the moment we have four wounded people here we've tried our best to stabilize them but we need an ambulance as quickly as possible there just aren't any we've been waiting for five hours already hardly anyone dares Venture onto the street one cameraman gets as far as the hotel [Applause] entrance nearby housing takes a direct this time the shock wave reaches the hotel lobby Hamas Fighters can Retreat to an extensive network of tunnels but there's nowhere for the Civil population to go Palestinian officials say more than 1500 people have been killed including nearly 500 children the humanitarian situation is getting more desperate as Israel blocks power and Waters supplies fuel for generators is running low in the darkness repeated missile strikes the whole situation out there is inhuman we urgently need humanitarian intervention foreigners may be stuck here but we also need a way out these are civilians here mothers and children but even with a safe way out we wouldn't know where to go fisa and many others remain at the hotel no one knows how long they will be there and we're going to cross over to Gaza now to speak to Hashim baloa he's a journalist based there and he joins me via telephone good to have you on the program Hashim so just as we've been discussing with my colleague uh the Israeli Defense Forces has given people 24 hours to leave Northern Gaza what is happening where you are it's fly CTIC here the chaos people are lost um I mean they lost their minds they like they are thinking calling everybody trying to communicate and to understand what's happening this is the new thing that happened in Gaza never been before uh people don't know what to do where to go um despite the local Comm Authority here saying like this is this is is um um this is not true and people shouldn't leave and they have to stay in their places but without giving them any instruction what to do um you know even if the people decided to leave I mean it's it's impossible that the capacity and and the capabilities of the other part of Gaza STP wouldn't be able to contain the 1 million or over 1 million move from North and Gaza City to the South um infrastructure there is l mited as well as like even there's no enough schools for for for those people to move and in the same time that b in in in of the Gaza Strip is not totally safe I mean there was um and now an air strike over there I can hear and see the smoke um and and you know there was an an um air strike yesterday in in Dar which is which is in includ included in the area the the Israel instructed people to go and there was like um about 20 22 people were killed there according to the local report and ra as well so people don't know I mean it's not safe there and they always raise the question and wonder where to go how to go and and and what to do and you know is it safe it's not I I just want to come in on that point there um because you seem to be um alluding to the fact that there's been mixed messaging people not knowing if it is true indeed that they have to evacuate um I'm interested to know if if you're going to be evacuating have you made plans to do that and what does this entail from a logistical perspective is there the infrastructure to move people at that scale uh if I I mean the the the sound wasn't wasn't clear enough but if I hear it like you have it myself yes I'm I'm thinking of that since the early morning I received a recorded message from idea saying that for the nor General one and and you have to evacuate for and without saying even it's like how long or you know which period for rules they didn't give instruction to anything I wouldn't I wouldn't lie yeah I'm I'm keeping this and and an option and I'm looking for what place to go because honestly I don't know where to go you know like even I have my car and and it's like limited amount of the fuel in there and barely able to to to to go there with with a fuel remaining in in my car and um and there is no um um uh there is no no fuel I can refill it from the stations in gva because all all the fu is run out or stored in in some places so um to be honest and my wife my kids and neighbors I'm I'm staying at like currently I moved out of my my house like a few days ago and I'm in in a relative house so and I'm thinking now to go somewhere but I mean I don't know where I'm still figuring out where where and and and how it's going to make it happen you know Hashem um you were talking about the situation in the South and and you were you were you were saying that it's just not possible for the South to be able to to host that many people um at at a single point in time we also know that the only exit in the South would be through Egypt but that border is closed all right it might be that we've lost that connection to Hashem I'm just trying to establish if that indeed is the case um he had alluded to the fact that he was having difficulty hearing me so understandably we have now lost uh that question to Hashem but we heard him telling us there how difficult the situation and people have received messages uh to leave but of course that is a difficult thing for people infrastructure he talked about having a car but it doesn't have fuel uh so that is a situation as we're hearing it from gaja we'll see if we can maybe get him back onto the program later to finish that conversation but for now that was the journalist um Hashem baloa in Gaza talking to us there I'm now joined by Ahmed bam uh he is the Middle East Regional media and Communications advisor at the Norwegian Refugee Council he joins us from Aman welcome to DW what are you hearing from your staff on the ground in Gaza morning uh our staff are perplexed really by last night's announcement we have moved from worry to uh Panic to fear and now perplexity this there is um this announcement is going to threaten not just our staff not just um an entire or half of of the population in Gaza but also the future of this um you know uh conflict our sta um 50 of them Palestinians over 50 of them have to leave home they are fearing for their lives their children don't know what is happening and they think that what is happening is punishment um for um an entire population uh this is honestly I'm speaking to you and I'm thinking of my colleagues some of them have been disconnected from the world who don't know where to go this morning this is the this is the phrase that everyone is repeating we don't know where to go and our colleagues um are not even able um to um well in these circumstances ammed the order is uh from the IDF that people in Northern Gaza Must ALL head south um and they've been given 24 hours is that realistic it's not just unrealistic it's really um I think a reckless attempt to uh Panic people um there is no there is no honestly there's no gend genuine way you can achieve that hospitals in North Gaza have been uh have been targeted they are um overflooded with patience some of them in life-threatening situations and also that kind of order gives the impression that um Southern Gaza is safe and that is simply not true a lot of areas and Unice even the RAF Crossing has been has been uh targeted um so there are there are no shelters to take people in there is no aid for people there is no places for people to stay in and this is not just unrealistic but it's it's also a flagrant breach of international law amid I want to pick up on the point you're making about Aid we know that there is a desperate need for Aid to get into Gaza right now has there been any breakthrough on that front there hasn't um there hasn't Israel threatens to uh bomb the r Crossing if Egypt tries to Aid in the humanit humanitarian corridors and humanitarian fors that we have been asking for is not just unachievable as of now because of Israel's actions we're actually heading in the opposite direction the direction of escalation against the civilian population of two million people um under the pretext of of of a response to a group of of of armed groups this is not how um how you deal with a situation where you are obviously laying a Siege um over two million people the entire Gaza Strip is less than 400 kilometers square kilometers um two million people are frowned into this into this strip they are being being bombarded from every side and you know latest you hear is you're telling them to go from one unsafe and dangerous area another all right we'll leave it there Ahmed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you for for
