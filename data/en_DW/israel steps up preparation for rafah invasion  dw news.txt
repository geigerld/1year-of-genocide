now there is growing uncertainty over Israel's ground offensive in GA in the Gaza Strip after the Israeli military pulled most of its troops out of Southern Gaza on Sunday Israel said it needed to prepare soldiers for future future offensives including into the city of Rafa where more than a million people are Sheltering meanwhile some Palestinians have begun returning to their homes but after months of air strikes and ground battles with Hamas militants many are returning to ruins this is Han yunit after months of bombardment displaced residents have been rushing back to their homes after Israel announced most of its troops had been pulled out of the area it's a shock a shock what happened was not small on my way here in the car I saw the destruction it's unbearable I'm going to my house and I know that it is destroyed I'm going to move the rubble so I can get a shirt a bit further north in der Al Bala much needed Aid arrived at schools and shelters for the first time in 2 months the need for everything from food to medical supplies is urgent according to eight agencies the UN says famine is fast approaching many children have suffered from malnutrition as a result of overcrowding there've been respitory and health problems such as hepatitis all of these things are a result of overcrowding in the the shelter because a large number of people left their homes because of the war a war that has now lasted six months and with no end in sight Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lana is a spokesman for Israel's military and he told me more about the Strategic considerations behind the idf's withdrawal of soldiers from Khan yunes we know that um the IDF is continuing its mission to dismantle and destroy Hamas as a governing Authority in the Gaza Strip uh and indeed as um the defense minister pointed out the forces have been re withdrawn or taken out of the Gaza Strip in order to regroup recuperate and continue for operational planning wherever it takes us we do know that in the Gaza Strip there are still at least uh six operational battalions of Hamas four of those indeed in the Rua area two in more Central Gaza um operating at a l capacity but in the south in Rafa there are still four operational battalions if we're going to be successful at dismantling Hamas we're going to have to go to Rafa I think if we've learned anything from our rescue operation two months ago in Rafa uh that hostages are being held there and that there is an extensive force that can conduct organized fighting against us so we need to operate in order to get rid of Hamas and bring back the hostages now there has been speculation that pulling out a large number of troops would change the face of of that uh War um indicating that maybe the IDF is going more into a surgical mode instead of a fullon full-on war if you will um what do you say to that so the operation has different stages and indeed as we um the war evolves moves forward and we dismantled much of hamas's infrastructure uh operational capability production and Industry capabilities to dis to produce uh terrorist uh weapons and and tunnel systems so of course there's a different type of operation that is required we are maintaining operational capabilities both Precision strikes from the sky as the operation develops but also ground operations based on intelligence based on the operational flexibility and freedom that we will maintain and continue to maintain um as we as we do look forward you know we have to realize that this operation has to work in conjunction with a humanitarian operation that supplements supports is the right thing to do um and also it's an operational and and strategic enabler now some critics in Israel say that the troop withdrawal gives Hamas the chance to regroup what's your view on that I would say we have um good confidence in our forces in our strategic uh posture at this time uh of course of course as we saw when Hamas went back to shifa hospital it is an opportunity and it is an option but as we proved when we went back to ra shifa nowhere is safe we can always take out Hamas wherever they are we can operate we can mobilize swiftly we can engage and we can seek them out even if there is a an attempt to regroup or take control of different locations like they did in the shifa uh instance now the Israeli government declared clear aims for this war from the beginning the elimination of Hamas and the releasing of the hostages U have you gotten any closer to that so we've uh dismantled destroyed a huge amount of their battalions their operational forces taking out many of their commanders their political leaders as well I would say yes every day that goes by we are moving closer and closer to dismantling Hamas as a governing authority of the Gaza Strip that is the goal uh or that is goal number one with alongside with Goal number two of bringing home the hostages um we have to be successful because if we aren't successful in dismantling Hamas it will send a very clear message to terrorist organizations around the world that it's okay to come into people's bedrooms and butcher them that's something we can't expect we can't accept and we will continue to fight in order to make sure that it doesn't happen so I would say yes we are moving closer every day it's a war that they've been planning for um and building their their infrastructure and Industry over the last 16 years so if that's the situation there is no quick fix to the reality we're going to take our time until we reach our goals Lieutenant Colonel Peter lner there spokesman for Israel's military in Tel thank you very much Colonel good evening I want to cross now over to Mike Martin he's military analyst from King's College London Mike it's good to see you um so we've heard from the IDF only six operational Hamas battalions are left in Rafa and Central Gaza we've also heard from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying yesterday that Israel is one step from Victory taking all of this together does this mean that the war in Gaza is close to its [Music] end couple of points uh so the word Battalion is is quite problematic when you apply it to an Insurgent group because they don't organize them m eles in battalions that's of course what the Israeli Defense Force does and other militaries they organize themselves in structures but as an Insurgent group uh Hamas is quite hard to describe them as organized in battalions in terms of is the war going to end soon well I think you know the conflict in Gaza can end at any time there are ceasefire talks going on and you know hostages will be released and the IDF will withdraw these are all the things that are being discussed at the moment but it will really only freeze the conflict in a strategic sense the conflict will carry on Hamas still wants to destroy Israel and Israel still wants to destroy Hamas and there's no political end state for this conflict and there's no after conflict plan if they do do this ceas fire for hostages swap so the fighting could end at any time but the conflict will continue There are critics in Israel who say that the troop withdrawal from Han Yunis give Hamas the chance to regroup there what do you say to that yes I think in one sense that is is very correct um but in another we've seen there have been several examples during this war of areas of Gaza that have been occupied by Israeli troops and then Rockets have been fired from those areas or the alifa hospitals a good example as well where the Israelis obviously went through did a big operation there kept lots of troops in the vicinity and then a couple of months later they had to go back and do another operation and again that's the nature of these types of War these Insurgent conflicts it's very hard to kill all of the enemy and so you end up just going back and called it's called unfortunately mowing the grass and you don't get all of the enemy and then you have to go back again and so yes the Israelis have left Khan unun and that may give some of those Hamas operatives more space but uh in the overall sense of the war you know Hamas is still able to operate underground even in those areas that Israel uh controls and you know hearing you say that it sounds like the past six months of of fighting have been for almost for for for nothing if Hamas is still able to operate in some form of fashion we still don't have the hostages released so what has been the point of the past 6 months I mean as a military analyst I mean do you also find yourself trying to get through the fog of War all the time when you're trying to understand what's going on yeah I mean this is a great question uh and you'll have to look back at some of my DW interviews in October November December uh and along with many other people uh we pointed out that this type of high intensity ground combat that Israel has been practicing uh carrying out in the Gaza Strip is ultimately unsuited to trying to achieve what it said it wanted to achieve which was to destroy Hamas you need something much more targeted specific intelligence-led Precision taking out individual people and this way also of course you avoid these massive civilian casualties which are so counterproductive not just at Israel's International image but also it creates the next generation of insurgents or terrorists that want to fight Israel so I do think you know there is this question is this withdrawal and admission by the Israelis a tacit admission that actually their strategy hither to hasn't been working that well and now they're going to do something slightly different Mike Martin military analyst from Kings College London like as always we appreciate your time and your analysis thank you thank you very
