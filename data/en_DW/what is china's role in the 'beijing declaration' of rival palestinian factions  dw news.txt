Chinese State media say rival Palestinian factions including Hamas and fata have signed a declaration in Beijing to form a national Unity government at some unspecified time after the end of Israel's war in Gaza the two groups have competed for power in Gaza and the West Bank for years this Beijing declaration is aimed at strengthening Palestinian unity and involves more than a dozen Palestinian factions amass is considered a terrorist group by the US EU and other states but not by China Israel moved swiftly to reject the agreement declaring that hamas's rule will be crushed it's a pack that could end years of infighting between rival Palestinian factions representatives from fata and Hamas have Inked what host China calls a national Unity deal it also includes a dozen other Palestinian groups the outcome has defied expectations as previous attempts at bridging their divisions have failed Hamas runs Gaza while F controls parts of the occupied West Bank after feuding for nearly two decades they have committed to a new chapter today we sign an agreement for National unity and we believe that this is the path to completing our journey we are committed to National unity and we call for it China unlike many Western Nations does not consider Hamas a terror organization The Pact is a major diplomatic coup for broker Beijing China is Keen to bolster its influence in the region and to present itself as a peacemaker on the international stage after repeating calls for a ceasefire in Gaza Beijing laid out its vision for the territory postwar the second step is to uphold the principle of Palestinians governing Palestine and work together to advance the post-war governance of Gaza the war has left Gaza devastated and an early start to post-war reconstruction has become an urgent issue in the next stage but Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas for carrying out the October 7 Terror attacks and firmly rejects their involvement in governing Gaza the future of the strip is a major sticking point as Israel and Hamas weigh an internationally backed ceasefire proposal John B Alman is with the Middle East program of the center for strategic and International Studies welcome to DW what do you make of this deal uh I think it's an interesting step I'm not sure how much it's actually going to mean there's a lot that will need to come between seeming to have a unified Palestinian position and Palestinians acting together uh I think while there's nothing moving in the Palestinian space it's an interesting step to take but I'm not sure this changes the picture for anything once people start having to make decisions exactly there there do seem to be lots of ifs around this this this deal looks like it'll if come into effect at some unspecified time in the future when if the war in Gaza is over and it's such a big if it makes you wonder if the deal is really just an opportunity for China to play at peacemaking well I China wants to demonstrate that it has diplomatic chops that it can talk to all kinds of people it can bring together people who ordinarily can't find ways to talk together that's certainly what China was doing when it facilitated a Saudi Iranian deal about 15 months ago but the reason this is so hard is because the stakes become very high you're talking about a lot of power a lot of money and people perceive it as a zero some game either you're on the the PLO side or on the Hamas side and ultimately for a lot of people there those are two incompatible organizations either one's going to win or the other that the Chinese like to talk about win-win Solutions but it's easier to have win-win Solutions when you're only talking about talking and it's harder to have win-win Solutions when people say you know somebody really could lose here and they don't just lose now they lose billions of dollars for decades into the future neither one is willing to do that and Israel of course has said that this deal is nonsense and will move to crush Hamas and what does it tell us that a what you might call interested party like Israel didn't learn about this deal until after it was done well I'm sure they knew it was I mean I knew it was moving forward I I did some interviews as was as they were talking about going what it actually is going to mean I'm not really sure it's partly what it means in the Palestinian environment where neither side really has a lot of legitimacy because each side has has failed in any number of ways but on the Israeli side if you can't get Israelis to acknowledge it then what tools do you actually have to effectuate it um I think what is sort of missing from this whole thing is a theory of the case of how all the parties are going to be brought together and whether that's about stopping violence in Gaza or leading toward some sort of reconstruction in Gaza or thinking about what the political future in Gaza is I think ultimately you're going to need a lot of stakeholders and the Palestinian side can say in theory we've decided to come together but going from that to having any solution to the the really desperate challenges of 2 million people in Gaza there's a long way to go and we're only at the very beginning of that Journey okay so China gets to play a peacemaker in the Middle East fine talk to us more about how uh China's relations with Israel which of course is is is going to be relevant to this has China for instance picked a side in the Israel Hamas conflict well traditionally China was very much on the Palestinian side in the last decade maybe two China has gotten a little closer to Israel they have certainly tried to engage with Israelis on issues of Technology surveillance to some degree of some some Weapons Systems although the United States was very careful to ensure that that American weapons technology didn't migrate through Israel to China uh and there's been some Chinese investment in Israel but since October 7 we've seen an increasing distance between China and Israel and China has really decided to double down on the idea that we are the the leaders of the global South the global South includes the Palestinian national movement and Israel is part of an oppressive hegemonic effort to deprive the Palestinian of what they rightly deserve uh there's been a lot of daylight between Israel and China in the last nine months I don't think that's going to go away quickly but of course Israel does have things that China wants and Israel also thinks it's important as you go through the world China is a great power and it's good to have good relations with great Powers CH Israel was very serious about not just having good relations with the United States but inculcating good relations with both China and Russia I think Israel is going to be open to better relations with China and I would expect that when the dust settles China will be open to improving relations with Israel in the years to come thanks for talking us through that John B timman from the center for strategic and international studies thank you very much
