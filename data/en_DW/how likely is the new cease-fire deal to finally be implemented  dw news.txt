now to the war in Gaza and Hamas has responded to the us back proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza saying it wants some amendments to the deal neither Israel nor Hamas have publicly committed to the plan the United States had been hoping for an outright acceptance of the deal by both sides Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has spent the last few days traveling across the Middle East trying to promote it on Monday the UN Security Council endorsed the plan calling on both Israel and Hamas to enact it immediately without conditions let's take a closer look now at the original deal that blinkin is trying to get all siid to sign up to it's made up of three phases in the first the release of some hostages the return of Palestinian prisoners and partial troop withdrawal under a six we truce the second includes a permanent ceasefire yet to be negotiated that would mean the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip the third phase would focus on a plan to rebuild Gaza well for more on this Let's cross over to Professor Simon mayborne he's a Middle East Analyst at Lancaster University in the UK thanks for being with us Simon Israel and Hamas are under huge pressure to approve the unbacked ceasefire proposal for Gaza what's your assessment of the likelihood of this deal actually getting done oh yeah you're right to say there is huge pressure here on all sides it is pretty clear from the UN making this commitment at Security Council passing this resolution that there is growing pressure on Israel on Hamas to actually get a ceasefire and that's unsurprising given the scale of the humanitarian suffering the scale of the devastation across Gaza now the likelihood of it actually coming off however is I think uh pretty difficult to assess the first phase of of of the plan as you've just outlined is is perhaps the most probable and the most likely but it gets far thornier and Far more complex when we move into phases two and three and I I'm particularly worried when we get to those stages now Kat has been hosting these truce talks and other Arab countries like Egypt and Jordan are involved too how much influence Simon do do these countries have in the negotiations especially with respect to Hamas well it's about putting pressure on Hamas and I think in the sense that that Qatar has has long been a an ally a host of Hamas not necessarily a supporter but they've been open to to to playing home to some of the Hamas figures like khed Michel who who fled Gaza in the past so it has a good deal of influence in that respect and also perhaps the more important thing is that it has the money and Hamas is obviously particularly concerned about how Gaza is going to be rebuilt the money has to be found somewhere and the Gulf States Qatar uh in particular is going to have a big role to play so I would imagine that Doha has got the ability to exert a good deal of influence but it's not so much the Hamas side that that I think is the concern here with regard to accepting this deal we've heard key figures suggesting that they they are willing to accept it it's more on the Israeli side I think that's where things get really complex H tell us more about how the Hamas leadership is dealing with this situation is it is it clear to you what their strategy is not particularly I think from the from the very offset of all of this on October 7 it's clear that that the Hamas leadership has has set out on a particular trajectory and found itself in in waters that it didn't necessarily want to find itself in um we've heard that the actual attack that was planned was far more limited than than what actually happened and that the the devastation of that terrorist attack was not what was originally intended or at least so we are led to believe so that tells us that there is a lack of coordination there is a lack of a clear strategy and that's certainly coming out um with regard to what has been happening in Gaza in the in the months since and that's not surprising given the political situation in Gaza given the realities on the ground of life in Gaza in this conflict there's intense speculation Simon about what will become of Gaza after the war ends uh what do you think is the most likely scenario for how that territory will be governed well it depends who you're asking here because the International Community wants the PA to be the the main sort of driver of politics in palestin auth in the Gaza Strip Israel the Palestinian Authority yes sorry uh the Israelis are perhaps a little less inclined to do that because that opens the door for Hamas influence and Benjamin Netanyahu has said that there can be no Hamas in Gaza he's he's hung his hat on this idea of defeating Hamas and eradicating it and that leaves a bit of a problem a conundrum because understandably the Israelis do not want a Hamas presence in Gaza because they have just enjoyed this absolutely devastating terrorist attack but at the same time the International Community wants a democratic space for people to engage politically in Gaza and that could potentially as it has done in the past lead to Kamas and that would be onp palatable for many in Israel and indeed many in the International Community so there's a there's a real conundrum here as to what happens next but I think in terms of the most likely scenario I would imagine it would be some type of either Arab or International peacekeeping force that would serve as a transitionary sort of role but then what happens after that is the big question it's kicking the question of the quote unquote the day after just a little bit further down the road Simon thank you very much that was Simon maybon Middle East analyst and professor at Lancaster University in the UK let's crawl straight over to our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca ritters Rebecca what are you hearing about efforts to finalize this deal we understand that Hamas is proposing new conditions yeah that's right Terry late last evening we got word that Hamas had finally uh handed over their um response their official response it was much awaited to the Egyptian and Qatari negotiators and within that response we're hearing that amendments uh have been requested that they haven't given their allout uh approval of the the current deal on the table we know that it's also now with us negotiators and and all three parties are mulling over just the requests that are being you know asked by Hamas so we don't know any detail uh about what those are we do know that there was uh a more stringent timeline given to a permanent ceasefire and that Hamas have reiterated or reaffirmed that their priority is indeed that permanent ceasefire we heard from a Hamas spokes person who said that this is a clear clear reaffirmation of our commitment to a ceasefire and that the response is uh responsible serious and positive certainly wanting to at least appear that they are trying to work towards this uh agreement or working towards uh perhaps a slightly different agreement now it's probably not the response that the US were hoping before we know that they would have much preferred an all out thumbs up from Hamas uh but I think it comes as no surprise as Hamas had been saying all along that they wouldn't enter into a deal that didn't have a clear uh outcome of a permanent ceasefire what about the Israeli side Rebecca the US says Israel has agreed to the deal why have we not heard that from Israel directly well Israel has been sending some mixed messages when it comes to this deal the US has certainly been selling this deal as an Israeli backed deal and saying that Israel has been on board Secretary of State Anthony blinkin when he was here um you know again said that he was reaffirmed by Benjamin Netanyahu the prime minister of Israel uh that they were behind the deal uh and and that they were committed to it but we didn't hear anything official now yesterday before hamas's response we got word sort of by way of an Israeli uh government spokesperson largely thought to be from the prime minister's office to say that again that Israel were behind the deal but that their priority was of course to be able to complete their military aims meaning that they wanted to completely dismantle Hamas and therefore you know therefore tacitly don't agree to a permanent ceasefire we know that Israel you know is now the government is never very reliant on the far-right factions of its uh government and they are saying that they will they will break up the Coalition the governing coalition if it enters into any agreement that moves towards a permanent ceasefire before they complete their military aims the us trying to sell it as to Israel basically saying that they have completed their military aims that they have destroyed Hamas that Hamas isn't capable of carrying out another October 7 and therefore trying to be able to tell those farri people that they have completed those aims but clearly not really getting that over the line and I I think we wouldn't have seen an allout commitment to that proposal from the Israeli side either Rebecca thank you our correspondent Rebecca R's there in Jerusalem
