Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Israeli military has set a date for sending Ground Forces into Rafa but is not specified when this will happen the US opposes the plan saying that it would have a devastating impact on civilians and Israel's own security netanyahu's statement comes days after Israel's Army withdrew troops from K Yunis some gazin have already started to return to the rubble in gaza's second largest city over a million are still Sheltering in Rafa most of gaza's population has been displaced by the Israeli offensive which was launched after the October 7th Terror attacks by Hamas now Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner is a spokesman for Israel's military and he told us why Israel considers Rafa to be so crucial to defeat Hamas we do know that in the Gaza Strip there are still at least uh six operational battalions of Hamas four of those indeed in the Rua area two in more Central Gaza um operating at a lower capacity but in the south in Rafa there are still four operational battalions if we are going to be successful at dismantling Hamas we're going to have to go to Rafa I think if we've learned anything from our rescue operation two months ago in Rafa uh that hostages are being held there and that there is an extensive force that can conduct organized fighting against us so we need to operate in order to get rid of Hamas and bring back the hostages let's take this to our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya Israel seems determined to go into Rafa despite many calls opposing this plan including from their staunchest allies why would Israel take the risk nonetheless well I mean I think Israel doesn't see it as a risk it does see it as a necessity we just heard it from the spokesperson of the Israeli military and we've heard it also from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu time and time again that the military needs to go into Rafa to destroy those four battalions they're also still uh searching for the leadership and there's also a lot of pressure on Netanyahu um this announcement that there's a date for Rafa although it wasn't specified when and how this will happen uh also uh was uh came after a lot of criticism by his far-right cabinet minister saying the policy of maximum pressure on Hamas uh need to be uh maintained and of course this all happens in the fines of uh you know International opposition International uh pressure of not going ahead especially also from Israel's key Ally the United States they have said that Israel needs to present a clear plan uh how they will evacuate or how they will bring uh those uh estimated 1 million people that are Sheltering uh in rafar uh to some uh uh sort of safety their talks going on between the US and Israeli officials to explain how they're going to do it I mean the true cost is for the residents and for those displaced people in uh in Rafa and if you use the word Sheltering it's also not really describing the situation there are air strikes and Strikes on the city as well as the war is going on and we've been talking to people there in the past weeks they've been saying us we don't know where to go we don't know what to do um and they're very very concerned about these uh announcements that are coming uh every other day that an operation is imminent yeah and that is part of why the US for example is calling for an immediate ceasefire and Hamas and Israel both send delegations to Cairo for truce talks on Sunday Hamas which is of course considered a terrorist organization by many states says it is now studying the terms of a new proposed true steel what more can you tell us well uh this came After High Level talks uh by uh the mediators and also um with the US uh over the weekend now we understand that Hamas has said that uh it this proposal that was submitted by uh Egypt and Qatar to Hamas doesn't meet any of uh their demands but they will continue studying that and there is the expectation that they will give another answer some time soon now of course we have heard this many times before and depending on which source uh you know you're hearing sometimes it said there's progress sometimes I said the gaps are very wide it's mainly about the Hamas demands they're saying there needs to be a full ceasefire there needs to be a full withdrawal and uh people needs to be able to need to be able to return to the north so we're waiting to see uh what will actually happen here in the coming hours that was DW correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem is always great to get your insights thank you so much well amid hopes for a ceasefire in time for the end of Ramadan families in Gaza have been doing their best to prepare for Eid aler the celebrations marking the end of the fasting month but with most of the population displaced by the fighting and much of gaza's infrastructure destroyed this year's festivities will be difficult to organize these pastries are traditionally baked and eaten by Palestinians to celebrate Eid the end of the holy month of Ramadan but this year Aya al- masharawi is preparing them in a makeshift oven next to the tent she shares with her sisters and their children they fled their homes to this camp in Rafa in southern Gaza e used to be joyful the atmosphere was beautiful we used to make these pastries with with loved ones and distribute them but nowadays there's no joy need because we've been displaced from our homes our family members have been killed or are still in Gaza City so e doesn't bring as much joy anymore crowds Gather in this market in the city of De albala in central Gaza to buy supplies for the religious holiday here too the annual festivities are overshadowed by the ongoing conflict and food shortages have led to price spikes because of the war here in Gaza there's no Spirit or Joy the prices are too high no one is able to enjoy [Music] Eid UN trucks arrived in De albala for the first time in few months Distributing critical supplies among several schools and shelters but this renewed trickle of Aid does not go far enough to help the Palestinians who are Sheltering here as they face malnutrition and
