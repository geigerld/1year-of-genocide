well just over 24 hours remain in an extension granted to Pro Palestinian protesters at Columbia University in New York before they face eviction from a protest Camp erected on campus police arrested more than a hundred students last week in an attempt to quell the protest against Israel's war in Gaza but the Crackdown has inspired other protests at universities across the United States several colleges have closed campuses and hundreds of students have been arrested [Music] their message for the speaker of the house was clear as Mike Johnson visited Colombia's campus in New York his thoughts on the protesters were also unequivocal my message to the students inside the encampment is get go back to class and stop the nonsense there look if we want to have a debate on campus about the merits of these things let's do that but you can't intimidate your your fellow students and make them stay home from class think about that is that right do you think that's right stop wasting your parents money uh Congressman Lawler says I think that's right pressure on the school's Administration over its handling of the protests is intensifying with many including speaker Johnson calling for the President to resign I will say that the Administration has done just about everything possibly wrong it can do so far and every single move they've made has only made things worse the worst of all being calling the police on Peaceful Pro protesters who are mostly undergraduates of 18 19 20 years old demonstrators have been given until Friday to disperse before the police will be called in but despite demands to call off the protests students remain committed to the cause and supported by faculty today marks one week since our first encampment on the south lawn which was brutally dismantled by NYPD at the direction of columia Columbia University after approximately 34 hours our demands are the same divest disclose and amnesty for all I think it's just been wonderful the students have been very peaceful they're very committed young people who are anti-war antiviolence and pro Palestinian Liberation Colombia notified students at classes and exams for the rest of the semester will be offered online bringing a turbulent end to the Academic Year tww correspondent Benjamin Alvarez Gruber is at Columbia University he told us about the wider ramifications of these protests for us politics this is definitely a nationwide topic you just mentioned the White House we also had the Secretary of Education Who weigh in here saying that what he has seen on campus is is a disgrace the White House the press release that they send out out saying that anti-Semitism has no space Not only in any college across the country but also anywhere and as we hear also the concerns of Jewish students but also of Faculty members a rabby cloth to the university even told Jewish students to stay away but there is important to make a difference between the protesters protesting inside the university but also outside when we it came here earlier today we were hearing is some chance also some people were here is saying and rejecting a two-state solution quite different to the chance that were here in Sou but we can imagine that this will still develop as we see more and more universities more of this protest also happening across the country
