some Western countries have banned Pro Palestinian demonstrations saying they could disturb public order but tens of thousands of people in other parts of the world have joined rallies in support of the Palestinians and against the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that follow the terrorist attacks by Hamas many are calling for an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians thousands of kilometers away from the Gaza Strip these protesters in austral are expressing solidarity with the Palestinians demanding a just solution to the conflict I think now that the status quo has been broken we see what the consequences of this state of affairs is where for 75 years the International Community has not intervened I think now it is very clear that we cannot ignore the situation because it will continue to lead to violence unless something is done and I think the world is increasingly beginning to understand that it can no longer the right of the Palestinian people strong shows of support too for the Palestinians in the Chilean Capital Santiago 75 years of occupation of suffering of oppressed people who cannot stand it anymore I am very very sorry for the victims on both sides I do not support any death from any side in the streets of the Danish Capital Copenhagen and outside the White House in Washington DC in London tens of thousands of protesters called for a free Palestine many demanding an immediate ceasefire it's aing what happened last Saturday makes me feel I was shocked really shocked but what I'm seeing now is just War crime from Israel thousands of people are out in the streets in Muslim majority nations of Bangladesh Afghanistan and the conflict ridden country of [Music] Yemen authorities in Germany's Financial Capital Frankfurt banned a pro Palestinian rally the non-compliance with the order led to scuffles between the protesters and the police an action the administration justifies anyone who denies Israel's right to exist who want to attack Jewish life who call for violence or who tolerate the barbarism of Hamas even in the slightest is not protected by the right of assembly nor by democracy and that is why we have banned the rally in Paris too Police Stopped a banned Pro Palestinian rally is this democracy I'm sorry it's not a country of law here I'm sorry I'm outraged and frankly I voted for Emanuel macron and I regret it I regret it with no signs of the conflict coming to an end emotions worldwide are raging I'm now joined for more um by our reporter Bish Bish you've looked at the international reactions to these latest uh develop uh developments what's driving these Pro Palestinian protests um ghard um instead of condemning the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel the focus of these protests has been um Israeli strikes and many of these protesters are saying that um civilians are a collateral damage in these strikes and they're asking um that uh these strikes be stopped now many of the protesters are also saying that Palestinians for long have been living in under an occupation and they have been treated in unjust and unfair way and the anger is not only directed towards Israel it's also directed towards International Community and especially to Western Powers um the protesters say that um uh their um response has been um um unjust and for long they have failed in the diplomacy to find a just solution to the conflict is that the only reason that so much of this anger is is directed at Western Powers predominantly the US I should think uh and not Hamas so I think one of the reasons why these protesters are uh saying that the Western um Power Powers response is so basically they say that um in the recent conflict the response from the Western Powers is more more supportive towards uh Israel and is less considerate towards the Palestinian people who are just now caught up in this conflict and I think one of the root causes or one of the reasons behind these protest is also the anti- US sentiment uh especially in Muslim majority countries uh and that anti us sentiment that increased significantly after 9/11 so during us war on terror many of the countries that saw us military interventions were Muslim countries like Afghanistan uh Iraq Syria uh Libya and these uh military interventions caused a lot of Destruction um militias were formed um civil thousands of civilians were killed so there's this element of anti us sentiment and many of these people see in the current conflict Israel as an extension of the west or as an a strong Ally of the US and therefore that is also uh the anger that we see in these protests there are also signs that this this conflict could be fueling political extremism in other countries are there any signs for that I think that is one of the most worrying Trends so Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by the by us by Germany EU and many other countries that terrorist organization is being glorified by religious groups in countries like Pakistan Indonesia Bangladesh there have been rallies in these countries with thousands of followers of these religious groups and in these rallies you can see um you can hear fiery speeches of these religious leaders glorifying Hamas and portraying Hamas as a hero organization and what we saw in Syria that Islamic State was able to recruit people not only from Muslim countries but also from other from Western countries um and the the fear is that with these fiery speeches and hatred against Israel and and glorification of Hamas many of these people could be radicalized and they could pick up arms and join armed groups or terrorist groups whose agenda is to fight um the Western World and thank you very much
