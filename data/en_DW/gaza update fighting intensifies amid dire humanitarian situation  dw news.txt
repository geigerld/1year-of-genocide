Israeli tanks have reached the center of Southern gaza's main city Kan Yunis the Israeli Army earlier told civilians to evacuate and fierce battles have been reported in the area the Hamas run health authority in Gaza says almost 18,000 people have been killed there since fighting started Israel was rejecting international calls for humanitarian ceasefire saying it is determined to push ahead with its offensive against Hamas militants Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by multiple countries another day of Destruction begins in Gaza in can yunes people wake to find nearby buildings in Ruins following Israeli air strikes and their neighbors stuck under Rubble they were like any other Ordinary People they prayed at night and slept a normal routine in Gaza we said our evening prayer and we woke up with a roof falling on our heads for those who do survive the situation in Gaza is dire it's getting colder outside thousands are injured and medical supplies are running low there's barely any food or water and very little Aid is trickling in desperate people have tried stealing supplies as misery grows in Gaza so also do calls for a ceasefire but one was blocked last week at the UN Security Council vetoed by the US that veto has been heavily criticized by Regional leaders meeting in Doha it's not up to Israel only it is those who have give those who have given the Israelis the greenest of the green light to continue killing the Palestinians for United States to block a United Nations security resolution one should hold the Americans responsible as part of the launching attack on the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank other Arab leaders say the actions of Israel's armed forces are harming its own interests and damaging the chances of Peace Israel has created an amount of hatred that will haunt this this this region that will Define generations for come and therefore it's hurting its own people as much as it is hurting everybody else in the region this is a war that canot be one Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war in Gaza will only intensify over the next few days and that there will be no end until Hamas is eliminated let hear from journalist Sami so in Jerusalem Sami uh strong words there by Jordan's foreign minister does he have a point I think many would agree with some of the things that he's saying uh the images that are seen here in networks of Israel bombarding residential areas Israel bombarding hospitals Israel killing women and children all of this very aggressive campaign and especially the site of Palestinian leaving their homes and wandering again this is what many Arabs see as another nakba another catastrophe the same kind of catastrophe that hit the Palestinians in 1948 if not worse then there were 800,000 who left their homes today we're talking about more than double so this is the kind of atmosphere that the foreign minister is talking about and already now the Israeli government has been warning its citizens not to visit tourist destinations in Turkey in the Sinai in the Southern siai and in neighboring countries now Jordan's foreign minister of course speaking about a time after the war does the Israeli government have a plan for the Gaza Strip after this offensive well usually they tried to keep it a little bit obscure but recently Israeli media has published a document that came out on the 13th of October and this is a document that was produced by the ministry of intelligence and there they they check the different options one of them is a Palestinian State and there they say that that is not an option and that the Palestinians should not get a prize for this attack that they waged on the 7th of October the other would be the ruling of a local government and they say that would not work either because because of the Israeli occupation they expect that the elements in the Gaza Strip will be more radical than Hamas and therefore the option is to expel the Palestinian population to the Sinai and settle them in Egypt in the Sinai and the the first stage would be building tents there and then more permanent towns and then the next stage would be encouraging them maybe to leave to other countries and they mentioned Spain and Greece and Canada I can tell you that the Egyptians are not happy at all with this plan and they've said that the Palestinian question has to be resolved in pal there has to be a Palestinian state in the Gazza strip West Bank in East Jerusalem and not on Egyptian soil and this has been a source of tension between the two countries the Egyptians have also built a kind of like a mount of Earth along the border between the Gaza Strip and the Sinai in order to prevent movement of refugees that might spill over to their territory Sami Soo then in Jerusalem thank you very much for sharing your expertise with us un Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez says he expects public order in Gaza will soon break down diseases will spread and there will be Mass displacement into Egypt I said that we are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system the situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and Security in the region chairman foreign minister analina verok warned that hunger in Gaza could lead to more terrorist incidents the Israeli Army must do more to protect civilians in Gaza it's not enough to Simply instruct them to seek protection when there is in fact no protection possible on the ground we are seeing how not just the suffering but the hunger is fueling further terrorism our correspondent Tanya ker is standing by for us in Jerusalem hello Tanya the International Community is increasing the pressure on Israel but will this change anything in Jerusalem well we don't see any change and I don't think the Israeli government right now is yielding to any of such calls we've heard so these calls also in the past weeks so we heard again this morning uh Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin netan saying that uh stopping the war right now would be inconsistent with their goal to eliminating uh Hamas we've heard other Israeli officials um saying uh similar uh things as well in the past days they're pressing ahead and actually we're seeing intensified uh intensified fighting uh in Gaza across the whole Gaza Strip but we also heard katari officials saying that they are still pushing uh for negotiations Qatar being uh one of the main mediators between uh Israel and Hamas alongside Egypt and the United States of course indirectly um saying that they are trying to uh stop the war to get to some humanitarian ceasefire but also uh to uh free some more hostages but they're also saying that the window is becoming very narrow because of the ongoing bombardment of the Gaza Strip and and also of course this comes uh after the u United States vetoed un Security Council call for a humanitarian ceas by on Friday as you see the fight is intensifying it's both in the North and South isn't it it is at the moment what we're hearing uh from the Israeli military they have given us an updated uh uh statement this morning with their uh ongoing military activities saying they have have struck over 250 targets by Sunday morning within the last 24 hours and we've seen mainly getting reports from the north uh of Gaza in the jabalia refugee camp but also from Eastern Gaza City in J but mainly uh also from the south uh um there a lot of fighting there's a lot of fighting going on in KH Yunis which is the second largest city uh in uh the Gaza Strip and of course this has devastated devastating impact on the civilian population uh they have been called on you know to evacuate again from these areas a bit more about the situation of civilians in Gaza it is quite dire isn't it it is and uh I've been talking to people there on the phone of course as journalists we are not allowed to go in um they've been telling me for weeks now that they have no safe space uh to go many of them have been displaced in the first weeks of the war from the north to the South they have been displaced many times you know to different locations always looking for a safer spot but also of course air rates uh and air bombardment is going on as well in the north as well as in the South the United Nations have said that uh about an estimated 80% of the Gaza the population in Gaza has been uh displaced and of course the situation gets more dire by the day they're also saying they have difficulties now in reaching uh people with humanitarian Aid because of the Intensive fighting uh going on as well in the South to correspondent Tanya kma in Jerusalem thank you let's bring in Frank lewi he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University a former uh British Military Intelligence officer as well now how close is Israel to achieve its stated goal to eradicate Hamas entirely well good evening Gart over the last couple of days the IDF has stated that it thinks that it's probably got about three to four weeks of operations left just in hanun the US indicated their preference that you that Israel cease operations by the end of this year the end of this month that's not going to happen because after hanun they reckon on another few weeks to clear the rest of the strip that said there is no doubt whatsoever that they are making a big impact on Hamas they claim and I think fairly reasonably to have killed about 7,000 Hamas operators and captured some more however that's a fraction I think probably a fairly large fraction of the Hamas Force so there's a long time to go of course the countervailing pressure is the US here and how long the US essentially and to a less extent is is's other allies such as Germany will tolerate the level of Civilian casualties now talking about civilian casualties many Palestinians have been displaced to the south of the country that's where the current offensive is pointing how is Israel trying to avoid civilian casualties there it's always important to remember here that there's a bright line between the deliberate murder torture rape and other Horrors that we saw just over two months ago all of which was deliberate added to which of course is hamas's use of its main defensive weapon which is its civilian population and the assaults by Israel now that said Israel has certainly eased the early in the war actually eased its Rules of Engagement meaning that civilian casualties collateral damages it's horribly called called is is far more likely now Israel has a targeting system which is based allegedly on on artificial intell Ence it generates huge numbers of targets so for example today the IDF said that it had hit 22,000 targets within Gaza now you can't avoid civilian casualties like that especially when you're operating like that you can't conduct the estimates or the surveys necessary to provide I think a a reasonable level of protection to civilians question is is this proportionate that's not for me to answer there is no doubt however that United States has put pressure on Israel equally no doubt I think that Israel has largely uh not answered the leverage that the US is trying to apply hence the continuing level of casualties which I think In fairness to Israel has reduced over the last week or so the military analyst Frank ledwich there thank you very much Frank thank you sir we're now joined by Hiba T she's Deputy Regional director with heal organization care hello hea the International Community is putting pressure on Israel to protect civilians in Gaza could this help in any way good afternoon IDI uh so far we have seen that since many many days no one expected that after almost two months we will be having this conversation and explaining that the situation is becoming more and more harsh and catastrophic yet we are hearing the people in Gaza we are hearing the colleagues in Gaza we are hearing other peer organizations different actors all of them trying to their to put an end and reach out to seize fire we remain hopeful and we hope that that this will be happening and it can be happening it can happen soon uh so we remain hateful hopeful and we hope that these this these efforts will will make a difference we saw that they made a difference even if slightly during the truth and now we are hopeful that it will have a longer impact you've been speaking to people on the ground in Gaza what are they telling you so uh unfortunately week after week we were saying that the situation is become more difficult and worse Unfortunately today um if I can just share with you a very bad uh uh image or a photo of what my colleagues were telling me um with all the the images that we see with destruction in the north and potentially in kanun now you you would see in the in in ra and the surrounding area that as per my colleagues were describing it a sea of people sea of human beings there is no one space one empty space for an additional tent and not even a a tent but these wood with plastic sheets shelters that people are trying to have no no trees are remaining in the South because people use them for for heat purposes or for cooking purposes they don't have food they are more thirsty more hungry more in pain but as I mentioned although they at a certain moment feel that they are abandoned and in danger still hopeful for a solution that can come in in the near future and you've also talked about uh kids that are traumatized with the ongoing conflict that must also be a critical situation isn't it uh only today a couple of hours ago we were talking about specifically the situation of kids here in in Jordan with different actors and unfortunately even those who are interested to for instance in the educational sector everyone was saying that in addition to to the difficulty with all the destruction for instance of schools and infrastructure related to education one of the major barriers that we are facing is related to psychological trauma of what the kids have seen and how how many how months it would require them to go back to a potentially normal life they expect not less than 24 months for the kids specifically to to be able to go back to a as close as possible to normal life unfortunately right so what can your organization do to help so far what we have been focusing on and this is our specialty is related to health sector H we were also working with people to distribute water and what we call Hygiene kits and with the beginning of winter we focused on on securing blankets thermal blankets um mattresses any items that would help would help people to to survive the harsh weather but also to to Bear sleeping in in in in the air with no shelters of course what we have done is very very little compared to the requirements but even a drop in the ocean makes a difference right here about TV of Care thank
