German Chancellor Olaf Schultz is in Washington for talks with lawmakers and President Biden on the agenda are the Israel Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine ahead of his trip the chancellor gave a brief statement in which he urged the EU and us to do more to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia the US Senate remains divided on releasing uh more funds last week the EU approved a 50 billion Euro Aid package for Ukraine following months of wrangling Chancellor Schultz appealed to lawmakers in Congress to put their differences aside the developments that we're currently observing in the US Senate are a positive sign we hope a decision will be made soon I don't want to speculate on how long it will take it may take a few more attempts but it would be good if a decision came soon this is about sending a big important and clear message to the Russian president and it's about active help for Ukraine Chief political editor mner is standing by so aid for Ukraine is going to be the focus of this meeting what can we expect in regard to that well the German chancer is arriving in a very volatile week here in domestic politics that is increasingly spilling out into the world having a direct effect potentially on Ukraine and that's of course what Olaf Schultz is concerned about what is EU partners are concerned about he was very happy that he was able to present as uh in time a success from the European and having secured a 50 billion EUR worth of funding from Europeans but it's the United States who is the biggest um assistant to Ukraine in this fight against Russia particularly militarily there Germany is the second largest so you have the first and second largest um Ally in military terms sitting down today and working out out on how to best help Ukraine more into the future with the US experiencing that political domestic squeeze that comes as a direct order from Donald Trump who is slowing down and potentially bringing to a grinding halt The Continuous Flow of us assistance to Ukraine so Olaf Schultz knows he's taking home some homework that's for sure that Europeans will have to do more and aid for Israel and Taiwan will also be on the agenda tell us more about that yes these of course are also two key conflicts we will also see Israel's two staunchest allies sitting down here today and both we just heard it um US President Biden directly criticizing Israel um for its military campaign being quote over the toop also calling for a sustained um Sease of fighting whatever that means in practical terms uh so both seem to be pretty much on the same page there which we've heard uh from the German side requires a lot of coordination as well and Taiwan is looming on the horizon as the next potential upset to a world order to a relative stability that is being attacked from all sides um here both leaders will also be speaking about China of which both are economically also highly dependent so it's all interconnected but we're seeing more and more key potential conflict areas that could upset also the stability of these two countries and M on a lighter note Schultz also met with what he calls his doppelganger tell us a little bit more about the man who makes the chance or smile well um he he actually isn't really known as very much of someone who has a particular sense of humor uh but it looks that Olaf Schultz seems to be discovering that when he heads to the United States but that certainly can't gloss over the fact that we're heading into various serious talks and very serious times here in DC okay uh Mel kufner thank you so much and uh we have to say that uh Chris Coons does indeed look a lot like Chancellor Schultz DW's Washington bureau chief iness pole takes a look now at some of Schultz's previous visits to the White House and where German American relations could be heading in the future when US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Schultz meet in Washington the stakes can hardly be higher the danger of the conflict in the Middle East escalating into a configration seems to be increasing every day the Russian aggression against Ukraine shows no sign of stopping Biden calls Schultz when he wants to talk to Europe particularly on the two big crises Ukraine and the Middle East Schultz just helped get a 50 billion Euro Aid package for Keef across the political Finishing Line at an EU Summit in Brussels and just like the United States Germany is staunchly at Israel's side the US president and the German Chancellor will come together to reaffirm their strong support for Ukraine when Olaf Schulz will be meeting Joe Biden here in the Oval Office right behind me he will not only be meeting president who is unable to get any further funding for Ukraine through Congress but also president who is just at the beginning of an election cycle on which end we might see another president in the White House who promised to cut all funding for Ukraine if Donald Trump wins this visit of a German chancellor at the White House might be the last one for quite some time the former president cares little about the transatlantic relationship and even less about a good good relationship with Germany putting the future of us German corporation on the thorniest global issues very much in
