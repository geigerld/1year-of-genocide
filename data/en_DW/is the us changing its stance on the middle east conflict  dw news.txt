US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin heads to Israel on Monday as he continues a diplomatic push to stop the war in Gaza from igniting into a wider regional conflict speaking to Qatar blinkin warned Israel it was imperative to put a premium on protecting civilians in Gaza Israel is battling Hamas which is classified as a terrorist organization by the US Germany and many other countries Anthony blinken on a diplomatic drive to prevent the spread of the Israel Hamas war after meetings in Qatar the US Secretary of State warned on Sunday the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could metastasize and threaten Security in The Wider Middle East in Doha Lincoln laid out his goals and he had praise for his hosts in all of my meetings over the last two days we've discussed ongoing efforts to better protect civilians in Gaza and to get more humanitarian assistance to them and to get the remaining hostages out and home with their loved ones cutter was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the simultaneous release of more than 100 hostages including American citizens uh and a pause in the fighting that during that time enabled us to double the flow of humanitarian Aid to civilians in Gaza for these displac Palestinians caught in the crossfire of this conflict in Gaza help can't come soon enough and the US Secretary of State made his position on their status clear Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow they cannot they must not be pressed to leave Gaza but at the funeral of two Palestinian journalists killed in an apparent Israeli air strike in the south of the Gaza Strip the prospect of Peace seems far away binkin said the killings were an unimaginable tragedy and that he was deeply sorry for the family's loss the US top diplomats Middle East Tour continues on Monday with visits that include Israel and the occupied West Bank Jason cidonia is the Los Angeles bureau chief for NBC news radio and joins us now so blinkin says it is essential for Israel to do more to protect civilians and called for more aid for civilians in Gaza is this a sign that the US is changing stance I really believe that he's there as a show of force and what he originally said about he doesn't want the crisis in the Goa strip to uh get any bigger he doesn't want any other groups he doesn't want any other countries to join in the fight for either side I think that really is his message him going out there and meeting with all these other uh diplomats and and leaders is just a way of saying hey America's here and if you if we have to we'll Flex our muscle critics are already saying that this is a uh all show noo event where it's not going to trigger a significant ceasefire or allow uh Aid to get to the people of of the Gaza Strip or allow uh the two sides to somehow come together and and call you know call it off or call Peace to in that part of the world right now it's just being seen as uh America going out and showing them hey we're involved and we're keeping a close eye on the situation at hand all right so America is attempting to sa face in the region it seems like and the state department has also said that it expects hard conversations when it reaches out to its Israel Israeli counterparts do they actually have any tools that they can still use to put pressure on Israel after three months of conflict you know I'm not I'm not exactly sure what those conversations are going to entail but I'll tell you when a when a when a state leader when the Secretary of State goes to another country and says there's going to be hardcomers conversations I'm sure there's going to be consequences for actions what those consequences could be I'm not exactly sure blink has also said that he wants the Palestinian people to be able to return home and they shouldn't be forced out of the Gaza Strip so that might be seen as you know changing sides or changing uh the way America sets up their their allies in that part of the world uh I can't answer that but I can tell you that if America says that they're out there um and 's going to be consequences that there there will be um I will say this that critics of blinkin are saying that he's an American doing what Americans do he's going into another country to tell that country how to run the country and that may be seen as an offense to the Israeli government uh we haven't heard much uh from Netanyahu talking directly to the president of the United States as of late um but I'm sure some of this will will shake the I think I think blink's out there to shake the trees to see what what they can do in that part of the world and the State of the Union so President Biden will address the nation in about two weeks or so and I'm sure this is going to be high on the docket because it's a very volatile issue here in the states all right that was Jason cadonia with NBC News Radio thank you very much for your reporting thank
