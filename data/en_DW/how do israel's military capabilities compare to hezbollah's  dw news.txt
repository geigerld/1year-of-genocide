US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has urged Israel not to further escalate the ongoing conflict with Hezbollah across the Israel Lebanon border both sides have been exchanging fire on an almost daily basis since the Hamas terror attack on Israel late last year earlier this week Israel's military revealed that it had approved an operational plan to invade Lebanon and secure the Border let's take a look at each side's military capabilities and what this would mean if a war broke out Hezbollah Rockets fired from Southern Lebanon intercepted by Israeli air defenses a common occurrence in recent weeks but some of those Rockets make it through and Israel has retaliated with devastating air strikes Hezbollah was founded as an anti-American and anti-israel militia in the 1980s when it carried out deadly car bombings on American forces in Lebanon the group has fought several Wars with Israel since then and has become a major political Force backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from Iran the militia prizes secrecy and typically doesn't reveal information on its capabilities so any estimates of its forces are just that but in recent years us intelligence has put its strength at 45,000 soldiers including full-time and reservist Fighters the group's leader referred to having 100,000 fighters in 2021 if that were true it would have more soldiers than the Lebanese Army last year the US estimated that Hezbollah also has 150,000 rockets and missiles more than enough to overwhelm Israeli air defenses and cause significant damage to infrastructure in a war Israel has one of the world's most modern militaries in addition to 170,000 active duty soldiers there are about 465,000 reservists it also has about 1,400 tanks as as well as significant artillery and multiple rocket launching capabilities it also has an Air Force with over 200 jet fighters and almost 150 helicopters and it's widely considered to have nuclear weapons though it's unlikely to use them right across its own border there's also the Iron Dome an advanced anti-missile system that has intercepted thousands of rockets from Hezbollah and Hamas something Hezbollah itself lacks an allout War would likely cause significant damage to Israeli and Lebanese cities with high civilian casualties after months of fighting Hamas in Gaza Israel's Army is also in danger of being overstretched and there are worries that intense fighting could bring in Iran and the US in a major regional conflict let's get more from DW correspondent Rebeca rits who's following events in Jerusalem Rebecca is the Israeli Army prepared for a possible two-front War One against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon well beish the Israeli military maintain that they are prepared for anything they have had troops stationed up in that northern border region since the very beginning of the war with Gaza when Hezbollah began uh attacking the Northern parts of Israel on the 8th of October they've been training up there just in June there was a rather large training exercise almost a full scale Preparatory exercise for what would happen under an attack and how uh they might proceed with an attack of their own and just this week we also heard from the military to say that they had green lit now and a plan of attack for carrying out a full-scale confrontation with Hezbollah in Lebanon uh there is little doubt though that a twoof front War would stretch a military that has you know troops and and uh you know resources tied up in many fronts also not forgetting the the amount of troops and resources that are tied up also in the occupied West Bank so military experts certainly wouldn't probably recommend opening up a second front at the same time and that's certainly what they the Israeli military have been trying to hold off from doing they certainly wanted to try and at least wrap up the the war that they have is ongoing in Gaza before they opened up that second front but as that war in Gaza drags on uh you know we may see that they will be confronted with the decision of having to open up the second front and on Thursday the Israeli Army claimed to have killed a Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon what is Israel's strategy Behind These targeted killings well in lie of carrying out a fullon confrontation with Hezbollah to try to push the militant group back from the border to allow for uh their some 60,000 residents to return to those border communities uh the Israeli military have been continuing and carrying out this tit fortat uh conflict with hezb militants and you know in that tit fortat they have been targeting Hezbollah commanders in order these targeting attacks as well as also infrastructure targets weapons depos launching sites and the and the like in order to try to mitigate some of the the tip fortat that's coming in the other direction and to try to lessen the force that Hezbollah has and of course lessen the resources and the force that Hezbollah have uh and its ability to try uh and attack those Northern Communities so that certainly and a strategy there I I I I think what we we're likely to see is a further conf confrontation that will go further than these targeted attacks and is there support among the Israeli population for a possible offensive against Hezbollah I think the answer to that question is certainly yes the people I've spoken to support might be a strong word there because you know I don't think it's that Israel particularly wants to go to war and certainly to open a second front at a time when its resources are stretched but it is when you speak to people residents in particular there's a resignation that this is a necessary step when I've been up in the north and I was there again yesterday and in previous reporting trips up there when you talk to people they say that they would simply wouldn't return to those communities if an allout War isn't carried out if hezb is not pushed back they they said that a political solution simply wouldn't make them feel safe enough and even when you talk to Residents that aren't from those border communities people in hia for example the northern the biggest northern city you know they say that they are expecting this to to happen and that they do think it's necessary we'll leave it there for the moment DW's in Jerusalem thanks so much
