diplomatic meetings are underway across the middle east in an effort to deescalate Rising Regional tension Jordan's foreign minister has made a rare visit to Iran where talks have also taken place with representatives from Egypt Oman and Qatar the US and its allies are urging all parties to prevent a wider escalation of the conflict following the assassination of the Hamas leader Ismael hania in tan now Iran has vowed to punish Israel for that killing but its foreign Ministry said say it is not looking to escalate tensions that's according to the reuter news agency well as Hamas considers its leadership options following the killing of its political leader Ismael hania attention now turns to the Palestinian militant group's chief on the ground in Gaza Yahya Sina is the man Israel believes orchestrated the October 7 Terror attacks it's been pursuing him ever since and has vowed to kill him Sina is hamas's top boss in Gaza born in the Kan yunus refugee camp he has been with the militant group since its Beginnings in the late 1980s around the time of the first inada or Palestinian Uprising against Israeli occupation back then he led a security network which Tracked Down Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel sinoa was jailed by Israel in 1988 for planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians he was locked up for 23 years eventually released in 2011 he was one of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners exchanged for one Israeli soldier having served as a commander of hamas's military Wing sinoa was elected as the group's Gaza leader in 20 17 he issued this threat while speaking to crowds in Gaza in December 2022 we will come to you God willing in a roaring flood we will come to you with an endless number of rockets we will come to you in a flood of soldiers without limit we will come to you with millions of our nation tide after tide Israel accuses sinir of being the chief planner of the October 7th Terror attacks which killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage in Gaza the one who decided on this despicable attack was yaka ala The Sovereign of the Gaza Strip therefore him and the whole system under him are as good as dead we will attack them we will dismantle them we will dismantle their [Music] system Israeli forces have hunted him relentlessly targeting gaza's underground tunnel Network where he is believed to be hiding from Israel's attacks which have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians let's find out more about this man Matthew levit has written several books about Hamas and Hezbollah he's director of the counterterrorism program at the Washington Institute for NE East policy welcome to DW Israel apparently has no problem targeting Ismael hania in a highly secured building in tan so why has it been unable to get Yahya sinoa in Gaza y senoir has been hiding in Tunnels for 10 months Israelis claimed that in at least three instances they nearly caught him and released a video of uh the room in which he was hiding in his tunnels the safe in which he was hiding money Etc but there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels in Gaza um they're interconnected like spiderwebs and it's very very difficult uh to penetrate them uh with the kind of eavesdropping material that might lead to his capture especially when he is likely being very very careful about the use of cell phones and the like so how has the heing of is Han affected Yahya sina's role in Hamas not very much at all yehia senoir is the overall Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip he has been and continues to be the only person whose opinion matters on things like a ceasefire and release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners Etc is Han is the overall Hamas uh leader until he was killed but that was really more technical than reality uh hania and sinir had a significant amount of tension between them hania was the overall head of Hamas located in the Gaza Strip as senoir was actually the head of Hamas in the Gaza Strip that led to tension and ultimately Hanah left Gaza and that's why we found him splitting his time between Qatar and turkey he was very close to to Iran which puts Iran in this position not only because uncomfortable position not only because Han was killed inan as he was there for the inauguration of the new president in an irgc safe house but because within two days Iran lost key interlocutors one from Hamas and one from Hezbollah who were key interlocutors with Iran and that and and of itself sent a significant message I found it striking that sinan was born in the KH Unice refugee camp we tend to think of refugee camps as temporary structures constructed during crisis and then dismantled when they're no longer Le needed but the canis Camp has been there for decades and it would be hard to design a more perfect breeding ground to encourage generations of people to Harbor resentment towards Israel it's true the refugee camps in the Gaza ship have been there for a very long time uh part of that is because Palestinian organizations have refused to relocate Palestinians into permanent housing before there was a final resolution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict there's this tension between creating a better situation for your own people on the ground and losing leverage uh of the idea of refugees uh in the overall effort between Israel and the Palestinians now the vast majority of people who live in these camps are not actually radicalized to violence which suggests that as bad as the situation is these are not the worst kind of places for radicalizing people very small numbers actually ended up radicalizing to Hamas in fact the poll that our Think Tank took in July before the October 7th attacks demonstrated that over 70% of gazin were fed up with Hamas wanted Hamas disarmed and did not support Hamas targeting Israel we've seen as you said a a number of Hezbollah and and Hamas um officials targeted and and dispatched in the the last uh couple of weeks is it as simple as saying that the war in Gaza would end if Israelis were able uh to catch SWA I don't think it's quite that simple um the people who would succeed him uh in particular his brother uh would still have to make the decision to release hostages and agree to um a a a ceasefire or a pause I do think that uh removing yoir from the equation would go a long way towards making that possible because he's very very widely seen as the hardest line person in this entire um calculation uh when you take out someone like a Hanah inan or if were to happen a sinir in Gaza that's going to make some within Hamas harder line at least in the moment but there's enough of uh um momentum there are enough reasons why Hamas itself will want a ceasefire so that that won't completely torpedo the negotiations and I don't think the assassination of hania will torpedo the negotiations thank you for that um very interesting Matthew levit from the Washington Institute for neares policy as Israel braces for possible retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah the families of the 115 remaining hostages in Gaza fear that the escalation will make a ceasefire deal even more elusive indirect negotiation between Hamas and Israel have so far been unsuccessful and the threat of a wider conflict in the region appears to only be growing by the day it is not easy for Dan algarad to walk here in Tel aviv's hostage Square for 10 months he has been campaigning for the release of his brother iik who was kidnapped by Hamas from kibuts near Oz on October 7 but now as a crisis unfolds with Iran and Hezbollah a ceasefire and hostage de seem more elusive than ever I think these people deserve to die we need to eliminate them the question is when and whether they're more important than the lives of the hostages that's the question after the targeted killings of Hamas leader is Han in Teran and f shukri a senior hisbah figure in Beirut Israel is now praised for retaliation and possible escalation 115 hostages are still believed to be held in Gaza some of whom are no longer alive people here in Tel Aviv are extremely worried about the fate of the hostages still being held in Gaza fearing an allout war with Iran and Hezbollah people here are more on edge than ever life goes on as usual here at least for now but the threat of an imminent escalation is is on everyone's mind it's very worrying things are unclear there is a lack of information we don't know what is going to happen we are terribly worried about our people over there there is no one who is leading us responsibly it's a difficult feeling it's not easy to be a citizen in Israel today for me it was already scary after 7th of October uh and uh I was really scared because I wasn't like sure what's going to be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow but uh eventually like um um I'm sure that everything is going to be okay no matter what and trying to stay calm yeah but it's a bit scary cuz you don't know what to expect Danny El garat is critical of netanyahu's strategy of Maximum military pressure and thinks he's motivated by his desire to stay in power we see the condition the state is in today the country's condition is much worse than on October 7th we're on the worch of a regional war in the face of growing uncertainty the hostages families are waiting anxiously for their loved ones to come home as the country prepares for whatever comes next Colin Clark is director of research at the sufan group that's a global consultancy focused on counterterrorism and International Security it's good to have you on the program Mr Clark do we know how has Yaya senoir managed to survive 10 months of war in Gaza yeah well this is something that senoir was uh long preparing for obviously and if you look at uh the the density and the complexity of what's really a Labyrinth of underground tunnels almost a city onto itself uh he's had a long time to prepare this is someone that knows the Israelis uh better than probably most uh Palestinian militants uh and he's also likely avoided the use of any technology anything that emits uh some kind of a signal uh as well as keeping very kind of uh you know close company and is likely also uh you know using couriers to transmit messages yeah Courier so no technology that would allow him to be traced if that's the case if he's hiding deep in a tunnel how then how is he able to effectively communicate with Hamas outside of Gaza and and hold basically the Reigns of power well he's got the street cred or credibility right to kind of be uh firmly entrenched and I think you know most people that are speculating on who succeeds is hania uh it may not make that much of a difference politically because uh sinir is really the kind of uh the muscle now uh and you know that's why we've seen in all the the kind of ceasefire negotiations and potential hostage deals uh the delay in a response right negotiations taking place across the gulf and there's been this kind of delayed response because it takes a while to get the messages to senoir then it takes a while to get the messages from senoir Back to the uh mediators in Qatar Egypt uh Israel the United States and elsewhere if symar is is not captured or is not killed will Israel ever be able to declare victory over Hamas well the Israelis could declare Victory today they've killed many of the leading militants of this group not only uh individuals like Muhammad Dave who they had long sought much in the same vein as uh senoir but they've killed some of the group's top political leaders uh you know alori in Lebanon back in January Maran Isa uh and now most recently uh SM hania and so uh if they wanted to they could stop and and declare Victory I don't think that's something that's likely though uh if they were able to get senoir Andor his brother that might be added incentive uh but only time will tell a few weeks ago the Wall Street Journal published leaked messages sinmir had sent to other Hamas leaders in which he basically said The more Palestinians die in Gaza the better for Hamas um has this been his policy all along yeah very likely he's willing to fight the Israelis uh until the last Palestinian civilian it shows you how diabolical uh you know of of an individual he is this is somebody that you know uh values martyrdom right exactly what they say and is not uh afraid to sacrifice Palestinians to achieve his goals of of maintaining power you know I will say in some ways people have made similar accusations about Netanyahu on the other side is that he's willing to continue sacrificing innocent lives to maintain his grip on power so you have two stubborn Leaders with their own agenda that may not necessarily be looking out for the best interests of their Collective people C terrorism expert Colin Clark Mr Clark we appreciate your time and your valuable insights tonight thank you
