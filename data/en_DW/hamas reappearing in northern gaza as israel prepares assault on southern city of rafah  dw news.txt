meantime in the United States President Joe Biden has criticized Israel for the way that it is conducting its military campaign in Gaza his remarks followed a warning from us officials over Israeli plans to move the ground defensive into the southern city of Rafa Israel's prime minister says that it is a stronghold for Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attacks another fam left grieving after five relatives were killed by Israeli air parents we were sleeping and we suddenly woke up to the sound of bombing rocks were above our heads and a fire had started at the end I was calling for my mother father and my siblings and they didn't answer me the southern city of Rafa is home to over a million displaced people who fled to the Border Town seeking safety people say they are living in fear of a promised isra Advance we don't know where to go they told us that Rafa is a safe area for displaced people and we were displaced to Rafa after being told to leave Han unes so the situation SC do we have to go home are destroyed houses we have no other choices we are just waiting to die we are waiting for the moment of our execution US National Security Council spokesperson John K said a military operation in Rafa would be a disaster and that the US would not support it President Joe Biden also gave his strongest warning yet I'm of the view as you know that the conduct of the response in Gaza in the Gaza Strip has been um over the top I talked to BB to open the gate on the Israeli side I've been pushing really hard really hard to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza there are a lot of innocent people who starving a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying and it's got to stop streets close to Ru as Q8 Hospital have been left in Ruins and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops to prepare for operations in the city the few safe areas left in Gaza are now also under threat and let's get some context now with Frank Lich he is a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former British Military Intelligence officer he joins us from Oxford uh Frank welcome to back to the program we've heard criticism coming from the US regarding reports that Israel plans to expand its offensive to Rafa an operation has not started do we have a sense of what might be being considered here is it likely to be a widescale assault or something different well good morning Sarah I think it's important to realize that the Israeli Army that went into Gaza 4 months ago is not the Israeli army or Defense Forces that we see today they've learned a very great deal so no longer do we see the frankly indiscriminate or apparently indiscriminate air strikes on a large scale instead what we see is a focus on ground operations and indeed there's good evidence now of subterranean operations so that's the first thing the second thing is look whether the Americans like it or not and there has by the way been quite a lot of the tail wagging the dog with respect to the us and this operation in RIT large but uh look the Israeli is going to do this anyway they have to uh proceed and clear as they see it the entire area they will be entering Rafa as uh their prime minister has said uh we can only hope that the targeting procedures and the Rules of Engagement that the Israelis are as we speak developing for Rafa will uh will reduce necessary civilian casualties this is going to happen whatever the Americans say meantime Israeli officials are saying that Hamas militants have begun reappearing in the northern Gaza Strip um what does this say about Israel's ability to achieve its War goal of wiping out the group also in central parts around conun for example where fighting continues yes very interestingly recently there reports that the uh that us intelligence officials take the view that uh the Israelis AR nowhere near achieving their objectives of eliminating Hamas and this uh this uh these actions in Gaza City are evidence of that they're quite interesting Sarah as to how they're happening what the Israelis think is that a lot of terrorists are terrorists that are engaging them there are in fact entering or re-entering the city through tunnels that they haven't yet found which brings back this key element which still comes back and back and back and the Israelis have not yet conquered it this of the tunnels so that's the first thing the second thing on a more strategic level is the Israelis must be thinking now look we are getting back to the old ways of what they call mowing the grass in other words we simply can't eliminate the problem it will continue to grow and we're going to have to deal with it as time goes on this war is nowhere near finished and they're going to have to be conducting these actions for many months yet I'd like to get you to respond also to these reports uh saying that the Israeli Army is trying to create a so-called buffer zone by destroying buildings in Gaza the UN Human human rights uh Chief says that that would potentially violate International laws of war how do you see such operations from a military perspective strategically speaking well what the Israelis obviously are trying to create there is a cordon sanitar around the the main core of the of the strip I think it's two kilometers they want uh which would be that from their perspective a security Zone would be I would expect mined and patrolled by Israelis so there is a mil military role then and the question is of course in international law uh is that an adequate reason for breaching the uh very clear rule against such things in international humanitarian law that's a tradeoff the israeli's judgment will be of course it is it's a we're justified by the military necessity that we consider is imposed upon us I think most people would say that they could impose such a Zone Cordon outside the borders of Gaza should they wish to do so but of course that would deny them uh land uh on their side so this is a political question there is a military requirement for it the question is on which side of the Border should it be uh imposed Frank ledv senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmith University many thanks thank you
