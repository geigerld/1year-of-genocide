well the organization of Islamic cooperation has condemned the assassination of Hamas leader Ismael hania in tyan and called it a serious infringement of Iran's sovereignty foreign Ministers of the Islamic block held an emergency meeting in jeda to discuss the killing and Iran's response in a joint statement the 57 members said they held Israel fully responsible for the attack on hania Iran has blamed Israel and vowed Revenge Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility author and Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld is joining me now for more on this thanks for joining us uh so we saw Saudi Arabia stepping up to defend Iran's sovereignty at this meeting that's despite the fact that the two countries are sometimes described as Arch Rivals is something shifting here yeah it's a fascinating uh event today um yes they are reconciled recently actually by at China helped broker that um reconciled but they are still Rivals so the question is what what is the significance for this 57 uh block statement joint statement I mean on the one hand you could say it's worrying that they're rubber stamping some kind of uh retaliation which would lead to further escalation on the other hand the positive view which I take is that by acknowledging what Israel has done uh you know Israel hasn't claimed responsibility for it but by acknowledging their hurt it takes away the sting and need for a Revenge often uh what a country needs is an acknowledgement that they have been harmed and what what the statement provided today was just that the us as well uh said that they hope the members of the OIC kind of what you're saying there will try to deescalate um you know take the pressure out of the situation and convince Iran not to retaliate or to retaliate in a way that doesn't escalate do you think that that's a likely scenario here I I'm growing more optimistic by the hour look Revenge as a weapon is a currency and it can be devalued um Iran is facing what you might call retaliation inflation because when they struck back at Israel in April clearly that didn't gain them the deterence that they were seeking so now they really are feeling like they have to do something to save face if nothing else and so with this kind of diplomatic flurry um whether it's through the Islamic Nations uh States um or you know Western European allies that are also all kind of in a frenzy and then also the military pressure I mean the United States sent um you know f-22s they're almost like high-tech messenger pigeons flying over to the Middle East with dropping a one-word note which is don't uh so we just talked about Saudi Arabia here of often described as a rival of Iran they actually helped Israel shoot down those missiles that Iran launched in the last round of retaliation Jordan is also part of uh this organization of Islamic States um was also part of the group that helped Israel shoot down these missiles so what you're saying is you're reading this statement here not necessarily as a shift away from Israel but as a kind of attempt to find a diplomatic solution to this there's tremendous tension and there's divisions within the group itself I mean there's this tension between ideology and practicality right Saudi Arabia is looking at Vision 2030 they're trying to diversify their economy in the middle of this there's this October 7th attack it kind of blows their whole plan out of the water I think the question here is blood thicker than liquidity right one of their brothers was assassinated in Iran but every country in the region including Iran is struggling economically so it's a fascinating struggle here and and you know time will tell which will prevail and um just shifting Focus the Palestinian militant group amas has named Yaya senoir as its political leader um how have or have the OIC member states reacted to this Choice well I think that they welcome senoir they respect one thing that they're very you know careful to do is to respect whatever Palestinian leadership is in place um that's the very least that they can do given that they haven't none of these countries those that have uh relations with Israel they haven't broken diplomatic ties so you know if they can't do anything in Deeds at least they can do something in words and and that's the criticism of that that it's just lip service to the Palestinian cause but what are they actually going to do how will they back that up with any kind of muscle Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld thanks for joining us many thanks
