here we go hello and welcome to news desk the conflict on the border between Israel and Lebanon has been on and off for decades but since the Hamas Terror attacks on Israel on October the 7th last year relations between lebanon's militant group Hezbollah and Israel appear to be at Breaking Point with fears that there could be a full scale War here's the head of the UN Antonio G's warning of just that I felt compelled today to voice my profound concerns about escalation between Israel and Hezbollah along the Blue Line escalation in continued exchanges of fire and escalation in Bello's rethoric from both sides as if an allout war was imminent the risk for the conflict in the Middle East to Biden is real and must be avoided when rash move when miscalculation could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border and frankly Beyond imagination so Antonio gares there really spelling out what is at risk there on the border between Israel and Lebanon with that Lebanese militant group Hezbollah um some countries like Canada for example have already told their citizens they need to get out of Lebanon so it's been taken yeah very very seriously um and we are discussing all this today on news desk we are wondering you know what could War be avoid avoided is there a way even towards peace in that region hello I'm Alex Forest Whiting and I'm Michelle Stockman and I will be paying special attention to the chat today to look at your comments to look at your questions and make you a part of the discussion and I thank the hundreds of you out there who have already commented on our community post I want to highlight One exchange that really stood out to me uh this is first between shut up 2751 I love that name um who said we can only hope that the prospect of so much destruction in the event of an Israel Lebanon war would act as a deterrent against war and responding to shut up is Tommy Moore who says never will never will happen so that leads me to you amyan you've been reporting in Israel and Lebanon over the past year so should people be worried are we entering into new territory here yeah that is a very good question actually I just had an idea can you share my screen right now because I have this really interesting map from uh the Washington Institute and on this map you can see basically all of the attacks crossroader attacks that have occurred uh just since October 7th when Hamas uh went on a rampage uh Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by many Western countries um killing at over 700 civilians and uh several hundred IDF members um which triggered um these crossb attacks hezb striking first Israeli Israeli troops retaliating but look at all this is just since um October 7th why has this not led to a war I mean in a lot of other countries if one missile lands inside your territory it escalates into an allout War um but it hasn't because there's these rules of engagement that have been going on basically uh since the last war between Hezbollah and Israel and uh it's something that both sides have basically tolerated people who live in that border area don't live in their they they often have to flee their homes because of these missiles Landing in their backyards or even on their houses sometimes but why we're talking about this now is because of the rhetoric basically um starting just last week things have ramped up very quickly to the point where Israel's foreign minister says they're on the verge of changing the rules of engagement here and are ready for a full-scale war um you had the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces saying that they had approved a plan to basically invade Southern Lebanon and attack Hezbollah and settle this once and for all doesn't mean that the government has approved the plan and that they're going to go in but basically they're saying we have a working plan and at the snap of a finger we could go in and you'd be finished Hezbollah and Hezbollah basically said the same thing back to them um that they would fight a rule without War uh War without rules um and we can hear some of that a bit later com that's why this seems to be getting out of control to where Antonio gas has to comment on this a lot of people weighing in saying it's inevitable other people saying wait wait wait war is never inevitable there's always a way to avoid this and um that's that's really the major con uh conversation happening in the Middle East right now but it has in the norm that you know it's normal that missiles are being traded back and forth but what's got people worried is this ramping up of the rhetoric which we're going to drill down into today um so please everybody send us your questions about that so that we can ask amian and the other people who will be joining us later um and Alex will introduce them in just a minute first I want to make sure that cherry uh gets everybody voting on our poll question today right um our poll question today is the escalation on the Lebanon isra rest in whose hands and there are four options Israel Hezbollah us and Iran or conflict is in effable so um don't forget to vote and we will talk about the result later great thank you very much Cherry and as well as Amy and we've got some other um good guests who will be joining us we will have Rebecca ritters who is a DW correspondent she's actually based in Jerusalem and is also spent time in Lebanon so we'll be hearing from her shortly and then a little bit later we will be speaking to somebody um who I'm very interested to hear from and that's mcran Raba uh from the American University of Beirut and he will be um looking helping us sort of look at this from a bit of a a bigger standpoint more of a geopolitical stand and perhaps the what role um for example Iran and the US are playing in this so do uh please stay with us for all of that but Amy and first of all to you we we've just heard you talking about um you know why we are discussing this particular topic today but I would really love to know how we got here in the first place what's really kicked all this off in the past few months well let me start at 200 BC oh boy that's the thing with a lot this is going to be a long news to everybody get sitting down get your water no go ahead keep it short Aman keep it short I said 200 BC I'm not going that far but no um as with a lot of conflicts in the Middle East this goes back to Colonial times there's a lot of places that we could start um but obviously for the sake of brevity we're going to I could start um talking about the escalation from October 7th because that's when we really saw a lot of these attacks happening that you saw on that map earlier so October 7th Hamas uh breaks across uh the Gaza border massacr Israeli civilians uh and Military takes 200 people hostage and right afterwards Israel starts bombing Gaza in a way that we haven't seen before for ever um Hezbollah is in Lebanon it's not it's the country that's North of Israel um has been involved in conflicts with Israel before it's a militia very powerful uh militia it's not actually a part of the uh um Lebanese military it actually has a lot of uh disagreements with Lebanon with the state of Lebanon and Lebanese military um but they are in solidarity with um Hamas and with the pal what they call the Palestinian cause so right after Israel started bombing Gaza Hezbollah in solidarity um launched its own attack um under the opes of distracting Israel's military so that they're fighting fighting a two-front war this was announced if you can show the map again I think this is important um the place where that first strike happened actually I can make this bigger um yeah here we go I'm gonna make that bigger for you the place where the first strike happened was here this region I'm going to zoom out again is actually an occupied uh well internationally recognized occupied Lebanese territory it's part of what the International Community recognizes as Syria um but Syria says that actually belongs to Lebanon it's called the Sheba Farms um so this was the place where they decided to get involved in the conflict this first attack here um by Hezbollah on an Israeli uh Defense Forces um I think it was a radar system something like that it was a military Outpost that triggered a retaliation retaliation from Israel and since then we've seen hundreds and hundreds of tit fortat retaliations between both sides uh the death toll is actually way off balance it's um a lot of Hezbollah Fighters have been killed um that number is over well over 300 Hezbollah Fighters as well as over 80 uh Lebanese civilians in this border area that you can see here and on the Israeli side you have 25 deaths altogether um 10 civilians and I think 15 um 15 uh where do I have it uh I'm going to correct myself later if I can find that but it's it's about half half civilians and Israeli military um so how where we got in the last week was that uh after these these kind of established Rules of Engagement um you saw an escalation where Hezbollah um they released this video Drone footage of hia which is in Israel uh basically bragging that we can fly a drone over this uh Israeli city and this uh very important International port and is Israeli military can't shoot us down we've got that I think I think we' got that footage that we can show um it's a propaganda video keep that in mind um we don't really know how they filmed it um but basically they released this video and the implication here is that we if we can fly a drone over it to film it we can also attack it um Israel was very concerned about this and uh they responded very aggressively Israel cat um he tweeted and if you can share my tweet um share my screen and I can show you this tweet he says basically that nasala boasts today about filming the ports of hypa hia operated by International companies from China India and threatens to attack them we are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon in an allout War Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely h hit the state of Israel will pay a price on the front and home fronts but with a strong and United Nation and the power of the IDF we will restore security to the residents of the north now like I said earlier this was followed by announcement that they had uh drawn up a plan to invade and then what you see most recently is that Netanyahu is saying that they're winding down um the fighting in Gaza and they're going to take some of that military power the IDF soldiers who were fighting in Gaza and move them to the northern border um to secure that area and bring back the tens of thousands of Israelis who are forced to flee their homes uh keep in mind um people in Lebanon would also like to go back to their homes almost between 80 and 100,000 people are estimated to have left their homes in that area near the border yeah I'm in we've got a question from uh do 97 here that relates to this so you're talking about you know both sides talking about um escalating the conflict the question here is what is to gain on both sides the case of the war the yeah there's a lot of lot to gain and a lot to lose and Israel cats pointed this out in his tweet it says that there would be a lot of losses on the home front and the military acknowledging that there would be a lot of Civilian deaths if they had an allout war with Hezbollah um what's to what's to gain on hezbollah's side um they are basically their whole ideology revolves around fighting with Israel I mean it was formed that we can talk a little bit later about what Hezbollah is because that's a huge question everybody wants to weigh in on what Hezbollah is because it's kind of a unique thing um it's this super powerful militia that is a force of its own in the Middle East it doesn't do what the Lebanese government wants it to do obviously doesn't do what Israel wants it to do it basically does what Iran wants it to do and uh Iran has every interest in keeping Israel distracted with a fight on its northern border so that it doesn't um again involved in Iran's uh Internal Affairs and so you could talk all day about what is the interest of Hezbollah but basically um Israel wants to secure its border and get rid of this shame of having 880,000 or I forget how many thousands of civilians have left the Border area um when I was in Israel last time we were in a hotel in Jerusalem and those families just living in hotels on government money the government is sponsoring these families to live in hotels um because they can't live in in Border towns and they can't carry on their lives there and the economy is dead these are ghost towns because of the Rockets being launched from I'd really like to um hear from hezbollah's reaction to what you were just saying um what the for Ministry and then Netanyahu were talking about um in terms of you know moving troops closer yeah after this R Ric was ramped up of course nasala Hassan nasala he's the head of Hezbollah he's kind of um a religious figure uh for Shia Muslims in Lebanon and um we can play what he had to say after this escalation they have to wait for us on the ground in the air and in the sea we have said this before and I will say this again today if the wars and post on Lebanon the resistance will fight without control without rules and without a ceiling so pretty clear there yeah and what we'll talk about later in the scenari of what is actually going on here um it's hard to tell what is deterrence and what is a threat yeah because a warning is not necessarily a threat um so when Israel says we've drawn up War plans that's most mostly meant to scare Hezbollah and when Hezbollah says uh we're g to we would fight a war without rules there's a little asterisk there and he says if Israel starts the war right so both sides are saying if the other side starts the war we're going to go all out and destroy your country etc etc but both sides so far have said we don't want an allout War well this is a good point now to bring in Rebecca ritters who is a DW correspondent she's based in Jerusalem um hi Rebecca thank you so much for being with us and I think you were listening to some of that conversation already um and Amy and did also mention what Netanyahu that's the uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said I think it was just on Sunday actually uh about moving his plans possibly to move more troops to uh that order with Lebanon let's just listen to what he had to say and then I'd love to get your reaction Rebecca after the intense phase is finished we will have the possibility to move part of the forces North and we will do this first and foremost for defensive purposes and secondly to bring our evacuated residents home if we can we will do this diplomatically if not we'll do it another way but we will bring all the residents home from both the North and the South I mean it's within a month the end of the phase of intense fighting very soon so Rebecca what's your take on what Netanyahu was saying there well there's a couple of things to consider there Alex and one is of course who he's speaking to there he's talking on this particular Israeli Channel that is considered pretty much a Netanyahu mouthpiece if you will it's very favorable to Benjamin Netanyahu and he's talking very much to his base now that was actually the first interview he has done in Hebrew to the Hebrew media and of course he's under increased pressure to trying to like as Aman was just saying to get these people these between 60 and 70,000 people that have been evacuated from along those border areas or from along that border area I should say um back to their houses and there's a lot of anger among what obviously those communities but but wider into Northern Israel and really across the country country about the fact that these people have been out of their houses for so long and it's still not safe for them to return so he's obviously speaking very much to his base there and he's trying to get that uh that you know opinion across in that first Hebrew media interview um yeah I mean I think that's probably the most important thing about that particular interview that he did but it's in keeping with what I mean was just discussing in this ramping up of rhetoric and that is certainly something uh that he's been saying but we of course know and we've heard time and time again that Benin Netanyahu is saying we are not going to leave Gaza until we finish Hamas so that is has been changing in the re in recent days we're now looking to this potential space of the Gaza war and just what that entails we don't exactly know yet but it's certainly a withdrawal of a lot so that Focus can be put more up onto that northern border and did have question have question Carina Vina uh speaking she's uh one of our um viewers who who loves to participate in news Des so I definitely want to get a question from karolina uh speaking of Netanyahu um he has there have been several um I would say sources or people accusing him of prolonging the conflict so that he can maintain hold on power meaning that conflict with Hamas so um the question is if he expands into another conflict with Hezbollah um is that does that mean that he's just trying to stay in power or will these conflicts end if Netanyahu steps down that's what karolina is asking so I'll put that to you Rebecca uh okay I mean you know obviously I don't have the crystal ball so to be able to give an a 100% answer is is really difficult to say but one thing is definitely true that okay yes definitely Vu Netanyahu it is the received wisdom so many people here saying that he is trying to cing on to power he doesn't want to face the music in a post Gaza War scenario and he is trying to keep these conflicts going that's perhaps slightly too strong but that he is um that he's in his political benefit to keep those going so that he doesn't have to face the commissions of inquiry uh into the failings that led to October 7 and his handling of the war and the hostage situation the agreements there but really I mean the war in Gaza and increasingly a potential war in the North is is is an opinion that much of the Israeli Society the the military and the political uh Elite are really on the same the same page more or less when it comes to these conflicts I mean it is still um popular although Israeli opinion is sort of Shifting to accept a deal with Hamas because people really want to see those hostages returned and they are pushing for that that that voice is certainly getting louder in Israel um but really the the support for the war remains strong um and from my reporting on the northern border and even polling that we've seen recently you know support for a conflict in the north uh is also there I think people see that as as really and it's inevitable that's how people feel and that is how they frame it to me when I've spoken to people in the north that they feel that those communities just won't be able to go home I've spoken to some people that were evacuated who said you know it's not that we necessarily want war but we will not move back even for a political solution if there's a political solution we still won't feel safe enough you know that's what we had before and we were seeing skirmishes on the border and we don't think that's going to go away now we need to finish this we need to push Hezbollah back before we'll return home so I think even if Netanyahu were not ow many of the decisions that are being made would would remain the same and you've spent a lot of time as well um Rebecca or some time in Lebanon um and that is a country in a very different situation it's had an economic crisis um you know really struggling struggling even with having a functioning government what's the feeling there among the Lebanese about the possibility of there being a full out war with Israel uh I haven't been to is for quite some time but the people Lebanon you mean you've been in Lebanon I'm living in Israel obviously here I haven't been to leban on for for a couple of years now but definitely when I speak to people from there I mean there's a there's a great deal of fear it's not something that the country could H it can really handle it is not in a position to be in an allout conflict with Israel it would certainly see a you know a huge civilian death toll and infrastructure damage that the it you know it may not be able to recover from certainly not uh in the years to come so people there's obviously a lot of concern it's not something that I would say the majority of Lebanese want to see happening they are hoping for a diplomatic solution they are hoping for a way out of this before you know standing here in the precipice on the brink of War they are hoping for a way out I would say that is the received wisdom that's certainly the majority view there now that does fall a little bit along searan lines I mean there's a lot more support for Hezbollah within the Shia Community um so that you know the the polling figures even show the discrepancy there but but by and large thei civilians people on the street they don't want to see a war with Israel I mean is that I know you haven't been there for a few months but when you were in Lebanon what was the what was the feeling on the ground there just when all this was beginning to kickoff in in Gaza well it was extremely tense I was in Beirut uh I was sent there by DW actually to help the bureau because there was a big speech by Hassan nasala the leader of Hezbollah it was the first time he was speaking publicly since the October 7th Terror attacks um by Hamas after um this this kind of tit fortat had escalated and people didn't really know how to interpret that was he going to give the speech and declare war on Israel or was he going to um deescalate uh so I I went there not really knowing if the war was going to break out or not and I was in Beirut which is a a it's a like a mosaic of religions and different um like uh political alliances and everything and Hezbollah has a foothold in the south of Beirut but really it's diverse City and a lot of people hate Hezbollah because they don't want a war with Israel the country like you said is economic in economic ruins they know that they would lose a war with Israel everybody knows that even Hezbollah knows that because their military just isn't big enough they don't have an economic means uh well I can just show you a video of kind of like what was happening at the time um and this was back in this was uh the very beginning of November so uh nasara had released a statement on October 7th um supporting Hamas but he hadn't actually uh talked yet and he hadn't really um Talks by Nala are this huge thing in Lebanon because he makes these big uh speeches that last like an hour and a half and sometimes he says something that scares everybody like there's going to be War sometimes he kind of de-escalates and um he has a lot of supporters in Beirut who um if you can play this video you can see this is something I posted to Instagram but basically you could see him on the TV and just finished speaking can't hear it so well but people are people are firing uh rifles into the air so this is a tradition in Lebanon when after he had stopped speaking then just when he started he started were in it so it was like uh our leader is speaking and they started firing rifles in the air a lot of his supporters had gathered but basically he spoke for an hour and a half and what he said was um we're in solidarity with Hamas but it's we had nothing to do with it they didn't know about the attack he said um we're not going to do anything more than we're doing because we're already fighting for Hamas he said that we're obeying the uh Rules of Engagement with Israel and we're not going to go beyond that and so basically he said a lot without saying anything um somebody even uh tweeted afterwards that the N speech could have been an email that went viral because it was a lot of nothing and people were relieved there was like literally uh some journalists um went out for drinks afterwards because they're like hey World War I didn't start so it was a big celebration because yeah it's it is so weird to see in uh Beirut how Hezbollah which is this powerful militia is hated by so many people because they feel like it's this wild card that could start a war with their powerful neighbor and get them all killed I mean it wouldn't be the first time Israel has bombed Beirut and killed a lot of civilians so they W don't want that to happen again and can I can I ask a clarifying question here this also came in from the chat uh a little earlier this is from Phil dq9 MC asking more about the relationship between Hezbollah and the government of Lebanon literally asking is Hezbollah Lebanon I think there's you know some basic confusion out there as to what the relationship actually is and how powerful they are compared to each other mhm um Hezbollah is the most powerful military institution in Lebanon but it's also a political party um it runs the airport for example so when I flew there it was Hezbollah police basically who took my passport and gave me the little stamp and everything um so they are an established institution uh they're way bigger in the Lebanese Army um they controlled basically the south of the country and they're supported by by two forces the uh Shia Muslims in Lebanon and by Iran so that's where they get most of their funding from Iran and um some a little bit from Shia Muslim Community within Lebanon and so there are this strange entity that is like super powerful and um can threaten war with a neighbor and um they basically what they say goes in southern Lebanon but they're only a a minority political party in Lebanon they had a majority for a while but they lost it and they're very unpopular among Christians among Sunni Muslims um among secular uh Lebanese and uh it's just very strange going to Beirut which is like a modern bustling Metropolis with Christians and atheist and nobody has to we you know it's like it's not what you it's not like a fundamentalist Muslim country um especially not in Beirut and then you have this uh militia that is like dedicated to holy war essentially I mean that's the rhetoric but it's also interesting to see how um the Lebanese even even they hate Hezbollah they recognize that it's one of the most powerful functioning institutions in the country and there's not that much you can do about it because Lebanese politics um has a lot of dysfunction in it and Hezbollah functions basically that's not a good thing but people recognize that and let's just bring Rebecca back into this Rebecca because you've also spent some time in Lebanon um we know that um Hezbollah um did actually have a parliamentary majority up until 2022 and then lost it um but are they still very much in control of the country from from where you're sitting I mean there certainly yeah I mean as Amy was just saying I mean there the fact that they are stronger than the Lebanese Army puts them also in gives them a lot of control and anecdotally in in terms of support they don't have majority support in the country overall as I mean was expressing there with the Shia and Sunni and Christian communities rather and obviously secular as well but you know the economy in Lebanon has been struggling so hard and Hezbollah have they provide a lot of services so there are members of the community I mean anecdotally I was there in the aftermath of uh the blast or or I'll say actually the time that I was there a year later after the blast actually more so there were people I was speaking to who couldn't find get medication blast being at that Port you're talking about yes sorry that of course yeah the blast at the port in uh what was it now 2020 I think it was um and so in in in in around 2022 the economy is you know really really struggling it's you know completely bombing people can't get medications and that you know you speak to people on the street who were like oh I'm looking for XY Z for my family member and they would go to D the the southern uh Shia neighborhood in Beirut that where has bu uh uh basically operate to go toes there to to get stuff because it was being brought in Via Iran uh you know for for the year for the support for his head brother of supporters basically for their base and other people also benefiting from that so in some ways people in Lebanon because the government itself is is so ineffectual for many it just it does often rely on some of the support that he has but it certainly doesn't mean that people there agree with the H buers policies and the way that they conduct themselves they're grossly unpopular when you speak to people on the street and you did just mention that Iran and also Amy and you mentioned hezbollah's links with Iran the the group has been very very clear about its links with Iran hasn't it yeah that's right the um I don't know if we have this do we have the yeah I think we have that I think we've got um a a clip from um nasala so that's again the head of um of the group of Hezbollah from 2016 which we can um which we can listen to now hopefully Wade can play that to us so that was uh we obviously had subtitles there um but what he was saying was that everything comes from Iran so very very clearly spelled out then yeah I think that that's a huge factor in this because um Hezbollah cannot win a war against Israel not any um military terms that I know of and I think Lebanese understand that but the reason why Hezbollah can continue to threaten Israel is because it feels like it Iran has its back and Iran and Hezbollah fighting a war with Israel is something that definitely scares Israel and then you have on top of that if Iran gets involved and the us would get involved and here's what I think a lot of people are very freaked out about this escalating conflict in the Middle East because obviously if Hezbollah does something that triggers Israel to invade then you're not talking about just a conflict on that border you're talking about Iran possibly getting involved us possibly getting involved and all of a sudden you have a World War on your hands I'm not saying it's going to happen but that's why we're talking about it that's why people are particular worried about it yeah you've talked about borders uh in terms of Israel wanting to protect its border and Lebanon also um and Hezbollah down near that border um we have a question here from Levante David who wants to know is this war about terrorist or is it more a war about religion not that it is a war but this conflict between them right now MH um very interesting and I think we can throw this also to our expert and maybe Rebecca can weigh in in this too because she spent a lot more time with Israelis on that side of the Border um I think that for I would say for Israel it is about um their territorial Integrity they want to protect their border um and that's what most people would tell you anyway um obviously there's very fundamental religious Israelis who um see it as a holy war just as fundamentalist Muslims um on the Lebanese side would see it as a holy war uh it's a lot harder for Hezbollah to say that it's territorial because um they um yeah because essentially they started this escalation with the attack after um the Hamas attack um saying that it was solidarity with the Palestinian cause which then begs the question so is this ideological if you're getting involved if you're attacking a country um out of solidarity for another movement then what are we talking about here um and yeah I think my take would be that Hezbollah itself is very ideological you can see that since the very beginning in 1982 when they were conceived uh they spoke in a language of Revolution and anti-colonialism they use that word colonialism all the time in their early uh Doctrine talking they you know sometimes you see pictures of CH Gara next to Hassan nasala because a lot of uh Shia Muslims in the area uh see this as Liberation from Colonial Powers don't forget that um Lebanon was under the control of French for a long time and is what is now Israel was a a British mandate um so a lot of this modern conflict happened after the colonial Powers left and Hezbollah sees this as a continuation of that but it also seems to be mixed too because um Hezbollah has called it a holy war has called for the destruction of Israel so there's territory involved in that so these messages really seem to be mixed many ways yeah yeah May yeah maybe Rebecca you would like to pitch in on that just listen I actually think that was no I was just actually listening to what Aman had to say and I thought yeah I would say that's pretty s especially the post Colonial thing I think is is a really important factor that we you know we can't put too much importance on because this is something that you know the at the founding as Abby was saying when they were founded this is something they were saying that they you know wanted to make sure that the French and the Americans were all out of there they this is uh it's a really big part of the puzzle um but I do think it is several things they're completing as you're as you're trying to make that point Michelle I think that's really that's important for everyone to remember thank you very much well maybe just at this moment we will have a little check with cherry to find out what what's going on in the chat and if there are any um particular repeating comments or themes that are coming out yeah there are um some of them actually now that you mentioned it um um first of all many people Express the wish that um there would be no more war that um they hope that um Peace will uh happen anytime uh soon um but there also questions about actually um the roles of international power in this um conflict between Israel and Hezbollah um for example there is a question from um karolina felini that Michelle also mentioned um does un have any solutions to end these conflicts um there are also comments mentioning um the role of the US and Iran and saying that this is a proxy war um so um yeah they want to know more about this aspect okay well we are waiting for um our guest who is mam Raba um assistant professor at the American University of Beirut but at the moment um we haven't managed to get hold of him but hopefully we will hear from him soon but just keeping that going as you are sitting around this table uh Amy and you're not allowed to escape maybe we could just bring in about a question about the UN and the role um because the un's role with uh Israel and Lebanon in the past has been strong hasn't it and it dates back um a couple of decades yeah uh let's go back to the map actually because I think that's really helpful to see um where the border is and how this has to do with uh the possible scenarios for conflict um this is the what's interesting is this is a map of the attack so the blue dots here are um Israeli attacks in Lebanon and the yellow dots are Hezbollah attacks in uh on Israeli Defense Forces and if you look at the line between the yellow and the blue what you're seeing here is the uh Blue Line uh this is the un's established um border between Lebanon and Israel uh what's interesting is that there you can't speak of this border as the same as the border of France and Germany for example because there um it isn't like a fixed point on the map things here can change what it is is the UN said after the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel um they drew this line and said here's where the conflict ceases and anybody who goes across this line is entering the other country's territory anybody who's on the other side of the line um it works both ways basically um and that line is called the the blue line that's right and it's actually demarcated by blue barrels that are up on sticks and uh what's interesting is that there's a fence got some pictures actually those if we can just show those pictures because they really are B on sticks aren't they but sorry keep keep keep I thought we were going to play the video oh we are playing it yeah this line represent the blue line and don't cross it because any crossing of the line mean violation of the line people often think that the technical fence is the blue line and they can walk right up to it but this is absolutely wrong the technical fence is not the blue line but the most important thing is never cross the blue line that's something to remember do not cross the Blue Line although it happens uh very often in terms of drones and missile strikes um but that's what is considered the um unofficial Rules of Engagement but what's interesting here is that the Blue Line exist both uh countries recognize it they launch attacks very often on the other side uh what you can see here is Israel goes way deeper into Lebanon than uh Hezbollah goes into Israel part of that is because of the sophistication their weapons lot of these can you show us again cuz I think we didn't see it on the screen yet show us again how far that yeah so this is Lebanon up here and you can see the blue dots these are Israeli attacks all the way up into Northern Lebanon there's several in Beirut these are assassinations I think this one was an assassination of a Hamas operative this is just since October 7th and you have this huge area of the South where Israel is striking with drones several journalists have been killed journalist family members have been killed a lot of these by drone very sophisticated um targeted drone attacks Hezbollah has launched pretty deep inside Israel but not as often a lot of their attacks are limited to the Border areas and I think that reflects why you see such a higher death toll on the Lebanese side but going back to the un's role here they established this border but they also said um when the war ended in 2006 um was the war between Hezbollah and Israel they tried to establish a demilitarized zone basically the Lebanese Army and the UN would Patrol this area here um that's near the border so this is very general do not uh print this out and send it to anybody in Lebanon but generally an area around here would be considered uh demilitarized and heah would not be allowed to enter this territory and uh launch attacks on Israel but that obviously has not happened Hezbollah um goes right up to the fence and sometimes Palestinian militant groups go as well there's hundreds of thousands of pales inian refugees living in Lebanon um who are already also party to this conflict they go right up to the border and sometimes shoot just like rifles across the border do we know what the rules of engagement are for the UN peacekeeping troops that are there I mean these are guys from 49 different countries there's 10,000 right do we know what they're supposed to be doing that's a that's a really good question what I I do know that they um patrol the area but it's very clear um just from what I've heard from people in the area and also when you're trying to travel to the area when I was in Lebanon in order to go down to the South first you have to get permission from Hezbollah you actually like call them up and say um hey we were going on this date uh can you have permission they give you like a little basically um a little letter so that you can go in the area so you don't ask the UN if you can go in the area you ask Hezbollah so that tells you what you need to know about who controls that area thank you very much um for that we are very pleased now that we have got mam Raba who is on uh the line down the line for us assistant professor at the American University of Beirut thank you very much for joining us uh we very much appreciate it um I would just like to just you know go back about what we're talking about um whether you know further conflict could be avoided between Israel and Le and Lebanon um and talk in a in a moment about what the scenarios uh could be there but for you personally living in Lebanon in Beirut does it feel different at the moment does it feel like uh possibly Lebanon is on the verge of a fullscale war or is this just business as usual well actually I was one year old when when the Israelis invaded in 82 and I witnessed to a number of Israeli operations into Lebanon all of them centered on Israel trying to get its security back unfortunately I think all of this military operations has put people like me in the state of limbo because every few years we are reminded that ultimately Lebanon lacks any sovereignty and that whatever happens in the region uh Regional players are using the weakness as well as the diversity of Lebanon to weaponize it against the people of the region be it the Israelis or even the syrians to a certain extent it's very hard to see part of your country being shelled where other parts are actually quote unquote safe however the entirety of the country or the idea of Lebanon is no longer there for a number of reasons first of all we are witnessing one of the most worst economic collapse in the history of modern Lebanon in addition to the fact that while many people look at hisbah as a local actor I for myself and my own personal experience with this Iranian sponsored militia is that basically it's the tip of the sphere for the Irani rary guard which have basically dismantled many of the countries in the leant including my own country leanon this is why gloomy uh atmosphere or this so-called Drums of War makes it hard to concentrate and to live a life of normaly unfortunately so do you think further conflict um between Israel is inevitable then well anyone who can tell you what will happen is basically lying to you we have been following up on this conflict from day one everyone is hoping that this conflict will simply Peter out and that ironically Iran and hisbah are betting on Israeli democracy as well as US democracy meaning that everyone is hoping that someone will topple Netanyahu and that basically somewh more rational or more doish will take over however I believe from following all the rhetoric from both sides the October 7 Fiasco and the fallouts of the Hamas attack on Israel has transformed Israel into a kind of I I use it here as a very descriptive as a Rabbid dog or a Mad Dog they are willing to do anything to bring back the idea that they can protect themselves and unfortunately what happened with Hamas is completely different what's happening in Lebanon meaning that the northern front Israel has been preparing for a potential war with hisbah and this is why the military establishment here has no problem going to war because it's not only about politics as some people might say say everyone is saying that Netanyahu wants to go to war to prolong his political career I think it's more deeper than that even if we don't have a fullscale confrontation what has transpired in the last eight months is enough to remind us that Lebanon is not even living next to the volcano we are the actual volcano which can stay dormant for centuries But ultimately can uh uh can kill us all and this is something that we need to certainly take a step back and think about makram you said that Lebanon is the volcano that uh conflict there um could be tripped off um there's a lot of people on both sides who are ready for that however there is a comment here I'm going to read to you from one of our Watchers here blip news who says the US Israel and Iran are all in a proxy war and he's saying these leaders do not want direct conflict and this is my biggest question why well for over a decade the Obama Administration has been trying to convince the International Community and has been able to do so at least with the Europeans trying to say that the most destructive element that Iran has this nuclear uh weapons and this is why the nuclear deal was brokered in the idea that once we contain nuclear Iran we can actually sit down and agree with them on other things I think the last couple of years have proven that the real threat in the region for for regional security as well as Global Security as you see what's happening in Yemen with theis is basically that every country Germany for example has a defense strategy the strategy of Iran is basically rather than allowing them to fight you in Iran you fight them through a combination of proxy militias hisbah here is not only a proxy militia I tend to call them the Strategic Consultants of Iran meaning that this outfit who is basically lethal not because they're Iranian and here I say it with all due modesty that because it's they're Lebanese because they take advantage of the ucational system and the diversity of the country and the fact decentralized nature of the sectarian system has allowed them to become very lethal and importent tool for Iran and this is why I think that Israel has realized that it cannot allow a entity like hisbah to be on its northern border as well as operate many of the militias so I think what the US Administration has been thinking that ultimately we can contain or we can fight limited proxy wars in the region has proven INE ineffective because Hamas at the end of the day actually jumped the gun on the the AA flood and implicated basically Iran in a war which it did not necessarily want to be this full scale so what so where I just want to be clear then where do you think this leaves Lebanon then what what scenarios could play out here well uh to be a bit pessimistic ultimately Lebanon has uh is not on the table it's actually being searched for lunch meaning that whatever happens whatever expires if it's a fullscale war and destruction will happen in different parts of Lebanon not only in the south of Lebanon unfortunately the International Community as well as the regional Gulf States will not invest in a nation which is under the full hemony and the control of hisbah in ' 06 when the 1701 United States United Nations security Council Revolution 1701 was brokered we had a kind of a government used to be branded as Pro Western and the International Community as well as the Gulf States doubled down on relief and reconstruction efforts at the moment Lebanon is much different since' 06 and unfortunately I think what will happen that ultimately it will be a kind of a rogue State because at the end of the day we are our relationship are severed with the gulf because of what was happening between hisbah and Iran on one side in the gulf and more recently the the statements of Hassan nah threatening Cyprus for example will only implicate Lebanon further and further and add to its isolation and more importantly I think that with what's happening in Ukraine and the entire Globe I think every country has different priorities I just want to pick up on one thing you mentioned there the 1701 um UN resolution and that's what came off the back of that war in 2006 isn't it between Israel and Lebanon just to just to clarify yes of course um and uh I mean what you're saying is um is it does sound pretty defeatist I'd just like to bring in our correspondent Rebecca ritters who um is joining us as well she is in Jerusalem I mean what what does this sound like uh to you Rebecca um of of what marran was just saying about the fact that you know for example Lebanon could will be serve for lunch could be eaten for lunch it's just not a big player in this it's it's it's just being used I mean you couldn't see me but when he said that I had little smirk on my face because I mean it's incredibly sad and a somebody who has spent quite a bit of time in Lebanon and really does love the country and think it has so much to offer that is certainly the received wisdom in the feeling that you have that that Lebanon just doesn't as a country doesn't have a leg to stand on M I'm I mean is that is that accurate do you think to say is there anything that Lebanon this state can do in order to get out of the goup of hezb while I might sound off as a bit defeatist or gloomy I actually believe that this is an opportunity because I think that we should acknowledge that we have been defeated in the sense that you cannot contain a militia likeah you cannot have uh winter and summer under the same roof so to speak we try to duplicate the idea of having Hong Kong which is an economic Prosperity next door having a Hanoi where you can keep on fighting and killing it doesn't work so I believe that going back to the basics meaning that while people are scared from ending this diverse system I think the way to come to to protect this diversity is to reestablish the idea of sovereignty and rather than the Lebanese themselves are to blame for allowing something like hisbah to mutate their political system we have a century old problem that this system hasn't been living up to the idea of State Building and unfortunately what we're see and my problem is with the many of these militias in the region if you destroy Hamas orah you don't know what monster would come out of this ultimately as a modern citizen of the 21st century I want the rule of law and one important thing I don't see it say this lightly the Arab Israeli conflict should be solved on just uh premises the idea of allowing Hamas to hijack the Palestinians for legitimate cause the problem with Hamas all of these they take legit imate demands but they hijack them for a different uh course unfortunately and I say this also with a bit of accuracy Netanyahu and NASA and all of these people they belong to the same school that might is right for me the pillars of a proper Lebanese a modern Lebanon for my family or for myself is a lean Lebanon built on Justice and unfortunately this is not nowhere to be found but it doesn't mean that we should stop fighting for that I have a question for m we still SE no no justice for the people who were affected by that blast that we were just talking about in 2020 still no justice seen there and the yeah but just just quickly to clarify for people who might not be aware by the power sharing agreement you're talking of course about the conf confessional system where every set plays a different Ro right maybe any a way but the problem is that this sectarian system which goes back to the 19th century was not modernized in the sense that allow proper participation and the problem is that these people people who are the feuder Lords who are in power basically they belong to the like you you're talking about people who resemble like the junkers back in the 18th century Prussia these people unfortunately don't take responsibility for many of their actions when you hear them talk you think that they are members of the opposition while in fact many of these people have been in power since the last three decades or even more I'd love to just he from amyan and I think am wants to put a question to you as well yeah just to um follow up on what maam said U basically mam you said that Hezbollah um when you're being pessimistic is just uh the spearhead of Iran's uh Regional power and uh you said that uh Lebanon is being served up uh on the plate basically um for the sake of this greater conflict but two things that I noticed when I was Lebanon the first is that has does have support there uh among um Shia Muslims but also this sense of like the the downtrodden they play into this ideology of we're protecting the people that don't have a voice they um they offer social services and things like this and so that's one thing what can can you tell me about the can you tell us about the support in leanon the second thing is um well sorry I'll let you answer that first that's a big enough question well technically I I tend to disagree with the idea of having support definitely they do have some sort of grassroot support but how can you actually gauge this is the is the electoral ballot boxes enough because at the end of the day you're not allowed to run against them and many of the regions are outside the rule of law and more more or so here and I have proof to accuse them of running a narco State between Lebanon and Syria and Assad regime these people are responsible for manufacturing amphetamines and smuggling them to the to the to the Gulf more so also the idea is that these people are somewhat responsible as a political party and as a militia for the October for the August 4 beut blast so and more so the gentleman in the background is my good friend lman sim a human rights activist who was killed in the south of Lebanon in a region controlled byah many of the people that has fallen victim to these political assassinations were all antib anti- Iran and they they fell victim so ultimately I would not treat hisbah as a political actor if hisbah was indeed a political actor we wouldn't be in this situation because the obsession of hisbah their DNA was formed out of rtion guard and this is why their ultimate aim is to continue operating whatever happens living to fight another day certainly they use a sectarian system as you mentioned the idea talking on behalf of the shites and they technically hide behind the shites if you notice what's happening the Israelis are praying very smart in the sense that most of these surgical hits are trying to avoid civilians but this doesn't mean that moving forward they will not do what they did in Gaza because simply at the end of the day they can get away with murder andah also tend to say that we don't care we are representing people who want to liberate Palestine but what we have proven in the last eight month that Iran is not really invested in Palestine but rather invested in its own shite sectarian brand of SE brand of shiism in the region this is why they always tend to use the Arabs of the region to protect their own interests back in Iran can I jump in here with a question from the chat uh for you makram um we've been talking about scenarios that could possibly happen between Israel and Hezbollah and a lot of the players involved a question from Sam o is beyond Iran and the US are there other countries or entities that could get involved on either side and influence what's going to happen next well uh I just like to point out that recently through many of its Mouse pieces hisbah and Iran has hinted to the fact that maybe Taliban wanted to join the fight so in a way the so-called axis of resistance or the Iranian axis has the ability to disrupt many of of the regional security I need to remind you that when your Amazon package is late it's because the OES are holding everyone hostage with the with the hermit traits so in the end of the day yes they have the ability to disrupt and to cause problems and ultimately we have seen how their many of their sabotage operations uh can can lead to many of the Western countries basically being mobilized to try to stop these cells or or the idea and more or less if we do get to the sectarian tension remember that Isis and alq and all of these people Justified their the fact that Iran controls many of the regions basically Iraq and we've seen how how this sectarian conflict was very destructive yes we have a number of problems if this continues and certainly I think I don't want to blame the US Administration on this but someone has to lead there there's there's actually a lack of responsibility from the Biden administration because ultimately they should double down on The Middle East because everyone knows that for since Biden was in the white house he simply uh pivoted towards uh towards the Orient and this has led to a kind of a power vacuum and Ukraine and Russia and everything that's happening around us is is anonymous sign that we need to go back to normany at whatever cost without shedding more blood and let me just pick up on that um with we're talking about um the US and somebody needs to leave we've had a lot of a flurry of diplomatic visits including to Lebanon including uh the German foreign minister who was there just yesterday U is that making a difference is diplomacy working or or are we beyond that from what you seem to be saying well I think many of these diplomats including the the German foreign minister simply don't want to uh to invest in the relief efforts if the actually War breaks out or reconstruction so they're trying to pre the conflict but I think it's too little too late because the real person that can do change and here I'm not putting all the eggs on one basket is the US Special Envoy uh Amos Hawkin Amos Hawkin now has an offer on the table for the Israelis but the Israelis don't actually trust that hisbah will uh honor their part of the deal which is basically withdraw their troops south of the Lan River and basically kind of do a rehash of the 1701 and this will include the peacekeepers who I was listening to you the peacekeepers are basically hostages forah and Israel in the sense that these people don't have a clear Rules of Engagement and many of the they just Monitor and report so what I think basically that uh this is only a Band-Aid solution for a much bigger hemorrhaging wound so we need to go back and first of all you have the refugee problem many of these issues you can't just throw money at one has to basically go back to the idea that we have a problem in Syria Iran equally andah are much involved in Syria itself and in Iraq so we need to go back and try to in a way detox the whole environment not only try to uh isolate Lebanon because the problem is not only Lebanon and in in Gaza but rather the whole mood which is engulfing the world at the moment but how do you do that how do you detox um that that whole area area I mean it's proved to be so complex so difficult for decades for centuries in the sense Lebanon for example rather than trying to to give you a kind of what we call a a beauty pageant response it's not about word peace but for example in the case of Lebanon by reconstructing the political system at the moment we have no president the presidency has been vacant even before October 7 so reconstructing this putting people back in elected office uh reforming and restructuring the economic system at least this is in the case of Lebanon enough to make you more appealing to the International Community this Al also applies to Syria at least within my own neighborhood if I open the window I want a president who can actually speak on our behalf it's not proper for the foreign minister of Germany to come and speak to the speaker of parliament it has to she has to go to the presidential Palace and meet an elected official as well as a cabinet that has the confidence and the vote of the speaker of par speaker the parliament this is how democracies work and I think that rather than blaming everything on the Arab Israeli conflict many of the nations are to blame for failing in building proper States many of the states are good we love them food is good coming here is good as many of the people pointed out but ultimately the elephant in the room is that people are not taking charge of their own future but rather betting that everything will be solved by the European Union or the us or even the Arab Gulf with its uh oil money this doesn't work this doesn't build you Nations it just gives you an opportunity to breathe until you are suffocated again we just heard uh here in the chat talking about the stakes that are involved in this conflict uh DeVos says we're all just a misunderstanding away from World War III so sad do you think we're really to that point makram no not really I think there's a number of uh there these are fighting words many of the people use them as a tactic and I I ultimately believe that Nala is trying to scare he's very good at Scare Tactics and psychological warfare because contrary to what I believe I think that he doesn't really have the technical skills but he has the ability to disrupt the situation so he's trying to use these words and many of his operations as a kind of deterrence but the problem we don't have the Mad model the mutual assured destruction model and we don't have the cold door we are basically trying to replicate the past rather than having people think outside the box so definitely there's a there's this the potential of War breaking out and the problem is that we are not running a this is not a science meaning that people mess up people might jump the gun if if if they end up taking the decision as they have been hinting that they might actually go after Nella and all of this this might change the whole ball game ultimately war is knocking at our door but at the same time we are in the midst of the war so it's a it's a mixed mixed War basically so um in in our um in answer to our question then that we've put um for this week's news desk can Israel and Lebanon avoid further conflict from what you seem to be saying the answer is no yes in a way giving the tools at our disposal and the way the people are operating I think that it's unevitable but doesn't mean that we cannot avoid it if we have a Hu if we end up changing the not the rules of the game but basically understanding what is at stake and in a way uh getting more international support and rather than just being proactive put something real on the table we can't just avoid the elephant in the room first of we have to acknowledge we have a much bigger problem and basically just like many of the countries have realized that either they they put their money where their mouth is or they just stop coming to Lebanon we don't want to internationalize this idea if people don't really invest on the long run the problem with the International Community is that they don't run a marathon they just run a Sprint and this has allowed Iran and its agents to actually take advantage of this so if you don't like whoever is in power in Germany you wait for the second election or the third election and something will change so people have to realize that you have to be in this for the long run I'm I'm curious um yeah go ahead actually I want to hear what Rebecca has to say Rebecca you go first is a c sorry I just wanted to ask you because you know I I I tend to agree that that we're sort of heading towards some kind of inevitable conflict and I'm just wondering what you think could be put on the table to avoid that because certainly uh uh the rhetoric here in Israel and certainly from the people have spoken to at the border and I don't know whether you heard me saying it before is there there's a you know I think this this resolution 1701 has never really been fully implemented certainly not from the Israeli perspective and many residents here as well as govern the government are frustrated with that and I spoke to so many people who said they wouldn't move back to those border towns unless there was an actual military conflict that a political solution wouldn't be strong enough because it's been ignored in the past so I'm just wondering what you see as a as a potential political solution way out well the key word here is political many of the solutions which have been used in the past are not political there are security or intelligence minded solutions for a political problem so rather than just trying to contain and give hisbah legitimacy Ironically in ' 06 hisbah did not win the military confrontation it was able to win mil kind of political confrontation and get the legitimacy from the fact that Leon in '06 had the economy to sustain the war or we had a kind of a kind of safety net from the International Community and the Arab Gulf ultimately I think going back to the idea that the Palestinians should get their own State we cannot allow for a kind of an open air prison like Gaza to allow for elements like Hamas to cause another October 7 and ultimately rather than allowing Netanyahu to be normalized as a normal politic we should also remember that we should not disregard the main idea that many of these people hide behind the Arab Israeli conflict so resolving the Arab Israeli conflict or putting back the peace process on the table would Empower voices of liberal thought people who are actually persecuted and attacked such as myself for suggesting that violence is not the way forward I wanted to actually ask you I'm just touching I'm sorry no I'm just with you saying including yourself I was thinking when when you were talking um in such strong terms about Hezbollah and Iran whether you are yourself uh under threat with with speaking out from Lebanon well a couple of months ago it was the fourth time they tried to arrest me and to accuse me of being an Israeli agent just for speaking out against hisbah as I told you my good friend was killed and many of my friends were killed by hisbah and I can tell you that I don't go around a lot because simply as a university Professor I cannot afford to have a security detail with me all the time and this is not only myself many people who remain silent do so because they're afraid of being branded as uh as Israeli agents or simply they don't want to be knifed like slan rushi was so yes the intellectual class in Lebanon even even those who are more moderate cannot speak out because Lebanon that was an oasis for freedom and liberal thought is ultimately now monitored by Hassan n and and hisbah who say that nothing is more important than the beat of the drum and this is why we all have to March towards war and I this is something I have refused and I refuse to double down on violence where we can actually hope or also dream of of potential peace the rhetoric coming from Nala is extremely bellicose as you just said the the beating of the war drum but um just looking at the numbers which is something that uh occurred to me when I was both in Lebanon and Israel over the past few months um on the uh Israeli side 10 civilians have been killed and 15 soldiers and all of these hundreds of attacks that we saw on the map um on the Lebanese side 349 Hezbollah operatives have been killed 64 operatives from uh Palestinian groups or other militant groups in Lebanon and 83 civilians by the latest count um when I was in uh Israel I think Hezbollah struck uh an F area a base there killed uh one uh reservist and then Israel retaliated with uh Precision drone attacks and killed multiple Hezbollah operatives as well as uh family members a grandmother and two children ended up in the hospital one of the children died um when I look at these numbers I think actually it's Hezbollah that seems the most afraid of a full out war that whenever a uh uh an attack like this happens they're okay to say uh we're back to the status qu we killed one Israeli soldier they killed three or four uh CI civilians in Lebanon plus uh several high ranking Hezbollah members but um we're even now is that is that false or um how are these numbers end up this way it's actually very accurate because simply uh the Israelis have learned since' 06 many of their surveillance and their technology ultimately the IDF is using Ai and Big Data uh they have been using facial recognition voice recognition isb's entry into the civil war in Syria and in Iraq transformed them from a gorilla operation outfit to a traditional Army this is what the Israelis wanted to begin with because it's easier for them to fight to fight hisbah to add to this hisbah have been suffering meaning that the people that you mentioned the 300 something half of them are the field commanders which keep the whole it's the glue that keeps the whole militia going so ultimately what is happening here that these people who are killed including people like kimman you can't just get them from the military academy these people have been killing for the last three four decades and they need operational experience which ISB cannot just Fe a new generation of Fighters This is why as you mentioned they every time they try to retaliate it's the idea that this could be also a face saving operation and the Israelis will just back away this won't happen because the debate within the IDF and the intelligence community in Israel is somewhere else these people are still operating pre October 7 whereas the the Israelis are talking about a new approach to the challenge of Lebanon that's really interesting I think that um that is exactly the rhetoric I heard in Israel maybe Rebecca can also um back that up basically what I heard in Israel is they there's a general failure to acknowledge that Israel was striking uh Lebanon and only I mean of course in the media it comes across but um a lot of the people that I talked to were every time an Israeli was killed it was like we need to go to war with uh Lebanon I mean this is generalization but that's kind of level of conversation I was hearing most certainly I mean when you speak to people I was just in Hyer recently just to see how people were feeling after that video that we showed a little bit of uh the Drone video that hisbah leased allegedly saying that they'd been flying a drone over showing areas that they um you know could and would attack should Israel go to war with them and you know that was very much what I was you hearing people saying this like we just we have to we have to be able to let those citizens go back to their houses we have to do something to end this Hezbollah threat and everyone I spoke to actually also had full confidence in Israeli military they said we you know I said even given what happened with October 7 you know there are some people who say well you know maybe the Israeli military isn't as strong as everyone had always perceived it was certainly a bit of a shock uh a huge shock a fundamental shock actually to to Israelis that that such an attack was able to happen and then you that everyone still feels completely protected by the Israeli military and they feel like they will be protected and that Israel would win any confrontation with h when you speak to the Israeli military I mean they're very um prag atic about the capabilities of Hezbollah and they are concerned and in a briefing that we had oh way back in the beginning of the war with Hamas about heesa when it looked like things could certainly spill over even then you know you had the Israeli military saying it is a different kettle of fish and of course we know we know that we hasb are a much different uh a much more advanced uh group than Hamas and they will be able to inflict a lot more civilian damage within the country and also but that that the military sorry I know that the military would then have to make decisions about what they could protect because they would have to be looking for big infrastructure uh targets that they would be needing to protect where they may not be able to protect you know certain civilian areas so that they you know they were very serious about that threat uh and taking it very seriously but I think most Israelis feel as though that that Israel would come out on top and it's the exact opposite in Beirut right I mean among at least non Esa supporters uh there's the feeling that they would lose the war it would destroy the country that's already on its last legs I was talking to one guy who was joking he was telling me Oh I'm learning how to swim I thought I thought he was serious but I could tell he was joking I was like what do you mean he's like well when the war starts I'm swimming out on into the sea and never coming back and I mean it's it's funny but it's also serious I think a lot of people are acknowledged that the Israeli military could do severe damage to add there was this joke that I think one minister in the Israeli cabinet was saying that if hisbah hits any of our uh Power factories we will make sure that Lebanon will lose its electricity and the joke was we don't have electricity to begin with are going so there's nothing actually to lose but the idea of Lebanon because ultimately if we continue on allowing hisbah to operate out of Lebanon and to uh basically threaten global global affairs it Lebanon will be branded as hisbah land rather than Lebanon so we don't want this and unfortunately I think part of it is from the fault of the political establishment which have used hisbah to hide from the fact that these people are corrupt and they have been using leonese resources to stay in power and ultimately when we went to the streets on the SE 17th of October 2019 to try to toble topple the regime it was hisbah that basically stopped us because ultimately there's a kind of Ian deal between corruption and Iranian weapons and this is something that we need to address I always say there's a herd of elephants in the room corruption sectarianism but there's one elephant which is armed so it's basically how to the priorities of dismantling this bomb without blowing up in our faces and on that point thank you very much mam Raba for joining us and for staying with us for much longer than I said you were so we really appreciate all of that your insights and and um also just the situation that you yourself are finding yourself in so thank you very much for joining us uh we do appreciate it um and just before I let you go Rebecca i' just love to get a very final thought on what you have just been just heard there from Marram did some of that um was that surprising to hear somebody speaking uh so openly about the situation that Lebanon itself is finding itself in um yes and no I mean no from my personal experience because when you're in Lebanon and you talk to people they are very open and they will speak rather openly with you but yes to speak publicly like this it's interesting I actually uh saw an interview that maam did the other day and I was discussing it you know last night or the night before with some people talking about this issue and they said I was explaining what maam had been saying in this interview and they said whoa you know like God is he is he worried about his personal safety and I very careful cavalierly said um and so that's actually the question I was going to ask Alex to to M so thank you for asking that question about his personal safety because I was sort of cavalier and said oh there are plenty of people that criticize Hezbollah and I really didn't think about it in the fact that yes but not so publicly and so I think um it's it's not surprising but perhaps it is surprising to be hearing it so openly and so so in this sort of public forum thank you so much but I'm not surprised by the content what he had to say sadly sadly accurate yeah um thank thank you Rebecca again for all your insights we appreciate you being with us again for a long time much longer than I said so thank you very much really appreciate it um we probably need to get the poll result don't we right yeah I closed it uh quite some time ago but oh did you yeah our discussion has been going so well so I guess I understand um so uh our poll results we have 646 votes and most people which is 38% think Israel um I mean again let me repeat the question um the escalation on the Lebanon Israel border rest in whose hands 36% of the FKS go to Israel um 23% say conflict is inevitable 23% says is Hezbollah and 14% says is us and Iran and actually someone put a comment saying that we should separate us and Iran um that's something that we didn't go into so deep into the discussion but I appreciate the comment and yeah will try to improve our choice in our po question we need more choices you mean more than four I me one last takeaway from this very um rounded discussion from you yeah um maam used the word at the end of what he was saying saving faith and that was a word that I was looking for the whole time but I'm glad he said it because I think on both sides um a political solution probably could be achieved if they found a way to save facei that's really for a lot of people that's what it's about um obviously Israel wants to secure its border um I do think like after what we've talked about in this discussion it does seem pretty apparent uh that Hezbollah also wants a way out of a larger conflict or would might be able to take that chance and I just think that um people who are calling for peace uh are hoping that that prevails that somebody finds some way to save face and I I I was interested in the the idea that Hezbollah has always said that they're going to continue this until the conflict in Gaza winds down and ironically the moment that Netanyahu announces that they're going to focus on the northern border he also announces that they're winding down the conflict in Gaza so I'm just wondering if that might be a way out that's obviously a discussion for a whole new news desk so bookmark that one come back to us next week but that was just my final thought thank you Ian really appreciate it thank you to
