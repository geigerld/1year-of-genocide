Israel says it is investigating how its defenses failed to prevent a drone strike in central Tel Aviv hthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack which killed one person and injured at least 10 others they say the strike was in retaliation for Israel's war in Gaza the explosion came around 3:00 a.m. local time blowing out windows and damaging cars a drone strike right in the heart of Tel Aviv raining down shrapnel and shards of glass just meters from the US Embassy even for a nation at War this was a startling strike the iranian-made Drone appears to have come from the Mediterranean Sea no air raid alarms were triggered and it avoided the Iron Dome defense system the Israeli Army said it was investigating and it would take all actions necessary to protect the country the Israeli Air Force is currently examining the incident including the reason of why no alerts were sounded this is not a steal UAV this is an an Iranian UAV it was detected by our systems we are examining the circumstances of why it wasn't intercepted Yemen's houthi Rebel forces claimed responsibility declaring Tel Aviv as a quote primary target the Drone force of the Yi houthi Armed Forces with Allah's help carried out a military operation that targeted one of the important Targets in the occupied Jaffa area known as Tel Aviv by the Israelis the United Nations condemned the strike and called for calm the Secretary General remains deeply concerned about the risk such dangerous acts pose for further escalation in the region he urges all to exercise maximum restraint and to deescalate to avoid further inflaming the situation in the region the Israeli Army believes the Drone was launched from Yemen raising the question of how it traveled more than 2,000 kmers without being intercepted this was not the first time the yemeni rebels have targeted Israel with drones but it is the first lethal strike by the houthis on Israeli soil well I'm joined Now by security analyst Marina [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] she is with King's College London Mar it's good to see you Israel's Army it believes that this drone was launched from Yemen how did that drone reach Israel undetected good evening Brent well the investigation is still ongoing in terms of what happened and how the Drone managed to evade air defenses but if we look at the footage for instance the Drone was coming from the Mediterranean so looking at the map it wasn't expected to come from that direction um that's number one the other possibility of course combined with that is the fact that these drones are manufactured in such a way as to evade air defenses and it seems to be a new iteration of the Samad three drone that hoodies have been used so there is a possibility that um the air defense were not enough and Israel has been struggling with um drones specifically because its air defenses are designed for missiles so what do we know about the the Drone that was used in this strike well so far as there are conflicting reports we know that um some reports refer to this drone as a yaka drone which is an upgraded version of a Samad three drone now Samad 3 drone was developed in 2008 and it is um designed by Iran however hoodies have been able to use um domestic and foreign components in order to manufacture these drones so apparently that's a drone that is claim to have a range of um 1 and a half thousand kilometers that has been used the HTI say that they will keep targeting Israel were they lucky that the Drone was able to reach Tel Aviv this time or could this pose a serious new threat to Israel's air defenses well in terms of air defenses um obviously Israel is now dealing also with Hezbollah in the north so it would create a problem for Israel um when it comes to intercepting these drones and um a hoodie spokesman said that that is just the beginning of the escalation however if we look at the geography I don't think that it would be um very efficient for htis to try and attack Israeli territory they are much more successful attacking the ships in the Red Sea and putting a lot of pressure so it remains to be seen what happens but I I think that Israel will have to also rely on the allied help in order to intercept drones if hood is as they claim designed to use these U mod modified samat 3 against Israel we've seen drones being used extensively in the war between Russia and Ukraine are militant groups like The htis are they employing tactics learned from that conflict well I would say it's actually the other way around because um drones offer such groups an asymmetric Advantage because they they are much cheaper to manufacture and as far as hoties are concerned in this specific example they have started using drones as early as late 2015 or so and they have been developing their own drones and using them against um Sai Arabia against Saudi forces as well as um Targets on Saudi territory so I think um if anything they might have inspired um the use of drones and of course we have seen the use of barar tb2 in nagoro kabak so this is an evolution and what we're seeing here with the hoodies is that they are trying to perect their craft and upgrade their drones by using foreign components and domestic components for instance to increase the payload or evade a defenses or increase the endurance of their drones before we run out of time Marina we know the houthis are backed by Iran is it likely that Iran played a direct role in this strike well Iran has been supporting hoodies but it doesn't mean that Iran coordinates every single strike that um the Affiliated groups conduct so it's difficult to say but I I I might be but um they still have their own goal so each of these groups um in the access have their own political Ambitions but they share the common enemy so there is a likelihood that Iran could have been involved but um perhaps it's just a hoodie thing security analyst Marina Maron Marin as always thank you
