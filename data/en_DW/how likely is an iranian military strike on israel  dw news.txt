the commander of Iran's powerful revolutionary guard has said there will be retaliation for an air strike he blames on Israel that has destroyed Iran's Consulate in Syria killing 12 people in tan thousands turned out to attend a funeral for seven members of the Guard including two senior generals who were killed in the blast Marchers chanted death to America and death to Israel clashes between Israel and Iran backed Hezbollah along the Israeli Lebanese border have increased since the war in again nearly 6 months ago and that is just part of the story let's get some more analysis now with Ali fat NAD he is the director of the center for Middle East and Global Order here in Berlin thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us so Israel has not commented on this strike but Iran clearly thinks Israel is behind it we've seen a supreme leader ayat hame vowing to punish Israel How likely do you think an Iranian military response is well it is quite obvious that um this Israeli strike has put the Iranian side into a dilemma uh first of all it's not the first heavy blow that uh Israel has uh imposed upon Iran through targeted assassinations against high ranking uh revolutionary guards figures but also other collaborators uh of Iran for instance we've had aruri in beut we had mavi um you know the musavi killing also the highest ranking in Syria uh you know highest ranking in revolu guard uh commander in Syria that was also targeted um around the turn of the year so this is uh you know the continuation of a series of such attacks and this puts the Iranian side into a dilemma because first of all it is really showing Iranian vulnerability here uh and um on the other hand Iran cannot really strong uh you know uh at the same level because it would then be very careful not to provoke Israel into an allout War which would pit Iran against Israel and or the United States and this such a great War would pose a danger to regime stability so it's a dilemma for the Iranian side so Iran not able to strike at the same level as you say but do you think we may see Iran carry out any kind of attacks and response and if so what would the most likely targets be I mean so far we've seen that also in the context of the Gaza War Iran has been uh you know using its proxies in the region to confront Israel it has refrained from confronting Israel directly um so this proxy Network you know the so-called exess of resistance could be activated uh for such a retaliation be it uh you know via the houthis you know against you know striking Israel from Yemen or via Hezbollah in Lebanon or via uh Iraqi militias uh be it in Iraq or in Syria or else there's also another option to Target uh Israeli uh you know interests uh in the region but also Beyond and perhaps also including Jewish institutions so there is a whole uh you know uh whole uh range of possibilities here for Iran to respond but the main problem here is that there's now uh you know this crisis of uh legit the crisis of of Iran within the context of the Gaza war is even fortified because Iran there has been some frustration within the supporter base of the regime inside the country but also regionally among the axis of resistance about Irani reluctance to attacks by Israel in the context of the Gaza war against also Iran so there is a you know there is a high level of frustration uh about Iran in credibility um of being really the you know the the main supporter of the Palestinian cause and about Iranian reluctance to confront Israel directly so uh this is something that the Iranian side has to deal with well thank you so much for sharing your insights that is Ali fat NAD director of the center for Middle East and Global Order we very much appreciate your time thank
