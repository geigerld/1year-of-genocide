these are live images from Southern Israel looking towards the Gaza Strip a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is due to come into effect right now these seven weeks of fighting have been the deadliest in the history of the Israel Palestinian conflict more than 1200 Israelis were killed in the October 7th terrorist attacks by Hamas and the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says Israel's response has killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians I'm Hannah huml welcome to the show that Qatari broker ceasefire is due to last for 4 days but could be extended the pause in fighting will allow the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails if all goes to plan that is expected to take place later today we'll go live to Jerusalem in a minute but first let's take a look at this report after weeks of waiting the families of hostages hope their loved ones will come home soon I want to hope I hope hope hope that it's going to happen we've been on such a roller coaster for the past certainly the past uh week but since October 7th between Despair and Trauma and hope I just want to see the children come back the Hamas terror group has agreed to release 50 civilian Women and Children of which 13 ought to be released in the first bch on Friday in exchange Israel is set to release 150 Palestinian prisoners mostly females and teenage males over the course of the truths the deal mediated by Qatar also includes a 4-day pause in fighting in both the North and South of the Gaza Strip as well as increased humanitarian Aid even though the agreement is considered a breakthrough both sides have remained cautious about saying too much before it materializes based on current circumstances with the start of this truce our main hope is that this humanitarian truce will give us all the opportunity to look into the bigger task which is to implement a permanent truce and Achieve longlasting peace efforts are being made to extend the truth beyond the 4-day period but Israel insists it will resume its military operation in Gaza until it has eradicated Hamas International humanitarian Aid trucks in Egypt await approval to head towards the Rafa Crossing with Gaza in addition to Essentials like food and water tankers will also be taking in fuel Egypt said 130,000 lers of diesel and four trucks of gas would be delivered daily to Gaza including 200 trucks of Aid that would boost the aid deliveries that the UN and other Aid agencies say are needed in the territory Hiba T is the country director for the NGO care in the pal Palestinian territories she told us what the NGO plans to do during this 4-day ceasefire uh we are coordinating with our peer humanitarian organizations and what we are going to do and focus on is related to human to health uh interventions where we are going to distribute hygiene kits focus on uh providing a medical services for the refugees and shelters and uh especially in the South uh continue distribu medical supplies for for the hospitals and of course continue with the with what we call Hygiene kits distribution that are very very much needed uh this that has been said it's not it's not only that that is needed people are waiting today in the morning we all were waiting for the the pause but unfortunately when it did not happen I can't tell you what was the impact on people on my colleagues for instance calling us sending us messages that they they really really wish for for at least one night of proper sleeping that was Hiba TB country director for the NGO care in rala well let's cross over now to our correspondent Tanya Kramer who's following the story for us in Jerusalem Tanya this is a huge moment that so many people have been waiting for how are people in Israel feeling now that the ceasefire appears to be imminent and that some of the Israeli hostages kept captive in Gaza could soon be finally returning home well that's right I mean Israeli media are talking about a very emotional day of course we've seen also overnight intensive Israeli shelling on Gaza with more casualties there but also air rid Sirens up to the last moment uh up to 7 a.m. here local time that was expected that you know the fighting intensifies before this PA and fighting comes into place and in Israel people are now of course watching very uh closely whether this uh ceasefire this temporary ceasefire uh will hold but of course all eyes are now on the afternoon this is when the first uh hostages are expected to be released we were told that should happen around 4 p.m. local time the families uh of those first 13 hostages uh are were notified last night uh we were told that there's a lot of you know caution as well because this is such a fragile truth and such an unprecedented situation as well I mean Israelis have seen prisoner swaps and hostage releases before but not on the scale and not involving children these are the first uh hostages that are expected uh to be uh released this afternoon and of course they're expecting as well that this continues in the in the coming days up to 50 hostages should be released but there are also mixed feelings because there are also many other host es that will remain in Gaza and it's still unclear uh how this will play out uh if uh and when the fighting uh will uh resume so many people cautiously hopeful there what more can you tell us about Israel's agreement to release Palestinian prisoners in return for these hostages well as we heard um in the report before I mean there is uh Israel released a list of 300 uh um Palestinians that are held in Israeli prisons uh we understand that some of the names have been approved we don't know exactly how many of them will be released today but according to the agreement between uh that was brokered by Qatar uh 150 uh Palestinian prisoners should be released in this uh first stage so we understand they will be gathered from uh different uh prisons uh later today uh at least the numbers we don't know how many will be released today but they will be then brought to uh uh checkpoints and then released into the occupied West Bank where then families uh uh will uh be able to receive them there they're preparing uh for this as well and of course we also have to talk about Gaza we understand that uh you know part of this uh agreement there's also that more humanitarian Aid will go into Gaza that people will get some respite uh but of course the big question is um many of those 1.7 million people that have been displaced in the past 7 weeks they won't be able to just go home uh they are in the South and it's uh unclear whether they can you know go to the north uh it's uh and and many have no home to go to obviously yeah so many unknowns there and the ceasefire is planed to last 4 days but Israel's military says it's already planning what it says are the next stages of this war what could these next stages inent well Israel has made it very clear that uh this is just a break and fighting a pause in fighting and they said the war will resume um there is uh the possibility of extending uh this PA and fighting uh for every 10 as they said in this agreement for every 10 hostages that will be released there might be an extension by one day up to 10 days uh we heard the uh Israeli defense minister you have gallan saying that he expects another two months at least of War because they want you know to eliminate as they say dismantle all the cap capabilities uh of Hamas and they haven't yet reached that goal uh so this war will continue one way or another uh so this is just basically uh a break and a pause in the fighting I just like to add that those are live pictures coming us H coming to us from Gaza now um as you can see there Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem thank you so much for all of your updates well for more I have our Middle East analyst shaie rosanes with me here in the studio uh shaie Israel was very much unified in the fight against Hamas but is it just as unified when it comes now to implementing this ceasefire well it's not really there is we've seen when the cabinet was um discussing that there were voices in the right that are against this there's a they're saying that it's immoral to leave some of the hostages out while others are are going to be released and there's also the big fear in Israel that this will be actually they losing momentum and re you know starting again that fight uh is not going to be really possible and this is de facto the end of the war where there's still a lot of as we see Hamas is strong Hamas is uh functioning Hamas is negotiating with Israel it's not really anywhere near where Israel wants it to be let's talk about the families of the host hostages because they are an important part of this whole Arrangement they've been putting a lot of pressure on the Israeli government are the families of the hostages uh are they satisfied that the Israeli government's priorities are in the right place here well in a way it's a relief because there was a lot of fear in the last almost 50 days that they're not being taken seriously enough that Israel is too occupied with the military um offensive um but this is not a Happy Day in Israel first of all there'll only be 13 and even in the end of the these um days if we're talking about 50 maybe more if uh the ceasefire is extended into 70 or 80 that still lives Hamas with over 150 people in custody I mean and and in hostages uh and these people U many of them are wounded um they're also tearing apart families we will see mothers and their children but there are whole families that were taking hostage the fathers that the men are left behind Hamas sees part part of the uh hardships and the discussion about the deal was Hamas sees a soldier as any man who ever served in the isra in the Israel military doesn't matter he is now 60 and he's been discharged already 40 years ago um and therefore the bringing these people out is going to be very hard and this is actually the biggest Milestone ahead for Israel and for the Israeli leadership because um these hostages um it's actually there' have been a sort of Av liability on Hamas the children and the the mothers um talking about the men the soldiers that's going to be harder there is a lot of international pressure on on Israel to come up with some sort of ceasefire a humanitarian pause in the fighting uh we're now here at what is supposed to be humanitarian pause it's very early hours we don't know how this is going to unfold uh it's a very delicate uh ceasefire how much of a role did that International pressure play in Israel's decision to ultimately go ahead with this major because Israel feels that it doesn't have too many leverages it doesn't have too many cards to play you know it's the attack happened on October 7th around 240 people were were taken hostage um and then Israel was was left with you know Kamas is setting the the conditions on the ground I mean Israel feels like it doesn't really have much against Hamas because it still wants to maintain this and and secure the livelihood of those 240 people um they felt this is why they felt that pressuring uh Hamas through the offensive on the ground and Through The Siege will be the only way to create some leverage to create some cards that they can use uh in order to to get get some gains uh in this terrible tragic uh situation uh it's still probably not going to be enough the world would like to see more humanitarian Aid coming we have to remember it's more than humanitarian these are basic needs and we're talking about about two million people because the whole Northern Gaza uh most of it is empty there were over 1 million people who who had to flee Northern Gaza into the South um and there's also a big question about what's happening now in the north because they're estimated around 880,000 Palestinians still there U they are not allowed to get any access to this humanitarian Aid coming in um and they're not allowed to cross this is the biggest challenge now for Israel Hamas has been calling people to cross from the south up to the North during the ceasefire Israel is trying to fight that and to stop the population from reima Back to the north what can you tell us about the negotiations in Qatar that led up to this because I'm hearing that there were weeks of negotiations going on in the background they must have been very intense of course they're secretive but what happened there how did we get here well we know that this deal in its General scheme was actually offered already last week uh it took some time for the Israeli uh leadership to be willing to say yes to that they felt like they need more time uh for the military operation to run its course there was always the Hope also in Israel that maybe they'll be finding enough leads you know the soldiers on the ground going into the tunnels going into Gaza will find enough leads to bring it home some hostages without the need for a deal with Hamas that failed and eventually the Israelis have decided that they need to save as many as they can as long as they can um the Qatar has been running running forth the Americans have put a lot of pressure um we've seen yesterday a bit of a stall um and Kar there felt like it's putting its own reputation on the line and it was pushing very strong pamas to not back off um and it's still a very gentle very delicate situation everybody is you know watching the other side very carefully um everything can still many can still go wrong and I wouldn't count on this to only last 4 days it's probably in Israel is saying that Israel is calculating Hamas will try to stall we try to say wait we need more time and so on but as you say this is a delicate ceasefire we're just in the first hour of it really we have to wait for it to really fully take effect and see if there's anyone who's going to spoil it uh because there there have been a lot of warnings about that as well we seem to be in a rare moment with with both Hamas and Israel it seemed to feel that they can benefit from some time off Israel before uh initiating its operation on the southern part of the strip and and Hamas of course for the need to uh recover recoup and and so on and also again there's some sort of an estimation that having those families those young kids elderly women in custody hostages in Gaza was actually a liability for Hamas okay we'll have to leave it there uh shaie thank you very much that was our Middle East analyst shaie Rosales you are watching DW news of course we're covering the uh the beginning of what is supposed to be a 4-day ceasefire in Israel International uh in Gaza International humanitarian Aid trucks in Egypt are now waiting for the green light to head through the Rafa Crossing into Gaza in addition to Essentials like food and water tankers will also be bringing fuel these live images from the Rafa border crossing show those Aid trucks lined up there at the border Israel uh Egypt rather says that 130,000 L of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily into Gaza including 200 trucks of Aid that would boost the aid deliveries that the UN and other Aid agencies say are needed in the territory journalist ham baloa was in Gaza until recently he joins us now from Jordan's capital am man uh tell us what will the ceasefire mean for the people of Gaza it means a lot it means for people to uh check their places to uh um to be released from the pressure from ongoing bombardment that lasted for um 48 days um many people um huge number of displaced people not only from the north to the South even from Southern areas uh from eastern border or even for those who are remaining in Gaza City and the north to check their places and uh for medical staff to remove some of the bodies still remain under the rubble um in in Gaza City or other places in in in in in Gaza STP um as long as for the aid to come in um to get some some help people can can um um try to find some some other places to move they were under pressure of moving in in the previous days now those Aid trucks again we're looking at pictures of the Rafa border crossing they're lined up waiting to bring that Aid in uh hundreds of trucks H understand are supposed to be able to enter during the truce what do people in Gaza need most right now ham people need first food uh water and uh of course fuel for uh running the the facilities um um um um the food was was very limited and there was a huge shortage of food not only for Aid that delivered or distributed to the to the shelters uh all kind of food are um um um are food is missing in in Gala St I I talk to to people there from my family or friends or ordinary people I'm trying to reach um they tell me that most of the supermarkets um um are empty shelves are not I mean like not nothing on them um um many like drinking water is is hard to get so these are the main thing they need uh from the aid or the deliveries that would expect to come to Gaza now Israel says it will halt the movement of military vehicles on the main Gaza Highway that North to South Highway uh they're going to Halt those military vehicles so people can travel South can can use that road to to walk to the South presumably do you think gazin who haven't already left the north for the South will do so now um it depends actually um I saw um many footages from the morning still some people are trying to to head north from the South not a huge number yet but um some people of course will will were waiting for for this POS to be able to move from North to the South it's not um um easy mission for many people for old people to walk that long there is no Transportation available in in in in the city um um many people were told like they have no places to go and the situation in the south is not that safe or uh proper for them to move so that made them to stay in Gaza despite of the danger that they exposed to um I'm sure many people would would would move um from North north to south but still some people will try to go from South to the north as you're speaking ham we're looking at some live pictures I'm I'm told that they are from the Kan Unice Hospital inside Gaza um so ham the release of detainees from Israeli jails is also part of this deal uh how important is that for the Palestinians it's very I mean the prisoners um issue and the Deton is very essential issue for the Palestinians whether in Gaza Strip or the West Bank the majority of the prisoners um are from West Bank cities um and today we are expecting um according to the reports 39 uh uh uh detes will be released uh to the West Bank cities uh always the factions and ordinary people talk about this essential issue um um to to be solved and they are willing to see the their beloved people released and freed from the prisons are there hopes ham among the Palestinians that this uh temporary ceasefire will become permanent this is the main hope uh everybody I talk to um all the comments um on on social media that I have read um they are they are hoping that this will hold first and it's not limited to 4 days which is not enough for them after um um devastating and and hard time that experience for 48 days um that they need um to to this war to stop and they are looking for a complete ceasefire and to be able to return their house or to bury their the the Beloved people um buddies who were still under the rle um many people are talking about this and they are willing for this and they think this 4 day um Bose is not enough uh for that ham thank you very much for talking with us again that was
