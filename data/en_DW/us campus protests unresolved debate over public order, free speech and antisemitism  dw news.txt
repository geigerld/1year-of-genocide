the October 7th Hamas terror attack it triggered Israel's declaration of war against Hamas and since then more than a million Palestinians in Gaza have been forced from their homes tens of thousands have reportedly died the UN says many more are facing famine it is this humanitarian crisis in Gaza not the Hamas attack on Israel that has spawned student protests on campuses here in Europe and in the United States there were dramatic scenes at Columbia University in New York where students occupied and barric ated themselves at Hamilton Hall demanding that the university divest itself from all Israeli businesses and last week protest erupted again in Los Angeles at UCLA police were called in to restore order polls show some public support for the students but majorities in the US do not approve of what these protests have morphed into May 8th 2024 an early morning operation at George Washington University Police deploy pepper spray to a pro Palestinian demonstrators from the area today little remains of the protest Camp the George Washington University has now scrubed the signs of the former encampment there's now a fence surrounding the former main protest side it remains uncertain how the protest will develop Beyond this week as the school year has basically ended in April students here built a camp to protest the war in Gaza one of more than four dozen at us universities nationally almost 2,800 people have been arrested on charges including trespassing and assaulting police officers the campus protest have triggered a national debate on how to protect Free Speech without enabling anti-Semitism or the harassment of Jewish students AR Patinkin is a Jewish student at George Washington University he spoke to us from his home really upset about what whenever I would walk by people would stare at us and harass us I was com back from uh from coming back from Shabbat I was taking one of my friends home which happened to be going through the encampment and we were spat at and uh harassed but student protest organizers say that the discussion around the safety of Jewish students distract from what they see as the main issue the war in Gaza we talked with Mahmud beun before the encampment was cleared the conversation anti-Semitism is a uh is a ploy to move us away from the current conversation we have Jewish students here we have non-jewish students here we have Muslim Students here we have non-muslim students here so the conversation uh crosses any religious line any cultural line it's a debate that remains unresolved GW students here say they experienced the demonstration as mostly calm but have heard of uncomfortable exceptions but I really don't see any danger from it I honestly think it's one of the most peaceful ones I've seen so far in terms of violence I have not personally witnessed any I personally have not felt not safe but I know that a lot of my friends have voiced that to me that they don't feel really comfortable walking around the specific area before the encampment was cleared police had said the protests were largely peaceful but what they called a gradual escalation and volatility moved them to disperse the camp Dana fisha studies activist and protest movements she says keeping people on message and maintaining tring discipline is more difficult the bigger a movement gets that's one of the challenges when you bring when you call for people to join you in solidarity or join you in the streets or join you at an encampment you get what you get and then you work with it and in terms of there being more extreme views or people with extreme views in the streets or in the encampments in this case it's very common you basically call for people to come out in solidarity and whoever comes comes the question moving forward is who will stay the next weeks will determine whether the movement sustains itself as campuses released students for the summer my next guest has made a name for himself on both sides of the Atlantic for his writings on the crisis of modern democracy he is the author of several books including the great experiment why diverse democracies fall apart and how they can endure in his latest book the identity trap a story of ideas and Power in our time he's also a professor at John Tomkins Unity University's school of advanced International Studies I'm happy to welcome back to the program tonight political sciences Yasha monk Yasha it's good to see you again students turned activists made possible by the Ivory Tower is that what is happening Yasha and if so I mean how is it happening um well I mean you know students have always been politically active as nothing completely new about that um it's also understandable that particularly students who uh maybe Arab in origin or maybe Muslim feel a particular kind of kinship uh to uh those who are suffering in Gaza at the moment I think what's been striking for about these protests is um both the rhetoric and the extent of support among uh parts of the academic left among people most of whom do not have personal stakes in the conflict in the Middle East and who have Justified uh their rhetoric in terms that are rather different um casting it as a form of intersectional struggle in which long that que for Palestine really imply that there's a natural connection between discrimination that sexual minorities might experience in the United States and what's going on in the Middle East uh today um sometimes rhetoric which basically tries to assimilate Israel into a sort of white colonizing state that is you know suppressing people of color um and there we're really seeing the application of a set of basic uh ideological categories that at the core of a new set of ideas about identity that has become very influential on the American left and the international left over the last years to this very complicated conflict in the Middle East in ways that I think are overly simplistic and and ultimately conceal more than they reveal about the events there do do you think that University students are being educated we hear from some members of society that they're being indoctrinated to to see the world in a very binary way um groups being either the oppressed or the oppressors and it we get that example with the Israelis versus the Palestinians um yes I think there is a strong strain of this ideology which is present uh in universities but often is uh reinforced by uh administrators at amican universities by a growing uh bureaucracy that has come to play a much larger role in the life of students as well and so there is at least a segment of both academics and students that looked at the events of October 7th even before the Israeli response and said uh you know this is very simple this is a question of whites versus people of color of colonizers versus the colonized um and you know in the since all forms of uh racism are structural since they have nothing to do with the contents of people actuals beliefs um it means that uh uh the oppressed uh are justified in any form of resistance including violent resistance including resistance that involves the deliberate targeting and murder of uh civilians y you wrote an article that appeared in The Spectator magazine earlier this month entitled how universities raised a generation of activists and you write that um universities should publicly commit themselves to upholding both free speech and public order but it's probably too late for principle to save them from their current troubles for now they're condemned to look like Hypocrites whatever they do because due to the failures of the past few years they are what have been their big mistakes of the past so look in order to uphold Free Speech you need to uphold two core principles the first is that people need to be free to say what they want and wish even if that is controversial even if that involves some of the statements of pro Palestinian protesters like calling for Global in that I personally find to be deeply upsetting at the same time uh Free Speech has always entailed restrictions on the place time and manner of expressing those views you're not entitled to occupy buildings in the University because you happen to dislike the policies of the University you're not entitled to shout down speakers or stop other academic events from going on because you disagree with them politically that isn't part of free speech that is giving you the right to restrict the free speech of others now unfortunately American universities have failed on both of those things for the last 10 or 20 years they've started to censor all kinds of political speech when it was offensive to various minority groups um and they have tolerated things like tent encampments during Occupy Wall Street or at Harvard for example that the University president's office was occupied for weeks on end over um a an issue involving labor at the University and so I understand Jewish students who since October 7th said why is it that every microaggression is met by a biased response team and sometimes by very severe sanctions against students but we have to tolerate uh people fight you know calling for Global intera um I also understand prop Palestinian demonstrators who said you know you have the norm you introduced uh for many decades but you never call the police but now in this conflict you're calling the police universities have failed to live up to both of those sets of free speech principles and so now uh they can't fall back on them without looking like Hypocrites yeah exactly it's like parents who have never been disciplinarians suddenly trying to ground their children when their when their children are are teenagers I guess and I want to pick up one thing before we run out of time and that is some University professors saying that what we're seeing in 2024 is The Logical Legacy of what we saw in the 1960s student um protest um do you do you really see that I mean I know you point out that in 1968 after the riots we saw in the country that Sumer Richard Nixon went on to defeat Hubert Humphrey by promising Law and Order and I I just want to ask you are you hinting that Joe Biden may be the 2024 version of Hubert Humphrey I I think that risk certainly exists um this conflict has split the Democratic base much more than the Republican base um and of course um it makes it easier for Donald Trump to make the argument that the country is somehow out of control and that it takes somebody like him to restore order um and so I do worry that Justice the protests in 1968 do appear according to strong research and political science by people like Omar waso and others to have helped Richard ni win the election that November uh the same fate May before the United States When Donald Trump is again up on the ballot in a few months yeah well if if that happens um we definitely will invite you to come back and and and talk about the repercussions of the election in November Yasha monk we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us tonight thank you
