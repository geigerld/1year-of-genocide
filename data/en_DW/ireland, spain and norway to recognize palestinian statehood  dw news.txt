we begin with some breaking news uh three European countries have said they will recognize Palestinian statehood Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez made the expected announcement earlier in his country's Parliament Norwegian prime minister yonis gura said the official recognition of Palestine by Norway and others will take effect on May 28th Ireland's prime minister Simon Harris called it a historic day in response is is says it's now recalling its ambassadors in Norway and Ireland will'll have a listen to what the Irish leader said today Ireland Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the state of Palestine each of us will now undertake whatever National steps are necessary to give effect to that decision in the leadup to today's announcement I've spoken with a number of other leaders ERS and counterparts and I'm confident that further countries will join us in taking this important step in the coming weeks this is an historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine well for more on this we're joined from Brussels by our correspondent Jack perck Jack three EU countries recognizing Palestinian statehood what does this mean well at the moment this is broadly symbolic and political gesture by these three countries but it is extremely significant what we heard from the when he made the announcement he said that the recognition of a it's a it's a recognition of the Palestinian people to their right to self-determination the Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris we just heard from he said that permanent peace can only be secured on the basis of a free will of a free people essentially what they're trying to do is show that their countries are committed to the two-state solution where there is a Palestinian state where the St Palestinian people have self-determination it's a big move though and as we've heard the Israelis have already recalled their ambassadors from Oslo and from Dublin as well um and so this is quite a major step forward we were expecting some other EU countries could potentially have made it but we now know that that it was Ireland Spain and Norway which is not an EU country that have made this announce today well what about the other EU countries there are 27 in all could we see other countries coming on board with that soon yeah it was expected perhaps that Belgium would also agree to do this and to recognize Palestinian statehood now there's questions about different procedures and legislative motions that need to happen in each individual country the EU has quite a complex and difficult situation when it comes to the the recognition of Palestine or a Palestinian State the EU has for a long time campaigned for a two-state solution where there is a Palestinian state with self-determination for the Palestinian people but as a whole the EU doesn't recognize a state of Palestine and that's very difficult for them to do the only country that has done what has been done today in the European Union as an EU member country was Sweden back in 2014 countries like Malta Cyprus Bulgaria Hungary Hungary and Poland they had Rec recognized the state of Palestine before they entered the EU so this is a big step forward though and I think the the signal of how big of a step forward it is is this quite strong reaction from the Israelis the Israeli foreign Ministry saying that this move could fuel extremism and instability in the region what is it Jack that uh prevents countries from recognizing Palestinian statehood how complex is that it is quite complex but mainly for countries that are staunch supporters of Israel countries like Germany for instance uh they would be nervous about the reaction that we are seeing to this especially in the current climate after the October the 7th terrorist attack and the subsequent um Israeli bombardment in Gaza the question is what exactly needs to shift diplomatically and in a foreign foreign policy Sphere for the European Union to get on the same uh page on this it's quite significant well as I said they're trying to still uphold the idea of a two-state solution we know that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that that's not possible so the EU wants that to continue to be its policy but how feasible is that but countries like we've seen today like Ireland and Spain making this move shows that that is their staunch belief uh and that they will continue to press for that two-state solution Jack thank you very very much our correspondent Jack perck there in Brussels
