the United States has authorized a multi-billion dollar weapons package for Israel according to several media reports it comes as President Joe Biden publicly acknowledged the pain being felt by Arab Americans over the war in Gaza he has also faced criticism by some in his own Democratic party the decision follows a visit by Israeli defense minister yav Galant to Washington this week the new arms package is meant to include 1,800 of the most destructive bombs used in Gaza the house deined to comment com and we look forward to a great discussion let's talk about this with journalist and Middle East expert Daniel gak Daniel the US says it's concerned about Israel's conduct in Gaza why then said it Â£2,000 bombs which are highly destructive especially in densely populated areas like Gaza yeah that is a contradiction that is being discussed in the American Media a lot um apparently the Biden Administration doesn't see a contradiction here because it says it provides these weapons not to prime minister netan with whom they have a difficult relationship at the moment and who is like of course calling the shots in the Gaza operation but that they're providing this for Israel's security I think for the Biden Administration they're in a way in a lose lose situation because it's a support for the Israeli um military on the one hand and then its um its opposition to the behavior of the Netanyahu government on the other uh leads it into to a difficult situation to a quack mire netan has has has successfully lobbied congress not only the Republican party but also the Democrats for many years and uh he's now cashing in on on on on what he had been successfully doing over the last decades and on the other hand of course Joe Biden has opposition inside its own party many Young Americans not only Arab Americans uh young people in this country see that uh there is a contradiction in these policies and if you drive around here in uh in America you would probably see at the freeway a billboard which says your taxpayers money kill uh kills children in Gaza so uh this is a difficult situation and uh Biden seems not to be handling it very well and Joe Biden is also facing criticism for his failure to stop uh Israel's campaign in Gaza what leverage does he have with Benjamin Netanyahu when you say that their their relations are difficult right now he he would probably argue that um America so far succeeded in delaying the Rafa operation because whereas Netanyahu has announced it's going to happen soon and we will do it uh and America said please don't do it please don't do it the way you have done it in Gaza if you need to operate militarily in Rafa apply a different tactic a different strategy protect the civilians and provide also a tangible strategy uh for the day after uh Biden would say netan has not implemented this so far he has made many announcements and of course the the war is going on but he hasn't done the ground operation in Rafa to the extent that they have operated in Gaza and Khan yunes and other places in the Gaza Strip so he would say that this is our Merit and of course if you look at the behavior of the United States at the recent uh United Nations security Council resolution where they abstained uh in face of an unanimous vote in in in favor of a ceasefire then you can say okay the Americans are applying some pressure on Netanyahu but Netanyahu is called of course calculating that he might not be ousted before President Biden is Ed because he definitely invests in a republican victory in the next presidential election and Donald Trump would be his favorite candidate Daniel thank you very much for your analysis Daniel gak there uh joining us from San Francisco I believe is that right yeah thank you thank you man ni to see you again sir J feein is with the Middle East Institute of Washington DC and is a former US ambassador to Yemen I asked him how badly he thinks Israel needs these weapons well the uh the issue of course is that some of the weapons uh that are included are the Munitions that are included in the package uh according to the Press reports are these 2,000lb bombs uh that the uh that the Israelis have been using in their Gaza campaign uh that that allegedly are the source of some of the mass casualty events uh that we've seen uh over the course of the past uh several months and so uh the the Israelis are clearly using them uh and there are a lot of people who are unhappy about about the use and will'll be unhappy that the administration is sending more well if this is confirmed uh this weapons package comes despite the US expressing concern over Israel's conduct in Gaza as you are citing now and supporting a ceasefire how is the White House handling this Balancing Act well your your question is exactly right it is a balancing act that the administration is trying to uh to achieve uh where on the one hand they are uh pressing the Israelis more aggressively uh to uh bring down the the level of violence and to and to find ways to to achieve a ceasefire and yet at the same time they don't want to be in a position where they are uh are not providing Israel with the defense mechanisms or or or defense equipment that it says it needs so uh they are pursuing a course that's probably making both sides unhappy it's a sensitive political landscape in the United States right now I don't need to tell you that how would this affect Joe Biden's popularity during this presidential campaign season well it's uh he's already suffering uh of course because of the unhappiness with the uh with the US green light Israeli military operations in Gaza uh and uh I think that it's going to increase uh the unhappiness and the pressure on him uh when uh when people see that even though the US has supported calls for an immediate ceasefire we're continuing to provide Israel with more and more Weaponry that they need or want to pursue their military operations particularly uh in Rafa again Gerald firin with the Middle East Institute speaking to me
