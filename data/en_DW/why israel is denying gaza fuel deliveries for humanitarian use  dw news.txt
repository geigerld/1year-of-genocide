earlier I spoke with hen Balou he's a freelance journalist in Gaza I asked him to tell us more about the situation in Gaza in the wake of intense air strikes reported overnight situation as you said like there were intense air strikes across the G St with in the north that the the place where the Israeli Army asked the people to evacuate or to the area in the South where people were asked to uh to evacuate too um dozens of or hundreds of of casualties were reported by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of interior um still uh it's not clear what's going on it's hard to to uh uh to count that the number of air strikes or or uh the bombing um we can hear it from time to time in my area I'm I'm in M rug Camp Central gva St and I can hear the the the tank shells the the air strikes and the Silence of the ambulances that evacuating casualties uh there was a report that when Baker was H overnight in maazi Refuge camp in central area and according to the information office that it's the only bakery that have the magazi uh refugee camp there the UN agency working with refugees in Gaza says that it might halt Gaza Aid operations due to a lack of fuel how much Aid have you seen coming through into Gaza we are talking about few number of trucks uh we are talking like um 54 then I think yesterday there were uh a few trucks more came in but that is very below the need um and all of these AIDS are not um including um um fuel which is uh the basic need for many services for water supplies for uh for vehicles uh to work for ambulances for civil defense um as well as for water deimination um you know Gala water is contaminated and it need to be uh uh uh deiminated um in in in different stations as long as there is no fuel there will be no uh drinking water for for the ordinary people um um the Ona is providing some bakeries with wheat with M wheat so that Bakery sell the backs with the cheaper price for for the people but other other AIDS I mean personally I haven't seen it um maybe there was some distribution in schools like it's as a filters people are evacuating too but um and some some some some medical supplies were distributed partially to some Hospital in the South officials in Gaza and Medics are saying that the hospitals and um in in the North or Gaza City and including the main hospital of the G sha Hospital are not receiving any of these AIDS as Israelis are preventing uh delivery to these these areas well we can now talk to Israeli milary spokesperson Peter LNA he joins us from Tel Aviv welcome to the program now the UN US Canada and EU the eu's foreign policy Chief they've all called for for a pause to the fighting to allow humanitarian Aid into Gaza uh is the Israeli military planning such a pause or perhaps a ceasefire Terry good morning it's day 19 of our war against Hamas Hamas that initiated a war opened a war massacred over 1,400 Israelis abducted 222 people we are we have decided to destroy Hamas and make sure they can never wield the sword of Terror against us again the situation in the Gaza Strip as as such as we are we are doing going out of our way to um to try and differentiate between the civilian population and uh the terrorists unfortunately it is Hamas that is intentionally putting the people at risk indeed that we are are uh working with International humanitarian organizations operating in the ground in order to assess and understand the needs uh there are and there was of course stockpiles of food and medical supplies before this war started 19 days ago and we are facilitating and indeed we've seen over the last few days several trucks come in from through Rafa Mr sorry War need change the Paradigm sorry I I I just wanted to to ask you you I see your points there but I was wondering about a ceasefire or a pause uh are is the Israeli military planning a pause in the fighting or ceasefire the IDF is continuing its strikes against Hamas that is our mission that is our goal at this time I'm not aware of any plans to conduct a ceasefire or any need for or any need for that at this time indeed we're listening to the international actors and and we are listening very carefully but nevertheless the time has come where Hamas has to go all right now let's talk about fuel uh fuel is not being allowed into Gaza it's desperately needed for hospitals and sanitation as you know uh your government says that Hamas is hoarding fuel but even if that's the case what speaks against the UN supplying fuel to hospitals and desalination plants ask Hamas that is precisely the problem Hamas is controlling the dimmer of the humanitarian crisis or the image of the humanitarian crisis that is developing Hamas has the fuel fuel it's holding it has the ability the the request for fuel needs to go not to Israel but to Hamas they are the governing authority of the Gaza Strip they are set claiming the responsibility for the people of Gaza they should instead of hoarding the fuel for their Terror tunnel so that they can have ventilation or for their rockets for propellant fuel or whatever they're doing with it they should give it to the hospitals they should give it to the people for the water pumps that is the right thing to do they should do it the world needs to Rally around this chain of regime so that Hamas can never hold israeli's hostage 222 Israel being hostaged this morning or the people the 2002 million people of Gaza hostage I do want to ask you about those hostages in just a moment but um regarding the fuel um you know that the un uh organization that's operating in Gaza providing relief to refugees it says it's going to have to stop its operations uh if it doesn't get fuel coming in uh today what do you think is going to happen in Gaza if the UN is no longer operating well it's not important what I think it's important what they do and they need to demand from Hamas to instead of holding the fuel they need to give it to the people that are in dire need and we're not we're not um saying that there's not a dire need of course when you um when we've asked um a million people to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip to the South to get them out of Harm's Way then there is going to be an increased need in the South and so Hamas need to make sure that the people their needs is the responsibility of Hamas they are the governing authority of the Gaza Strip they decided as a governing authority to go to war with Israel you can't expect Israel to give Hamas fuel that is it's quite a simple conundrum unfortunately uh the international humanitarian organizations demanding this assistant come from Israel are missing the point Hamas need to be held responsible for their actions they need to make sure that they are giving the supplies to the hospitals hospitals have only fuel for one for one more day but every day they keep giving them fuel so it shows that Hamas are actually Distributing well Ju Just to be clear I think what they're asking for is for the aid uh the fuel to come in from from Egypt at that at that Crossing there and not asking for Israel to provide the fuel itself but to Simply allow it in for the humanitarian work but I wanted to move on to to something else the question of safe areas in the South you you you referred to those uh those areas is are also being bombed we plenty of eyewitnesses um confirm that what are you doing to assure that innocent civilians are are not being killed uh in those safe areas soal so I just received a report that in the humanitarian Zone that we designated that a rocket had actually been fired out of that so that poses the exact challenge we are facing do we not protect ourselves because Hamas is launching Rockets behind civilians do we not protect our civilians this is the Dilemma what we are doing is trying to minimize the impact we are targeting Hamas for sure we will continue to pursue this terrorist organization that brutally massacred maimed uh abducted over 1,400 people 1,400 men women and children when they dismembered when they came in and penetrated our border they signed their own destiny they cannot be permitted to ever hold the power of government in Gaza again to launch such a against Israel that is the situation unfortunately it is the civilians of Gaza that have been let down miserably by this terrorist organization it is their responsibility to try and alleviate those issues on the humanitarian but also on security sorry we're just about out of time I just wanted to ask you one more questions about the hostages which I I mentioned earlier um what efforts are underway to get those hostages released briefly if you can the hostage issue as I said 220 people the families of 220 people that have been torn to pieces for 19 days now a reality that I can't imagine the pain that they are going through and we are and and I'm saying that the IDF has put at the top of our priority both for operational and civilian efforts in order to bring them home immediately it is hamas's responsibility for their welfare we're demanding uh International Committee of the Red Cross have access to them and I would say we will go no uh uh to any length in order to bring them home they are the top of our prior priority they need to be let let free now um um Hamas have that responsibility we are expecting them to come home now Peter Lana of the Israeli Defense Forces thank you very much for talking with us today thank you good day and we can now talk to Margaret Harris a spokesperson for the World Health Organization she joins us from Geneva Miss Harris I understand you're in touch with your w uh colleagues in Gaza what are they telling you they're telling me that they're not sleeping they're bombardments all the time they're not sleeping because of the bombardments but also because of the anxiety about trying to get the supplies to the hospitals they've only been able to supply four hospitals from the trucks that we were able to get through beginning Sunday because there's no safe way to get to many of the hospitals in the center and the North and there's no guarantees from any sides that they will be safe so uh and wherever they go the need is so desperate they they describe how they arrive at a hospital the staff open the door go through the boxes and get the the the drugs particularly the anesthetic drugs that they desperately need to use to operate on the people who until they had those drugs sometimes times the doctors even had to operate on them without anesthetic the UN is warning that Gaza could run out of fuel by the end of this day Wednesday what would that mean for the humanitarian situation there it would mean death for so many patients we know of 300 babies that uh are in sorry 150 30 babies premature babies who are dependent on the electricity to keep them warm to keep the the ventilators going there are a thousand dialysis patients there are pregnant women an average you give an average of 183 births happening per day so that needs light and warmth as well there are 350,000 people who need continual care and there are the thousands of people who are being injured every day and without the electricity you don't have the light you don't have the Machinery you cannot function you cannot provide the safe space that a hospital needs to be there's also a link between lack of fuel and the spread of waterborne diseases I'm told to why is the fuel so necessary for providing clean water to uh the people living in Gaza that's correct because it's used for the desalination plants and the desalination plants are the only way people are getting water at the moment because the not much water's coming in as you know there's been a blockade uh at the moment people are getting no more than 3 lers per day and the the basic standard for for a person is 15 lers per day you need that for washing cooking and drinking and if you're not getting that you're not able to wash certainly you're not a to cook safely and you may well be drinking dirty water so you are highly likely to be getting gastroenterological diseases now the Israeli military says it has good reasons for not allowing fuel in to enter Gaza what do you say to that market we're talking about health we're talking about hospitals we're talking about 15,000 injured people and people being injured every day that there is no other way that hospitals can generate electricity they do not have the any electricity coming in they can only do it with generators and the only way those generators going to work is with fuel Israel has called for civilians to leave Northern Gaza to go to the South many have stayed there in the north do you have any idea what the situation is like for those people who have remained in the north it's must be terrifying but it's also terrifying for the people in the South they are also receiving bombardment and I am hearing from my our colleagues on the ground that uh many people who came down from the north have moved back again because they don't feel any safer in the south they talk about people sort of running when they hear the bombs running somewhere else running somewhere else I cannot even begin to imagine what this is doing to their mental health particularly the terror the children are feeling Margaret thank you very much for talking with us today that was Margaret Harris spokesperson for the World Health Organization well Germany has voiced strong support for Israel since the Hamas terror attack foreign minister analina Bach was among the diplomats who addressed the UN Security Council on Tuesday she also appealed for humanitarian relief the fight is against Hamas and not against civilians that is why that is why it's crucial for us that this fight must be carried out in line with humanitarian law with the greatest possible conservation for civilians in Gaza that is why my country Germany is increasing our humanitarian Aid to GAA by 50 million Europe of which 19 million go to unra that is why we need humanitarian windows so that those who are suffering can get help in Gaza let's bring in Johan vadol here he's the deputy head of the CDU CSU parliamentary group in Germany and an expert on defense and foreign policy welcome to the program we just heard uh foreign minister babok there announcing a new Aid package for Gaza after repeating Germany that Germany stands by Israel uh in the face of Civilian casualties mounting in Gaza and the humanitarian situation there is there a red line for Germany when it comes to supporting netanyahu's government now I think um thinking in in red lines is is not the the um necessary approach in that very situation Israel is in now you know uh due to our responsibility uh after uh being uh responsible for the Holocaust for killing millions of Jews uh there has no doubt that Germany is uh close to Israel is supporting Israel fully in its combat against Hamas Hamas is the very reason uh for the situation we are in now and if there is a chance to solve especially the problems for the civilians who may be injured uh in the in the fight ahead it is Hamas who can solve the problem if they give up their terrorist fight against Israel if they leave their arms beside and if they come back to a negotiation table and of course there are legitimate rights of Palestinians and uh everybody is in favor of a two states solution but not in this way not by killing more than thousand israelian not through terrorist attacks so in that very stage Germany fully supports Israel now Israel says it wants to wipe out Hamas uh after that horrible attack on October 7th but there are voices who say that the current war will breed more hatred and extremism we heard German Chancellor Olaf Schultz talking to Benjamin Netanyahu urging him not to be blinded by rage um what's your take is Israel on the right path now yes it is on the right path you have not seen a full-fledged offensive on the ground so I do not see rage but I see but I see in Israel which is uh clearly decided to really wipe out these terrorists and I think this is very necessary I do not see any other solution and I would have expected that the UN Council and especially the general secretary could have urged the Arabic countries who are of course taking care of the phe of the Palestinians uh and and who are formulating their interests on the international uh level which is necessary and uh absolutely legitimate but I would have expected that the UN secretary could have uh asked the uh Arabic countries to put more pressure on Hamas to use their leverage on Hamas to give us this to give up this fight to give up uh the way and only using terrorist uh uh chances to to to and and opportunities to to wipe out Israel that is there's no determination for for this Johan vadul Deputy head of the CDU CSU parliamentary group and expert on defense foreign policy thank you very much thank you as
