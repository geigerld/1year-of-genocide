hundreds more foreign passport holders have left Gaza through the Rafa Crossing into Egypt the crowds have gathered at the border but only those on an official list are being allowed to pass the biggest group of around 400 were US citizens the Crossing's been opened for the first time since the start of this current conflict between Israel and Hamas these were some of the first foreign passport holders to reach the safety of Egyptian soil on the other died hundreds were hoping for their chance to cross but only those on a list agreed by Israel and Egypt would be allowed to do so after more than 3 weeks under Israeli bombardment and blockade people here were desperate to escape we are relying on God and hoping we'll get out it's still our country and we feel sad for it for its Destruction for our friends and loved ones entire families were destroyed and erased all martyred and if it weren't for what happened we wouldn't leave as well as those allowed to leave for good Egyptian authorities have agreed to a small number of medical evacuations with ambulances crossing the border to retrieve the severely injured once in Egypt they were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment gaza's own medical facilities are desperately short of even basic supplies and are overflowing with the injured and while more Aid trucks were allowed through once again on Wednesday Aid groups say it's only a tiny fraction of what entered daily before the Hamas terrorist attacks the head of the un's relief agency in Gaza stressed that residents were in urgent need after he crossed into Rafa for a visit and I was shuck by the fact that everyone there was asking for food was asking for water we I saw almost every children trying to express their way that they need to eat they need to have water um I never ever have seen something similar in Gaza when I came before after conflict Egyptian officials say more people will be able to leave over the coming days but it's unclear just how long the the Border will remain open to foreign passport holders what is certain is that unless Egypt's government lets Palestinians cross 2 for the vast majority of those trapped in Gaza Escape will remain impossible well hajan baloa is a journalist based in Gaza and we asked him whether the small amounts of Aid being allowed in are making any difference well in some places some areas hon one scho like that is people displaced people are taking as a shelter they're receiving more Aid some organizations are distributed but making huge or a concrete difference it's not I mean still we are talking about a huge number of displ people whether from the northal GZA City or even those people who are in this area from the border areas or other places people they are still struggling of of getting the aid their distribution mechanism is not clear to everybody when when and when I'm asking coordinator people about that they don't know sometimes they get some aid from here and there but um it's still uh it's it's not easy because there is no cooking gas so people are not cooking in their homes no water whether for washing or even uh for a drink that's Hasan Bela in Gaza well our correspondent Rebecca RS is in the Israeli city of stod near the border with Gaza and she gave us another update on Israel's military offensive well Phil we know that the ground offensive continues and is growing that the Israeli military is saying a little earlier that they have they've used this figurative term that they've reached the gates of Gaza City now that you know is obviously one of their key points one of the places of focus it's one of the biggest residential areas or the biggest residential area inside the strip of course we know that the military have advised everybody living in Gaza City and further north to head south because to expect these bombardments last night saw some pretty heavy bombardments as well and where we're standing is about 2 kilm from the northern Northeast part behind me is a city called bate hanon uh you can hear uh the pounding of artillery is outgoing artillery um and you can hear even still some machine gun fire heavy machine gun fire in the background from time to time but the bombardments from here we've been here for a couple of weeks on and off and the bombardments in this area have been a lot more intense in recent days today we're seeing a little less of that as they the troops move further south towards Gaza City where we expect them to be encircling the city so that they can continue the bombardments and trying to to carry out their military aims of completely destroying hamas's military capabilities thanks for that um the president of Israel Isaac Herzog has given a national address urging Unity amongst his uh countrymen we'll listen to a clip of that Rebecca then we'll come back to you the enemy seeks to Kindle hatred between us between Jewish citizens and Arab citizens we have to fight back against us without compromise and single-mindedly we have to reject every urge toward hatred and racism toward different groups among us to recall the dozens of Arab citizens who paid with their l lives those at home and those in battle and the most important is to recall the responsibility and the mutual respect that exemplifies the Arab community in Israel back to Rebecca R is in the south of Israel uh Rebecca how is uh Society there dealing with all this tension well that's a very important and timely message that you're hearing from the president there just exactly what ears it will fall on remains to be seen uh the tensions here are incredibly High both in Israel and especially in the West Bank so we're seeing an an increase in violence there in particular Arab Israelis in Israel also saying that they're feeling uh pressure that they're feeling squeezed that they they're not being able to express themselves in the way they might like they're being uh even there have been cases of people being arrested for expressing uh their feelings about the war in Gaza but on the West Bank we're see seeing a lot more violence uh 2023 already before the war was on track to be the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the West Bank since uh Records began and you know we have seen that spike a lot since October 7 the UN saying that more than 130 Palestinians have been killed in that time since the attack on October 7th and we've seen you know renewed and continued raids today in particular uh we've seen a lot of settler violence and that has also been on the rise of many settlers um rampaging in the settlers that being Israeli citizens who live in the West Bank rampaging uh through uh uh the West Bank and and even killing uh Palestinians so today we saw uh settlers lighting fire to property and rampaging through areas around the nablas area and this morning we heard that four Palestinians were shot in various places across the West Bank so you know really the it's very very tense they've bolstered troops Israeli troops throughout the West Bank and they're trying they say to to obviously root out militants Hamas militants they've made over 12200 arrests but uh it's creating a lot of tension and the lives for Palestinians in those areas is becoming increasingly difficult thanks for that Rebecca Rebecca ritas in southern
