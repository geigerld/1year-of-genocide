we start in Qatar where us officials say negotiations to bring an end to the war in Gaza are off to a quote promising start the talks come as the Hamas run Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll from the conflict has surpassed 40,000 Hamas which sparked the war with its October 7th Terror attacks on Israel is not taking part in the talks Israel is feeling pressure at home to reach a deal for the release of the remaining hostages the us and its allies hope atuse might also avert expected Iranian Le reprisals for the recent assassination of hamas's political leader Ismael Han in Teran let's take a closer look at these negotiations with Middle East expert Daniel G Daniel we've seen so many rounds of negotiations since October but very little movement since November when that group of hostages was was released and exchanged for a group of Palestinian pris rers where do things stand right now well over the last couple of months things have become more and more complicated and at the same time which is probably a bit ironic uh the Americans have become more and more optimistic in their communication every time a round of negotiation fails and new one started so uh we have to look at the at the US communication strategy in order to understand what is really at stake it is true the Americans are trying to use these hostage negotiations these Gaza negotiations to prevent a regional War but they're also trying of course by creating this like optimistic scenarios uh White House spokesperson John kiry just said I think today uh we are just talking about the implementation of the details which is quite interesting you know it's not a question if they agree or not it's just about the details that means very far from the truth yeah it probably is but it creates pressure and then he said something else which is very interesting uh I believe and that's what the US said in the last couple of weeks uh repeated that Israel did not achieve the goal of destroying and disabling let's say Hamas uh as a military force in Gaza and so the Americans said you will not achieve this goal so be reasonable you know and negotiate now John Kirby said Israel has almost achieved everything it wanted in order to just let's say give a face saving exit for the netan government to say you have won you have achieved what you wanted now sign the deal and that is interesting I think we have to really read carefully it's all about the margins of interpretation and that's also what the Qatari partners are doing uh the the Iranians are going to tell the Israelis are trying to protect these negotiations for three or four days so basically we're going to attack so the qataris have to say look they're not protecting it we're really working on the deal so you this is this is the role of the negotiators and as gruesome as the as the news are every day that we here I think this is an a very interesting time of international conflict diplomacy all of that said what does does off to a good start then mean well in fact that uh you remember last may we we we we talked about the Biden plan when uh Biden said well this is basically an Israeli proposal and we uh think that the Israelis have already agreed to that then netan said no no we did not it's not our plan uh then there were accusations that the Israelis had tried to push in other demands for example uh a continuous military presence of Israel in two different corridors in the Gaza strip uh the Israelis denied that and they said like well we we did not invent this we didn't come up with this a new it was something that was already suggested but maybe it was not outlined in detail in the plan so it's about the words but let's say a good start is that negotiations are still happening and that the parties believe that a deal a binding deal is necessary because of course you can tell you can say that netan is not interested in a deal that's he's been accused of that many times that he just like wants to project the situation on and on and on until he achieves a military Victory and stays in power of course on the other side you have Hamas who were not interested in an initial deal now they're saying we're not going going even to Doha because we remain committed and faithful to the deal uh that was suggested in may keep in mind the head of Hamas the political head of Hamas was assassinated by the Israelis in in tan and the most radical and most uncompromising person that Hamas ever had Yahya sinir is now officially at the helm and still Hamas says we remain committed to the deal that we have agreed to to in in in May the Iranians have always said we will take revenge for what happened in tan regardless of any like you know political Arrangements but now they're messaging at the same time if the Americans achieve a ceasefire in in Gaza then we will uh probably postpone or even probably cancel our revenge and that is very interesting because the Iranians now for the first time or a very rare moment are giving the United States a constructive diplomatic role in the region they call the Americans the big devil but at the same time they're giving them a diplomatic role and that is good news I think uh the problem is The Americans really have to deliver because they have created a lot of expectations if they don't deliver now we will see a major war in the Middle East in a few days so there are so many sources of pressure at this moment the threat of a major regional War the the pressure inside Israel to get the hostages released but also the the number of victims that keeps growing and growing in Gaza civilians that are killed as part of this military operation on both sides how much longer can the Waring factions withstand this kind of pressure well we see that uh the netan government can sustain the pressure for a long time it was not intimidated it was not even let's say impressed by whatever criticism and let's be honest uh the criticism was came from the United States from every now and then but in fact uh the United States just signed a major released a major arms deal Congress still has to approve but I don't don't don't see any don't think there's a problem there about 20 billion mainly uh fighter jets delivered to Israel so the Americans of course verbally issued some you know critical statements but at the same time always made it pretty clear we're going to support Israel if a major conflict with Iran erupts now you see everyone has has a lot to lose in this conflict um Israel in particular the civilians the society they are tired of this war and they just cannot afford another War look at the Palestinians there's no safety for the Palestinians at all like they are not even in the situation to decide about their own future Hamas is to a certain extent but certainly not the Palestinian population that's why the International Community needs to speak on their behalf you talk about other conflicts other players like Hezbollah and Lebanon or Iran of course they want to take revenge and of course they want to show that they have a force of deterrence but at the same time they have a lot to lose Hezbollah is a is a Lebanese party it has power it has money and it has a lot to lose if you have power and money you have to stuff to lose so you you you are careful about risking it and the same is true for the Iranian regime that has other geopolitical interests that go beyond uh the the Israeli Palestinian conflict and that's we have to see the the interest of the players and we have to take them seriously and then I think that's what the duty of diplomacy is I'll have to let you go yes or no answer will we have a deal at the end of these discussions I think we will but I don't know how long these discussions take and that's the major issue issue how long can you still convince the other side that you are serious you want to have a deal but you still need time that's the most difficult part for the negotiators cautiously optimistic Daniel G Middle East analyst thank you so much negotiators are using a plan drafted by the US and endorsed by the UN Security Council it calls for a six- week ceasefire in Gaza Hamas would release its remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners Israel would allow unlimited Aid deliveries into Gaza and withdraw its forces but Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by many countries is not participating in the talks the region is on edge as Israel awaits retaliation from Iran after the killing of hamas's political leader isma Han in Teran last month journalist Kareem elari is following the story from Cairo for us Kareem what are you hearing about the status of the ceasefire negotiations at the moment well the negotiations are starting now basically in Doha um there was a momentum built up for this negotiations of course which has to do with the regional tension that was building up with the killing of the ptical Hamas leader isma hania and the military commander fuad shuker of hisbah in Lebanon so that of course created a lot of pressure because the everyone was waiting for the retaliation from Iran from hisa possibly also from theis so the conflict got took much wider circles and that kind of pressured the US and the Egyptian and the K negotiators to ask for this uh new round of negotiations as you said hisbah Hamas is not taking part in this negotiations they saying um they are afraid that Israel is going to impose new conditions as it happened many times before and they call it an Israeli created Maze of negotiations they want that this negotiations are based on the Biden plan something that is already discussed since months and days when this uh base is really the base of this negotiations they might also attend at a later Point don't forget there is a Hamas representation a Hamas office in duha that could join the negotiations anytime yeah they're not present at the talks but as far as I understand the situation they're right up the street from where those talks are happening How likely is that absence of Hamas Representatives at the table though to impact the success of these negotiations well you see the outline of the negotiations is are clear since months there's really nothing new to negotiate there is no new will uh to really invent we have since months like uh a three phase deal on the table in the first first phase release of some of the hostages at some of the Palestinian uh prisoners in Israeli uh prisons uh in exchange for six weeks uh um ceasefire followed by a second phase with more releases uh and uh basically the idea that the Israeli Army that a permanent end of the war permanent ceas fire and then a third phase which is about uh rebuilding the Gaza Strip where you have to have all kinds of of course setups who is going to control the Gaza Strip in case the Israeli Army is withdra that was journalist Karim elari in Ciro thank you so much you're welcome we can now speak to a professional negotiator who has worked for various Israeli governments and prime ministers in the past Mo Crystal heads up a consultant consultancy Nest negotiation strategy he joins us from Tel Aviv M we mentioned that all Israelis are expecting a retaliatory strike from Iran and or Hezbollah after two killings blamed on Israel can these negotiations in K Qatar make any gains under this Shadow or in fact head off a retaliation well I think that it was uh Iran which explicitly mentioned that if a ceasefire agreement will be reached in DOA uh Iran will reconsider its uh retaliatory attack um you know we need to take things uh by its merits uh Iran andah threaten to uh make any attack on Israel in the last two weeks this uh didn't happen or hasn't been happening yet and uh of course Iran is trying to take advantage of the overall dynamic in DOA Iran is trying to take advantage of the tremendous pressure which is put by the Biden Administration on Nan to reach a SE fire and to see to what extent they can gain why because Iran itself uh was uh extremely embarrassed by the uh assassination on its territory and at the same time they need to react retaliate in a way which will not lead to a tremendous escalation which is neither the interest of Iran and Russia nor the interest of Israel and and the US so that's a um a very dangerous and sensitive game which is happening today uh in Doha and in in the Middle East in general now the Hamas is not sitting at the table in in Doha uh but even without Hamas many see this as a last chance for negotiators how do you see it well you know been taking part of so many rounds of negotiation hostage and political negotiations there is one thing that I can tell you with significant confidence there is never last round Never Last Chance and never the last uh um Summit there's always a followup there always the right moment and definitely in the Israeli Hamas uh mind battle on these negotiations the fact that sinir is not sitting at the table and the fact that suir was actually left almost alone in the Hamas leadership with the assassination of death and the hania that really diminish the actual likelihood that this round the specific rounds today and tomorrow uh will end up with with a a deal despite the efforts of the US Qatar and and Egypt it just doesn't work like that uh in in the Middle East understand you have been involved in hostage release negotiations in the past what's it like to try to work with the hostage takers to let let them go well the uh it's always a challenging uh task but this particular the number of the hostages which is in the hand of Hamas our understanding that sinir see these hostages as a policy as an insurance policy for his uh life for the continuing uh ruling of Hamas in Gaza and the continue role of Hamas in the Palestinian Arena from a professional point of view and I know that I'm here against the very dominant Israeli sentiment from a professional point of view a deal which all the uh hostages will be released is almost impossible because sinir will always keep either live hostages my assumption or even bodies which uh is which he knows that Israel care much about them in order to prolong this and in order to make sure that his life are not uh in in in danger so you are relatively confident that not all hostages will be released well I to be honest I don't see any scenario in which sinir will agree to release all the hostages uh the demands will increase uh what the the basic principle in hostage negotiation ation is you free and you take whoever you can so if there is a deal at the moment a sensation of violence for a certain period of time for a release of whoever was Left Alive by the hand of uh this Terror organization myself as a negotiator as a hostage negotiator I will take it because my Supreme command is to uh free as many people as possible the continuation and the violence and the isra Palestinian conflict will not end this weekend in Doha and uh we still have a long way to go including unfortunately uh staying of hostages in the hand of this uh uh ter organization the only way uh to to resolve this is to completely diminish or destroy uh terminate Hamas ruling capacities and regime in Gaza and a long process of transformation of the Palestinian population MTI Crystal there a former Israeli crisis negotiator thank you very much for sharing your expertise and experiences with us thank you good evening
