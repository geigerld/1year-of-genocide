Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to hunt down the leaders of Hamas after the military said it had recovered the bodies of six hostages from a tunnel in southern Gaza the militant group captured them during the October 7th Terror attacks one by one the names of the six hostages are read out on isra TV crushing the last hopes of their relatives and Friends a few hours ago we informed the families that the IDF located the bodies of their loved ones in an underground tunnel in Rafa our initial assessment suggests they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them they were kidnapped alive on the morning of October 7th by the terrorist organization Hamas one of the hostages was 23y old old Israeli American H Goldberg pollin he was seized by Hamas militants at a music festival in southern Israel during the attack on October the 7th speaking to DW in December his mother was full of hope he would soon be released I pray all the time that I know there are kind good gazen civilians who are also caught in this horrible situation that we're caught in and I want to pray and hope that there's someone kind there being kind to hirs and to the other you know innocent people who are also being held there in a terrible situation such words would resonate with people at this rally in Tel Aviv held just hours before the IDF announced it found the six bodies for months protesters have been demanding a deal to release all hostages they accuse the government of putting its political survival above the lives of Israeli citizens all they care about is the politics and they didn't approve to to do a deal with the with Kamas and so our loved ones are still there and currently we don't see the Horizon and don't see know when they will be back with us the Israeli Prime Minister said the killing of hostages showed Hamas didn't want the deal I say to the Hamas terrorists who murdered our hostages and I say to their leaders your blood is on your hands we will not rest and we will not be silent we will pursue you we will find you and we will settle the score with you the confirmed deaths of six more hostages are likely to further Galvanize the protests with the opposition already vowing to bring Israel's economy to his standstill journalist balik sedine has more on this story for us from Tel Aviv bik have additional details emerged about this operation to recover the bodies of the hostages yes in the past couple of hours Pathologists and professionals are saying that the hostages were killed between 48 to 70 hours ago which means that we're talking about Tuesday evening um while we're talking while excuse me the cabinet was taking their decision on the Israeli presence in the Philadelphia C or not very far away from there in Rafa they were murdered by Hamas militants apparently and according to the details uh they were found with the head shot all of them uh alongside other um like shots in other areas so they were executed um another very important detail that they were found uh um 20 M underground in a tunnel just 100 just excuse me 1 kilometer away from the place that the IDF soldiers found an alive hostage um two days before that so maybe the Hamas milans when they sensed or when they noted that the IDF troops are getting closer to reaching the hostages they murdered them in order not to give this achievement to the Israelis now this will be just devastating news for families say their loved ones been murdered after surviving almost 11 months in Hamas captivity how much of that anger will also be directed toward the Netanyahu government for not securing a deal for their release yes well uh yesterday evening I was also present and covering the uh event that happens every single Saturday evening the hostages or the families of the hostages hold that event every um end of Shabbat and we can tell that the anger tilts toward One Direction which is the Israeli government they accuse the prime minister of trisingular [Music] and also today they are planning into uh they're planning to um um exceed or um um just get this protest and demands for the hostage deal bigger and bigger maybe today and also during the week now today Israeli opposition leader yayer Leed has called for a strike to shut down Israel's economy and an effort to pressure the government to reach a deal how influential do you think this might be yes we already number of businesses has declared that they are um accepting this strike and they're not going to be operating in the next um 24 hours all of these businesses are small to medium businesses for now we're talking about restaurants chains of restaurants and cinema halls and maybe some malls but uh the bigger issue here is the reported meeting between the workers union um or the head of the workers union in Israel called the his is very powerful organization in Israel with some of the families of the hostages that want to um convince him to uh call for a strike as well if that happens and this meeting should take place later today if that happens then maybe that will put more pressure but from what I understand that according to the prime minister's office um he's not um planning to change his policy will continue to seek a hostage deal but will not give up on any of the Strategic assets that Israel already holds the Philadelphia Corridor the narim corridor and many of the things that are considered to be an obstacle for a deal and um the Israeli Prime Minister and the government still thinks that this is very important for guaranteeing Israel's Security in the future thank you so much for joining us that is bik leadin in Tel Aviv thank you
