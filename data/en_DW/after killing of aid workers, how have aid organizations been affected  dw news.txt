Israel has responded to international calls to allow more humanitarian Aid into Gaza the government has now approved the reopening of the ays Crossing into Northern Gaza and the temporary use of ashad port in southern Israel eight agencies say that supplies which are getting through at present are not nearly enough inside these boxes is medicine and supplies much needed Aid at this Hospital which has become the most important in Northern Gaza after alifa Hospital stopped functioning many patients arrived at Kamal adwan Hospital which is a small hospital and we lack medicine and supplies we called on International organizations including the World Health Organization and thank God today we received some supplies Aid has been trickling into Gaza however agencies say it's not enough to meet the needs of the population pressure has been growing on Israel to allow more humanitarian supplies Into The Enclave which the Israeli government has approved this decision comes in the wake of the killing of several Aid workers in an Israeli strike earlier this week but safety concerns remain an issue for ageny still operating in Gaza we don't have the necessary security guarantees to work work here the people also need to be safe so for that for us to really be able to scale up to avert famine so that people don't have to die because they don't have food we need security guarantees for us as humanitarians but also for the people we serve in Gaza famine is edging closer in Northern Gaza where some 70% of the population is facing catastrophic hunger according to the un's world food program Oxfam says since January Palestinians in Northern Gaza have eaten an average of just 245 calories per day that's less than a can of beans when we were displaced at the beginning of the war we used to eat rotten bread because of the high prices of food here this is the only place where I can get food for my children I have three boys and one girl they need food where do I get them food I couldn't afford to buy any food everything is so expensive and I have no money this Local Kitchen is our safe place we come here every day a problem shared by many gazin six months into the war and with no end in sight to their suffering let's bring in Jonathan Fowler he's a spokesman for unra that's the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees he joins me from Cairo Jonathan more Aid is expected to come into Gaza now now what difference does it make for the people on the ground this remains to be seen I mean we we were not party to to discussions about opening the the new Crossing I should stress we've been advocating for this since the very beginning of the war we need more crossings that that's absolutely essential the current capacity at um Rafa and at Karam Shalom is insufficient and in any case the the number of trucks that have been permitted to get through at those two Crossings has been V ly under the number that's actually required we need to get 500 trucks a day into the Gaza Strip of food and other kinds of Aid just to meet the minimum survival requirements of the population now on average the existing two Crossings over the the beginning of this month we've been seeing 169 trucks a day which is barely better than the previous month so 169 does not equal 500 we really have to hope that this new Crossing enables the operation to be scaled up but we have no idea what's going to be allowed through or indeed which agencies are going to be able to to take um Aid through through this Crossing and we currently are are not permitted to take aid at all to the north of the Gaza Strip your organization said before that Israel has been putting obstacles for a to come into Gaza uh does reopening these routes mean these obstacles will be gone um again I mean we we remains to be seen what what will happen but I mean the obstacles at the border include inspections operating hours the these kind of issues you know items that get plac on the band list we've not been able to take in um certain kinds of medicine your anesthetics insulin pens for children um medical scissors solar lamps uh these kind of things um and so if caros had to be inspected and then items are removed a place on a band list that that by definition slows things down um and then there are also difficulties of moving around within the Gaza Strip because the difficulty of deconfliction um sadly illustrated by by the death of our friends from World Central Kitchen um and sadly illustrated by the death of of huge numbers of our own staff um in the Gaza Strip so again you know opening a new Crossing is is important um but really uh is the opportunity to scale up the what needs to be seized is the opportunity to scale up the operation to an acceptable level um you mentioned uh the attack on the aid workers in Gaza how has it affected the work of Aid organizations such as yours on the ground well um obviously I mean world Central Kitchen and other organizations have had to make the decision to to Halt operations and that's meant that people that they were feeding um will no longer get fed and the clock is ticking ever faster to famine for over a million people um a man-made famine um but in terms of operations on the ground you know this tragically is more of the same we we've been seeing this kind of pattern um of refusals to to be able to do missions and notably as I said we we have been banned uh from from going to the north um we have faced severe restrictions on on our ability to operate within the Gaza Strip denial of permission to do assessment missions to even see where people are who what they might need because you don't just go in with a truck um of items that don't necessarily meet the need of the the people that you're trying to help um so the operating environment that really needs to be solved as well Jonathan Fowler there spokesman for the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian ref gz
