I'm Claire Richardson welcome residents of Gaza are rushing toward the Rafa border crossing in the hopes of making it across the Egyptian border human rights groups have been calling for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow safe passage both for Aid and for people to leave Gaza Egypt controls the Rafa border crossing the only passage in and out of Gaza that's not controlled by Israel the Border was shut down nearly a week ago these people are rushing towards the Rafa border crossing hoping the gates will open there is no safety even when you're at the Crossing you're afraid on our way to the crossing they shelled Rafa Street we came thinking it was safe nowhere is safe in Gaza wherever we go there's shelling crying screaming and blood we don't know what to do we're coming to the crossing knowing they won't open it no Aid either for 8 days I swear to God no electricity no water no internet we can't communicate or know what's going on seriously this is not alive media reports had prompted hope that Cairo might open its border for foreign passport holders there is no confirmation yet and many people desperate to leave Gaza are willing to wait with few belongings their children and family my sister my brother my and I just like before the world like couple days and I want to spend like two two weeks with my family here and enjoy I enjoy here with the w with the w they I can't sleep L of bomb no water no food no nothing no no life here no life I don't know I don't know how they thinking about people all all over the world they they have like country people live they go visit family they go everywhere that's Gaza s in palestin this is like they think there not people here this people here this people here live it's not life and as people wait to leave on the Gaza site eight supplies are stalled inside Egypt but Egypt says the Border opening was not possible because of earlier Israeli a strikes on the Gaza side Israel denies that any agreements on eight or evacuation have been reached and with no definitive answers the wait for many of those trying to flee might be long Jason Lee from the charity save the children joins me from rala in the West Bank thank you for taking the time to speak with us can you tell us what save the children is doing to help children in Gaza save the children we're trying to meet the immediate needs of children now despite the fact that my staff themselves have been displaced and are living in shelters in the South will manage able to do some distributions today again ensuring that water was distributed some hygiene kits it is difficult the situation is becoming it's dire you have a more than 500,000 people have fled in the South what conditions are your staff reporting there in the south again you've got more than 500,000 people that have fled um numbers are uncertain because we can't verify but you have at least 275,000 people Sheltering in un schools now these schools have no food they've got no water um very no electricity you've got maybe one wash facility for thousands of people um so it's the the conditions there are D not only you mention that you're carrying constant shelling so people that are fleeing from areas that they were told to evacuate from are still being shelled they's still shelling and air stries going on and at this point is save the children able to continue uh to get Aid into Gaza I'm curious what the biggest challenges are to actually getting it into Gaza and providing it to the people that need it it's difficult because all entry points to Gaza at the moment are closed so the normal entry points that we use from Israel is are closed Rua is closed now with dwindling supplies in Gaza so you've got a situation where Gaza is running out of water Food Supplies are low you don't have medicines that are medic are basically running out if the borders don't open if the crossings don't open to allow humanitarians to enter and to bring critical life-saving Goods with us civilian death toll will increase exponentially it's also critical that all sides stop the hostilities in order for us to deliver Aid safely and for civilians to reach safety and what do you think the International Community should be doing then I think the International Community needs to realize the urgency of the situation and the humanitarian crisis that is looming and it's important that we go back to a consistent rules-based order where there is adherence to international law that all sides have to abide by it for save the children we fundamentally believe that every right should be afforded to every child all of the time no matter who they are or where they are we can't pick and choose which rights to protect for which children and in what times and what circumstances All rights for all children all the time everywhere thank you so much for joining us that is Jason Lee from save the children thank you let's bring in Saleem ois Communications officer at UNICEF Middle East and North Africa for more on this story um thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us can you tell us what your partners on the ground are telling you about the situation in Gaza right now thank you CLA um the situation is as as we heard from people themselves it's catastrophic it's it's really the images that we are seeing the stories that we are hearing are horrific people are struggling to uh to stay alive uh till the hour I think uh uh what what we could uh uh get reports of is over 720 children dead that's in 9 days that's that's almost three kids an hour uh over 2,400 kids injured and those are only the numbers that were reported uh to us uh unfortunately the numbers might be much uh uh much more um people are living without water without electricity this means that there's no uh uh no clean uh uh water for children to drink uh risking their their lives for the hydration also the infrastructure for water uh uh uh all the sanitation and the sewage system is is is ruined and that means that um they are they are very uh uh on the verge of of waterbor diseases um health systems are really in a bad shape uh hospitals are running out of fuel without electricity and without fuel that means that they will not be able to to uh deliver to their patients and to the injured thousands of inured people um they are overwhelmed with the numbers and they can't uh keep up U the situation overall is really horrific and we are heading towards a humanitarian catastrophe with more than 1 million people um asked by Israel to move from northern Gaza to the South can you tell us what the situation is like there is there a big difference between what is happening in the north and south of Gaza at the moment well that's that's what that's the thing we we we since they one we said 1 million over 1 million people asked to move to the South the problem is there's no place that is safe they don't have a place to run to uh the South the south is not safe for for for Children and Families uh uh whether it's less or or uh better in terms of violence but it's still not safe because the war is covering all of of OFA violence is there and children and families are not spared uh infrastructure is not spared all around and uh they don't have really they don't have Prospect uh if if they moved well thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today on DW news that is Sim o with UNICEF we really appreciate your
