now US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says Hamas has proposed changes to a us-backed ceasefire deal with Israel he said while that while some of the demands were workable others were not wrapping up his Middle East Tour blinkin insisted that a deal to end the war in Gaza was still possible and meanwhile lebanon's iran-backed Hezbollah militia has fired a huge barrage of rockets into Northern Israel there were no immediate reports of casualties the group says it was in response to the killing of a senior commander in an Israeli air strike the funeral of the most senior Hezbollah figure killed since October Talib Sami Abdullah was known within hasbalah as Haj Abu Talib and perhaps the clearest indication of his status on the battlefield during the funeral procession in Beirut a vow to retaliate this will be our response to the martyrdom of Abu Talib we will increase our operations in intensity Force quantity and quality wait and see on the battlefield Israel says the strike on a Hezbollah command and control center took out Abu Talib in response hasbalah launched one of its heaviest rocket attacks on Northern Israel adid already escalating clashes across the Lebanon Israel border since October strikes have killed 25 people on the Israeli side including 10 civilians and over 400 people in Lebanon including more than 70 civilians the latest casualty a public utility worker in the Lebanese town of nakura killed in an Israeli drone strike was one of the guys who was persistent and patient he was a good person he didn't want to leave the town the US is calling for deescalation while US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said a Gaza deal would also help lower Israel Lebanon tensions now there's no doubt in my mind that the the best way also to empower a diplomatic solution to the North Lebanon is a resolution of the conflict in Gaza getting the ceasefire that will take a tremendous amount of of pressure out of the system hostilities have forced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the border to flee their homes a resolution Lincoln says needs to also ensure their safe return home let's get across to our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem from war Tanya Hezbollah has vowed to intensify its attacks along the Lebanon Israel border what kind of respon response white might we see from Israel well we could see more intense crossborder attacks we've been seeing this in recent weeks and as you just said Hezbollah has threatened after the killing of this high ranking Commander that it will intensify or widen its attacks and what is very worrying here in Israel is that those attacks from Hezbollah are going deeper inside the country like on Wednesday we've heard air rate Sirens going off in Tiberia which is on the Sea of Galilee and other places and this has been uh you know going on this gradual in intensification uh of uh uh cross border strikes and also of course Israel retaliating deeper inside Lebanon now what could that mean I mean either we will be seeing a diplomatic uh uh solution that is being worked on also for months already but uh it's very openly discussed here that once uh the offensive uh and the war in Gaza is coming to an end we could see an escalation on the northern border there could be actually uh an offensive uh in Lebanon uh from Israel and that is because it's in the report as well we've seen that that you know tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced since October 7 uh when those crossb attacks started and Israel has to change this reality in some ways when you go up north Border Town towns and bigger towns even like Kon they are ghost towns people have left them and this is of course something that Israel cannot accept in the long term so Tanya looking just briefly at that Gaza ceasefire deal uh that Lincoln has said um the US is supporting that it would attentions do we know how close Israel and Hamas are to actually accepting the plan well I think nobody can answer that question right now and this uh ceasefire deal that would also see the release of hostages is really hanging in the balance and we've heard from US Secretary of State blinkin he said uh that changes were made now the official response by Hamas so we have to wait and see uh how both sides will be you know coming together on that or not this is pretty much unclear how both sides will be moving forward Tanya thank you for that update that's our correspondent Tanya Kramer
