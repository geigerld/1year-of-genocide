last week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood before the US Congress in Washington and put the regime in Iran and its proxy Fighters Hezbollah and Hamas on notice now it wasn't a declaration of war but it was as close as against the word ceasefire was not uttered not even once since then two men a Hezbollah commander and the political leader of Hamas have been killed Iran is blaming Israel and vowing revenge the us today said that it had no knowledge and no involvement in the killings how is that possible tonight America's influence over Israel it looks Mighty weak netanyahu's ability to keep his word does not I'm Brink off in Berlin this is the [Music] [Applause] day Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from any Arena we condemn this brutal and painful operation is a great news and I think it was It was supposed to happen I consider what happened in Iran to be a conspiracy he met with the Iranian president and then an Israeli attack happened I'm not going to speculate on what impact any one event uh might have also coming up and trying for the positive spin the US says an escalation of the Middle East conflict is not inevitable and that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still possible I think it's too soon to know what any of these reported events uh could mean for the ceasefire deal um but if I could add two points one is that doesn't mean we're going to stop working on it in fact we have a team in the region right now as we speak uh to try to continue to work with our counterparts to move this forward because it's that important to our viewers watching on PBS in the United States and to all of you around the world welcome we begin the day with an angry and humiliated Iranian regime vowing to take revenge against Israel on Wednesday Iran announced the death of one of its closest allies a top Hamas leader Ismael hania an assassination on Iranian soil that the regime immediately blamed on Israel Ania was in tyan to attend the inauguration of the newly elected Iranian president he was reportedly killed in a pre-dawn air strike that could end up triggering an allout war in the Middle East after the October 7th Terror attacks last year Israel pledged to kill Hanan and other Hamas leaders but today Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin n yahu said nothing of hania's death but he said Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against it on any front in tyan we can only imagine the shock and disbelief an air strike that targeted a Hamas leader inside the Iranian Capital has revealed massive failures by Iran's intelligence and its Republican National Guard add a new president to the equation along with a regime that's still cracking down on domestic descent and you have a full-fledged crisis in the Islamic Republic for its leaders and for those proxy groups that allow Iran to wield power across the Middle East Ismael hania greets Iran's new president in what would be one of his last meetings just hours after attending the president's inauguration he and his bodyguard were killed in a strike on his residence in tyan we condemn brutal and painful Operation God willing with the efforts of the security forces a report will be given to the people as soon as possible my request is that necessary Works be done so that those responsible don't feel like they can hurt us at the time of his death Han was the political face of Hamas the militant islamist group that carried out the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel Hamas Fighters killed around 1200 people and took more than 250 others hostage nearly half of whom are still held in Gaza Hana had not lived in Gaza for several years but ran Hamas from qat where he lived in Exile born near a Gaza City refugee camp the 62-year-old was the child of Palestinian refugees from the village of Alura near Ashkelon he joined Hamas when it was founded in 1987 and was arrested and jailed by Israel during the first in the uprising against Israeli occupation Hano was exiled to Lebanon but he returned to Gaza following the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords he became the Palestinian prime minister in 2006 and continued to rise through hamas's ranks eventually becoming its political Chief in 2017 while hamas's Gaza leader Yahya sinoa is believed to have been The Mastermind of the October 7th attacks Ania was seen as a more moderate force in Hamas he has lost several of his own family members in Israeli attacks on Gaza which have killed nearly 40,000 people since then three of hania's sons and four of his grandchildren were killed in April at the time time hania insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks hania represented Hamas internationally and moved around the region for diplomatic meetings he was a key player in negotiations to stop the fighting in Gaza some fear his killing will be a major setback in achieving peace in the region well Israel has not claimed responsibility for hania's killing but its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today about an earlier strike on Beirut that killed a Hezbollah leader fan shuker he said that killing and others had shown that Israel had delivered crushing blows to all of our enemies Netanyahu said that his country is ready for whatever lies ahead citizens of Israel challenging days lie ahead since the strike in Beirut there are threats sounding from all directions we are prepared for any scenario and we will stand United and determined against any threat Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from any Arena my first guest served 25 years in Israel's defense intelligence community that includes being head of its Iran research Branch he's now with the Atlantic Council and specializes in the Middle East National Security and intelligence I'm happy to welcome back to the program Danny covitz Danny it's good to see you again it's good to have you um on the program you know as well as I do the Middle East has been a powder keg for a long time what do these two killings at the top of hisbah and Hamas what do they mean for the risk of an allout wider War breaking out well again thank you for having me and uh I think that uh as described I think rightly so uh we are on the verge of uh severe escalation and even a regional War I think those two events are putting us closer and closer it's not only those two events but the threats coming out from Teran and tomorrow we'll hear probably Secretary General kasan ASA talking about that as well and I think that we are if uh something it won't be contained in a way that uh maybe inter intervened by the us or other Regional superpowers I think that escalation is almost imminent and I think that uh we are close as we ever been to a direct clash between Israel andala and definitely between Israel and Iran the closest that you've ever been what needs to happen immediately to pull both sides back from the brink in your opinion unfortunately I am not uh verying of good news I think there is no not not a thing that someone can take or do in order to to prevent the reaction uh from Iran andala the retaliation against Israel for the killing of for shukur and isia I think that Israel will have to absorb the strike and then hopefully it will foil most of the attack like what happened 14th of April and then if we're able to foil it then we'll maybe retaliate a limited response and maybe we can contain it but the real problem is the fact that it's not only only even if we contain the current situation we have to remember that without the ceasefire in Gaza the tension will continue and while both sides or or all sides playing with fire I think it's uh safe to assume that even if we contain the cor escalation the future one is just around the corner so but we are in a very vle situation and I hope that after the retaliation of his and Iran and it will be a retaliation I think they climbed on the tree and they said that they will retaliate I hope then the International Community will intervene pressuring both sides to contain a future retaliation because if not escalation like I mentioned imminent and without someone that will be at the end of the day will be able to contain the current situation we'll find ourselves in a in a full stage war that nobody wants but I think we are very close to be there well the Israeli Prime Minister last week when he spoke in Washington um he gave a very long speech he did not mention the word ceasefire once in his speech speech and I know that Israel promised after the October 7th Terror attacks to kill you know hania and other Hamas leaders but hania was also one of the main pointman one of the main people involved in the negotiations about a possible ceasefire and also about a possible hostage deal so it doesn't look that like Israel really wants that ceasefire to to take place is that your read on what Netanyahu wants well uh again it's very hard for me it's easier really to analyze Iran than trying to analyze the Israeli political system especially Nan but I would say this I think that uh isia from the 7th of October it was obvious that Israel will paino it or him but the main problem right now is like you mention is the fact that we have no other choice in that regard in terms of reaching at ceasefire and I'm not sure that killing isma Andia will get us closer uh through this promised land in terms of reaching that agreement hania run the negotiation from Kamas cter I think unlike C he was interested in in a deal uh again he is not a good man he is a terrorist a very bad man but if you want to release our hostages I think that killing uh Ania I'm not sure it's getting us closer to where we want to be I think now we'll have to wait until the will point a new guy hopefully a one that will push for a deal so the B line of things I think killing an in general terms after 7th of October something Israel inspired to do but for in the current situation I'm not sure that killing him will promote deal on unfortunately I think that it will aall one but we'll have to wait and see what's uh how things will develops the future but I'm I'm sadly I'm very pessimistic for the chances for a deal in the current weeks and even months you you say that you're not that killing hania is is going to be um productive for Israel or for getting a ceasefire the United States the Secretary of State said today that the US had no knowledge of the plan to kill Ania and also was not involved in the plan that's hard to believe but if that is the truth what does that tell us then about the relationship between Israel and its most important Ally the United States and what does it tell us also about Washington's ability to influence Israel well I think uh both countries of course have strong cooperation between them but both are independent I think Israel has it Independence to take the relevant decision in order to improve its security uh but it goes with that saying that Israel will need us backup especially if we are deteriorating into a war and that is why I think it's imperative to make sure that the American Administration know what Israel wants to do know what how Israel wants things to be developed and I think we will be highly dependent on them after retaliation whether going to war or using the US to contain or to pressure Iran and kisala through the Lebanese government not to escalate even further so I think in that regard I don't think it's an indication how strong the co cooperation is or connection is I think it's quite strong but I think in that regard I think the administration is highly worried that what Israel is doing right now will deterior the situation into a full scale war and I think they will pressure all sides to contain their activities towards the future okay Danny sovit as always we appreciate your time appreciate your valuable analysis tonight thank you thank you very much well immediately after the air strike on Wednesday morning Iran vowed to take revenge for the killing of Ismael hania now he had come to tan for the inauguration of Iran's new president masud peshan the president today said that Iran will quote defend its territorial Integrity dignity honor and pride and will make the terrorist occupiers regret their cowardly act and in a statement read out on Iranian television the country's supreme leader Ayatollah alih hamani directly threatened Israel claiming that it had laid the ground for a harsh punishment and it was tyron's duty to seek revenge for The Killing of is well for more I'm joined Now by Ali fah Nan director of the center for Middle East and Global Order he joins me tonight from right here in Berlin it's good to see you again Iran promising to punish Israel but within Iran's leadership after the killing of hania in tan do you think that there will be consequences for this failure in intelligence and National Security inside Iran well in terms of consequences I'm not sure uh but then again it's very clear that there have been such uh deficits and huge deficits in terms of uh providing Security in terms of air defenses uh and it's quite a humiliation for the Iranian side after all hania was a top regime guest uh going to tan to attend the inauguration of the the new Iranian president masud pesan and also meeting uh together with the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad um with the supreme leader of Iran Ali but then um you know the so powerful Islamic Republic of Iran was not able to protect uh one of his key allies and one of his top guests so there is a lot of pressure now um to you know in Iran to respond uh to that killing yeah Iran has valed to take revenge um do we know what that could possibly look like well if the New York Times report that was just published an hour or so ago is correct um uh this morning when there was an emergency meeting of the Supreme National Security Council which is an elite buddy tasked to deal with uh vital National Security and foreign policy issues uh at this meeting uh supreme leader Ali according to the New York Times and its sources um has ordered um Iran to strike Israel directly so if this of course would present uh you know a huge escalation uh potentially uh but then again we may see um what we saw what we saw on April 13th uh with the uh unprecedented direct assault by Iran and Israel uh which U you know there's a lot of confusion about that but after you know at the end of the day the Israelis together with the support of the United States and its Regional Partners were able to uh defend uh Israel uh quite uh strongly so maybe uh this kind of uh you know scenario going to be repeated uh basically uh being a show of force from the Iranian side but beyond that of course Iran can activate uh different components of its so-called axis of resistance um the houthis and Yemen who have also launched long range missiles quite recently uh to Israel uh but also pro-iranian militias in Iraq and Syria uh uh retargeting U uh the US military presence there and of course not least Hezbollah in the north of uh Israel but then again uh potentially not to the extent of uh you know the the I mean at the end of the day the Dilemma remains um that uh Iran has to uh show a kind of phas saving response but then again it would be a huge risk um to draw in the United States uh into uh the Middle East War uh and also um create a veritable Northern front between Hezbollah and Israel at the end of the which Iran may lose its Crown Jewel Hezbollah let me just ask you about Hamas and um Hezbollah their their faith and trust in the Iranian regime Ian is it it has to be shaken now or or how do you see it well there was some you know uh shaking credibility all along um since um October 7th because of Iranian reluctance to strike um you know Israel directly um so um this particular credibility problem uh amounted to the kind of Iranian direct assault that we saw on April 13th uh so again um yes it's a credibility problem for the Islamic Republic both with its inside supporter base but also most notely within the axis of uh you know the so-called axis of resistance um uh but but the uh Iranians um uh you know this credibility problem uh has to be dealt with uh but then again we we cannot forget that there is a clear pattern of dependence uh one-sidedly so that is to say that Hezbollah and Hamas are the ones who are dependent upon Tan's support and not vice versa okay Ali F Nan director of the center for Middle East and Global Order we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you good seeing you again thank you with the background to hania's killing is the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel the US has been pressuring Israel to agree to a ceasefire but the Israeli government has resisted ania's death makes a ceasefire seem less likely than ever nevertheless the Biden Administration thinks that it's still possible I want you to listen to what the US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said about that today we still believe there's a viable process we still believe there's interested counterparts and we still believe that there are meetings and discussions to be had we wouldn't have a team over there right now if we didn't believe that it was possible to to try to uh gather gather together and push this forward all right let's stay in Washington now go to our correspondent Janelle Dean she's following the story for us so Janelle weakness and fear let's start with weakness the fact that Israel was able to possibly carry out this assassination the fact that the US was unable to to sway Israel to do something differently US influence on Israel is anything but strong is that what you are hearing right now in Washington well in a word Brent yes and the fact that the US did not know about this attack that's according to Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and that this attack was not coordinated by Washington that kind of uh does seem a bit more indicative of The Limited influence that the US appears to have but uh it's also worth noting out that this idea that the US has un been unable to exert influence on Israel effectively it's worth pointing out that that has been a discussion here uh for a longer time the US for all its support of Israel for its support of its military campaign for all the Diplomatic cover that the US has provided at the UN and the UN Security Council the fact that it stood by Israel uh in terms of helping it fend off attacks uh from Iran the US has been kind of like a passenger in this journey and it's been unable to press Iran into uh achieving certain kind of goals such as uh appearing um appearing more restrained or getting more humanitarian Aid uh into Gaza so prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was just here last week he met with Biden he met with Harris he spoke before Congress and the White House also made it clear then that what they wanted to see was uh netan Yahoo's full backing of this uh ceasefire hostage release deal he came and went without having given that backing and that clearly shows you that he was not pressured to do that but what everyone here is also aware of is that Benjamin Netanyahu more than anything is motivated by domestic concerns by domestic pressures uh his personal ambition perhaps his goal of staying in power and that is a square that Washington has not been able to Circle yeah and now let's talk about the fear the big fear is that the United States will be drawn into a wider war in the Middle East is there a sense in Washington tonight that that is indeed what could be happening now I mean there is an argument to be made that uh a wider regional conflict was happening already you have the houthi and the Red Sea you have Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Syria and these tensions between Israel and Hezbollah but of course uh the fear that uh this could motivate Iran and uh its proxies to uh exact a very harsh response of course and drag the us into a wider uh into an even deeper conflict of course uh that is a concern here now for now the White House is maintaining this line that a wider escalation uh is not necessarily inevitable uh John Kirby who uh whose uh quote we played there earlier in the show he also said that today but also worth noting that this is a region that is uh full uh where the US is uh is is very much represented the White House has been saying that it still sees a diplomatic solution as the way forward for a more peaceful and secure region but you can certainly tell that nerves are on edge here yeah yeah amazing though that they're they're taking the positive spin on this um we we'll see if that's where events indeed take us Janelle in Washington Janelle thanks for your reporting thank you
