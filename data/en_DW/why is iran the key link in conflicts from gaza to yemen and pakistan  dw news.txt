now the US and UK have carried out new joint strikes on houthi Targets in Yemen including on the capital sonar the Pentagon says they hit eight locations an underground storage site as well as locations associated with the group's missile and air surveillance capabilities it's the second time the two allies have coordinated to attack houthi Targets in Yemen the houthis had previously vowed to continue their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea British foreign minister David Cameron gave a statement on what prompted this latest round of air strikes have a listen since we last took action um 10 days ago there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the houthis in the Red Sea these attacks are illegal they unacceptable and what we've done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these taxs are sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warning with action and I'm pleased to welcome Sarah bazu bandi from the Giga Institute of Middle East studies in Hamburg welcome considering that we've seen uh these past strikes and they don't seem to have deterred the houthis do you think that these most recent strikes by the US and the UK can make a difference in deterring the houthis um thank you for having me good morning um unfortunately no the short answer is no um because when looking at the houthis and their actions in that region one needs to really reflect on the ideological framework that they are working within and their political project the ideological framework is that they are exactly like every other islamist radicalized movement that we've seen in that part of the world and globally in fact um they are after establishment of a worldwide Islamic caliphate with its capital being based in Jerusalem so they have multiple goals to um achieve um um most importantly is to destroy the state of Israel and um they believe that the path to achieve that ultimate holy goal is a longlasting war and they are prepared and they have shown that resilience and uh preparedness before that they are not going to um step down from their Ambitions their political project is also to establish a zi Shia ideologically um structured uh political establishment like they had for hundreds hundreds of years north of Yemen until 1960s when eventually they were dismantled so this temporarily um might contain the attacks but in the long run we're dealing with a very dangerous ideology and um it's it's very hard to contain it and we should say that Iran also plays an important geopolitical role here what kind of reaction do you think that we might see from tan is a widening of the conflict in its interest at the moment uh yes Iran has been investing uh for a very long time in houthis and trying to align um them and their Ambitions with its own strategic Ambitions and with its own in fact ideological Ambitions because let's not forget that one of the reason that brought these two uh together is um their their ideology and their World Vision and the way that they perceive the changes in the global framework need to be done in order to have a um ultimate utopian uh global system that they have in mind um Iran is an important supporter for for uh houthis um there have been various pieces of evidence leaked evidence that indicates that um Islamic Republic um revolutionary guards have been training um the houi forces they have they have bases to support and to consult with the houi forces inside Yemen they have been delivering arms and ammunitions to them uh so Iran is not going to also back up uh back down from its support for for the houis in fact this conflict is a god-given gift to the Iranian regime because um there is a lot of problems at home there is a lot of pressure specifically domestically economically socially Iran is going through a very dangerous pension and banking crisis both systems are on the verge of collapse and bankruptcy um and Co maintaining the public uh sentiment in this estate of anxiety whether Iran is going to enter into a war whether or not what's going to happen it's it's a very good way for the regime to to control the society as well yeah those domestic considerations of course very important too Sarah thank you and please stay with us I want to turn our Focus uh a little more to Iran's role in the conflict as we know following hamas's October 7th terrorist attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza violence has spread throughout the region from Israel's border with Lebanon to Iraq uh Syria and the Red Sea Iran really has been at the center of it and we know tan has been using its network of proxies to chip away at Israel and its main Ally the United States let's see if we can take a closer look Israeli troops on the advance footage from Israel's military shows its forces fighting in the Gaza Strip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly framed this as a struggle between Israel and Iran which backs Hamas Israel has long been locked in a shadow war with Tran conducting covert strikes and targeted killings it was believed to have been behind this strike in Damascus at the weekend but Netanyahu says his country is now in direct conflict with Iran who says we're not attacking Iran we are attacking it Iran is the head of the octopus and you can see its tentacles all around Iran backs a network of militant groups throughout the Middle East among their goals to undermine Israel and drive out American influence these proxies have become more active following the October 7th Terror attacks in Lebanon Tran supports and arms Hezbollah seen by some countries as a terrorist organization its Fighters fire Rockets into Israel on an almost daily basis Israel is returning fire these images released by the Israeli Army but while the situation here at the border is tense so far each side has been careful to avoid an escalation Iran also arms the huis an armed group in Yemen Civil War which has seized control of large parts of the country including the capital SAR now the hoies are attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea they released this video showing them bard boing and seizing a cargo vessel they say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians Yemen is Bravely standing against Israel thank God for your beautiful efforts Brave Mighty and proud Yemen is defending the oppressed and strong Palestinian people the United States and others have sent warships to the region and launch strikes on Hoy targets another front is in Iraq and Syria where Iran appear is to be encouraging its militias to attack US military bases Washington has responded with its own strikes Israel's president is calling for a global response to these challenges there is an Empire of evil emanating from tan they have proxies all over the region quietly lurking to undermine any peace process and any stability of the world and that is exactly what we are seeing and they have to be faith by a very strong Coalition for the moment Gaza is the most active front in Israel's cold war with Iran but Tan's proxies are becoming more heavily involved each strike and Counter Strike could bring the sides closer to open conflict so we have Sarah bazuband from the Giga Institute of Middle East studies uh still with us and we just heard in that report there a little bit of context about Iran's proxies about this so-called axis of resistance and uh Sarah I'd like to get your view I mean when we're looking at groups like Hamas and Hezbollah how much is Iran really calling the shots here um Iran tends to detach itself and this if you look at the speeches of by the Supreme Leader by other senior um officials inside Iran they praise their actions but they don't they don't really take responsibility they don't share responsibility but in fact we know that for decades these groups have been supported by Iran in 2018 the US Treasury and is did a calculation and estimate of how much Iran is uh injecting investing financially in only one group Hezbollah um nearly $1 billion dollar in that one single year was invested by Iran in hisbah paid by Iran directly to hisbah in forms so you cannot have a a group that you support and invest this amount of money in them without having the right to demand or to influence their decision so that is my personal opinion there is a degree of influence there is a degree of manipulation and control by Iran in exchange of f to the very least in exchange of financial incentives um and yes of course it's very hard to to exactly measure how how much the extent of this influence is but there is undoubtedly a very strong influence by Iran over these groups and we spoke a little bit earlier about the domestic situation inside Iran I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about how what's going on there is affecting Iran's uh foreign policy and if there's any chance that uh frictions within Iran itself could ultimately lead to a world in which we see um teron seeking to to normalize relations with Israel in the way that we have seen many Muslim majority countries seek to do um unfortunately to go to your qu last question about normalization I don't have really hope in the current uh political Elite inside Iran to have any desire for normalization that is against their DNA this is not um this has doesn't have any space in their political imagination in their geostrategic imaginations in their aspirations they see themselves more in line with countries like China and Russia and their New World Views and their uh New World Order narrative in which the US power is undermined um multiple other strong powers are rising and that new world order creates the space for Middle powers like Iran to jump into a set power to establish themselves and project themselves as a more powerful player at the global level so this is very much what the current uh political Elite inside Iran really desire to Aspire to um the situation inside Iran for the people is extremely dire the inflation is crushing as I mentioned earlier the Pension funds crisis the banking crisis Iran has 17 Pension funds according to the government's reports nearly um 90% of these funds are are bankrupt so they are only paying their pensioners with the cash injections from the government budget so for how long the government can last this really nobody knows but it the fact is that with the current economic situation they're alienating the people they're alienating various interest groups within the elite and the current Elite has no desire to um align itself with with normalizing with the vest unfortunately well Sarah thank you so much for sharing your insights with us that is Sarah bazu bandi from the Giga Institute of Middle East studies appreciate your time thanks gido Steinberg is a Middle East expert at the German Institute for international and security Affairs here in Berlin he joins us now good to see you gido uh what do you think is behind this growing involvement of Iran's proxies I mean is this only about the war in Gaza no it's uh more about Iran itself U Iran's aim is is uh is to gain heany in the region and there are two main obstacles in its way one is Israel uh small country but a nuclear power and secondly it's the United States and its military presence and therefore it uses the opportunity uh to show that it can hit Israeli and American targets all all over the area in Iraq in Syria in South from South Lebanon in Gaza uh and in Yemen but it wants it does not want a full-blown conflict right now uh I believe because it thinks it might be too weak at the moment okay so obviously trying to strike the balance do you think the Islamic Republic will take further action then and if yes what might that look like well the Islamic Republic already does take further action and there is always um the the danger of escalation for the time being it mainly relies on the strikes by its proxies hisbah in Lebanon the houis in Yemen Shia militias in in Iraq and Syria uh but I believe that it already plans attacks on Israeli and possibly Jewish targets abroad simply because the leadership of the Islamic Republic is under pressure by its own hardliners um to react on what has happened in recent weeks and months especially the direct attacks by Israel on its Personnel leading Personnel of the uh revolutionary guards in Syria okay so the benefit then for Iran if this conflict spreads out further or even if there is an allout War across the Middle East what is that benefit exactly well Iran for the time being does not want this major conflict it simply wants to show the Israelis the sis and the Americans that it is able to hit targets all over the the Middle East whenever it wants that it is a major power in the region it does not want a major escalation simply because its own weak weaknesses in the country we have seen that in early January the major terrorist attack in kman on the fourth of that month it mainly fears a Revival of the protest movement in the country not so much the women in tan but the protests in the uh in the Border areas in Kurdistan in beluchistan and in husan where big minorities live and that is part of the reason why the Islamic Republic does not want a major escalation right now okay and just clarify clarify for us again how has Iran's Regional policy shifted since the start of the war in Gaza well it has shifted in so far as it has mobilized uh virtually all of its proxies all of its proxies I would say in in in the whole region it has not shifted in so far as from the beginning Iran did not want a major conf confrontation but it has it has ordered its proxies to step up attacks that was first hisbah in Lebanon which attacked Israel early on in the war from uh from from Southern Lebanon um it has ordered more than 100 attacks by Shia militias um on American Targets in Iraq and Syria and most recently um it has well it has ordered the houthis uh to attack um um to attack maritim traffic in in the Red Sea it's a dangerous policy but it's not a policy designed uh to lead a major war against the United States the leadership in tan is well aware that uh that it could lose uh such a kind of war and it could lose its power in the country it is mainly motivated by its desire to stay in power in tan G Steinberg Middle East expert from the German Institute for international and security Affairs gido thanks so much for your insights and for more on this we can cross straight to our correspondent in London Berget Mass uh Berget what else uh do we know about these most most recent attacks by the US and the UK we have a pentagon statement and that says that eight Targets in Yemen were hit with what they call precis Precision strikes um they also say that it's aimed at underground storage and at missile and surveillance capabilities now when it comes to the justification for these strikes you've already heard the UK foreign secretary David Cameron he further flashed out in a statement that he does not believe the houthi narrative that this is all in retaliation to the war in Gaza and he bemon that hthi um had have indiscriminately targeted shipping so the narrative overall from the US and the UK and the general Coalition that are um Behind These strikes is this is to protect international shipping to protect um the Red Sea that's so vital for global trade this is the second time that the US and UK have conducted these coordinated military strikes against the houthis is there support for these attacks generally in the UK it's it's interesting a recent poll did show that there was overall support by the British public and also there is generally cross-party support um when it comes to to the the conflict in the Middle East and also um about these these attacks there is a little bit of dis quiet that the opposition leader wasn't briefed before these strikes but generally there is cross- Party Support that doesn't mean that there aren't also critical voices on the left of the labor party mainly but also by some experts in the reg region so they say that overall there should be a strategy of deescalation um as one researcher put it with a with a ceasefire in Gaza at the heart of this deescalation strategy and I would say that the overall support for the strikes um by the British public doesn't mean that there isn't also an anxiety uh about the the conflict in the Middle East of course but also about these strikes so there is of course the risk of of that this this could um generally escalate the conflict and this is something that I think the British people are aware of bur thanks so much for bringing us up to date that's DW's burget mass in
