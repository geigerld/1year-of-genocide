an Israeli delegation has arrived in Cairo Egypt ahead of peace talks aimed at ending 10 months of war in Gaza negotiations are set to resume Saturday us Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage a deal that would pause the fighting and free the remaining hostages held by Hamas which you may remember committed the October 7th Terror attacks in Israel meanwhile Israel has been keeping up its attacks in Gaza Palestinian Health officials say at least 27 people have been killed there in the last day packing up their lives again as Israel Issues new evacuation orders for these garans uprooted once more in Han Yunis life seems hopeless the Israeli Army tells us to evacuate from one area to another and this is our situation in Gaza there's no hope in the negotiations even with Qatar and the Egyptians there's no hope their role is that of mediators not pressuring Israel and here we are the civilians paying the price Palestinian Health officials say Israeli attacks have killed dozens more people throughout the strip in the last day the house was blown up and everyone inside children men women it's as if the house had never been built it's like it never existed prayers for any ceasefire to save civilian lives go unanswered many gazans are exhausted by suffering and desperate for an end to the fighting I'm begging them to reach an agreement we're being slaughtered Israel is fighting for its people and Hamas is fighting for its people enough is enough they both need to make concessions our children are gone how can we return to our homes without our children both Hamas and Israel accuse the other of blocking any potential truce control of gaza's border with Egypt an area known as the Philadelphia Corridor remains a red line for Israel the Philadelphia Corridor the border between Egypt and Israel the Hamas Lifeline of terrorist smuggling is so crucial so report that the Prime Minister has agreed that Israel will withdraw from the Philadelphia uh Corridor are incorrect Israel says its attacks are the best way to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages taken in the October 7th terrorist attacks but with Gaza already in Ruins and tens of thousands of civilians dead the Palestinian militant group still hasn't been broken DW correspondent Felix tomsu joins me now from Jerusalem Felix what more do we know at this point um that's an interesting question because at the moment we were up until I would say two hours ago we were all under the impression that those talks are not going to take place at all we've heard reports yesterday saying that the talks are on the brink of collapse according to uh us sources uh now just an hour ago Israeli media have been reporting that uh the Israeli negotiations team is currently in Cairo with the idea of negotiating um Sol or finding a solution to uh some of the core issues um this meeting on Saturday which uh many people hold their hopes on is not yet final it's not yet sure that it's going to take place but the Israeli cabinet uh is to meet tonight and um it's very likely that we will know more after this Israeli cabinet meeting we do know that one of the main sticking points in the ceasefire talks has been and remains control over the Gaza Egypt border that Israel wants to maintain um is there any update on that tonight indeed uh some of the reports coming out uh in Israel tonight uh say that the Israeli negotiation team has returned to Egypt has returned to the negotiations with the mediators with an uh upto-date offer when it comes to the uh Israeli presence in the so-called Philadelphia uh area on the border between Gaza and Egypt um this Corridor is basically at the core of the differences between both sides whereas um where we have Israel wanting to keep their presence there um Israel argues that this is a main uh Lifeline of uh smuggling goods for Hamas whereas Hamas insists on no Israeli presence there uh the current offer according to sources in Israel um is that Israel will evacuate its forces only in the second phase of the deal meaning after 40 something days um it's going to be interesting how this pans out but it needs to be said at the moment we don't know whether Hamas is going to take place we don't know what Hamas thinks of this offer um and negotiations are in a very very critical point yeah you can say that again DW correspondent Felix Thomson with the latest from Jerusalem Felix thank you
