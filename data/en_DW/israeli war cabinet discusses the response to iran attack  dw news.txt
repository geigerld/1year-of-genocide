Israel is considering how to respond to Iran's attack Israeli War cabinet has met twice since Saturday's aerial assault but the government has yet to announce any definite course of action military Chief leftenant General hery halevi has promised that Iran's aggression will be met with a response but Israeli media are reporting that officials are looking for a calibrated response that will hurt Iran without triggering allout war world leaders have repeatedly called for restraint here's a look at a long Shadow war that has come out into the open with Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend Israel's government faces pressure from within the country to strike back at Teran forcefully to maintain deterrence the highest risk and most drastic step Israel could take would be to strike at Iran's nuclear program that could quickly lead to a major escalation of the conflict Israel's sup expected to have attacked Iran's uranium enrichment facilities before including in 2010 with a computer virus program that set Iran's nuclear program back years but never officially acknowledged it a step down in intensity would be air strikes on Iran's oil facilities military airports or other military facilities attacking oil targets might significantly rattle the world economy and attacks on Iran's military could could force tyan to feel like it had to respond again tit fortat attacks that could lead to a regional war in both cases there are military and technical issues Israel's stock of longrange ballistic missiles is low and fighter jets would face a long and complicated journey to their targets raising the risk to Israel even further a third option is no official public reaction but to instead take the shadow War back into the Shadows Israel suspected to have assassinated multiple Iranian officials and nuclear researchers over the past decade it also regularly strikes at Iranian proxies in Syria and Lebanon pushing retaliation into this gray area without attacking Iranian soil would likely allow Israel to avoid the escalation its allies like the US have been trying hard to contain let's consider this with Gerald firin who is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Philadelphia uh welcome back to DW how do you read where this conflict is now tit fat and honor satisfied on both sides or has the escalation ratchet been tightened even [Music] further it's a it's a pleasure to be back with you I I think that it's a little bit uh hard to see at this point uh I think that the Iranian statement after their attacks was that they've now satisfied their uh their requirement to uh to respond to the Israeli attack on the uh on the consulate uh and now it's the ball Israeli in back in the Israeli Court uh we know what President Biden is counseling uh he's said it publicly that he has advised uh prime minister Netanyahu uh to to take this opportunity to declare Victory and go home if you will but uh but it's not clear that the Israelis will take that wise advice and and write it down and if they don't then once again you're in a situation where uh it would be easy to get into a as you said a tit fortat scenario so if Israel chooses then to respond just looking at the last 6 months um since October in its war against Hamas Israel hasn't achieved its stated goals of destroying Hamas and rescuing the hostages so would a war against a state like Iran be easier or harder for Israel to prosecute and win now the Israelis have no capacity to prosecute a war against Iran without the direct involvement of the United States and President Biden has said that we have absolutely no interest or desire uh to uh to partner with uh with Israel on such a mission uh and even for the US I think that any kind of full military assault on Iran would be a very questionable uh Pro program process so uh so the Israelis uh can certainly uh do something that will sting Iran uh but they cannot go beyond that you think that would be a step too far for the United States because you know the world was pretty shocked about three weeks ago when Benjamin Netanyahu um responded to U us advice against going into Rafa by saying um we will uh go in with or without us support you think this is a completely another level entirely well uh again I I think that there's a difference between uh Netanyahu ignoring us advice uh a strong us views which was certainly the casee with Rafa and I would note that that despite his rhetoric Netanyahu has not taken that step yet uh but uh but again uh without the active involvement of the United States uh there is no Iran uh you know prospect that Netanyahu has except for relatively minor strik so uh so there's a difference between uh ignoring us guidance uh and trying to do something that is beyond his capability without the US engagement what should we make of the fact that this is the first time Iran has attacked Israel directly rather than through uh proxies what do you think brought about this change well I think it's a reflection of the fact that Israel hit a uh an Iranian diplomatic facility directly and in the past of course uh uh there was a degree of of Separation if you will an arms length Association so the Israelis might might hit a a Syrian Target or a Lebanese Target but not uh an Iranian uh you know a clearly marked Iranian facility uh and I think that on that basis the Iranians felt that they needed to respond in like uh in like way that uh that since the Israelis had crossed a red line for them they needed to cross a red line for Israel brief word about sort of how this affects domestic Israeli politics Benjamin netanyahu's fragile coalition government was facing criticism at home for its handling of this war and for not getting the hostages back and being criticized abroad for the mounting death toll and the humanitarian disaster it's causing does this Iranian attack change any of that I think in the short term uh of course it's taken people's attention away from uh the underlying issues in Gaza humanitarian situation the you know the uh the military operations uh but I don't think that's a a long-term change I think that once the U the issue of Iran Fades uh that that the focus will come back onto what's going on inside of Gaza and popular support will will return to a focus on that thank you for that that assessment very clear Gerald firin from the Middle East Institute in Philadelphia well I asked a Middle East analyst Aaron David Miller from the carnegi Endowment for International Peace for his thoughts on Israel's likely next move I think there will be a response U even though the Iranian strikes um on Saturday night caused very little damage uh a new president was set a new threshold was crossed new rules were established uh and I think the Israelis simply cannot afford to allow this to go uh unchallenged uh this was the first time in 33 years that another state uh 1991 it was Saddam Hussein who launched 43 scud missiles at is so I think there will be an isra an Israeli response but the reality is um I think your your report uh covered several of the baskets the timing of this the scale of it the intensity of it I think think uh is almost impossible to predict and you pointed out quite correctly that it's conceivable that the um response will be covert um I suspect it'll be over but um uh and most likely I would think against conventional military facilities right and so are we therefore in an inevitable upward spiral of tensions uh from this point or does at some stage do do does each side peer over the the the uh the The Edge and look into the abyss and say all right that's it that's enough well I mean I I would say to you that even if you get through this current phase which is really quite extraordinary the strategic competition between Israel and Iran is not going to end um none of the problems that fuel this relationship Iran's efforts to push US military out of uh out of the region the fact that Iran is now a nuclear weapons threshold State they have all the elements um uh to make a a deliverable nuclear nuclear device should they decide to weaponize and uh their efforts to influence Regional developments through their proxies none of this is going to be solved and the Israelis clearly are are going to try to establish reestablish some measure measure of deterrence um so I I I think no it is not inevitable in fact if I had to make a prediction I would say that we are not headed toward what you and I would describe as a regional war and let's be clear that would almost invariably trigger hezbollah's uh inventory of high trajectory weapons which frankly unlike drones roughly takes 12 to 15 minutes for cruise missiles to travel the distance from Iran to Israel has balas got presan gued Munitions that could cover most of the uh most of Israel and there we're talking about minutes so I think the Israelis want to avoid that um but it remains to be seen whether or not they can find a way basically to do what Iran did which presumably is to calculate a response between making this qualitatively and quantitatively different than anything the Iranians have done before on one hand but not courting or triggering um a a response that would escalate into a regional confrontation and so how is Saturday's attack likely to affect any hostage deal between Israel and Hamas which of course is part of Iran's so-called axis of resistance yeah poorly I'm afraid uh I think that Hamas y who is in some tunnel somewhere meters below ground in kanun or maybe according to Palestinian sources maybe even in a tunnel tunnel infrastructure in Egypt um I think sinir is under no pressure no real urgency the Israelis have basically wound down their ground campaign uh they've begun to facilitate under us pressure more humanitarian assistance that's important for Hamas to maintain the postconflict constituency among Palestinians uh and I think senoir understands that his insurance policy to actually survive this uh depends on retaining H so I think um and certainly the is strike and you get an Israeli Counter Strike Hamas has no interest whatsoever they want to see this play out they wanted on October 7 to Spur Regional confr confrontation and conflict if possible so they're not under pressure and frankly the Neto government as well uh I think isn't in isn't in a hurry either despite the pressure from understandable pressure from aage families uh to release them okay thank you for uh walking us through that so clearly Aaron David Miller from the Cari Endowment for International Peace thank you so much thank you well here in Germany the government has strongly condemned Iran's attack on Israel but Chancellor Olaf Schultz has joined other European leaders in calling on Israel to exercise restraint amid growing concerns of a wider conflict in the region German Chancellor Olaf Schultz is on a high-profile State visit to China but now that has been overshadowed by the risk of a large scale escalation in the Middle East Schultz strongly condemned Iran's air strikes this was a very brutal Iranian attack it was unprecedented and uh it was the first time that they used missiles to go directly against the Israeli State this is unacceptable but echoing other Western calls for caution the chancellor also urged Israel to deescalate the situation back in Germany the opposition Christian democrats said Berlin should be ready to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to support for Israel if Israel is asking for armed and AR Armament and ammunition from Germany Germany should stay to its commitment and deliver weapons to Israel to make sure that Israel is able to defend itself Germans are watching developments in the region with concern of course you worry about it but I try not to think about it too much they're all stubborn somewhere along the line they can't manage to sit around a table and say this is how we're going to do it it's sad but unfortunately that's how it is at the moment but while diplomatic efforts to resolve Israel's war with Hamas might have dropped from the headlines the German government says one of its top priorities is to ensure that the tensions between Iran and Israel don't escalate into a new war
