Israel's Army Chief hatti Hali has pledged to respond to Iran's reprisal attack at the weekend the government's War cabinet met on Monday again there's been no announcement of any definite action but hevi says Iran will face consequences we are closely assessing the situation we remain at our highest level of Readiness Iran will face the consequences for its actions we will choose our response accordingly the IDF remains ready to counter any threat from Iran and its Terror proxies as we continue our mission to defend the state of is according to Media reports commanders are seeking a response that will hurt Iran without triggering a wider War there are international calls for restraint here's a look at some of the options a long Shadow war that has come out into the open with Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend Israel's government faces pressure from within the country to strike back at Teran forcefully to maintain deterrence the highest risk and most drastic step Israel could take would be to strike at Iran's nuclear program that could quickly lead to a major escalation of the conflict Israel suspected to have attacked Iran's uranium enrichment facilities before including in 2010 with a computer virus program that set Iran's nuclear program back years but never officially acknowledged it a step down in intensity would be air strikes on Iran's oil facilities military airports or other military facilities attacking oil targets might significantly rattle the world economy and attacks on Iran's military could force tyan to feel like it had to respond again and tit fortat attacks that could lead to a regional war in both cases there are military and technical issues Israel's stock of long range ballistic missiles is low and fighter jets would face a long and complicated journey to their targets raising the risk to Israel even further a third option is no official public reaction but to instead take the shadow War back back into the Shadows Israel suspected to have assassinated multiple Iranian officials and nuclear researchers over the past decade it also regularly strikes at Iranian proxies in Syria and Lebanon pushing retaliation into this gray area without attacking Iranian soil would likely allow Israel to avoid the escalation its allies like the US have been trying hard to contain j see Mel is an associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at chattam House of british-based Think Tank I asked him if this is going to be the start of a tit forat escalation good morning hopefully not but yes Israel committed itself to to respond the way that Iran committed itself to respond to Israeli attack in in Damascus and there there is the fear of a very of a slippery slope of of did for that but we you need to pay attention to the wording the wording doesn't say that it has to be immediately it doesn't seem that you know the the scope of it so there leaves enough room for diplomatic efforts at least for now but Israel allies to reassure Israel of its DET turn without the need to retaliate at least not to retaliate in a way that will drag the the the Middle East into into a regional War this is the real danger but you know there there is as every country in a situation of of War there is a bank of of of targets with the assessment of what might lead to to low intensity response and what to to much more major response and this is a calculation that the is government needs to to take into account but okay actually it's in a much better strategic situation today that it was three days ago you can definitely say that uh but you are still talking about the dangers of a Regional War still the us one of uh Israel's biggest supporters and uh one of the biggest players in supporting uh Israel during this attack from Iran uh which was supposedly in response to an alleged Israel attack on that uh Iranian Consulate in Syria um what happens next because the US is saying that it won't join in any retaliation attack now from Israel on Iran which opens up Israel to to a range of danger and threat I think the coordination on Saturday Sunday night showed that the United States as is the UK and and where and and France as well not to mention some some Sunni countries in in in the Middle East were behind Israel in trying to support to support it in defending it its border but this is not guaranteed if Israel is retaliating in in a way that endanger them one of the reason that they supported Israel and and participated in this operation on protecting in protecting Israel because this was a tack on Israel and hurting Israel badly goes against their interest but retaliation with Israel and then starting this kind of t for might endanger them and they are not interested so again this is something that Israel should should calculate sometimes showing restraint actually taking their time because a Iran didn't manage to to cause great damage B it actually re it United the front against it so Israel can actually take time and reconsider it next move but what has happened now to deterrence um Israel's prime minister was harshly criticized by the opposition leader yesterday who said netanyahu's government was responsible for leading to total loss of Israeli deterrence in the wake of this precedented Iranian attack well the the very the very fact that Iran D to launch that an attack shows that the ter was damaged but has a lot to do with the way that Benjamin nany and his irresponsible government is governing Israel for nearly a year and a half now it's it create friction within the country it damaged the unity within not only the conscript but within the military the reservists many of them that refuse that refuse to volunteer at least until October 7 in a country that goes on the path of dictatorship and instead of of democracy so when Mr La talks about this he actually as much talks about Internal Affairs within within Israel the inability to stop Hamas on October 7 and the way that Israel a conducts the war in in Gaza and alienating many of its of of of its friends and allies across the world Jessie Bebe thank you very much for joining us great to get your insights thank you DW correspondent amanf is following events in Jerusalem we saw some of the options there another of course is deescalation any signs of that well is Israel's war cabinet uh ended it uh meeting yesterday Monday saying that they were going to plan a forceful Counterattack uh but one that was designed not uh to spark a regional War uh We've also heard Benyamin Netanyahu the prime minister of Israel say that uh any Counterattack would be calculated and would not come from the gut so it would not be an emotional attack it would be a very calculated attack and all of this language is designed to reassure partners and people within Israel that there will will not be a wider war that this will deescalate the problem here is that Partners such as the US and also other International actors such as the UN and China urging Israel not to respond at all that's because don't forget uh the Iranian attack was a response to an alleged Israeli attack on a Embassy complex in Damascus that belonged to Iran uh so Iran's attack over the weekend was seen as an attempt uh to put the matter to rest at least by Iran and us seems to be convinced of this as well so uh what Israel's version of deescalation is may not be Iran's and that could spark a regional War anyway Ian what about the timing of a response well the war cabinet is set to meet again today Tuesday so that signals that there is not going to be an immediate response uh also the home front rules which are the restrictions on public Gatherings and things like this which came right before uh Iran's attack have not been put in place the they're they have been lifted uh so that also signals that we won't see anything in the uh next day or so uh but we'll we'll have to wait and see about that what pressure is the prime minister facing to order a Counterattack well he's facing serious pressure from within his government that's because he's made a coalition with farri groups uh and who have urged an immediate attack on Iran uh one that would go crazy uh basically um there are elements within his government who are seeking a regional War they want to attack Iran and knock out its nuclear capabilities before it has a nuclear weapon that could strike Iran and want to take advantage of this moment but it's the Israeli War cabinet that's going to make a decision about this Counterattack and uh that contains centrists um like uh uh uh Benny Gant who is not from netanyahu's party and may be urging Netanyahu to show more restraint than he would otherwise following developments for us from Jerusalem
