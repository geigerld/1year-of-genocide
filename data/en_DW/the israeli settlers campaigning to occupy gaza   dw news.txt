we're just a few kilometers away from Israel's border with Gaza where Hamas burst through and carried out the October 7th Terror attacks these Israeli families are gathering here because they want to go and live in Gaza which they sometimes called G katif even as War continues to bring death and destruction to Palestinians in the strip their signs read only settlements will bring security and conquering settling winning you look in the Torah and you see very simple the answer there you know that Israel belongs to the Jews and Gaza is Israel doesn't mean that you're not allowed to live here if you're not Jewish no but at the same time it belongs to the Jews the plan this evening was to drive along the border with Gaza a symbolic return but Heavy Rain forced organizers to move everyone indoors one of those organizers is Daniela Vice the 78-year-old has been involved in establishing settlements in the Israeli occupied West Bank for decades these settlements often displace Palestinians and are illegal under international law she's been arrested numerous times but sees her unof approach as more efficient than anything parliamentarians could do no no member of can do what I do no member people look for purpose and what I give them is the love of our homeland and this is they will why they will follow me everywhere now Vice says she's using her pressure group Nala to work towards settling Gaza and she says it's a realistic aim we publicized um the fact that Nala movement is organizing groups of families to settle the entire area of Gaza and people registered hundreds of families the Arabs of Gaza will not stay in Gaza period this rally may seem small but it has outsized connections their demands have been echoed by two farri ministers in Benjamin netanyahu's government one of them is finance minister Bal smotrich often described as an ally of Vice they live in the same occupied West Bank settlement the other is national security minister itamar benav who recently called for a return to gush katif the main block of Israeli settlements that once existed in the Gaza Strip the defense minister disagrees and Netanyahu says a return to gush katif is unrealistic but his government has not laid out an official plan for gaza's future NOA turulski is an independent journalist who's been covering Netanyahu for most of her career she says even though the Prime Minister has given bangir and smartr unprecedented power resettling Gaza is different you can't just occupy territory because the Prime Minister wants to it has to be an entire cabinet decision has to be voted on in Parliament he hasn't said a word to them because he needs them in order to stay in power but what we see is that he lets them keep talking about it he lets them make this be a subject in the public space even when this causes Israel measurable and significant harm in the on the global stage that harm condemnation from Israel's top allies the US and Germany Egypt and Jordan which have long-standing relations and peace treaties with Israel have ruled out resettling Palestinians on their territory and for Palestinian themselves Israeli discussions about uprooting them from their homes brings back memories of 1948 when over 700,000 were forced to flee in the war fought over Israel's establishment despite International resistance to a return of Israeli settlements in Gaza NOA tarnopolski says the ministers pushing the idea shouldn't be ignored I think we're talking about maybe a few thousand people who are Fringe figures led by opportunist IC marginal extremists who think that they can take advantage of this moment I I think it's important to cover them because they do have power right now because they're sitting in government and yet Fringe ideas discussed by demonstrators here in a basement can also be found in wider Society a survey conducted by the he University found 33% of respondents in favor of annexing and resettling Gaza another one by Israeli Channel 12 showed 44% of respondents in favor of reestablishing settlements in the strip that survey found the figure jumped to 66% among netanyahu's supporters calls for a Jewish return to Gaza or gush katif are not new in Israel but they have been getting louder since the October 7th attacks to understand the thinking Behind these calls we have to look at Israel's recent history in the Gaza strip a history laid out here at the gush katif Museum in Jerusalem in 1967 at the end of The Six Day War Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and other territories almost 400,000 Palestinians lived there over half of whom were refugees from elsewhere soon Israeli started building settlements the largest block of which was called gush katif it was against international law to be there but museum guide avner Franklin believes the settlers made a positive impact they turned the place from a desert into a Garden of Eden this was a picture taken about 10 or 15 years later of the same place gazin felt otherwise and violence in the strip escalated it became unsustainable for Israel to keep the settlers there in 2004 the Israeli government led by prime minister Ariel shaon decided to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza and Evacuate the more than 8,000 settlers living there the decision divided Israeli Society for and against resistance to the evacuation culminated in 2005 with scenes like these Israeli police officers and soldiers forcibly removing settlers from their homes data itaki lived in gush katif for 21 years it was a completely betrayed Ariel Shon he came many times and he said he would go down to Raam to the border with Egypt and say the only way to protect the south of Israel is having the civilians in gush katif it was crime against the security of the state of Israel against valume of of Zionism values of Zionism and against the people there were there but leaving Gaza did not usher in an era of calm almost a soon as the settlers were gone Hamas and Gaza intensified rocket attacks on Israel Israel continued to control access to the territory and life for civilians there kept getting worse the next almost two decades were marked by Wars and conflict that culminated in the terror of October 7th 2023 it was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust almost 1,200 people were killed 4,834 injured and over 200 200 were kidnapped and taken to Gaza the community's hardest hit were the kutum right next to Gaza the community daa says leftwing people living there had strongly believed that the 2005 disengagement would bring peace so the Arabs were cheering when they took us into the buses and then when the buses went out the Kim were standing there and cheering and they were very happy when they took us out out from the Gaza region and we told him you were the you'll pray the pay the price and you know I'm not happy I was right data wants to return to where her house in Gaza once stood and thinks others should join her the Palestinians who live there are not her concern we give a solution to the Israelis that today have to flee from their homes because of the war Egypt can give a solution to the people from Gaza that flee from their homes because of the war you know give them a solution they're our enemy I can't give them a solution here in Israel's parliament the knesset some Representatives agreed that having Israeli civilian and Military presence in Gaza had kept a lid on violence and that a return would increase security oh hatal is a concent member from Finance Minister betel smc's Ultra nationalist party religious Zionism we have to make sure that these things will not happen again so we have to control the area and again in order to control the area we have to have the Israeli Civic presence in these areas he's himself a settler living in the occupied West Bank which he refers to with its Biblical name Judea and Samaria why do civilians have to be there and live in um sometimes very dangerous for them environments when the state should be the one securing borders Israel is a beacon of peace and democracy in the Middle East it's true we decided to live in this region which is uh uh we have a many neighbors who does not want us to be here I'm talking about Gaza specifically if he put if you put civilians there that's the same thing that's I live in a frat it's the same we are I'm threatened by Palestinians in what in Judea and Samaria in the Arab cities of of the Palestinian Authority each and every day why they don't have the same capabilities like Hamas just because of one thing because Israel is security have the security control of the area and have the Civic presence with settlements with Jewish villages in Jude and Samaria which are protecting uh Tel Aviv which are protecting karaba and all the cities the the Israeli cities we have to do the same thing in Gaza the UN says settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has reached unprecedented levels since October 7th the Palestinian Authority which governs parts of the occupied West Bank recognizes the state of Israel unlike Hamas and Gaza which like Iran and Lebanon doesn't a hotel says settlements on Palestinian territory would send a message to the whole region to all the enemies that we having in this neighborhood telling them that if you're killing Israelis if you're killing babies if you're raping women you will pay price that you consider as something that is for you a heavy price and that's land and that's land the only price is land now I think the world also should support humanitarian evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza because it's for their own good when Palestinians when Palestinians hear that they think permanent displacement they don't think evacuation they think that they're being kicked out of their so I I offer something very simple let's just open the borders and we'll see who wants to stay and who wants to leave back at the Museum which was founded by a right-wing group involved in the campaign to remain in Gaza interest in gush kati's past and a possible Revival is growing tours are booked for months in advance avner tells me and t-shirts like these are high in demand it says let's go home we're going back to gush katif and people want to buy this today there's been a tremendous uh interest this manura once stood in a synagogue in Gaza this past Hanukkah the museum arranged for it to be taken back to Gaza for Israeli soldiers fighting there it was very very emotional and then they brought it back here and this is where it stays in the meantime it's on loan to us and when we go back to narim and we have our synagogue there we're going to put this back in the place that it came from Franklin and others here tell me living in Gaza or gush Ka is not only about security but something that God has promised to the Jewish people they see things like this a replica of a mosaic believed to be from the floor of a gazen synagogue dating back to the Byzantine era as proof that their Roots Run Deep there it's our connection it's our bond to the place you see the fact look we have for me the fact that we have a bond to the place a connection to the place that means a lot you know that it's mine of journalist noga tarnopolski says the campaign for a return to Gaza is not what most Israelis are concerned with in the aftermath of October 7th it is part of a very dangerous thing we're seeing which is this Chasm between what average Israeli citizens want and need and are scared of or are demanding and what their government is actually doing the US has repeatedly said it opposes any Israeli reoccupation of Gaza in his January 2024 visit to Israel US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said this on Notions of Palestinian displacement Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow they must not be pressed to leave Gaza blinkin said that genuine security for Israel requires a two-state solution meaning a Palestinian State alongside Israel that two-state solution is something Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected something he and Daniela Vice agree on her work now focuses on creating so-called outposts these are settlements which even the Israeli government considers illegal in the occupied West Bank creating facts on the ground ground which many in the International Community say should form the core of any future Palestinian state I'm so glad I'm not blinking because what he says is not is not smart there is no chance no chance whatsoever for two-state solution it seems that he takes some some paper and reads and someone forgot to tell him in the administration that it's not relevant and he keeps reading from it he I mean he he reiterates in my eyes in an embarrassing manner we uh uh um have now 800,000 Jews living in 250 settlements in Judean Samaria where will you put Mr blink and where will you put your two-state solution where are you going to do it in the West Bank settlers have often gotten government recognition for settlements they built illegally after the fact it's not government policy y to allow settlements in Gaza but Vice says she may not wait and may take a similar approach there what we are going to do and telling you secretly we are going to squat close to the border right now there is a border that uh prevents us from uh entering but maybe um the northern part of Gaza which is actually not under uh any uh formal sovereignty it's called the no man's land so maybe over there there will it will be easier so once we start uh then once there is an opening then there will be the second stage and the third stage it will happen in my lifetime okay this prime minister has a track record of giving these extremists things that nobody ever dreamed them or anyone even in their position in their office would have then why is it unrealistic uh or why should we not take their demands to reoccupy Gaza seriously because it seems that they have a very good track record of getting things done in this country so that's a very good question and the answer is a bit complex but it's a really good question so I want us to address it you mentioned natan's track record and what you're mentioning is a recent track record Nan's been prime minister for 15 16 years and his actual track record is one of stasis Netanyahu has been the guy who just tried to like keep the status quo and say I'm the hero for many of these years he's not himself particularly radical he's himself very self-interested he wants to preserve his own power and for many years the best way he saw to preserve power was simply let's keep everything on a kind of low heat everything will be okay what changed everything is that in 2019 he was indicted for very serious crimes of corruption and all of a sudden he began to perceive the state the institutions of State the police that investigated him the Judiciary that indicted him and that was putting him on trial he began to perceive them as his enemies this is the event that radicalized Netanyahu first of all against the institutions of state and secondly politically cuz the entire center of the Israeli political Arena took a step back from him didn't want to sit in government with an indicted criminal so he ended up becoming more and more dependent on these marginal figures many of whom themselves are criminals convicted criminals they didn't care if he's a crook or an indicted crook so he was radicalized on various levels so his track record in fact during the last year is extremely radical he returned to power December 29th 2022 and his first step was to attempt what he called a Judicial reform which in fact was uh what in Spanish we call an aogpe he attempted to take power of state and had he succeeded he would have had unfettered power and the questions that you ask would have been terrifying questions because had he succeeded he would have probably tried to issue orders that today remain illegal orders but it's unclear whether they would be still illegal and I think it's important to mention um netanyahu's attempted coup provoked massive protests in Israel massive uh millions of people protesting in a country of just 10 million Israelis are very um aware of the limits of the power power of their prime minister so that what really radicalized the Israeli public was in late March 2023 the defense minister made a statement a warning that he's obliged under the law to make as minister of defense and he said that if the government continued to purs pursue this judicial reform it was endangering National Security Netanyahu responded by firing him on the spot with immediate effect this sent I think half a million Israelis to the street that night why you may ask because Israelis know that if they don't have a defense minister who's independent that is the first step towards an authoritarian takeover Israelis were scared to death and Netanyahu was forced basically by public opposition to undo that firing and the reason I can have this conversation with you today and say netan never says no to these two radical ministers but de facto he can't really give them what they want is because the Israeli people stood up and stopped him and that is a remarkable
