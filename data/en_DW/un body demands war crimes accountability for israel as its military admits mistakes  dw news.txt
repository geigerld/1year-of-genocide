I'm CLA Richardson thank you so much for joining us we begin with breaking news Israel says it has dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for Monday's air strikes in Gaza that killed seven Aid workers Israel's military admitted a series of grave mistakes saying the soldiers mishandled critical information and violated the Army's Rules of Engagement we can get the very latest on this from DW's correspondent Tanya Kramer joining me now from Jerusalem Tanya what more we know about the results of this investigation well this report was just uh released by the military and they're basically saying that the forces uh they were riding there identified a uh Hamas gunman on one of the trucks where the uh World Central Kitchen uh Aid workers were at the time they were then uh um you know offloading uh the the aid from there and then uh turning back from this Warehouse in central Gaza now they say according to this report that they identified a gunman on an aid truck as they say and then at a later stage another gunman also at the warehouse and uh they say uh the IDF the Israeli military saying that they believe um that the forces believe that these uh two gunmen were in one of the three uh vehicles and they're talking about a misidentification they're talking about misclassification uh of uh the uh event and as you said two of the officers have been uh uh dismissed and three uh were reprimanded but a lot of the details are not really uh yet known there will be a lot of questions asked as this Convoy uh was hit uh with according to reports here at least three missiles there is also talk about a complete uh breakdown of the chain of command uh so we'll have to see whether this is an an answer you know for uh the World Central kit but also of course for the relatives and the eight workers community that is working in Gaza and now this comes as International pressure is mounting on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza the United Nations top human rights body has in fact just passed a resolution calling for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes in the Palestinian territory the Human Rights Council has also called for a halt in armed sales to Israel 28 countries voted in favor uh six including Germany the United States voted against and 13 abstained from the resolution it is the first time the UN body has taken a position on the war in Gaza so Tanya it really seems like International pressure on Israel is mounting by the day well that's quite right this is another another international organization and another resolution that has been adopted criticizing Israel's uh conduct of War we got a first reaction there from the Israeli Ambassador in Geneva that was distributed here by the foreign Ministry that said that the decision today a stain on the Human Rights Council and the United Nations uh in uh General uh they've been saying that Hamas is not mentioned and their role on October 7th uh that also reflects of course this very strained relationship between the United Nations and uh Israel as well uh but of course it is just another uh International or organization uh that is now uh criticizing Israel again amidst this really mounting as you said International a pressure further pushing uh Israel uh to change its conduct of war and among them also uh its closest allies in the United States that have also you know criticized isra and asked them to do more to protect civilians in Gaza given the high death tall and to do more uh to protect uh to bring in more Aid and also of course in this case to protect more Aid workers but we haven't really seen this translating into any significant changes uh for the population for the civilian population on the ground there in Gaza now in the six months uh of this war on the subject of Aid Israel has also now announced the temporary opening of more Aid routs into Gaza what more can you tell us about that well yeah this is uh quite a significant uh development because eight organization ations and the United Nations have called for weeks to open another uh land uh Crossing to get eight uh more directly into especially Northern Gaza where the population is really in a critical situation as the United Nations have said on the brink of famine and this decision came after what was described here in the Israeli media after a 10's phone call between uh the US President Joe Biden and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that they will uh open at least temporarily uh the AIS Crossing that is a Crossing in the north of Gaza it used to be more a pedestrian Crossing also uh there were some cars going through uh but again it is still to see how the logistic of all of this will be uh how many trucks will go in there when this will happen and we heard the uh US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin also saying that the the test will be uh you know uh the the reality test with what will happen and that they will watch it very close what Israel will do in this regard Tanya thank you as always for bringing us up to speed that is Tanya Kramer in
