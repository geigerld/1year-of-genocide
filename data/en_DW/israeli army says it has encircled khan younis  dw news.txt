the United Nations says that people Sheltering in its training facility in the south of the Gaza Strip have been ordered to leave by the Israeli Army by Friday afternoon for their own safety that is the warning comes a day after at least 12 people were killed when tank fire hit the shelter in Kanan Yunis over 25,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive against Hamas which committed the worst ever terror attack against Israel on October 7th of last [Applause] year families Rush from the fighting in gaza's South Desperately Seeking safety as gunfire rattles in the distance one mother pushes her sick son on a hospital bead for this family it's their third time being forced to move it's like this every time they say Israel has previously told people to move to the south of the Gaza Strip which is now the scene of intense fighting a reported tank attack on a un facility killed at least 13 people and injured dozens around 70,000 people are estimated to be Sheltering in or around the complex Israel has only now warned them to leave now in terms of how realistic it is to ask up to 70,000 people to evacuate in less than 24 hours it is extremely unrealistic to expect all these people to be able to truly leave while the active fighting is still happening and to leave safely hospitals in the area are overwhelmed and struggling to provide basic care with many of the injured unable to to even get to them for help there are three main hospitals in hunas they're all en circled currently so the the the nas Al AA and alal these are the main hospitals in kanun and it's extremely difficult to access them and in fact it's extremely difficult to access that part of West hunas anyway Israel believes senior Hamas officials and Israeli hostages are in tunnels under Han Yunis thousands of people are now trying to leave the city with many heading to nearby Rafa joining the more than 1 million displaced Palestinians who have already fled there and for more I can now welcome Hisham Mana spokesperson for the international Committee of the Red Cross joining us from Rafa in southern Gaza welcome Hisham as far as you are concerned are people heeding the Israeli Army's order to evacuate the UN shelter in KH Unis can they hello Nico thank you for having me unfortunately what we're witnessing what we have been witnessing over the past few days is that uh the north is becoming uh the south of God is becoming another North uh you cannot simply Force thousands of families to continue being displaced from one place to another under the most dangerous circumstances without any access to um the basic needs for survival aducate water food um medicine and top of all Safety and Security uh what we are witnessing now is that we are we fear that actually that the the Gaza would lose its Health Care System capacity in total if the very few hospitals in in hanun governorate in South and Gaza Strip are are pushed out of service as hostilities have become near them the are the entire Health Care system is on is is is on its needs and um there's absolutely no guarantee now that medical staff will be able to continue their life-saving job um we have witnessed thousands of families had to flee from hunas the majority of them were actually displaced inside tents or inside these two few hospitals uh uh they took shelter and uh now they move to the ra governorate which is uh which represents only 20% of the total space of of Gaza STP that's approximately 60 kilomet 60 square kilm and now it's inhabited by over 1.5 million displaced human beings uh before October in ra Governor aren't you can you can you describe what the situation there is for you as someone who's who's living there but also trying to assist people who are on the Run well it's nearly impossible to assist people anymore because first it's it's we lack all the security guarantees that would allow us to move freely and securely on the ground the limitation on the human itan Aid that is entering or allowed to enter Gaza is also has also compounded the suffering and um people literally live live on the streets now either in tents or makeshift now it's pouring rain it's it's it's very rainy and it's very very cold and even the weather is not is no longer on the side of the people here uh people hustle every day to have access to clean water some of the families are forced to fill buckets from the Mediterranean to use to clean their clothes or or uh uh just wash uh themselves and um um finding food is also hustle for uh thousands of people the north itself unfortunately families had to use animals fotter and turn it into uh uh uh you know a bread instead of flour because humanitarian Aid is no longer accessible to the north and this is another catastrophe yeah the UN warned this week in fact that parts of Gaza might already be in famine if the situation further deteriorates what will be the consequences unfortunately the world will bear witness thousands of lives being lost uh without any meaningful reason without any reason at all uh the situation unfortunately just moves from bad to worse uh which is why both parties of the conflict now must adverted their legal obligations according to the international humanitarian law by uring the Safety and Security for the civilians civilian infrastructure hospitals and whoever is inside them uh uh are enjoy a special protection under the international humanitarian law as long as they are not uh uh misused that was ham Mana with the Red Cross many thanks for your time and please stay safe thank
