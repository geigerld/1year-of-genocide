Israel has categorically ruled out a ceasefire in its war against Hamas prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would represent a surrender to the militant group he said the ground offensive was the best way to secure the release of more hostages one Israeli soldier was freed during an overnight mission in Gaza the first such rescue since the War Began another Israeli hostage safely home Israel's military released this picture of soldier Ori ish to announce her release a crowd gathered outside her home to celebrate the news she's the first captive to be freed amid Israel's growing ground offensive prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the rescue and rejected calls for a ceasefire Israel will not agree to Association of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7th calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to Sur surrender to Hamas to surrender to terrorism to surrender to barbarism that will not happen as Israel ramps up its fighting the pressure to bring hostages home is also growing hundreds of beds have been laid out in Jerusalem to represent the missing families gathered at the vigil watch the latest video released by Hamas militants showing three female captives it's brought some hope to their families when I saw the photo of Danielle on TV my heart almost stopped my wife and I were on the one hand shocked but on the other hand we felt relief relief that she's alive and that we can see her we didn't know anything about her until today but other families have received devastating news authorities say German Israeli shiny luk who was believed to be kidnapped is dead the news has given her mother a sense of closure I'm a bit relieved that the matter is closed the news is not good but at least we know she didn't suffer more than 200 people are believed to still be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza DW correspondent Tanya Kramer is in ashdot in southern Israel I asked her how Israelis are reacting to their prime minister rejecting any possibility of a ceasefire with Hamas well yeah we just heard it there he says it's not a time for a ceasefire but it's time for war and I think this is very concerning for many of the relatives and the families of the hostages because you know they are fearing that by going deeper inside Gaza by widening this uh ground operation and incursion uh that uh we are seeing uh um they might harm uh the life the lives of their loved ones and their relatives now um the government of course is trying to prove here there was a a soldier that was rescued uh Monday night during the course of Monday and uh you know that means that the we don't know many details about how this played out but uh this shows somehow from the government side that they can do both on the one hand eliminate the capabilities infrastructure eradicate Hamas as they say on the other hand trying to get the hostages out but I think for families still you know by seeing that um some of the hostages might I mean they beli to be maybe in some of the tunnel systems that they believ to be held in different groups in different areas maybe we don't know of course for sure where they are uh that they could be at the end Collateral Damage by by see seeing what you know the the the fire power that is coming down on Gaza right now so their main concern is certainly to look at you know the negotiations and to hope that there will be some kind of breakthrough uh uh while Qatar and Egypt have been helping with those indirect negotiations that was DW's Tanya Kramer there speaking to me a short while ago from asot in southern Israel well as Israeli tanks and troops Advance on Gaza City there have been reports of fierce CL es in the northern part of the strip Israel's military says it has struck more than 600 militant Targets in recent days in Gaza the UN is warning that Israeli shelling and air strikes are getting closer to hospitals where thousands of Palestinians are Sheltering the Hamas ran Gaza Health Ministry says more than 8,300 people have been killed so far meanwhile Hamas is also launched Rockets into Southern Israel causing fires there let's bring in Frank ledwich here he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer he joins us from Oxford Frank you said at the beginning of this war that Israel did not appear to have a clear strategy for their military campaign now three weeks into it has that strategy become any clearer well good morning Terry the answer I'm afraid is no and this is causing worries amongst Israel's friends not the United States and indeed within the government itself the only thing we know is that Israel has said it will uh no longer have responsibility for Gaza now there's a number of meanings embedded in that look plans are being knocked around in the Israeli government for example to resettle or to move some of the gazen population to Egypt that comes from Ministry of intelligence that's a nonstarter that'll never happen but I think more seriously negotiations are going on with the Palestinian Authority hoping that Arab world will sometimes will somehow get involved no sign of that so we're still at an early stage us are very concerned about it they've embedded us senior US military staff within the planning cells to ensure that at least some consideration is given to setting the the conditions for such a a longterm strategy in the operations now but the answer is essentially no there is no apparent strategy end state or political track here well one success has come through uh for Israel in terms of hostage is it's at least managed to free one soldier that was taken hostage how did they manage to find an extractor Frank do we have any idea with respect to the soldier concern we don't have any clue at all how this particular uh young woman was rescued however I think we can uh bet fair that there'll be many more like it and the reason for that is that Israel despite its intelligence disaster of three weeks ago has a really first class uh intelligence structure and much of it is based in Gaza itself for example there are Elite teams they're called in in Hebrew uh Cherry D dvan I think who are in civilian clothes and uh they will assist in targeting but also their primary intelligence requirement the main thing they have to do will be to discover and if possible set the stage to rescue hostages Israel will have a presence on the ground so much of the bombing that we see for example just to move move across slightly to illustrate looks like it's indiscriminate probably isn't much of it will be targeted by these teams so it's highly likely they would have been involved in finding this hostage highly likely but right overlaying that of course is Israel's huge signals intelligence capability listening to the comms of Hamas and of course their fantastic air and satellite reconnaissance systems as for extraction I suspect it was buy an armored vehicle in one of the probes Israelis did but we don't know now of course all this started Frank when Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7th killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping hundreds Israel responded by sealing off Gaza and has been bombarding it relent relentlessly since then with thousands of deaths reported the UN says Israel's response is disproportionate do you agree Frank I think it's important to understand the the the meaning of proportionality in international humanitarian law and I say this neutrally the proportionality does not relate to the incident three weeks ago in other words we can't be counting bodies and Counting the dead that's not what proportionality is and weighing one against the other proportionality in this context is quite straightforward it relates to the mission of any particular strike if for example we have a mission to uh to kill a Hamas senior officer we will assess whether the mission despite its collat natural damage is which is to say the killings that's what it is killings and injuries and terrible calling uh Horrors for civilians whether that outweighs the benefit done by the strike now I think in many cases that might be questionable but that's the that's what proportionality means it's weighing the Damage Done against the benef the operational benefit here and uh I think time will tell as to whether as to whether those decisions would be considered appropriate I think it is worth saying In fairness to everybody that Israel has um let's say loosened its Rules of Engagement so that calculation uh May favor more the military objective rather than the civilians who will be killed that proportionality in this context has to be understood as having nothing to do with body counts well the United Nations is warning that Israel's uh Israeli shelling and air strikes are getting closer to hospitals where thousands of Palestinians are Sheltering video reporting to show the moments after an Israeli rocket attack near Al's Hospital in central Gaza the Palestinian red cant says Israeli bombardments are coming ever closer to the hospital the humanitarian group estimates 14,000 people are Sheltering here in addition to the patience they are refusing Israel's orders to evacuate we don't have the means to evacuate Al's hospital we have over 400 p patients who are inside the hospital many of them are in the Intensive Care Unit evacuating them means killing them that's why we refuse the evacuation order we call on the International Community to intervene immediately to stop a humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding Israel accuses Hamas militants of using hospitals as command [Music] centers and shows no sign of pausing its pounding over the territory as its troops on the ground Advance deeper into Gaza Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas after its unprecedented Terror attacks in Israel weeks ago in coordinated attacks by ground and Air Forces Fighters killed dozens of militants in Gaza who had barricaded themselves inside buildings and tried to attack our forces that were moving in their Direction the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains desperate as Israel enters what it calls the second stage of its war with Hamas thousands looted an aid Warehouse on the weekend a sign the United Nations says that civil order is breaking down Israel has rejected appeals for a humanitarian pause the international criminal court has warned that impeding Aid May constitute a crime and I want to underline clearly to Israel that there must be discernable efforts without further delay to make sure civilians receive basic food medicine anesthetics morphe we hear reports of operations taking place without these basic medicines as if we're in the Middle Ages but despite all the international rhetoric little is changing for ordinary gazin with many now deciding to stay put leaving their lives to fate the dire situation facing the people of Gaza and particularly children has been laid bare at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council the head of the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF Katherine Russell said more than 400 children are being killed or injured in Gaza every day claiming that number should shake each of us to our core the UN security council meeting was also told that more than 3,400 children have been killed in 3 weeks of fighting well Toby fricker is a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF I spoke to him earlier and asked him whether the extraordinary numbers being reported for children killed and injured in Gaza are reliable yeah you're right the numbers of children killed the numbers of children injured inside the Gaza Strip are are extraordinary now these numbers come from the Palestinian uh Ministry of Health um and UNICEF also has our own you know sources on the ground we have staff on the ground Partners on the ground uh to to look into the numbers as we always do um and I just say that in in past like in 2014 for example when there was an escalation uh the UN then verifies numbers you know we can't do that in real time of course for obvious reasons but we verify numbers and when we've done that before in similar situations not at this scale uh the numbers have been very very similar is it possible uh to provide any safety for children in Gaza given the conditions that uh are are are operating there the there's it's a war zone with constant bombardment and a ground Invasion how do you provide safety for children in that are yeah I mean let me say and UNICEF has been saying that there is no safe place for for children in the Gaza Strip right now uh anyone who's been there or anyone who knows the Gaza Strip is a tiny area of land you know and when you have hostilities in such a densely populated area where there are more than 1 million uh children of course it's not safe anywhere um and that continues to be a massive concern we continue to see these numbers rising of children being killed and injured you know and and that's the the massive concern that it's not stopping um and that's why we keep calling for this immediate humanitarian ceasefire but but as of the situation now there is no safe place for children inside the Gaza Strip as you know Toby uh Philip lazarini the commissioner general for the UN relief and works agency uh unra has accused Israel of collective punishment of the people of Gaza he says that the current Aid System is geared to fail are you in talks with the Israeli government Toby regarding humanitarian issues in Gaza and how how the humanitarian conditions can be improved yeah I mean the UN has a system in place where we have uh connections where we talk to all parties to a conflict and that's very much focused uh first of all on stopping the violence saving lives but also on on humanitarian access you know and what's absolutely critical now is that we open up access points to the Gaza Strip uh to improve to bring up that life-saving supplies into into the into the area and then that's really an absolute priority because there are some supplies going but it's absolutely tiny amount given the massive massive needs and what we're talking about now is a lack of Safe Water people who can't get Safe Water children who are drinking salty water who have got dehydration who've got diarrhea uh so these waterbor diseases are becom becoming a real reality and you also have families children civilians living in very densely populated shelters uh that unra schools unra you know even in in hospital areas um and that's a massive risk for the outbreak of disease the Israeli military says it's killed a senior Hamas Commander responsible for the October 7th terrorist attacks the Israel Defense Forces released footage which appeared to show an air strike on what they believe is Hamas terrorist Nasim Abu aen this comes as Israel continues with its Grand defensive in Gaza the military says it has struck more than 600 militant Targets in recent days and IDF spokesperson gave this update on the military incursion overnight forces continue to fight and advance in the ground operation in Gaza in coordinated LED air attacks they killed terrorists and contined to attack hundreds of targets of the murderous Kamas organization DW correspondent Ben fulan is in Jerusalem and he told us more about the latest Israeli attacks inside Gaza well the information we're getting um here the media from Hamas is that they've targeted tanks in the north that they've been clashes with Israeli troops in the South and the indications from Israeli uh forces is that uh they're also attacking from both sides uh most interestingly is that they say they've penetrated some of these tunnels this vast tunnel network of Hamas and managed to destroy uh rocket launch pads uh in shafts also control centers within those tunnels and have attacked Hamas forces and troops uh within those tunnels uh sealing off access points as well remembering though that the hostages are said to be in these tunnels Pablo Ben Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a ceasefire so what's the reaction been to this among Israelis well his announcement came in a briefing to the international media and his rhetoric uh was tone down in comparison to other press conferences he's been hel holding here over the past weeks um he stopped short again of calling this an invasion there's a global outcry at the moment as you know um but he's not going to send in all troops at once uh that would be a death trap considering this intricate tunnel system that uh hamus could use to Ambush the troops the families of the hostages don't want to see any ground or air offensive uh but if they do see results and if it means just one by one only one hostage having been rescued so far according to the information we have then that would be a positive thing of course there are over 200 hostages in a hall being held by Hamas now some experts say that Israel's ground operation is is advancing slower than expected what's behind this well they're saying inch by inch that's what uh military strategists are saying uh first of all to uh ensure there's no Ambush no surprise attacks uh by Hamas also to keep open the possibility of negotiations for the release of these hostages uh those negotiations are said to still be underway uh with the mediator c um we'll see as far as whether or not uh there are results Netanyahu says this is going to be a long War he said that time and again and is refusing uh a ceasefire he says a ceasefire as you also pointed out would only be giving up only be surrendering to Hamas and would take the pressure of Hamas uh to release the hostages it would mean Hamas would only hold on to those hostages in those tunnels that they have now more on the situation on the ground in Gaza as we've heard the Israeli military is pushing ahead with its offensive in the north and stepping up Round the Clock air strikes on the territory the hamon health Ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed the head of the UN children's agency says the number of casualties is too high to be collateral damage gazans go through another night of explosions Israeli air strikes have been tar targeting the strip for weeks they say they're hitting Hamas militants and their infrastructure inside the territory as the death do mounts the Hamas run Health Ministry claims that over 8,300 people have died in Gaza since Israeli bombing began many have lost entire families one of my men we don't have anything nothing he was just going out to find gas because we don't have any at home he was also looking for bread for the children and gas then they told me he was martyred this is now a daily reality for the people of Gaza people clawing to get others out from under the rubble many of those stuck are children on Monday the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the Gaza crisis with Aid agencies focusing on the young casualties of this war nearly 70% of those reported killed are children and woman save the children reported yesterday that nearly 3,200 children were killed in Gaza in just three weeks this surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world's conflict zones since 2019 this cannot be collateral damage there also came this call for children to be better protected on behalf of all the children caught in this nightmare we call on the World to do better whether they are young people attending a music festival or children going about their daily lives in Gaza they all deserve peace children do not start conflicts and they are powerless to stop them to add to the suffering essential supplies are running dangerously low food water fuel and medicines are all hard to find humanitarian workers say the aid reaching Gaza is far too little for residents with one UN agency in Gaza claiming an urgencies fire is now a life or death matter for millions of Palestinians journalist ham baloa is in Gaza and we asked him earlier about how many people are still left in the evacuation Zone in the northern part of the territory there are many civilians living there they are um a huge number uh honor wise talking about 600 or even U 600 100,000 and even a bit more um this place to the South part where some including myself and my family that we are staying at wom's houses that we are talking about like one about 1 million people displaced from North and down the city some of them they are displaced from the border areas into the city or the center of the city whether in indp or the other city I know personally and I communicate with some people they are still there for many reasons one one of them like they have no uh place to go in the sou or the circum and misery life that they experienced and that they been back to go to the
