Spain Norway and Ireland have become the latest countries to officially recognize a Palestinian State they join 143 other UN member nations to do so the move has been welcomed in Gaza and the West Bank but criticized by Israel the Norwegian Spanish and Irish flags unfolded and flying alongside that of South Africa outside municipal buildings in the West Bank it's a tribute to the three Western new European nations that gave their official recognition to a Palestinian State first came the formal announcement from Madrid at the meeting of the Council of ministers that will be held today the government of Spain will approve the official recognition of Palestine as a state then in Ireland's parliament in front of the Palestinian Ambassador came the nod from Dublin we here in Ireland we see you we recognize you we respect you and today Ireland for recognizes the state of Palestine thank you T outside the Palestinian flag was raised beside that of Ukraine and the European Union and shortly thereafter the announcement came from Oslo 2 the government has decided that Norway will recognize the state of Palestine Norway's recognition will come into force on May 28th it's a decision that has had repercussions across Europe and Beyond in Paris an MP brandished the Palestinian flag in Parliament during questions to the foreign Ministry he was accused of provoking the assembly and received a 15-day suspension it's the highest penalty possible under the national assembly's rules of procedure there were similar scenes in Rome as leftwing MPS waved the Palestinian flag during a speech by one of their colle Gaza we are happy with the Nations that stood with us and recognized the state of Palestine we hope that all nations will stand with us and put pressure on Israel to end the war many in the West Bank concurred it's an excellent development it gives us complete Freedom a recognized country our own currency it unites us so that we can escapee the occupation the recognition brings hope to some Palestinians but many obstacles still remain nonetheless other European nations are expected to follow with us in the studio now is Martin Koba retired German ambassador and former German representative with the Palestinian authorities he's now a member of diplomats Without Borders Mr cobler thank you so much for taking the time and coming on the show today so these three European States recognizing Palestinian statehood is that a symbolic move without much consequence or could this really give new momentum to the push for peace in the Middle East no I do think it's much more than a symbolic move only uh of course there are no immediate practical consequences the war will go on and it will not change the situation immediately However the fact that Norway the father and mother of the Oslo process recognizes the U now the statute of Palestine is an important step and don't for get we shouldn't forget that 140 states in the United Nations they recognized Palestine as a state the permanent representative of Palestine is sitting in front of a name plate state of Palestine in the UN so it is important that also a few European States Sweden and some East European States already did it um they recognized Palestine as a state um but I'm a little bit worried that it's not a joint European decision exactly because Germany for example is a lot more careful saying that recognizing Palestinian statehood could actually send in the way of Peace how do you feel about that well Germany is of the opinion that the two-state solution is the only way out of the war right now and we have been seeing this for the last 30 years now um the Oslo process was set up in 93 and and everybody remembers the Rose Garden with Clinton and raat and prime minister Rabin being being present um and it was supposed to be a what five years transition period and then there should be a final solution however as we all know 30 years passed since 1994 and not so much happened on the contrary the situation got worse the isolation grew there is a Palestinian Authority which is corrupt uh there's an Israeli government which uh is well gradually expanding the settlers the settlements in the uh in the occupied territories in Palestine and these were not good developments and now we have a new situation that's why to get new Dynamic into the well not peace process in the political process I don't dare to speak of a peace process right now but into the political process and avoid the mistakes of Oslo I think this is the game of the day what were the big mistakes of Oslo well the big mistake of Oslo was I think that the end status was not fixed the end status after five years years was subject to negotiations where are the borders of a state what's to do with the refugees where is the capital how is the water distribution all these questions were subject to negotiations until well the end of the uh of the transition process and it never happened so why not putting the pyramid just on top and determine the end status now as the German government says two states will be the solution for the security of Israel and this is also emanating from the what we call from the well how to say historic responsibility of Germany to provide security for Israel but security for Israel is also the security for the Palestinians there can be no security for Israel without ending the isolation of the Palestinians without without having a political process which is worth the name yeah I want to talk about the issue of security because um Israel's foreign minister has accused Spain of quote being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes by recognizing Palestinian statehood what do you make of that rhetoric no I think we have to look to the Future now it's very clear that both sides have rethoric which are not conducive for bringing a political process ahead so I never use the word genocide or aparte or whatever I I think we should go back to look at the to the legal status of everything yeah and not and not indulge in in political political propaganda here from from all sides I think it's good if we go back to the international law there are two levels there is of course the right of self-defense for the Israelis after the brutal attack of Hamas but there is also the principle of proportionality so let's discuss about proportionality the international Court the other day said stop the Rafa actions because it's not proportional under international law so let's go back to Legal systems and let's take emotions as much as it's possible out I understand the well the fear and and the the anger and of of Israelis and also the the pain of those who still have hostages in in Gaza imagine but I also understand a close friend of mine Palestinians in Gaza he lost 31 members of his family there are in the meantime more than 35,000 dead and 80,000 injured in Gaza now this is all something which which I understand that you cannot demand I mean just uh strip your your whole um strip yourself of emotions but let's go to the legal system the occupation of the West Bank the isolation of the of the Gaza Strip the um well also individual responsibility of Hamas and Israeli leaders I think the international criminal court decision the international crimin criminal court as such is one of the biggest achievements we had in the outgoing last century that individuals independent of whether they are terrorists or whether they are heads of States like Mr Putin or uh or or others here that they are really accountable for what they are doing let's let's pick some of the decisions that that you pointed at there apart the icj ordered the Israeli Army halt all military activity in Rafa Israel has pressed on nonetheless defying that order why does Israel think that they can get away with that and can well this you better ask Israelis here and not not you know the quite well well I I think um I'm of the opinion that if we have an international Court ruling and this court is an organ of the United Nations everybody has to has to stick to to what they say and Israel should follow what they say there are others now genocide uh kind of um proceedings now applied for by the by the south a I think if we agree theal field that we have interal courts that we accept their decisions we also have to implement them but it's of course I agree a weakness of international law if the court orders Putin you have to withdraw from Ukraine and he just doesn't do it so what to do now and it's the same uh with with Israel I um don't like that in that that representatives of these States they do not follow the international order the international order nowadays is in dissolution in a way nobody agrees on well legal Norms anymore so really and and I think there is a consequence beyond the icj and the consequence beyond the international criminal court independent of Israel that if states do not follow it further erodes the international order which is not good for the International System as a whole yeah there's so much more I want to talk to you about but I think we're running out of time um I want to talk about your recent visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories um you know the region very well what struck you most what did people tell you what surprised you maybe going back there well I've been following this conflict since um well my uh youth so to say professional youth I opened the German office in Jericho immediately after the Oslo agreement in '94 and stayed there until 97 and have been following events ever since so what struck me most um is was that Palestinians really despite of the fact that I know their opinion polls that they support Hamas um or many of them high percentage for Hamas but they are committed to live in peace with Israel on the Palestinian side but I'm convinced that it cannot be done under what the Americans call revitalized PA there needs to be a game Cher there needs to be a time after Abu maazin after president abas but also post netan now uh and and here I see the pro problem but this has to be decided by the Palestinians and Israelis themselves we cannot do it from outside the Palestinians themselves have to decide how their political structure will be how Gaza and West Bank will relate to each other the Israelis have to decide which government to vote for who is ending isolation engaging in a political process not a peace process a political process avoiding the mistakes of foso so an argument for self-determination in the entire region that was Martin kova thank you so much thank you so much pleasure to be here as we've just been discussing Spain Norway and Ireland joined some 140 other countries and officially recognizing Palestinian statehood but what exactly does their recognition mean for the everyday lives of Palestinians DW correspondent Rebecca ritters reports from rala in the occupied West Bank here in rala the occupied West Bank's biggest city and the state of palestine's deao administrative Capital news of this latest recognition has been welcomed in a gesture of appreciation the municipality has raised the flags of Norway Ireland and Spain mayor Isa CIS tells me why their recognition is so meaningful it's a beautiful moment uh um it's a moment of of hope uh it really brought in our hearts hope for a better tomorrow hope that the world is listening to us hope that Palestine still has a chance Norway Spain and Ireland joined some 140 un countries that have already recognize the state of Palestine the movie is largely symbolic but many say it has political meaning I always say that we want to live for Palestine we don't want to die for Palestine um we we live for for for earning our uh our right for for self-determination and for for for Independence we've been striving and fighting for seven decades and what is is happening now uh is that hope uh is is being is being revived the Palestinians we spoke to say that while it may not affect their day-to-day lives they hope it will lead to yet more recognition the recognition of these three countries affects the whole world it highlights our cause that the land is ours our rights our reality so they can stand with us so we can overcome the brutal occupation the countries that have recognized Palestine are making the voice of young Palestinians reach everyone young Palestinians will have a voice in Europe we don't live in Freedom Spain and the other countries recognition might make the occupation feel weaker and countries that stand with it might come to our side and hopefully recognize us too despite the signal of Hope for pal Palestinians many things stand in the way of a fully fledged Palestinian State one major obstacle is the Jewish settlements like that one you can see on the hill behind me they're considered illegal under international law but they're dotted all over the occupied West Bank making a contiguous Palestinian State almost impossible another obstacle is the lack of a unified Palestinian leadership and the ongoing war in Gaza another major obstacle is a lack of political will from Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the move by the three countries saying it was like handing out a reward for terrorism he's long fought to keep the two-state solution off the negotiating table I I think the biggest obstacle to piece is that Israel has gotten so use to being able to flout international law do whatever it wants get away with it that people don't take seriously the need to think about what is a realistic outcome with the Palestinians and therefore if there is no such thinking then people go along the lines of well maybe you know we have to remove them permanently the leaders of Norway Ireland and Spain say their decision was made to promote a peaceful solution for Palestinians here the move constitutes further recognition for their decades long struggle for statehood
