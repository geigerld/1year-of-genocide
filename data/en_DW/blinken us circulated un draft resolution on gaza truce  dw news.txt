the United States has circulated a draft un Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire linked to the release of hostages in the Gaza Strip during a visit to Saudi Arabia US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin emphasized the need to protect gazan civilians and provide humanitarian Aid the draft resolution is an about face for the US which last month vetoed a call at the UN for such a truce Lincoln is now on to Egypt and then on Friday will continue on to Israel here's what blink had to say to a Saudi media Outlet we actually have a resolution he said that we put forward right now that does call for an immediate ceasefire tied to the release of hostages and we hope very much that countries will support that for more on this we can talk now to journalists balig sladin in Tel Aviv and and Karim elari in Cairo kareim to you first this shift in the US position on a ceasefire in Gaza how is that likely to be seen in the region particularly in Egypt where Anthony blinkin is holding talks today well I think the hope is that this will give some impetus it will boost the ceasefire negotiations that are going on of course in the background uh we know that there's a basic agreement of six weeks ceasefire in exchange for reasing hostages 40 hostages and then in exchange releasing uh the 20 or 30 fault of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons but of course there are lot of disagreement still and this is the hope that this new UN us initiative will boost this the there is differences the difference one of them is like Hamas is demanding a list with hostages that are still alive Hamas refusing it Hamas on the other side is asking for um to pick the names for the Palestinians who are relased from Palestinian prisons they ask for at least a hundred of them with life sentences Israel is refusing that and on it's on the other hand is asking that possibly to deport some of the released Palestinian prisoners to third countries and finally there's of course the hope that there will be further ceasefire and further releases but Hamas is connecting this to like um uh a permanent ceasefire to an end of the war and that is of course something netan is refusing because of his objective to destroy Hamas so despite of this change of the UN positions there is still a lot of work still a lot of disagreement in this negotiations now bik in Tel Aviv uh what about Israel how is Israel likely to react to this Push by the making a huge deal of this statement by Blink here in Israel and I do understand why what we have for now is a statement by blinkin in an interview with the Saudi media saying that the US issued a proposal to the UN Security Council on the state on the basis of an immediate ceasefire Target to the release of the hostages we didn't see the details of that proposal yet the issue here is less about the ceasefire being immediate or not but whether it's a permanent ceasefire something that wouldn't be acceptable in Israel and honestly don't think that the US would ever call for such a thing secondly when blink saying it's tight to the release of the hostages does he mean that a ceasefire would be an unconditional release of the hostages because if that's the case in Israel that will be 100% for it something that I don't imagine Hamas accepting even if the uh uh un Security Council proposal uh passes and lastly blink saying that this UN resolution proposal will send the message I see three parties here getting this message the first two are of course Hamas and Israel that engage right now in the toes and Doha and such a proposal would put pressure on them to accept the terms of the negotiations but thirdly and maybe I'm not here to talk about the US politics but it's definitely a message also to the uh Democratic voters ahead of the election saying here we are we are pushing for ceire as you're demanding in in Gaza kareim tell us more about the situation in Gaza right now it sounds like the need for food assistance there has become absolutely critical well I mean let's not stay with anecdotical evidence I mean we have a clear statement by wfp the world food organization that famine is imminent between now and May and they don't say this lightly there's clear indicators when the UN is announcing an imminent a famine or a famine and some of it is the insecurity of food the situation of insecurity of food in Gaza the other one is the malnutrition of children so wfp decided that it's the time now to announce that we are an imminent if of famine uh people in Gaza are starving to death right now the wfp executive director Cindy McCain is saying man by a man-made hunger and Mal nutrition crisis uh she is saying that there's a very small window left to prevent an outright famine and to do that we need immediately and full access to the north that means through Israel and if you wait until famine has been declared it's too late thousands more will be dead says the head of wfp Kareem thank you very much that was Kareem algari in Cairo and in Tel aiv we were speaking with balik sladin thank you very much to you both
