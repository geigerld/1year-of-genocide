we can now talk to Ian Bremer political scientist and president and founder of the Eurasia group ngz media Mr Bremer good to have you on the show now what influence does the International Community have over what happens between Israel and Hamas the International Community I wish I knew where that was uh there was an effort by Brazil to put forward a security Council resolution that would both condemn Hamas terrorism and also uh urge uh focus on humanitarian support for the Palestinians that failed uh with an American veto the United States of course is Israel's most important Ally uh in the world Israel's America's most important Ally in the region uh a lot of the developed world is aligned with that if not completely most of the global South is not and almost everyone is Unified in having ignored the Palestinians for most of the last decade uh but that turns out to be something we shouldn't have been agreed upon uh and uh and the world is getting a lot more challenging because the pivot away from The Middle East uh proves to you that you have to continue uh to keep focusing so I wish I had a better answer for that question but maybe I will for your next one yeah I mean we have seen Qatar and turkey offering to mediate Anthony blinkin is toward the region so as analina babok China is sending someone soon is there anybody who's suited to really achieve something in this the Americans are most suited in in the sense that they have the most leverage over Israel Biden doesn't like or trust nanahu but that doesn't mean uh that they won't work together they will and given that the Israelis are the ones that are now on the back of the terrorist atrocities in October 7th are planning a ground Invasion that will be incredibly bloody um on the back uh of a couple of weeks of bombings it is the United States that's going to play the most significant role the Chinese will be on the margins the Europeans will be on the margins they all understand that but it would be nice to have the regional players involved at actively especially uh because we're talking about the potential of this war expanding expanding into the West Bank into Lebanon with Hezbollah maybe more broadly and in that regard the biggest news this week was a disappointment it was the fact that the Palestinians the jordanians and the Egyptians canell what was going to be a summit with President Biden in the region on the back of his trip to Israel yeah he traveled to Israel he met with Netanyahu someone you say he doesn't like Ora trust he did come with a strong message of solidarity but in the wake of what Israel is calling its 911 he also came with a message of caution didn't he he did and and if it's Israel's 911 and of course in terms of the impact on a country that size that's much greater than 911 was for the United States but the US does have some lessons 20 years of war and Terror led to a lot of failures uh I mean failures domestically in um a an overly repressive policy uh that took away human Liberties especially in terms of profiling Muslims in the United States but also and much more tragically failed Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that cost trillions of dollars and disrupted millions of millions of lives and the United States does not want Israel to repeat those mistakes a ground occupation uh of Gaza would certainly go a long way in repeating those mistakes I will tell you personally I think that Israel has every right to want to destroy the terrorist organization Hamas but I also need to tell you we're talking about 30 or 40,000 fighters in Gaza and I do not know how Israel can accomplish that um especially because they operate within and next to civilians putting them in danger yeah how Israel accomplishes that without radicalizing far more Palestinians to become okay they'll change their name but an organization that will be much more dangerous for Israel and for the region is that what you meant when you said a couple days ago that the Israeli population is most threatened by what the terrorists of Hamas unleash from Israel that's absolutely right I think it was gold in my ear uh that that once said that we won't hate you um for killing our children we will hate you for making us kill your children um and and that precisely is the danger that when you're fighting a monster you cannot become a monster and Israel cannot be an a position um where the the radicalization that has already occurred among Palestinians that has already occurred in Gaza which has become functionally unlivable over the past decades gets worse and worse and worse again um Hamas uh needs to leave this earth uh anyone that's engaged in directly targeting civilians the elderly the children we cannot have they they have no place in civilized society but but Israel has to be so incredibly careful um in in not making matters vastly worse um in the way that they decide to pursue a legitimate response against those terrorist attacks as Ian Bremer great speaking to you thank you so much for your time thank you
