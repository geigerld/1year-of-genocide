right turning now to Israel's war on Hamas Israel says its Army carried out a large ground incursion in the Gaza Strip overnight to attack Hamas positions the military described it as its biggest incursion into Gaza yet the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories has warned that nowhere in Gaza is safe as Israel steps up its preparations for an expected ground Invasion Israeli tanks and Northern Gaza setting the stage for Israel's next phase of combat a full ground war has not started yet but air strikes are hitting the Gaza Strip nonstop theyve already reduced entire neighborhoods to Rubble because of the bombing destruction and killing I came to seek shelter inside this camp with nine members of my family in two cars I had to sleep out in the open in the heat for 10 days to get a tent Israel says it is striking targets of the islamist militant group Hamas considered a terrorist organization by many Western governments according to the UN about 1.4 million gazin are now displaced the organization now says nowhere is safe in the entire Gaza Strip residents there who have no way out of the strip are calling for an end to the hostilities we don't want war we want it to stop we're so tired we're overwhelmed we stand in Long cues just to use the toilets we don't even have basic rights we are more like lifeless bodies a Complete Siege imposed by Israel after the Hamas terror attack has caused a critical shortage of supplies and air strikes are impeding eight deliveries uh we've been asked if we've been able to deliver to the Turkish Hospital which is uh perhaps the biggest provider of cancer services in in Gaza the answer is no um the answer is no because we do not have security guarantees to deliver that Aid International diplomacy efforts for a ceasefire have so far failed a ground war to topple mass now may worsen an already dire situation in Gaza well earlier I talked to DW correspondent tany kma in Jerusalem she tell me more about the Israeli incursion into Gaza overnight while the Israeli military confirmed only that uh what they described as a targeted raid into Gaza they also released uh this video where you can see tanks and the Infantry basically moving in they say they targeted that Hamas infrastructure there also Hamas militants and the Army Radio described it as the largest incursion yet as to date so they also said that this is done in preparation for the next stages of combat possibly referring to a even larger uh ground uh incursion that uh everybody in Israel at least is waiting for all of this happens of course with also massive air bombardment uh Israeli air bombardment on uh the Gaza Strip and north and south and we heard again also uh that Palestinians still in the north of Gaza where also is the Gaza City uh were called on leaving and that prompted also a statement by the UN un's humanitarian coordinator this Hastings saying that Palestinians they face an impossible situation because some had opted to stay they don't have the means or they don't want to leave so it's a very very difficult situation for the civilian population there tell you with heard Israel's primee Minister there explaining that preparations are still underway for a ground operation as they have been for days did he shed uh any new light as to what we can expect of that operation well I think he needed to address the Israeli public there are a lot of questions being asked where this is going in Israel uh people are looking uh what's happening in Gaza obviously but also what is happening in noris on the northern border with Hezbollah as well and uh he didn't say much new he said that the ground offensive will happen soon but he didn't give any details he also said that uh a priority is still also to get the hostages the Israeli hostages and other foreign Nationals that are being held in Gaza now at the number of 224 only four were were released so far that are being held in Gaza to get them out he also briefly touched on saying that um basically talking about the responsibility this is one of the big questions that's being discussed as well in Israel for uh what happened on October 7 when Hamas uh breached the border and went into Southern uh Israel he said everyone will have to ask and answer those questions but this will be done after the war T briefly you you mentioned the growing tensions in the north at the border with Lebanon how is Israel handling the prospect of fighting on two fronts at the same time I mean there is a lot of concern that the second front will be opening and we've seen over the past two and a half weeks tensions Rising there lot of cross border fighting and uh we also uh see that the Israeli government has asked you know most of the villages and towns in the close to the Lebanese border to evacuate and to go further uh to the center of the country so there is concern that a second front will be opening uh you know there could be miscalculation military analysts here are saying there could be a preemptive Strife by Israel or Hezbollah might join uh the war as they put it once this ground Invasion might go ahead T ker in Jerusalem thank you let's bring in Hiba Tibi here she's country director for the humanitarian organization care responsible for the West Bank and Gaza she joins us from rala in the West Bank welcome to the program he start with a situation in Gaza you're in daily contact with your colleagues there what are they telling you I was just before the interview with my colleague on phone and they were explaining to me that the situation is becoming more and more harder only today they had to go for bread cues that are now taking six hours in average to find a loaf of bread or limited amount it's like limited amount per family and they are for instance my colleague had to leave at 4:00 a.m. just to reserve a spot in the queue uh this is not the only issue that they are facing the water uh in the beginning the first days of the war they were able to secure water from the municipality pumped not clean water the salty one for Hygiene purposes and they it used to come for for 3 hours every 3 4 days now it is not coming anymore and I'm pretty sure that you already heard about the drinking water water that is not available in Gaza anymore because it requires fuel that replaces electricity for uh pumping and treating the water to become more drinkable now Israel has told Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to leave the North and move to the South but the UN says that some Palestinians who did that who fled their homes in the north are now going back there because they can't find safe shelter even in the South which is supposed to be a safe zone are your colleagues in a similar situation unfortunately it's it's a reality and a fact it's it's a testimony from my colleagues not one not two the five of them who are in in who who evacuated to the South they left their houses there are no houses to go back to by the way three of them how their houses are completely destroyed two of them they don't know if they can if it's safe to go back to their homes but they are unable to stay in the in the South they are staying in apartment designed for 10 people but they are sharing it with 80 people they cannot sleep they cannot access water and it's under constant shelling and by the way those who stayed in the north most of them who did not evacuate did not evacuate because of the the fact that they cannot afford going to the South the the lit of fuel became extremely expensive so for a family an average family to transport from the north I'm talking 10 days ago because every day by the hour the price of fuel gets higher every so in the beginning it would cost the family around 1,000 shakel which is around 350350 and they cannot afford it right now you've issued a statement saying that what's happening in Gaza now is beyond what your team had envisioned as a a worst case scenario but things could get even worse couldn't they yes unfortunately if the UN as they announced are going to stop providing Services if the hospitals are going to stop their services honestly I I don't know what will be the situation already we see doctors we have some contacts with partners with doctors who are providing Medical Services they are doing surgeries using vinegar instead of the minimum anesthesia uh requirements they are treating people on the floor outside the hospitals they are very tired but still they are trying to find a way Medical Supply electricity access to water the the contagious diseases now are breaking in a very scary way in the overcrowded shelters in the UN and even beyond all of the information that we get unfortunately comes only from the shelters that are run by the we don't even count what is happening in the surrounded surrounding areas with the crowded Apartments similar to what my colleagues are facing so this is going to be an unimaginable imagin I can't even find words to describe what will happen if the situation continues to be like this with no humanitarian Supply fuel or water restructured in Gaza and most importantly if the ground Invasion occur in amid of all of what we are seeing already now what is your team doing to prepare for that scenario about a possible ground Invasion because everything is pointing towards that uh ground operation as as the uh Israeli government is calling it what are you doing to prepare for that I will be very Frank with you care has been providing the humanitarian services for war victims since 1945 since the second world war however now in 2023 we are unable to fulfill our mandate over the last days we were able to focus our our intervention from within a you know that and also from Egypt what all our supplies are on the border now what we try to do is to secure what we have from on the ground the worst case scenario that we built our intervention around is nothing compared to what we are seeing now no one I'm confirming no one is prepared to intervene if a a land Invasion occurs what we are seeing now is already massive we are learning from what we have implemented as care International in Mass Destruction like what happened in the earthquake in Turkey but all what we are trying to find is not even working or suitable if no if a ceasefire is not attended now if safe environment is provided for the humanitarian organizations to fulfill their mandate saving lives now we are talking about survival moment it's not Rehabilitation or restructuring only to help in people's in people survival mode hea thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today that was hea TB with the humanitarian organization care speaking to us from rala in the West Bank well let's get the latest from Gaza journalist hzm baloa is there and joined us now on the line ham we understand that fuel is about to run out in Gaza and without it there'll be no electricity what impact is that likely to have uh fuel is not only for electricity it's for everything for water supplies for desalination stations for drinking water for hospitals for uh um uh uh for grocery shops that that have some some supplies that remain there um um um for for Hygiene for cleaning and for collecting the trash from the streets I can see the piles of of of of trash in the street um because the the Ona and municipalities have no fuel for their tracks to collect these stretches so all aspects of Life affected by by by the shortage of a fuel not only the electricity Israel says that Hamas has hoarded fuel supplies and that that's where gazin should get their fuel from do people in Gaza see it that way well in Gaza they don't care about about what's happening on the military level or in the political level they care about their daily life um the fuel is shortage affecting their daily life there are lines of people are waiting to fill the galloons to carry some some water to their places as there is no pumping of the water to the tanks up in the the rooftops um um they they go for for long distance to to get some drinking water from some place is that they still provide the water um um they are looking at like yes sorry uh I was just hm could you walk us quickly through some of the things that you've witnessed there in Gaza during the last 24 hours well um um most most noticeable thing that I from early morning hours I I could hear the the artillery shows no stop in east of of of uh of Gaza strp particularly in bage refugee camp in the central Gaza uh there were some reports that there was some tanks entered the the area uh and there were uh some reports of of of Hamas Fighters fired some rockets at Israeli Jets particularly according to the statement Israeli helicopter and and you know I see now like I'm I'm close to the street to get some some signal in my phone um I see people go and to line at the bakeries and and some of them they carry empty gallons to to fill it with the water ham thank you very much for that update that was journalist ham baloa in
