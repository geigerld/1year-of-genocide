Hamas militants have released more hostages from Gaza they include 14 Israelis and three Tha Nationals who had been held captive in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks by the islamist militants whove been designated a terrorist group by the EU us and others Israel also freed 39 more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody now with the 4-day truce between Israel and Hamas now in its final day there are signs from both sides that it could be extended after more than 50 days in captivity hostages arrived from Gaza two Israeli hospitals for medical checks among them three Thai Nationals greeted Inside by previously released hostages none of them needing urgent care they're undergoing a medical and emotional evaluation by the medical and psychosocial team the youngest captive to be released was 4-year-old Abigail Eden a dual Israeli American citizen both her parents were killed in the Hamas October 7th Terror attacks you know she's free and she's in Israel now and uh so those who are now uh wrapping Abigail and love and care and the Supportive Services she needs she's been through a terrible trauma throughout the weekend reunions like these between 9-year-old hostage Emily cornberg and her sister brought hope amid the hostilities we finally got Emily back from the hands of the Gaz and terrorists uh she's lost a lot of weight um from her face and body uh but generally doing better than we expected um dozens of Palestinians were released from Israeli jails as part of the agreement crowds welcome their return in rala celebrating we are very happy thank God for this joy and we hope that all prisoners will be released as the pause and fighting nears its scheduled end calls to extend the truce are growing with both Israel and Hamas signaling there is a chance for a possible extension and for more on this we're going to bring in DW correspondent Tanya krer who's in Jerusalem for us it's good to see you Tanya so this is as we've been reporting the last day of the ceasefire agreement How likely is it that this deal will be extended at this point well I think it's still too early to say and at the moment the focus is on getting those last hostages out under this deal that 50 hostages should be freed uh within those 4 day of uh the PS and fighting and 150 Palestinian prisoners uh should be freed in exchange for that so we understand that Israel has received a list with the names but it seems also there are some problems we are also hearing from Hamas there's a problem with the list of the Palestinian prisoners and Qatar is uh Medi mediating at the moment you know that there are no last minute delays and of course then you know everybody is uh looking forward to see whether this deal could be extended as you said uh there is a provision in the outline of this agreement that for every 10 more hostages uh Hamas can uh uh free uh there would be another day of the uh Tru uh extended but at the moment we don't know uh whether this will happen we understand both sides have signaled they're interested in that and everybody Qatar Egypt and also the United States are working on that but we have to wait and see whether this will actually happen Tanya for the past few days we've been seeing these moving images of the hostages being reunited with their with their families but what more can you tell us about the state uh that these hostages are are in the ones who've been released well so far we only heard from the medical staff but also from some relatives and you know the medical staff doctors have said the last hostages that were released on Sunday especially the children they were in stable condition uh but there is one of the hostages an 84 year-old elderly woman uh she's in critical condition she was uh airlifted immediately after she was released uh to a hospital and of course there's also the concern about you know the trauma that uh the hostages have been uh going through especially also for the children but for some who only learn now what happened to their uh loved ones uh you know some of them have no home to go to of course this is something uh that is a concern uh in the long term as well and Israel's prime minister benam n he visited troops inside Gaza on Sunday what was his message there well I think think it's mainly a message uh to the domestic public I mean for prime minister to go into uh uh Gaza to go into this area basically showing or uh trying to show uh that we are in control here for now he reiterated again you know that Israel is uh you know might be resuming uh the war because they need to attain uh their their goals of eliminating Hamas of el eliminating uh their infrastructure but of course such a visit is also seen as a provocation I would say uh by many Palestinians all right and that is our correspondent Tanya Kramer reporting uh for us there in Jerusalem uh we wait to hear if indeed that truth will be extended thank you so much for your reporting Tanya and let's now move on to Jordan's capital Aman where we can speak to Ahmed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee count Council NGO uh we appreciate you being on the program Ahmed um the big question today is whether the truth uh is going to be extended what what are you hearing good morning um I mean like you report I mean there is a chance and we hope a genuine chance of of uh this truth being extended and the polls becoming a a permanent ceasefire really four days is is Never Enough five days is not enough a week month is not enough to uh you know recollect and and and go and support these these people um it's a disaster what is happening in Gaza and we need the weight of the world thrown Behind These negotiations the 11th Hour negotiations we hope that um we will get an outcome um for for the sake of the people for the sake of the hostages for the sake of the the death place for the sake of the heavily wounded uh it is Vital hours that we are uh getting to now now and we still we are still full of optimism we hope that um everyone will come to that agreement and extend that pause and Ahmed just give us a sense of how much Aid um organizations like yours managed to deliver over the past three days in during the truce it might it might look uh better and and more than we have seen before the truth however it's it's nowhere near enough we had a few trucks making their way into Gaza um to Bringing bringing Essentials Basic Essentials uh like water like mats like kitchen sets for people spoons plates uh blankets Etc but we are racing Against Time really and we can't operate in an environment where we know that the gates will close uh soon I mean we we need not a trickle we need a gsh of Aid coming through through Gaza I think now it's it's pretty futile to be talking about a number of trucks what we need is the you know is is for the gates to continue to open so that we can reach more people and give us a sense of your your preparations uh in the event that this uh the truce is is not going to be extended I mean that would be a disastrous scenario really for for everyone involved not just the Norwegian Refugee Council we are at five um shelters we are you know and providing help there we are providing some clean water purified water I mean we will lose all of that almost our um you know movement around Gaza we will lose that and obviously Northern Gaza we haven't even spoken about that it's it's almost unreachable very little has has got there we can't lose these very little gains that we have made and we need to capitalize on what we are making in terms of progress in terms of Aid if the ceasefire was to be agreed tomorrow Gaza would need years to go back to where it was before before this all um tick off and we need we need the International Community to put Humanity first and prioritize the needs of those people all right ammed bam is from the Norwegian Refugee Council uh we appreciate uh your time and insights thanks very much Ahmed thank
