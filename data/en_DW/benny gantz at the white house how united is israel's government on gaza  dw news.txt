and as those talks in Cairo continue Benny gun an influential member of the Israeli War cabinet has been meeting with top us officials at the White House this visit is being seen as further signs of Washington's growing frustration over the war in Gaza Gans is a former Defense Minister and political rival of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who agreed to enter an emergency Unity government following the October 7th Terror attacks by Hamas gans's meeting Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan yesterday he sat down with vice president kamla Harris who called for more Aid to be allowed into Gaza she also called for a ceasefire let's bring in DW correspondent Felix tomson who joins us now from Jerusalem so how is gans's visit being seen by netanyahu's Administration in Israel well you could say that uh the reactions from within Nan's government has been have been very very critical of Benny gun's visit one senior liid member has used the term Troy on horse to describe uh Benny gun's trip to the US and later to uh London as well um another prominent member of nany's government uh Finance Minister smotrich uh said the US is trying to divide the Israeli government and its Society um so reactions have been very very critic iCal and this comes as a time when um conflicts within netanyahu's government um are also growing on other issues so it's definitely one to watch in the coming weeks to see how netan and his government will deal uh with uh those issues and those uh conflicts within its own uh ranks it's it's no secret that the current US Administration is extremely frustrated with Israel we've just seen that from the rhetoric in the past weeks and how it has escalated um how United is the Israeli government in the face of that well it really depends if you if we're talking about the more right-wing elements of netanyahu's government you could say that they stand behind netanyahu's approach they even call for a more um say conservative rightwing approach meaning um less talks about a ceire less talks about reaching a deal with Hamas um more talks of uh in the war and reaching this this uh final victory that they talk about um on the other end there's Benny gans's party which is considered by many as the voice of reasons I would assume that it's also the case from from within the uh the uh American Administration um and uh this is a result of the uh very open criticism of the American Administration against the netan government and it's uh writing partly far our right elements indeed um it's going to be interesting to see how this pans out in the coming weeks in terms of the relations between the two countries and governments how high is the pressure on the Israeli government right now I mean can we expect major changes um either within the government itself or the wartime cabinet for example I don't think we're expecting we should expect any major changes just yet but having said that we are talking about a government that that's under pressure due to the war in Gaza due to other reasons for an instance the enlistment of the ultra Orthodox Community to the Israeli Army um and the uh Rising tensions with the US government is just something which adds more and more pressure upon the Israeli government at the moment um and uh this means uh we're going to see more and more voices from within Israel's liberal politics um demanding um demanding such actions such as uh uh guns's trip to the US and talking about him leaving the government again we're only we're also talking about a time in which uh the uh Israeli liberal uh part the part Israeli the liberal parts of the Israeli Society are also protesting calling for elections so it's going to be interesting to see how this pans out DW correspondent Felix Thompson thank you meanwhile the United States and Jordan have air dropped more Aid packages into the Gaza Strip the US military says that almost 37,000 meals were dropped into the territory in a joint operation on Tuesday but with the humanitarian crisis nearing catastrophic levels critics say the amount is only a fraction of what is needed and the UN is calling on the International Community to quote flood Gaza with Aid panic and Chaos as men in Gaza City run around in a frenzy to find food countries such as Egypt Jordan France and now the US have been dropping aid from above but there are too many people in need and there's not enough Aid we have the willingness and ability to Bear it but is there a father in the world who can see his children writhing in hunger in front of him and remain silent even if the price is risking his life just like all these people who risk their lives in order to obtain what is not even enough for a crumb of flour or Aid or canned food yesterday some expired canned goods arrived containing mold and fungus we are not animals as they described us over the weekend workers from the UN and the who rushed into to provide supplies to hospitals medicines and fuel are running critically low and this is costing children their lives unfortunately yes we have lost two babies here they had pneumonia but they died because of the power cut the power went off at 4:00 a.m. and at 8:00 a.m. we were out of oxygen many others have died from Hunger according to the visiting team from the W there is no milk or anything the situ is bad Indescribable we're not able to get him anything these deaths come as the bombing outside continues and bodies fill up floors somebody so young they barely had the chance to
