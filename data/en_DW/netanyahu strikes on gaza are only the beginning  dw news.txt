rushing the injured to hospital after an air strike in Gaza City Israel's military stepped up air strikes on Hamas targets a week after Hamas launched Terror attacks in Israel that killed more than 1,000 people Amid bombardments and ground raids Israel's military says it dropped pamphlet giving civilians in Northern Gaza a new time window to evacuate to the South the warning comes ahead of an expected ground Invasion by Israel but the United Nations is urging Israel to revoke the evacuation order warning of a humanitarian disaster they are calling for an end to The Siege on Gaza and the passage of Aid our call now is uh for uh one humanitarian poses and two humanitarian corridors uh safe passages for Aid to reach uh the children and families in in the Gaza Strip uh also the protection of children is is Paramount and it's the responsibility of all parties to the to the conflict Israel's Army accuses Hamas of stopping civilians from evacuating and stress that its Target in Gaza is Hamas terrorists the Palestinian civilians in Gaza are not our enemies we don't assess them as such and we don't Target them as such if they were obviously the situation in Gaza would be totally different we are trying to do the right thing we are trying to evacuate civilians in order to minimize the risk for them meanwhile to Israel's North in Lebanon Israel's Army says it killed several terrorists trying to cross the border lebanon's Hezbollah a militant group backed by Iran has said it is prepared to join its Ally Hamas in fighting Israel fears are amounting that the conflict between Hamas and Israel could spill over across the region our correspondent Tanya Kramer has been reporting from Israel close to the border with Gaza and I asked her earlier if there is a sense that a fullscale ground offensive is imminent well this is of course a big question but I don't think they will tell us you know when they exactly move in there will still be this moment of surprise but I mean what they're trying to do now what they've been saying since yesterday is to call on the people in Northern Gaza which includes Gaza City the heart of Gaza where over 1 million people are in this area you to move down south they said that they have these two main roads that are usually the main roads when you are in Gaza you travel from the north to the South that people should take those and these are some kind of safe corridors to travel uh to the center of Gaza or to the South uh this is at the moment uh what they're telling people there to move because as uh one of um the army people there said they will hit hard and they're calling on people to move but it's very very difficult we're hearing also from the you know humanitarian side I mean it's not so easy for people just uh to move South uh in in in in in this moment yeah huge concerns from the UN and from International Aid groups there about a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza what can you tell us about the conditions uh inside Gaza right now well I mean I managed to talk uh to very few people it's very difficult with the communication and you know some of them are actually moving from place to place in the past days looking for a safe space I mean those people have move now to the center but there are many many others they can't I mean if you look at elderly people or so or if you don't have a car or something you know what what do you do I mean it's it's just uh the the situation has a lot of confusion what to do I mean we're hearing from the humanitarian organizations how dire the situation is uh also you have to understand you know the electricity uh at least the the electricity that comes from Israel was cut off um that has also consequences of course then the main power plant because no fuel is coming in has a cut off so there's mainly at least for the civilian population uh there are all these problems that have uh the hospitals of course then have problems for their generators the water pumps have problems so I mean all of this together but I think the main issue right now for people in in these areas and also in the South there have been still air strikes so is to to find some kind of safe space but there is basically no safe Zone in Gaza you're basically trapped in there and I think this is uh psychologically also it's it's a very difficult situation from what I'm hearing there uh from from people absolutely uh tell us a little bit more about military operations um on Friday we know the Israeli Army said it had conducted raids into Gaza um both battling militants there and also so looking out for information about hostages what can you tell us about what the current situation is like at the border well we're here near the Gaza border and we've been to areas where you know there's a buildup of Tanks of the um uh infantry mainly here um I mean at the moment they're not moving I think they're waiting now for the next step for for their orders uh to what comes next of course you have still uh we had so rocket barag is coming out in the past half an hour or so from Gaza of course there's also the Navy around Gaza and the mediterranian uh you have the artillery from here the air strikes on Gaza so the war is going on um and of course everybody's waiting now to see what happens after this uh 4:00 deadline might it be a bit flexible uh what will happen next uh we don't know we just have to to see what the next hours here will bring and we will be keeping you posted here on DW thank you so so much Tanya for your reporting that is our correspondent Tanya Kramer near the border with Gaza now Israel has called up some 360,000 reservists and mass troops and tanks along the border with Gaza the Palestinian territory has been under siege in a near constant ground and air bombardment Israel says a senior Hamas military commander who it says led the attacks a week ago has been killed in the air strikes Israel is believed to be planning a major ground offensive as we've heard although no such decision has yet been announced DW senior International correspondent funny faar is reporting for us from Jerusalem I spoke to her earlier and asked her about the preparations being made for a possible ground offensive that's the big question really because israelian government did not elaborate on when they're going to start the ground offensive but also once they start it how long it's going to last so everybody can just speculate on it and we do not want to do that but rather look at the indications here what may be the next step and one clear indication of that that ground offensive appears to be quite imminent is just the very fact that there's a massive troop buildup israelian troop build up very close to the Gaza border second they've been for the first time in fact already israelian soldiers on the ground in Gaza uh trying to take out they say uh Hamas militants but also trying to find some sort of an Evidence where the hostages are estimated 150 people have been abducted on a Saturday last week exactly One Week Ago by Hamas militants where are they now one has to imagine that that local raid that apparently took place in remal is just a few kilometers from the city center from Gaza City that again is the main base to say so with the vast Labyrinth uh on the ground for Hamas militants and the third indication that a ground offensive appears quite likely uh very soon is basically that Israel keeps repeating ordering uh people Palestinians to move from the north to the South we speaking here about the half of the population in Gaza strips about 1 million people that are not supposed to leave go to the South which of course makes the impression at at the same time that the south is safe this is not the case there have been several air strikes since Saturday hundreds of them from all sides when it comes to uh Gaza but certainly the strongest ones were in the north so taking those points a a into consideration that ground offensive is just a matter of time people do expect that it's going to be some sort of a surprise when that's going to take place obviously uh not to give away information to a people uh to the Hamas militants in Gaza Strip and you've mentioned it's not just a matter of when it begins but also how long it lasts um in a rare television address we heard prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasizing that this is quote only the beginning do you think with this he is addressing Hamas or is this a message to Israelis that they can expect this to go on for a long time I think by that he's readdressing uh several entities to say so uh first of all he's addressing people here domestically Israelis who are by the way as we're speaking uh hundreds of of them are taking to the street protesting asking for the loved ones to be to to return to come back the uh people who are being held captive since Saturday in Gaza STP so people really are demanding a very forceful and very strong reaction there uh by uh by the Israeli military but you will also hear voices here on the ground of people just simply being concerned because they do not know what the next step that ground offensive is going to mean for people here in re in in Israel uh also if he listen to this message that he says uh um this is just the beginning that is of course also a clear message to the Hamas militants that they know uh they're going to pay the price for what happened on Saturday their attack on Saturday killing very ordinary very innocent uh uh uh people and third it is a message also into the region basically trying to express do not get involved Iran do not get involved Iran backed Hezbollah the militant group in the north uh rather in Lebanon uh and there have been a lot of exchanges of of fire between uh uh Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel already so they potentially another starting at the same time prime minister netan simply just wants to appear strong once has to understand before all of this started on Saturday there have been massive demonstrations here on the street of Israel uh demanding change uh when it comes to the Israeli government there been a lot of protest uh revolving around the controversial judicial reform so now prime minister netan is trying to uh display unity in Israel and he needs that Unity he needs people uh to support him in what's to come and nobody exactly just knows what the consequences what the Fallout is going to be of that next step forward by Israel in their undertaking as they say to quote as prime minister Nano says to crush Hamas and funny just before I let you go you mentioned it's now been a week since those attacks by Hamas do you think a tragedy of this magnitude is going to portend some kind of major change in Israeli Society I think it's really too early to say uh as I say the even though there is a Unity building up here and people are really sticking together how to help each other how to help the people the israelian people who have been displaced from alongside uh uh the from The Villages which are close to the Gaza border since Saturday everybody's trying to uh be together not really get involved too much into uh israelian politics and domestic politics whether that's going to uh bring any changes really too early to say as we just simply do not know how this entire situation is going to continue and how it is going to evolve but one thing we can say for sure most people here have more questions than answers of what's going to happen funny faar thank you so much for your reporting we really appreciate it to find out more about Israel's military planning I spoke earlier to the idf's operations officer um Ariel who declined to give his full name and I asked him how Israel can ensure the safety of civilians uh if it attacks Gaza so on Saturday morning last uh last week we woke up to a terrible morning where more than 1,500 terrorists Isis terrorists Hamas terrorists attacked and muiz citizens babies inside Israeli uh Israeli Villages along the Gaza Strip yesari question a disgusting attack I'm sorry I have to jump in there that there's no question this was a disgusting attack on Israeli civilians but I'm asking about your response now in the Gaza Strip and I'm wondering what your plans are to make sure that there aren't more innocent civilians killed uh from Gaza as Israel begins its ground offensive well as it being Hamas is responsible for everything that happens inside the Gaza Strip the Israeli uh IDF will do anything to bring back the security to those citizens around the G around the Villages who lost it in at at once the Israeli Army were prepared to do whatever is needed there has not not been anything declared but we have nothing against the citizens of Gaza we have something against Hamas who was who decided to take out this attack this horrific attack which I myself took part on defending citizens in the city of K in the village of Kim and Nim the things I saw with with my own eyes I've never seen in my in my entire life it sounds like a ground offensive now in response um is correct me if I'm I'm wrong there in such a densely populated area you know where you have elderly people and women and children who may not have gotten out uh over the last day I want to know how you will be able to launch operations um that distinguish between civilians and militants well this is a this this has been our challenge for for many years Hamas is a terrorist organization who embeds itself inside uh population uh we call for the PE for the people of the city of Gaza to evacuate we understand that it takes time we have nothing against the Citizens we only have those who are protecting Kamas and those who are aiding them uh and hiding the hostages that were taken into Gaza so that is why we give the we give we did give the opportunity and we're giving the opportunity we are only looking out for Hamas terrorists we have to change the situation we cannot go back before the situation in this area has changed we cannot live alongside such an unhuman terrorist uh Organization no one none of our citizens can live with that and that is our main goal in this operation like you said there has been no uh order but we are ready to do whatever it's needed whether in the South or in the north uh we are ready yeah yeah that is my question um by which metric will you measure a successful military offensive here what is the end goal um and when will it have been met the situation the security situation needs to change we've been suffering from these terrorists for many many years our civilians suffered and the horrific attack on Saturday was the high point the situation needs to change Hamas cannot keep on ruling that area and letting out attacks on our people and sending missiles into uh densely populated areas like Tel Aviv and Etc this situation will change that's what I can say so yeah my question is what will ch the IDF has hit Hamas many times since Israel unilaterally disengaged in 2005 and yet Hamas is still there still carrying out these gruesome attacks um why will this time be different what is the plan well the the last attack we saw on Saturday was something we haven't seen ever before we saw in small quantities but this was something else what needs to change is Hamas cannot cannot be in power in that area cannot have the the military power to attack and to threaten our people threaten the people of Israel so it needs to change if we need to uh go and attack every single terrorist in the Gaza Strip that's what we do but our aim is the terrorists is their army capability capabilities the Rockets or anything else they used to to to murder to destroy families to burn them live in their homes anything they used anyone that was part of it and our other goal is to get those who have been kidnapped Gaza Afra I'm afraid I still don't see clearly how this is uh going to be achieved I'm also curious about whenever this does end what kind of assurances Israel can provide to the people that have been told uh to leave their homes to evacuate from the north um what assurances can you give that they will at some point be able to go home or or to whatever is left of them well that question they will have to ask Hamas our only insurances right now are for the people of Israel that we will protect them and do anything we need to do so they can go back to their homes we have nothing against the population that's not our aim our aim are terrorists and if we can make God's also a better place for those who are evacuating now we will Hamas is a terrorist organization not only towards Israelis but also towards the Palestinians well thank you very much Ariel for joining us um that is Ariel from the IDF we very much appreciate your time thank you very
