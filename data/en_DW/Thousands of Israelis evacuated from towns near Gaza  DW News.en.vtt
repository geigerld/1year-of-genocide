00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
the reason I thought we perhaps better

the reason I thought we perhaps better
take<00:03:43.120><c> cover</c><00:03:43.360><c> is</c><00:03:43.439><c> it</c><00:03:43.560><c> was</c><00:03:43.680><c> actually</c><00:03:43.879><c> quite</c><00:03:44.080><c> low</c>

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
take cover is it was actually quite low

the last couple of days uh we where
 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.550 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days uh we where

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
we're positioned actually uh the the

we're positioned actually uh the the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
Rockets and the the missiles then they
 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.069 align:start position:0%
Rockets and the the missiles then they
they<00:03:55.319><c> rarely</c><00:03:55.640><c> make</c><00:03:55.840><c> landfall</c><00:03:56.360><c> in</c><00:03:56.560><c> this</c><00:03:56.760><c> area</c>

they rarely make landfall in this area
 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.429 align:start position:0%
they rarely make landfall in this area

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
but what we have to look out for of
 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.270 align:start position:0%
but what we have to look out for of
course<00:03:58.640><c> is</c><00:03:59.000><c> the</c><00:03:59.159><c> falling</c><00:03:59.640><c> trapnel</c><00:04:00.040><c> from</c><00:04:00.159><c> the</c>

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
course is the falling trapnel from the
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.270 align:start position:0%
course is the falling trapnel from the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.710 align:start position:0%

excuse<00:04:03.640><c> me</c><00:04:04.439><c> uh</c><00:04:04.640><c> but</c><00:04:04.799><c> that</c><00:04:04.920><c> has</c><00:04:05.079><c> been</c><00:04:05.280><c> basically</c>

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh but that has been basically
 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.750 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh but that has been basically

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
day but as I was talking about before we
 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
day but as I was talking about before we
got<00:04:12.959><c> cut</c><00:04:13.200><c> off</c><00:04:13.439><c> was</c><00:04:13.599><c> of</c><00:04:13.720><c> course</c><00:04:13.879><c> the</c><00:04:14.000><c> troop</c>

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.430 align:start position:0%

to<00:04:16.600><c> be</c><00:04:17.400><c> Israel's</c><00:04:18.079><c> next</c><00:04:18.400><c> move</c><00:04:18.840><c> which</c><00:04:19.040><c> looks</c><00:04:19.280><c> to</c>

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be Israel's next move which looks to
 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
to be Israel's next move which looks to
be<00:04:19.720><c> like</c><00:04:19.880><c> it's</c><00:04:20.040><c> going</c><00:04:20.199><c> to</c><00:04:20.280><c> be</c><00:04:20.400><c> a</c><00:04:20.479><c> very</c><00:04:20.680><c> big</c>

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
