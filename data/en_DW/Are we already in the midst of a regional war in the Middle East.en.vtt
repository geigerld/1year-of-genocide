00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.790 align:start position:0%
as well and we're seeing it now in
action<00:09:42.959><c> and</c><00:09:43.120><c> so</c><00:09:43.600><c> I</c><00:09:43.680><c> think</c><00:09:44.079><c> that</c><00:09:44.279><c> is</c><00:09:44.440><c> something</c>

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
that is both directly and indirectly a

that is both directly and indirectly a
