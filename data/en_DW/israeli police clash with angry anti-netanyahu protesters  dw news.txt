emotions are boiling over on the streets of Tel Aviv meanwhile with demands for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign 136 hostages are still being held by Hamas and Gaza and their families are running out of patience dozens blocked a major highway on Saturday night lighting bonfires an Angry Crowd marched on Military headquarters demanding a deal with Hamas to free the remaining hostages DW's Ben fulan reports the battle lines are drawn between the demonstrators and police a 1,000 strong crowd outside military headquarters police are now moving in some of them on Horseback to subdue the protesters things are reaching Tipping Point here in [Applause] Tel they're taking away one protester after the next they shouted the police shame on you what they're doing is they're attacking protesters um and uh arresting peaceful uh uh protesters and attacking them uh choking them trampling them uh doing exactly what you would expect from a corrupt militia in a in a dictatorial country now they're using uh these horses you do not need to do that in order to uh clear the streets uh the protests have been very peace they've also been growing every week and becoming more and more political this was a nation in shock just for months ago they were dealing with the trauma of October 7 they were dealing with a war against Hamas now their Fury is pointed directly at the Israeli government this parliament of ours right now is the government of criminals and the Parliament of criminals which are busy robbing the um the economy of this state and uh taking care of private interests instead of taking care of the state which is really what we need right now just up the road the families of hostages block a highway setting bonfires of Blaze they want the immediate release of the captives the same message a kilometer away at habima Square residents of Tel Aviv tell me about their fears for Israeli and Palestinian lives I'm here because I am a I am strongly against the violence that is happening in the Gaza Street as a Israeli citizen I'm I'm devastated to live my life normally while this is happening an hour away from me the situation is just unbearable the government we have here is just destroying the country destroying the future of my children we are in a situation that is so sad and so deeply deeply disturbing that we just cannot continue to stay home and not say anything we need to have elections never ever so many people have died in Israel in one war and this is one government that is in charge for this and they're not taking any responsibility for what happened and it's unbelievable 126 days of War how much longer will netanyahu's Coalition last let's bring in our Jerusalem correspondent Tanya Kramer Tanya protesters are demanding the return of the hostages that remain in Gaza but there's a lot more Brewing under the surface isn't there well absolutely and uh we've seen this here in the past weeks that you know those protests have been growing louder and larger you see sometimes on Saturday evenings there now anti-government protests that are merging then into those vigils and protests uh for bringing uh the remaining hostages uh home so there are many people out here in the streets uh in uh Israel while you have to say there's still a large majority of the Israeli public supporting the war but there's a lot of anger in how uh the Israeli government is handling uh the particular issue of the hostages over 130 hostages are still held in Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups and uh over about 20 of them are presumed dead and people here are saying that uh their time is basically running out uh that the uh government policy of maximum pressure on Hamas to reach another deal is clearly not uh working out but at the same time we are seeing also that more more people are coming out uh and saying that there needs to be a change in leadership and calling for elections and as the report said uh more and more people are criticizing uh prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu in particular uh people here are very angry uh at him because he has never taken uh full responsibility uh for the security failures uh linked to the October 7 uh Terror attacks by uh Hamas and also they're saying he's lacking a clear view or he's not uh showing you know what will happen uh after uh the war in Gaza ends particularly also given uh that there might be another escalation uh between Israel and Hezbollah in the north potentially Another War uh coming up in the region criticism is as you as you point out growing louder and louder inside the country as well as outside how has the government responded so far well they didn't really respond on to it and I think um what we've been hearing from prime minister Netanyahu especially is that he said he's deferring all the criticism to after the war he has said we're in a war the country needs to stand together this is also why then you know the smaller War cabinet was formed where some of the opposition uh figures joined but we are seeing more and more cracks there and I think if they would decide at some point um you know that they wouldn't stay in this war cabinet then we might see things uh unravel but for the time being it is more uh the Mantra by prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu uh that everything else you know the investigation what happened on October 7 uh uh how whether there will be elections this is all deferred to someday after whenever that will be an approach that doesn't seem to convince many Israelis that was Tanya Kramer thank you so
