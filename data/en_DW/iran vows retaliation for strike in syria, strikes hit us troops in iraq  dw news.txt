Iran is threatening retaliation following a suspected Israeli air strike in Syria the attack which flattened a building in the capital Damascus killed five members of Tan's paramilitary revolutionary guard Iran's president accuses Israel of spreading instability in the region and says the attack will not be left unanswered Israel has not claimed responsibility but the strike comes just days after Iran struck what it called an Israeli spy headquarters in Northern Iraq and the US military says several of its troops were injured in another attack on an air base in Western Iraq us Central Command says iran-backed militants launched multiple missiles and Rockets at the al-asad airbase a us-led coalition facility it says most of the projectiles were intercepted but some struck the facility the US says its troops St stationed in Iraq and Syria have faced more than 140 attacks by tan Allied Fighters since the start of the Israel hamus war in October Christen hellberg Middle East expert joins me now from Berlin uh Christian would you characterize this as a harmful but limited tit fortat or the start of a regional war that many feared could very well happen well actually we are seeing that this war in Gaza has been spilling over as it is an old conflict that has been going on for decades between Israel and its so-called access of resistance on one side and Iran and its so-called access of resistance on one side and Israel and the US on the other side so what has happened after October 7th is that as Hamas considers itself to be a member of this AIS of resistance every other militia would jump in trying to help and step up pressure in Israel so this is what has been happening in southern Lebanon by hisbah we have seen this with the houthi militia that are attacking naval ships in the Red Sea and we have been seeing this uh looking at the Iranian back militias in Iraq and Syria that have been attacking US troops in Northern Iraq and Northeast Syria and have tried to attack Israeli targets so everybody's trying to portray it himself as a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause while at the same time they are trying to avoid a full-blown War it's more an exchange of Fire portraying oneself as being determined uh without getting into a direct direct confrontation between Israel and Iran or even the US and Iran and just so our viewers can have some levels of understanding here and Nuance uh let's focus on Syria for a moment why are members of the Iranian uh mil revolutionary guard in Syria in the first place Iran is a long-standing Ally of the Syrian regime and we should not forget that it was Iranian militias on the ground that together with the Russian Air Force helped to save Bashar Al Assad I mean they kept him in power so Iran used the last few years to build up a military presence in Syria which is something that Israel considers to be an existential threat because Syria and Israel are sharing a border the Golan Heights the Golan Heights are occupied by Israel so Syria and Israel are in a war in a state of War officially so this is why Israel has continuously attacked Iranian targets inside Syria which were usually military facilities the airport of Damascus the airport in Aleppo um transportation because all the weapons that are going to hisbah in Lebanon has to cross through Syria but this attack that we've seen in the middle of Damascus is a definite escalation because it is in the middle of a neighborhood within Damascus the presidential Palace is close by so it is another step of escalating this war Iran blames Israel for the attack How likely is that Israel has a long history of targeted killings in the region they have been stepping up this strategy during the last few months they have killed his Bola commanders Hamas commanders in Lebanon and in Syria so I don't think anybody has a doubt although the Israeli leadership never officially claims responsibility to not put their allies in the west into trouble but I think nobody has a doubt here and Israel wants to send a clear message that every Hamas and hisbah Commander or Iranian revolutionary Guard general is not safe wherever they are and they cannot get hold on the Hamas leadership within Gaza so they are try trying maybe to send this strong message outside uh to go after these kind of leaders in the neighboring countries Christian no doubt this is a delicate potentially dangerous Dynamic what's likely to happen next Iran has to reate because it's a message of Saving Face basically internally and externally so they will do this indirectly as we have seen before uh there might be attacks from Syrian soil by Iranian militias towards Israel from the Golan Heights there might be other attacks and we have just seen one on US troops in Northern Iraq and Northeast Syria which has been happening continuously there might be direct missile attacks from Iranian soil against Israeli and US targets but all these attacks have been very limited in their damage so it's more a symbolic meaning it's a sending of messages saying that we are ready to react we are able to react in case you want to escalate any further but I don't see a strong interest neither by Iran nor by Israel or the US to get into a fullblown regional War at this time the only group that would be interested is Hamas but we have seen at the same time that all these attacks are limited so that they will not cause a major or at least direct confrontation Iran wants to build up its nuclear potential before getting into this direct confrontation and they have not finished so far that's a Middle East expert chrisen Helberg many many thanks for your insights thanks to you and to try to understand all this uh let's welcome amnon Iran a professor of international politics of the Middle East at City University of London C we have air strikes in Iraq Syria which we just mentioned but also Lebanon and Yemen recently is there a risk of a regional War do you think I think there is certainly a risk for a regional War uh at this point we we're seeing that most of the players involved Iran Israel the United States Iran's proxies hisbah and the hthis are trying to keep the conflict uh underneath the threshold of a full-blown War however if we look at the trajectory over the last month we've seen that um the conflict has inched closer to a regional War than backing away from it so we're not there yet but the danger is considerable and there's a been a split as you know better than I between Israel United States on the future of Gaza and the two-state solution with Joe Biden and uh prime minister Netanyahu not seeing eye to eye at all is that disagreement um feeding into the overall Regional tension somehow I'm not sure it's feeding into the regional tension at the moment but certainly uh it is a major flasho between the United States uh and Israel and it is uh definitely making it more difficult for Israel to achieve uh its War goals despite the use of really uh devastating military force uh by Israel uh very very large amounts of ammunition and so on uh it is difficult to see what strategic goals the Israelis have achieved so far and there is growing critic ISM within Israel that without a Clear Vision for the day after as it is called there um it will be difficult to translate the military maneuver into uh successful political aims certainly the ones that were self-proclaimed by the Israeli War cabinet and what space is there left for diplomacy now it feels like things have have gotten very military and tit fortat and and escalating yes I think there is still uh room for diplomacy the United States and France are trying to find some kind of resolution for the ongoing skirmishes on the Israeli Lebanese border some sort of deal which will involve Israel and hisbah uh finding uh some Middle Ground uh and hisbah forces being withdrawn to the uh to an agreed Point North of the Israeli border and Israel uh in return agreeing to some sort of concessions on the Israeli Lebanese border but so far there hasn't been a breakthrough and moreover the Israeli are entrenched in their position hisbah has rejected so far the American and French proposals and the Israeli government is under growing mounting internal pressure to enable 880,000 of its citizens which have been effectively evacuated from the northern border to return to their homes but an agreement with hisbah that is impossible from a security point of view so everybody's entrenched uh everybody I think is looking for who will uh if you like Flinch first the there is still some room for FY but the space is being reduced understood and thank you for that Insight andon Aran a professor of international politics of the Middle East joining us
