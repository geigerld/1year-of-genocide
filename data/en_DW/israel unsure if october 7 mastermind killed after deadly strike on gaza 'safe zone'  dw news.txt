an Israeli attack on a humanitarian Zone in the Gaza Strip has killed and injured hundreds of people Israel says it was targeting two Hamas commanders including Muhammad daif one of the planners of the October 7 terrorist attacks it's not clear whether he was among the victims but Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has restated his pledge to track down every Hamas leader the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 90 people were killed in the Strunk which took place on a camp for displaced Palestinians in the southern city of hit the aftermath the smoldering Embers of the al- maasi displacement Camp are designated safe Zone I was displaced 12 times this was meant to be the safest area in K Yunis the busiest area my neighbors are elderly people women and children they are all civilians I was sitting in my tent when the tents around me and this building were hit we started running I got out of the tent and ran into the street the bombing was relentless the whole street was full of bodies we started running are these the humanitarian areas that Netanyahu talks about there are no humanitarian areas or safe areas the Israeli Army say they were targeting two Hamas commanders who they claim were hiding among civilians one of the targets was Muhammad da Israel believes he was one of the masterminds of the October 7th Terror attacks a Hamas official denied the claims by the Israeli military accusing it of intentionally targeting civilians the attack on al- maasi is the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on areas in Gaza where displaced Palestinians are Sheltering we can speak now to journalist balik sladin who joins us from Tel Aviv balik Benjamin nety who's just been speaking what's he had to say about the strike yes so Natan confirmed that the strike happened and the target of the strike was Muhammad Dave and his debuty as well one of the senior commanders in KH yunes the central part of the Gaza Strip Nat didn't say that or didn't confirm whether he was killed or not but uh he said that Israel will actually um go after every single Hamas leader and specifically speaking about Muhammad Z who has has been a symbol uh in the Palestinian um Minds in general but specifically in Hamas and with all of his knowledge and all of his capabilities then we can say that if that attack it did successfully kill him then this would be the most significant assassination since the beginning of this war okay let's talk a little bit more about Muhammad if Israel has been after him for quite a while now for quite a while now tell us who he is and why he so important yes so it has been said that uh he actually survived a number of assassination attempts before five or six times some people would even say seven times so so this is the eighth time that Israel sted to assassinate him uh he had a long of course uh um history with Israel military and has been um the de facto at least chief the military chief of the Kasam brigades the the Hamas military wing and that's why Israel is after him it's not only about the October 7th attack he obviously was one of the masterminds but also for future purposes uh when we talk about hamas's possible strategic Rehabilitation Muhammad would have played a key u element there so now again if he was actually killed then this is a huge uh slap for him we can call this way belue just quickly if you don't mind ceasefire talks are still taking place in katar and Egypt what's Netanyahu had to say about that well first of all we had to update that D Bara the head of the Mad will travel to Doha this week again so the ceasefire talks are continuing there has been some worrying that this attack could actually lead to some um sabotaging of the talks but the estimation in Israel that could be a tactical just you know announcing that for a few days there will be no negotiations but that will not eventually affect the negotiations so we We are continuing and watching that okay journalist balik sadine thank you so much for your reporting thank you professor of law Michael link of Western University in Ontario is a former un special rur for the Palestinian territories he told me about the legal implications of the strike um international law is very clear that during a combat uh Zone um that the attacking armies have to distinguish very clearly between combatants and civilians as your target um and this has been a running theme throughout the nine months uh of this particular War where Israel claims that it's shooting at targets that are only aimed at Hamas militants or militants from other uh Palestinian armed groups but where the consequence has been thousands and thousands of uh of Civilian deaths and uh and injuries with respect to this um and most leading human rights organizations that have examined uh both the Israeli claims and the facts that they've been able to gather on the on the ground have concluded that Israel has been indiscriminate uh in its use of military force resulting in these thousands of Civilian deaths even Joe Biden has said in several occasions that Israel's attacks have been indiscriminate looking at the other side what about hamas's obligations is there evidence of Palestinian civilians being used by the militants as human Shields yes look that's a claim that Israel often makes um uh Hamas does fight in a in a densely populated Urban uh area um and it is obliged to try to stay away from civilians or putting them in harm but the fact that they are fighting in a uh densely populated civilian area does not uh excuse uh or relieve the other Army in this case the Israel Army from taking every precaution uh to distinguish between civilian and uh uh and combatant and we've seen I guess what's happened today this is I think the fifth straight day of missile attacks that have resulted in substantial uh Palestinian civilian deaths uh where Israel has said it's attacking militants but the consequence has been this enormous death told among civilians and Michael you mentioned the word consequences uh or consequence which uh sets off a light bulb for me what will the consequences of this war be for both sides well one can only hope that there's going to be a reckoning one day for for the leadership of both sides um in the heg we know that the um prosecutor of the international criminal court in May uh made application to uh uh to the court itself for arrest warrants for three senior Hamas leaders and for the Israeli Prime Minister and the Israeli defense minister um that has yet those arrest warrants have yet to be decided upon or issued by the court but it's be it's it's a slow but necessary first start in trying to bring some uh issue of accountability uh to not only this nine-month-old War but the to the 57 year-old occupation um the the issue is and this has been repeated in a number of United Nations reports that there is a almost total impunity and a lack of accountability with respect to both Israel and Hamas uh in in the various conflicts that have gone for the last 15 years in particular in Gaza and the UN has repeatedly said this has to end and in the meantime the fighting continues the deaths continue Michael link from Western University in Canada thank you very much for taking us through that thank you very much for having me and our Jerusalem correspondent Tanya Kramer joins us now Tanya good to see you what more is the Israeli military saying about this strike well the Israeli military basically says said it targeted what they described as an area compound uh with militants in it and where they had intelligence at that time that Muhammad Dave and another uh senior Commander were there on the ground and another key factor to carry out that strike for them was that there appeared to be no uh hostages uh around them now they have they have not denied that this area was in a so-called designated safer Zone uh an extended safer Zone uh near in the western part of KH Yunis where tens of thousands of Palestinians are actually uh Sheltering they also have released uh some satellite imagery uh showing uh the target but you can also see on that uh uh on these photos that there are tents and structures uh nearby and what we're hearing there from eyewitnesses and also of course those footage that's coming there from uh on social media is what people are saying there were several plasts and it's believed that those plasts also affect of course the surrounding areas and what we've been seeing uh during the course of the day is people trying to rescue uh people with their bare hands also carrying them with cloth or carpets uh to the uh nearby hospital the alasa hospital uh Rescue Services they have said that they are overwhelmed now after 9 months of war that they have difficulties to take in so many casualties now now Hamas has said that 71 people were killed uh we don't know the breakdown whether there were any militants among them but over 300 people injured with probably still injuries Rising so it's certainly not that there is a safe zone for people what many people have said for many months now Natan at the beginning of your answer you mentioned Muhammad daif Israel has been after him for quite a long time now tell us who is he and why is he so important to them well Muhammad Dave is a very uh somehow elusive figure and and Israel has tried for many many years to assassinate him actually he is uh the number two uh of Gaza militants the head of the military Wing the Kasam prades but also number two after Yahya Sina that Israel is also uh trying uh to get and he is as you heard in the report considered one of the architects of October but also Israel sees him for many years behind many of the attacks that were carried out by Hamas for many years and it's so elusive that there's even no real photo or photo that's undated so many people don't even know uh what he actually uh looks like right now Hamas officials have denied that any of their leaders was killed or targeted and they have said uh this is just an excuse for yet another Massacre as they put it so they the Army has said they are still verifying so it might take some time until we know whether they confirm that they targeted him but whether we know whether he was killed our Jerusalem correspondent Tanya Kramer there Tanya thank you
