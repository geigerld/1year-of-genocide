Iran says that Israel will pay for the assassination of hamas's top political leader isma Haner he was killed in an air strike in Teran thousands have gathered in the Iranian capital for a funeral honoring the leader of the Palestinian party and militant group Hamas he was also the chief negotiator in talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire with Israel Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Kam spoke at the ceremony Iran holds Israel responsible for the killing and has said that they will make Israel regret the move in Tel Aviv the Israeli War cabinet met to discuss Rising tensions Israel has not confirmed or denied that it was behind the attack that killed Haner but it did announce that it was responsible for an air strike on a suburb of Beirut that killed a Hezbollah Commander prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to reassure israelies that the country is ready to face down threats from both Iran and lebanon's Hezbollah there are challenging days ahead of us since the attack in Beirut threats have been heard from all sides we are prepared for any scenario and we will stand United and determined against any threat Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us on any front D Rebecca is following developments from Jerusalem I asked her how worried people are about retaliation from Iran well that's right that is reporting coming from the New York Times to say that Ayatollah hman has ordered a direct attack they've certainly said publicly that they will be responding and retaliating as you've just been reporting against what they see as an Israeli attack of course Israel haven't claimed responsibility publicly although Benjamin Netanyahu did hinted it last night in his address to the nation saying that Israel had had a devastating a devastating blow to Iran's proxies in the plural because let's not forget we're talking about two assassinations in less than a 24-hour period one uh just hours before the ishan assass assassination in Iran uh one of the key commanders of the Hezbollah group was killed in Beirut and Israel did claim responsibility for that attack so Iran certainly saying that they will come out in uh defense and you know it's hardly surprising this was an very embarrassing blow for Iran that let's say Israel or that an assassination was able to take place inside on their Sovereign soil so they they have little choice but to retaliate now whether or not they do it on Sovereign Israeli soil of course remains to be seen there has been precedent of that we saw that happen for the first time in April when Iran retaliated to another assass assassination that they believe uh Israel carried out uh and they you know sent hundreds of missiles and drones into uh Israeli airspace most of course were shot out by Israel and its allies but there is certainly precedent for that and we'll just have to see how big an attack Iran are prepared to uh to to to give Israel but we are talking also there are people talking about a three fronted or multif fronted attack where all of Iran's proxies May coordinate including the houis uh from Yemen and Hezbollah and Hamas as well so we'll just have to see how big it is and then of course what that means in terms of a wider conflict in the region Hamas leader is Hanya was involved in the negotiations with Israel on a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of the hostages what does his death mean for these efforts well is Hanan was not just involved he was really the chief negot negotiator if you will he was really the person in Hamas who had the strongest voice in terms of uh negotiating some kind of ceas fire his death will certainly uh bring a blow to those negotiations and that's what many people is saying that he was considered the more moderate Voice Within Hamas if you will certainly when you compare him to Yahya sinir of in Gaza uh and that he was almost pushing or certainly more open to some kind of a ceasefire deal now the Qatari and Egyptians who have been uh very key negotiators in these ceasefire uh agreements uh say that the killings will certainly uh be a blow to any deal that there was a deal uh a deal that Israel had sent back to Hamas after negotiations in Rome on Monday and they were waiting for a Hamas response uh Hamas themselves saying that they were they were very very close to reaching some kind of agreement though we don't know how close but obviously this is going to deal a blow and the Qatari prime minister yesterday taking to the social media platform ex to question how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates negotiators on the other side so kind of R response but certainly underlining what many people are feeling about the negotiations now we'll leave it there for the moment de respondent Rebeca rits in Jerusalem thanks so much and let's bring in journalist hen balha who spent a lot of time in Gaza before he had to leave he joins us now from Cairo hzim what has the reaction been to hana's killing in Gaza and the West Bank the most important part for for Gaza is U particularly is to end the war and to have an end of all daily basis suffering um after uh more than N9 month in in in such situation um all they care about is um ending this war and uh the reaction came as a result of that um the assassination of of hania Might delay or postpone um um um reaching a deal in the West Bank it's a bit different there is a bit of grief um they are not in direct um impact of the situation what's happening in GH of course there is a impact of um um blade and and um and pressure from Israeli Army but um the situation and the impact is in Gaza how big a blow is this uh uh for Hamas it is big no doubt about that Hamas um um officials said that out loud um hania was the top leader of of M uh but um it's it's good to mention that he's not the top influential person um I mean if we talk about the situation and the war in Gaza the military Wing is the the most powerful part or body um that influence the war in G in in Gaza currently but um it would be a political problem for Hamas and it will be a debate over who's going to replace him so who is going to replace him well according to the to to the Hamas um um um low Hanah got three deputies uh one of them already killed um um um one in in Gaza City um is yya senir who's not available and he's under ground he's busy with the war the second one is the who was killed in in Beirut earlier the third one is um khed mashal who's in Doha and who's the former um uh top leader of Hamas before Hanah so um according to the law um one of the three deputies uh um um should take the place but that is not necessarily maybe some changes would happen because um many other parties would would influence that I mean um the hosting country like Q um Iran the supporting country would influence if they are in favor of khed mash or not other parties like Egypt or other Arab countries who is in interested of the Palestinian um issue so the the it's not crystal clear about that who's going to replace him but um according to the law most likely will be khed Mas where would that leave cesa negot iations then between Hamas and Israel well the negotiations is in in in in already before the the killing of was in in in in hard uh uh position and and was in Dead Block uh somehow uh there was no agreement between the both sides Hamas and Israel uh but of course the the assassination of Hanah would make it more complic at um um I I would expect that this the negotiation would would be postponed for some time as it happened before when the deputy was assassinated in Beirut before but it would be resumed eventually uh but the the question is like um uh uh how and and and when and if the two parties are ready for reaching um a deal so that is the most important so then negotiation now is in hold uh course for some time but it's not the end it would be resumed because there is no other option we leave it there for the moment journalist hzim baloa in Cairo thanks so much thank you meanwhile Iran has vowed to take revenge for the killing of isma Haner the assassination was a massive security breach and a huge embarrassment for Iran's leaders any retaliation could come in several different forms what could a respond from Iran look like and how far does tan really want to go tensions in the Middle East were already high after Israel's assassination of hezbollah's top Commander F shukur in Beirut both incidents have intensified cause by Israel's enemies for Retribution but experts say Iran's leaders want to avoid a war with Israel and an outright attack seems highly unlikely backed by the United States Israel has formidable resources at the r including an army of some 170,000 active Judy soldiers it also has an advanced Air Force with some 200 fighter jets plus the well tested Iron Dome rocket defense system Iran could also ask its proxies in the region to step up their activities Hezbollah could launch a massive barrage of missiles at Israel from Lebanon similar to the one Iran launched in April that unprecedented attack of some 300 missiles and drones was largely repelled but some managed to penetrate the Iron Dome system causing damage inside the country last year us intelligence estimated that Hezbollah has over 100,000 Rockets out their ready heah could also carry out a strike on civilian targets within Israeli territory this is a much less likely possibility but a much more serious one an attack of this kind would almost definitely lead to an even further escalation but Iran's retaliation won't necessarily happen on Israeli soil aside from Hezbollah in Lebanon Iran backs a number of Allied militant groups across the middle east in Iraq Syria Gaza and in Yemen tan is now already encouraging the Islamic resistance in Iraq a coalition of militias to step up its attacks on us targets there after months of calm and in the Red Sea Yemen's houy Rebels have been carrying out attacks on ships it claims are linked to Israel since the beginning of the Gaza conflict the assassination of Ismael Hanah puts Iran in a difficult position how to respond in a way which shows strength and restores deterrence but at the same time avoids an allout war with its sworn enemy [Music] Israel and let's get more on this from DW's Middle East Shan rosan is who joins me now in the studio shanni good morning what will be the main goal of any Iranian response well of course they need to show strength they want to build deterrence against Israel because this seems like an un you know AB bashed you know attempt of Israel to to uh on Iranian soil on Iranian sovereignity so of course they would want to do that they want to show that they're strong they cannot keep you know face to the world especially wanting to be seen as the strong you know uh Fighters for the Palestinian cause they need to show that they venge the blood of hania and also uh don't let Israel tread all over their you know sovereignity and this is exactly how you do that do you how do you strike this balance because so far Iran has tried despite um you know its strong alienation with the Palestinians and the support the Palestinian CA through Hamas it also tried to distance itself in a way uh not to be directly involved and now it will try to strike a balance of how to send that message without bringing to a wider escalation and and what about um hollah can one expect a response from the group and if so what sort of a response should uh one expect well I think in a way there's a bit of a relief for Hassan asala he will be speaking later today we will hear what exactly he wants to say following uh for Cher's assassination but but you know knowing that this is a bigger problem and now the spotlight is on you know the backers the Iranians of course that helps him get more time to to get his you know response in order but it's no doubt in Israel there's far more concerned about the northern border that is that means that response from hez balah than from Iran uh mostly because it's just much shorter time and much shorter distance Israel has very little time to respond to any attacks from kisala kisala is considered to be the best armed proxy Iran has in the region with over 150,000 you know missiles in different ranges um so when hisbah decides to attack it can be very deadly while what we've seen from Iran on in April is that Israel had much longer time to respond and eventually also the attack was more more than 99% of it of the barriage was um you know Israel managed to uh stop we we're talking about expected attacks and responses from Iran and also Hezbollah potentially at the same time I mean uh whatever these responses are will it prevent an allout escalation into a wider Regional War oh it's s to to to be seen we need to see exactly what happens under theg ground and we also need to keep in mind if we rewind a bit partially why we are here is because uh there was an attack on the go Israeli occupied go on Heights that killed 12 kids in a in a soccer field and and this is probably a mistake and this is what happens when when you're engag in war you know you can plan what you want but you don't always uh control the result and Israel has this uh rule that it responds according to the result not according to the intention this is why we've seen also a very tame response to the previous attack from Iran in April so yes it could be that all sides do not want to see escalation but only want to show deterrence and you know keep this game of balancing reactions but a mistake could happen and that could maybe lead to an escalation out you know taking things out of hand sh stay with us just to remind our viewers the visuals that they're seeing on their screens right now are live visuals coming from tan this is the funeral procession of isma Han the the top political leader of Hamas that's happening right now in Teran and as you were talking sh we talking about deescalation there are now many calls for uh deescalation including uh from from Germany DW's Chief political editor M kufner spoke with defense minister Boris Pistorius about that currently there's a huge concern that there could be an allout war in the Middle East after the Hamas leader was killed in Iran Mr hania but also a leading member of Hezbollah your American counterpart Lloyd Austin says that the war can be prevented what is your assessment at this moment well of course Lord Austin is right uh it can be prevented but it has to to be it need to be it needs to be prevented because nobody can wish or can can even imagine a further escalation in the region we don't need that we don't want that and we have to um to u to try everything uh to make influence available available to All actors in the region not to escalate and um pay attention to deescalation and to do everything uh for getting peace back in that region as soon as possible what does this mean for German weapons deliveries weapons commitment towards Israel but also for German's participation in of unifil on the Lebanese border unifil is um not touched at the moment we we continue we proceed with our engagement over there of course we uh we assume the the situation every every day every hour uh but we we stay there and we won't make U only National decisions over there there the German defense minister there speak speaking earlier to DW sha who can in effect exert any influence uh in the current situation to prevent uh further escalation in the region well we talk about the Israel is definitely the Americans that's where you have most of the leverage um and you know we were just hearing the German defense minister Germany and America America by far more are the main suppliers of weapons and for Israel you know they have a lot of Leverage they can use there and we've been seeing a lot of efforts from uh Europe and and and and and the US when it comes to Lebanon there's a very great fear that any confrontation that will lead to direct attack on Lebanon is is just going to be too devastating for this already frail country um so this is where the the focus is on but when it comes to Iran I think it's very hard to know who can even you know exert any leverage there um I think it's you know I think what Israelis were counting on when they initiated this was the assumption that isra that Iran as a as a rational player will will have zero interest in actually an allout war and a wide escalation um we will have to wait a little longer to see if that assumption is in any way correct we'll leave it there for the moment shanas thanks so much for coming into the studio for that
