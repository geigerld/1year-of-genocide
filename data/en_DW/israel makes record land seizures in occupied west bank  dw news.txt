in the occupied West Bank the displacement of dozens of Palestinian communities is also raising concerns with violent attacks by Israeli settlers on the rise at the same time the Israeli government is declaring more and more land there as Israeli state-owned since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7th Israel has reclassified 1,100 hectares in the West Bank as Israeli state land and from there Rebecca ritters sent us this report H for bhan basharat everyday life has become a struggle the ban Shepherd has been grazing his herds in these Hills for decades on lands his father and grandfather grazed too but lately his livelihood and family tradition is coming under increased threat for two three or four months on a daily basis we have been experiencing violent assaults it is not possible to sleep at night fearing for our children we under constant threat and at any moment we could get killed we could have our houses and cabins burnt we could be displaced the threat comes from settler violence boran's encampment is surrounded on one side by an Israeli settlement considered illegal under international law and on another by an outpost an informal settlement considered illegal even under Israeli law Boran says lately it feels as though they're closing in after October 7th they stabbed someone with a knife in elali burned houses they attacked and confiscated livestock one of the farmers from defle who got his lifestock confiscated had to pay around 40,000 shels for it livestock theft is not uncommon according to Israeli liberal newspaper heds more than 500 goats and sheep have been stolen by armed Israeli settlers in recent months some times in military uniform even more common than theft though is violence and intimidation scenes like these are a regular occurrence all over the West Bank and the intimidation is working since the October 7th terror attack settlers have forcibly displaced people from at least 20 hering communities and entirely uprooted another seven the Israeli military is supposed to protect pales Ians living here but a report by Human Rights Watch has found the military is either failing to do so or is directly involved in the violence Israeli volunteer activists have stepped up their work in an effort to keep communities safe the protective presence started right after October 7 communities were extremely threatened by settlers visits and harassment so we we have we had to start coming in the nights when we are there much less is happening the activists say settler violence is part of an unofficial but deliberate Israeli policy to take land is but there's another official way too when they are declaring an area in statel land draw edas is the founder of km navat an organization engaged in monitoring and researching Israeli land policy in the West Bank he says the reclassification of land is one of the main methods by which Israel seeks to assert control over land in the occupied territories basically they had survey this area they were supposed to survey this area and to reach the conclusion that this area was not cultivated mhm and if it was not cultivated for certain amount of years so then they assume that it's stat land and is Israel has a right to run this land so you can assume that this area which had been declared is going to is going to go to a body which is related to the Israeli suon Enterprise an Enterprise the government is actively working to promote when reclassifying the biggest pocket of land in decades Finance Minister betel smotr said the move was an important and strategic issue while there are those in Israel and in the world he said who seek to undermine our right to Judea and Samaria we promote settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country this year more than 1100 hectares of land has been reclassified as state land this is directly related to to the political climate they are doing it now in order to convey a message we will do whatever we want we are decisive to go on with the Israeli annexation of the West Bank and there's no legal way that Palestinian can fight this not the Palestinian Authority not a practical one despite the challenges bhan is determined to try to hold on to his land there's no justification so I am living here in my land right these settlers what business do they have here in my land I have a title to this land what do they want from me where should I go he hopes increased International pressure will help save his land for future generations and we can now speak to T Hinrich she's a spokesperson for the office of the Israeli Prime Minister welcome T thank you so much for making time to come on DW today now settler violence in the West Bank has seen a dramatic spike in recent months Israel has security control over most of the West Bank what does prime minister Netanyahu intend to do to stop the violence well thank you for having me on Nicole uh actually the numbers that I saw the numbers that I'm familiar with with uh show a decrease in this already marginal phenomena that of course the Prime Minister has condemned uh the Prime Minister said on multiple occasions that nobody in Israel nobody should be taking the Law into their own hands and if someone does that we prosecute no matter their religious affiliation uh no matter where they live uh of course uh and the Prime Minister has said it repeatedly time and again but uh what we should uh uh uh what we should bring to light here is the is the the fact that this is a marginal phenomena the the the overwhelming majority of the so-called settler Community Israelis Israeli Jews living in Judea and Samaria we're talking about more than 500,000 people are law-abiding citizens so uh don't mistake the the exception for for the rule here and the fact of the matter is that currently and historically the Arab on Jewish violence in Judea and Samaria the so-called West Bank is is in much much higher numbers than the other way around even though media reporting does not reflect it we have seen 500 Palestinians killed as part of settler violence since October 7th and the truth of the matter is that an overwhelming majority of settler attacks go unpunished why is that I'm not familiar with these numbers these are not numbers that I can confirm what are the numbers that you know what I I want to I want to add something important here about numbers again I I'm not sure where you're taking the numbers uh from but um sometimes and you know I've seen un reports for example about this phenomena so-called of settler violence which it does exist it's a marginal phenomena and and we fight it um but uh International reports like like a un one that was issued a few months ago they don't use real numbers because they take Palestinian as salant for example that commit crimes and and Carry Out violence against Jews in Judea and Samaria and they put them as victims of so-called sex settler violence in the in these reports so these numbers are not accurate the numbers the numbers that we have come from Watchdogs who've been observing the situation for for quite some time but let's not get hung up on this then I do want to move on because we did meet in the report that we just saw some people who are acutely affected by what you say is a marginal phenomenon it does affect them in their everyday life how do you expect Palestinians who are expected to react when they are attacked on their land well I speak for the Israeli Prime Minister's office I don't speak uh uh to you know Palestinians uh what I can tell you is how the Prime Minister and how the government views uh this uh marginal phenomena that we of course take seriously and nobody nobody should be taking the law to their own hands we prosecute as I said um if if there's any wrongdoing that we recognize of course many many social and political scientists have found that experiences of trauma and violence increase the chances of radicalization now you say that you you go after the perpetrators of uh violence in the occupied territories but how aware um is the Netanyahu government of settler violence fostering mindsets that could in turn pose a risk to Israel's security I'm not sure I I follow your question uh 100% here question line here um but uh obviously again if if there's any breaking of the law um we're we're against it obviously but there are numbers I think it is about 94% of settler attacks that go unpunished why is that again I'm not familiar with these numbers all right then let's uh move on um the US of course Israel's staunchest Ally they are opposed to settlement expansion um there are parts of the Israeli government that are very much in favor of settlement expansion the US says uh Anthony blinkin recently said it again that new settlements are counterproductive to reach enduring peace and weaken Israel's security what do you say to that so uh let's set the record straight here on a few things uh Jewish presence in Judea and Samaria uh the place from which Jews come from you know Jews come from Judea uh it does not go against international law as long as you don't twist the law to fit your political views uh Judea and Samaria are rightful parts of uh you know our Jewish homeland the biblical Heartland and Jewish presence was you know evident there for more than 3,000 years now Jews have rights to reside there alongside uh Arab commun Palestinian Arab communities there's no question about it but settlements are not the main impediment to peace if someone thinks having Jewish neighbors is the main essence of the Israeli Palestinian conflict well they're they're dead wrong uh Nicole because the real impediment to peace between Israelis and Palestinians let's put it right here on the table uh is the Palestinian refusal to uh recognize to acknowledge the very existence of the legitimacy of a Jewish State and Palestinian terrorism um if someone is really interested uh uh you know in promoting peace and inquiring as for why there's no peace these are the questions that they should be asking how come the Palestinians have refused every peace offer since 1937 and up until you know uh recent times how come they started every conflict lost it only to cry victim and perpetuate a conflict how come Terror infrastructure and Terror ammunition are found in every almost in every Palestinian school every Palestinian home that's what our forces are discovering in Gaza so we you and I can sit here and talk about settlements but that's not the essence of the conflict let's look at uh the war in Gaza which continues of course and and you know it is widely acknowledged by by many many uh people that the settlements in the West Bank among others do breach international law but let's look at the at the conflict that that we've been focusing on for for the past months ever since the October 7th Terror attacks um prime minister nany called the truce proposal that uh was presented by President Biden last week partial so what does netanyahu's plan for peace look like what did Biden Miss well uh to make things clear uh we have set three War objectives right after the October 7th Massacre we said that we want to dismantle Hamas as a governing body political body in in the Gaza Strip and as a military Wing to make sure that they will no longer have the military capabilities no that nor the desire to attack us again after this war a the second goal is of course to uh bring all our hostages the stolen people back home and to make sure that Gaza will never ever pose a terror threat to us again now Israel like President Biden said has put on the table very generous proposals that were rejected time and again uh by Hamas because they're not interested in releasing hostages so far they haven't been uh uh serious about these negotiations in recent weeks as as you know um but the claims that we agree agreed to a ceasefire proposal that will not meet our conditions I mean the these are incorrect these are false claims uh we will not agree to any kind of a ceasefire a permanent ceasefire I'm I'm I'm talking about uh that would leave Hamas in power and some hostages in Gaza all right we have spoken over the past months ever since October 7th to countless um experts who say that Netanyahu appears to be more interested um in staying in power than an actual reaching um a lasting peace now would he be willing to risk his government falling apart if it meant an end to the war and a return of the hostages well I just uh stated three War objective that the Prime Minister and honestly every Israeli almost every Israeli and overwhelming majority of people in my country are eager to achieve there will be no compromise on our security uh this is not about a political Survival by the way Nicole this is about the survival of uh the nation of Israel Jews Christians Muslims who refuse to Simply die in the hands of a terrorist organization so we will continue to plow on in in Gaza and make sure that our goals are reached if it would mean that he would have to risk his governing Coalition would he agree to a deal that could lead to that end I I again this is not what what's on the table right now we're not dealing with politics uh very few few uh people in my country in fact are dealing with politics right now because what I told M of his Coalition have said that they would not they would not stay in the Coalition if the deal that was presented by Joe Biden for example were to go through well but what I am saying is that the the deal that was presented is is not 100% accurate because as the Prime Minister said in recent days um we will not agree to a ceasefire that would leave some hostage in Gaza and Kamas in power so we're not talking about a permanent ceasefire here the terms of the the the recent deal that were discussed in the nature of the talks is not something that I can discuss on air with you but I can guarantee to you uh that there's no notion of a SE of a permanent ceasefire that would leave Hamas in power that is T hin Expos person for the Israeli Prime Minister thank you so much thank you
