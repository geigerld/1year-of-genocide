less than a day after repelling a direct aerial assault by Iran Israel is weighing its response prime minister Benjamin netan who has met with his War cabinet its members are set to favor responding to the attack but are divided over when and how hard to strike back Iran launched more than 300 drones cruise missiles and ballistic missiles in the overnight attack but nearly all were intercepted by Israel the Us and other nations world leaders have urged restraint with US President Joe Biden telling Netanyahu that Washington will not participate in any military retaliation against Iran Tran says the assault was itself retaliation for an attack on its Embassy in Damascus earlier this month that killed two top ranking generals flashes in the sky over Jerusalem and ionome in action this footage shows the interception of missiles and drones launched by by Iran after the first ever direct military attack on Israel from Iranian territory concern is growing over a possible further escalation Israeli War Cabinet member Benny Gans made a defiant statement that did little to elay those fears this incident is not over we will build a regional Coalition and collect the price from Iran in a way and at a time that suits us US President Joe Biden reaffirmed what he called America's Ironclad commitment to the security of Israel but the White House added Biden had told Netanyahu that the US would not participate in any Israeli counter offensive against Iran in tan prover Iranians took to the streets to celebrate the wave of strikes against Israel the elite revolutionary guard says the overnight assault was a response to a deadly air strike on the Iranian embassy compound in Syria earlier this month which killed several of its most senior commanders Iran's mission to the United Nations wrote on social media that its attack on Israel can be deemed concluded the Iranian foreign minister made a statement after the attack that seemed to be aimed at giving assurance that tan was not looking to escalate the conflict we notified our brothers in the region where the United States has military bases in their countries that our goal is only to punish the Israeli regime and that we are not seeking to Target American bases in the region but as Israel says its confrontation with Iran is not over that may do little to calm fears of a full-scale regional war and I'm now joined by our Middle East analyst Shan rosanes Shan the Israeli walk has been meeting uh what do we know uh what came out of this meeting it's more than 5 hours that they were discussing uh it seems like there's a consensus in Israel that they needs to be some sort of a response but now the question what is that response should be you know we're talking about 45 years of this uh tensions between Iran that escalated into a shadow War uh in the last decades and for Netanyahu it's been his life mission uh to fent off Iran and he's pushing back very strongly for a response here we also know he has the backing of the military and the defense minister galland who's always been more of a hardliner and against that we see the minister guns who's more of a moderate he's also a former uh chief of the military and uh other two members of the cabinet trying to push back what's on the table what are the options going Allin for Israel would be using this excuse and going for the Iranian nuclear uh um um facilities that would be something that Israel had had been hoping to do for a long time with International Coalition uh maybe they think this might be the time to get any legitimacy from the world might just be now that would be going all in but then other than that there's also more moderate responses either going directly into military bases or military facilities in and that were participating in the attack yesterday sort of a tit forat a very measured response or going for any of Iran's more strategic uh proxies in the region trying to attack there and of course there's always the covert operation sort of the mild Cyber attack attacks have we've been seeing any of these that would be the lowest level of attack so the idea is to send a message but how can we send a message without alienating the Americans and the International Coalition of support that we're seeing now uh coming together in uh hopes uh in support of Israel and it's and its uh war against Iran that would lead directly to my my next question what would Israel be able to gain from any military response versus what it would have to lose well the way Israel sees it ever since October 7th uh they lost their deterrence which was one of the most strategic assets when it came to their positioning in that region in the Middle East and having lost that they feel like the only way to gain it is with force a lot of it this is why we're seeing Israel uh so aggressively uh operating whenever it does operate um so they feel like this is about the the standing of Israel in the region for the long run what it can lose of course is international support and mostly American backing uh we know that Joe Biden have said very clearly he will support Israel Defense efforts but will not support any attacks um we know we have had a he has had a talk also with the G7 uh uh countries quite recently when they're all trying to form together some sort of a diplomatic package it will put pressure in Iran and hopefully convince Israel to uh you know uh fend off any attacks and this is a lot of the on the line for Israel because the very uh idea of having a wedge between Israel and and and the US that's for itself is quite an achievement for Iran uh in the region so of course that's also on the line well the defense minister the Galan says that this attack provides an opportunity to cement a strategic Alliance uh against Iran how could that local be a part of that well of course the Americans we've seen the Brits uh UK taking active part in that and also the Sunni moderate uh countries in the region we know for a fact it was Jordan Israel's neighbor but you know part of this Alliance traditionally would also include uh Egypt would also has a peace agreement with Israel we also know there were uh willingness from the Saudis we have all the countries that are part of the Abram Accord so Bahrain and so forth this is um Biden's uh deal package that he's trying to sell for for netan and his government for quite some time uh because of Gaza saying listen the bigger if we zoom out of Gaza and the conflict then they need to solve the Palestinian problem we need to look at the bigger problem in the Middle East and that is no doubt Iran and the only way to defeat on a long term is through cementing of this moderate Alliance um Israel needs to decide um if it's moving its you know Focus from Iran from Gaza currently into Iran what would that mean for the hostages still left in Gaza for the goal of eradicating Hamas who is still quite uh active in Gaza and that's a very tough dilemma that Israel is standing uh in front and that's why we're seeing this it's very hard for the Israeli leadership that now to reach a consensus Israel has in the last couple of years um made progress in peace agreements and and uh making friends in the region if you will is this paying off now well we've seen it yesterday no doubt I mean jordanians have put their neck their neck on the line not just for their reasons they also want to fend off Iran they've been seeing a lot of attacks from Iran and through Irani proxies on their borders um but but there's no doubt that there's more than just Israel who wants to defeat Iran in the region there's more than that and the only problem is that the current government and the things we see in Gaza create a situation where Israel canot really leverage that uh properly and this is where the Americans come in and say please let us try to find diplomatic ways in order to make it happen let's try to find a diplomatic package to put pressure on Iran um and we will see partially why we will see more time before Israel takes a decision is how to make any to to make any to to reach any agreement with the Americans and what would be the most appropriate response sh rzan is there our Middle East expert thank you very much leaders of the G7 Nations have condemned Iran's attack on Israel during a meeting that was convened by US President Joe Biden following their video conference they said they would take measures to prevent an uncontrollable Regional escalation in the Middle East the leaders also called on Iran to exercise SI restrained the group's statement pledged to work towards an immediate and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza as well the UN Security Council is holding an emergency session over the attack Secretary General Antonio gutes opened the session by calling for maximum restraint saying the region cannot afford another War it's time to step back from the brink it's vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East civilians are already bearing the brunt and paying the highest price and we have a shared responsibility to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation Iran's overnight attack against Israel was the first of its kind the animosity between the two Nations however goes back decades the October 7th terror attack against Israel was led by the Iran Ally Hamas that escalated those tensions from a proxy war to direct attacks from both sides the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel shook the entire country to its score Hamas widely perceived to have the backing of Iran claimed responsibility Iran distant itself from the worst terrorist attack on its Arch Enemy but it praised the Palestine we defend the struggle we kiss the hands of those intelligent and brave Palestinian youths who planned the attack on the Zionist regime we are proud of them the US quickly reacted and warned Iran to exercise caution we're surging additional military system to the Israeli Defense Force including ammunition interceptors replenish the Iron Dome and we moved the US carrier Fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean they were sending more fighter jets there in that region and made it clear made it clear to the Iranians be careful Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Syria Hezbollah in Lebanon and houti rebels in Yemen continued to launch attacks targeting Israeli and US installations and forces in the region this is a battle against the Iranian AIS Iranian access of Terror which is now threatening to close the maritime straight of Babel mandb this threatens the freedom of navigation of the entire world tensions escalated further the Western world became more involved the US and Britain launched dozens of a strikes against Iran backed HTI repels in Yemen after months of attacks on Red Sea shipping Israel also stepped up its assaults on Iranian revolutionary guard members and on Iranian proxies in the region tit forat attacks continued in the Middle East but the April missile strike on Iran's Embassy in Damascus that killed Iranian generals was seen as a major blow to Iran something that Iran said LED it to directly attack Israel from its territory since October 7th Israel is believed to have assassinated at least 18 Iranian commanders outside Iran's borders after Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979 Iran's previously friendly relationship with Israel dramatically changed it scrapped its recognition of Israel claiming to Champion the Palestinian cause the Islamic regime became so hostile towards Israel that it publicly stated it wanted to wipe Israel off the map a policy that makes Iran Israel's biggest adversary and the current escalation shows the shadow War Iran has been waging with Israel for years now threatens to turn into a very real and a dangerous conflict Germany's chancellor Olaf Schulz has responded to the Iranian assault while on a trip to China where he'll be meeting with among others president xiin ping he is here is what he had to say earlier we strongly condemn the Iranian attack and warn against any further escalation Iran must not continue down this path at the same time it's absolutely clear to us that we stand in solidarity with Israel which has every right to defend itself we we will do everything we can to prevent further escalation and will therefore continue to pursue our current course we can only warn everyone especially Iran against continuing down this path German chancelor FR speaking then now let's bring in Alexander Miller he's a member of the German Parliament defense policy spokesman for the free Democratic party which is uh part of the governing Coalition here in Germany uh for their parliamentary group and chairman of the defense committee now we just heard Olaf Schultz there calling for restraint and German armed sales to Israel have been under scrutiny uh recently could German weapons be used by Israel to retaliate and does that worry you no um I don't think the German weapons could be uh used because it is um just a small parts there are no tanks no airplanes uh nothing where you can uh um what what you can use um uh to to attack any other country um so I'm not really worried that uh German weapons would be used on this now the Secretary General of your uh party the fdp just called for a different approach in Germany's Iran policy uh what does he mean by that um I think we have been too kind to Iran in the in the last time um perhaps some more sanctions should be checked uh if we can even have even more sanctions against Iran uh to make it clear that we are not accepting that Iran and there are marionet in in all around the Arabic World in Lebanon in um Yemen and everywhere else in Iraq uh that U um that are making terrorist attacks and uh unstabilized uh the world we we cannot we we do not want to um look at this uh without doing anything now following this attack you expressed some hope for peace in the Middle East in a tweet uh and that sounds a bit counterintuitive uh at this point what gives you reason for that optimism yes DW has also mentioned it um the the fact that uh as well Saudi Arabia as also jordania you know jordania um there are a lot of um or Jordan there are a lot of Palestine people living there um uh both countries have helped to um to to take um attacking drowns terrorist drowns down from the sky um to to help um protect Israel and those countries are not um classical friends of Israel and that makes me gives me some hope that we will have peace in the near East um in in the next years perhaps now is there anything that Germany can uh do to help diffuse the situation um not a lot um uh we we are um an intermediate between um Israel and Iran because we talk with with both sides and we try to deescalate the situation that's the one thing that we can do uh but in military um terms we will not uh be involved in anything uh not in uh in in attacking Iran or something like that um so it's just a piece talks and trying to to talk with both sides to deescalate that that's what we can do Alexander M there member of the German Parliament thank you very much thank you and we can now speak to hakob Schindler he's a senior director of the counter extremism uh project uh given the advanced warning with Mr Shindler why do you think Iran launched attack thank you so much for having me clearly Iran um was under domestic pressure of considerable proportions to show response to what it says and considers to be an attack on its Sovereign soil when Israel attacked um its Consulate in Damascus um however it made apparently sure that it the damage that this attack is met it out in on Israel was quite limited not only did it publicly save and it launched the drones and the rockets giving ample war time but as it turns out now today apparently the Iranians briefed the Turkish government who then in turn briefed the US government and that uh the attack is coming and it's going to be quite limited but uh unfortunately we are now in a situation that Iran for the very first time has attacked Israel and that really puts a lot of pressure on the Israeli government in turn to now also respond and the response is going to determined on whether the situation stabilizes escalates or slides into original War I mean if you just look into your crystal ball what would be a likely reaction you think from Israel well it depends of whether you are an optimist or a pessimist an optimist would say a attack that is more or less signaling yes we are responding forcefully but it's business as usual so an attack against um the Arsenal of hisbah which is an immediate tactical threat towards Israel because its missile Arsenal can actually overwhelm simply with the amount of ammunitions that they have Israeli air defenses however if you're a pessimist you could say okay this is also a moment if there ever was one where Israel could clearly decide that it is now time to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities which is a long-term very strategic threat against the existence of Israel um this would of course then really result into unforeseeable really Regional escalations well How likely you think uh is this to escalate into a regional escalation a full-blown war between Israel and Iran well I mean we could clearly see that all sides are trying to calm down both sides so the Jordanian King apparently told President Biden if the gazin situation could be resolved um this could not you know easily escalate again um the Russians and the Chinese as well as the Egyptians have called for calmness the G7 has come for calmness in just over 90 minutes the security Council here is going to meet in New York obviously it's going to condemn the attack but I I hope that the security Council will also call for a measured uh and and considerate uh further actions from all sides so um The Diplomatic efforts are there however it just simply is a very difficult situation for Israel um it now for the future will have to always contend with the risk that if it moves in any way shape or form against major figures of Iranian proxies or major figures of the iig which are supporting these proxies which present a direct threat to Iran and to Israel and it its territory that it would have to always also consider a potential Iranian air strike um this is really a change paradigm here and we've not yet found a new equilibrium in the way that existed before yesterday everybody keeps pointing uh at the risk of escalation uh in the Middle East uh Beyond uh Israel and Iran uh is there this risk and and and what is the risk who else could be getting involved in in in fighting each other no we are now already in a very tense situation with not one but several of the Iranian proxies uh around Israel so not just Hamas but also already hisa the houthis are continuing to harass shipping in the Red Sea and were shooting missiles and drones towards Israel last night we have the Iraqi and Syrian proxies that were also apparently in some way ship of War involved in last night's attacks these who these proxies are of course instruments of the Iranian regime but they are not uh they don't all have an on and off level the closest that Iran comes to fully control of proxy really is hisa because it is an Iranian generation however the houthis are far more radical um than even the Iranians are their slogan is death to Israel death to the United States occurs upon the Jews um and they are much harder to control so escalation um and in this current situation where everyone is on a knce edge could also come simply by these proxies without any particular Israeli action or however measured the Israeli reaction would be now Jordan has intercepted missiles over its territory as well is Jordan likely to get involved more than that well number one Jordan has uh the second oldest peace treaty with Israel after Egypt so obviously it's been in a very close relationship with Israel um for quite a long time however I don't think militarily um the Jordanian Army would be getting involved in an attack on Iran Jordan and Iran don't have a good relationships neither does Saudi Arabia who also last night shot down some missiles and drones apparently from the houthis that were heading towards Israel not the first time by the way they' have done this several times the last couple of months so that the battle lines are clear there is a of course anti-iranian majority and then there is what the Iranians call the axis of resistance I Iran certain elements in Iraq are definitely the Syrian regime and its proxies and I'm not really surprised that both jordane Jordan and Saudi Arabia were at least defending their own territory against this blatant violation of their air Space by the Armenians last night now US President Joe Biden said uh that the US would not participate in a counter offensive against Iran so let's talk about the wording here not participate but maybe tolerate I mean President Biden also said he his support and US support for Israel is IR am glad obviously that extends to the fullest extent when it comes to the defense of Israel even the defense of the Israel when there is a re should there be a reaction against Israeli answer to the attack last night however clearly uh the US Administration as indeed in fact the Israeli or the government or the Iranian regime none of these three players are fundamentally at this point interested into starting a large scale Regional War the problem is how can you prevent uh you know the sliding into this war without anyone want wanting it it wouldn't be the first situation where War start without any really seeing this in their interest thank you very much that was hob shler from the counter extremism project thank you thank you so much for having me
