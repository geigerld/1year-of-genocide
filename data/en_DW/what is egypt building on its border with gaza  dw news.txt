evidence is mounting that Egypt is building a holding area for Palestinian refugees on its border with the Gaza Strip sources in Egypt say the work is in response to a possible Israeli offensive on the gasan city of Rafa despite International pressure these satellite images show what appears to be construction work underway close to the Egyptian border with Gaza video released by the britain-based NGO Sinai foundation for human rights also shows building going on in the Egyptian authorities however have denied making preparations for Palestinians being forced out of Gaza and they're urging Israel not to attack Rafa well for more I'm joined Now by journalist Karim El gajari who is uh been following developments from Cairo uh good to have you with us Karim so uh what do you make of that the Egyptian government denying it's preparing for a possible Palestinian Exodus from Gaza what are you hearing well very conflicting input I must say uh the Egyptian government last evening U released a statement in which they say Egypt totally denies reports from certain foreign media Outlets about kyu's plans to build shelters for Palestinians in the vicinity of the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip in the event that they are forcefully displaced as a result of a bloody Israeli aggression against them in the Gaza Strip so a denial from the government at the same thing same time what you showed in your report we have satellite images we have uh the videos from this sa foundation for human rights and we have some uh Anonymous security people in Egypt who were also talking about that so we as journalists are not able to go there independently so we cannot verify any of the claims right so I mean help us out a little bit here because it seems to be uh very controversial for for any of the Arab states to openly help Palestinians Escape From The War Zone that also seems to be the case now with with Egypt uh sort of keeping things somewhat in secret or denying it as we've just heard why do you think that is well first there is uh of course people want to help uh people in in in the Gaza Strip there's a very moving uh picture that's going around on social media this morning that is an Egyptian farmer who stands there with a cradle of foods and uh an a truck is passing by clearly marked for the Gaza Strip and he takes the the fruits on his graes and throws them onto the truck so people really want to help the Palestinians uh there was also hundreds of trucks coming trying to get in from the Egyptian side being blocked by the Israelis uh Egyptians don't want to be part of a Palestinian displacement scenario also in the same statement I quoted before uh it's written that the complete and irreversible rejection of any forced or voluntary displacement of Palestinian brothers from the Gaza Strip to outside it especially to the Egyptian lands because this is a certain liquidation of the Palestinian issue and a direct threat to Egyptians security so we have the security issue for the Egyptians but we really the I think one of the main things that don't want to be seen as any kind of taking part in a Palestinian displacement uh scheme because the fear is of course that people never will be able to get back all right journalist Kim El gari there from Cairo Karim thank you so much you're
