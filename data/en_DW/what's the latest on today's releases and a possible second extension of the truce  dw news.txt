the Israeli military says two Russian Israeli women released by Hamas militants have now entered Israel Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by multiple countries is expected to hand over 10 more hostages to the International Red Cross as part of the TRU deal with Israel their release comes on the final day of the extended truce Qatari mediators have been pushing both sides to agree on further extensions of the ceasefire we can now bring Martin aach he's a psychiatrist and psychotherapist and currently aa's National Clinical Director in Israel welcome to DW so great to see you it's been five days since the first hostages were released what do we know about what Emily and the others went through and how they were treated in captivity um good evening uh first of all we don't know very much uh besides what we hear in the news uh because uh they were taken a lot of precautions to have the children all the hostages that come back to Israel um stay in privacy so that they don't have to meet the media immediately and tell the story they were isolated in some way and meeting first of all their families and they were given a chance to tell the stories and whatever happened to them whenever they feel fit for that whenever they ready for that for some it may be immediately and for some it may take some time specifically I think about the children uh there were children who were 2 years old 3 years old four years old uh adolescents and um for each of them it takes some time to tell the story yeah and we can only imagine what they must have witnessed what they must have gone through can you tell us about how this kind of traumatic experience affects children especially if like many of the hostages freed now they don't have a parent by their side when they get home yeah first of all one one has to say that generally children are much more uh vulnerable to traumatic events than adolescence you have to think that children don't have uh so much uh life experience they don't have a personality that is so much U Already um um um I would say uh developed and they uh they have very much the need to be together with parents or other caregivers so what we know about the children that were uh in Gaza we know that part of them were kept in houses uh above the ground and part of them were underground in tunnels we know about at 12-year-old uh hostage who told us that on the way to uh the place where it was kept he was beaten by all people around and then he was kept for 16 days in solitary confinement which was extremely difficult and afterwards he was allowed to join others whom he knows from his kibuts or from where he came from and then it became much easier iier for you that sounds for those who were for those who were together with their mothers it was easier for those who were separated from the mothers it was really very much difficult now apart from you know love and hugs from their families and everybody who's welcoming them back home what kind of professional support do these children need now well the first thing was that there was a big question how should he get the news how should he be updated about what happened in the last 50 days some of them did not know that part of the family members were killed and they had to hear the news um the military who um took them uh On the Border uh got an order not to tell these news these are news that were given by family members that's the first thing and then they were asked how they want to be in the first days whom they want to meet and um so gradually to be open to the surrounding they will not be meeting all their friends and all the kibuts members at the beginning we start very very uh small family close family and then open up gradually they even were told that they can stay in the hospital as long as they need and then they can choose where to go after being in a hostage where you don't have any choice yeah to do what you want to do you were told when to go to to bed when to talk this is what children tell us they were told not to talk loudly a small child 9 years old came back and is just Whispering now she can not talk normally again because she's afraid to talk aloud you understand so it needs time now how therapy will be uh over the next uh uh periods of times it's very difficult to know there are children and Adolescent and adults who are very strong and really can cope and recuperate relatively easily and there are people who need for many many years uh treatment yeah so it's very individual you cannot know it in the in in the beginning you have to follow them and just another point that it's very important not only to give professional help to the victims to the people who were captured to the hostages but their family members need a lot of help sure one day at a time that was Martin aak head of the Haru Institute thank you so much thank you good evening Sami so is in Jerusalem and has more Sami what's the latest on today's releases well the latest development is that those 10 Israeli hostages and we're talking about five women and five children have been handed over uh to the International Red Cross in the Gaza Strip so there has been that Handover that we've been waiting waiting for many hours apparently there were some logistic issues earlier two women came in these are women that were given a gesture to Vladimir Putin to Nationals that are both Israeli and Russian and they've been received by crowds that were waving the Israeli flag one of them is a 50-year-old woman and her 73y old mom at the same time I can tell you that north of Jerusalem in the betunia area you have a Palestinian families that are waiting for the release of 30 Palestinian prisoners and now that today's group of hostages has be handed over as you say uh does that mean that the truce will be extended yes the plan plan is that this truth will be extended there's still negotiation as to who will be on this list um Hamas has some difficulties and it has said that it is having difficulties in in finding some of the hostages because the hostages are kept by various factions inside the Gaza Strip but there is an agreement already with Israel that some of those that will be in the coming uh batches will be also men elderly men so we we can expect at least for tomorrow and the day after to have a similar formula of releasing of 10 Israeli hostages and in return Israel will be will be releasing 30 Palestinian prisoners then of course there will have to be more negotiations for kind of like a bigger uh a bigger PR program or maybe a ceasefire yeah while these diplomatic efforts continue the Israeli Army says there is an anti-terrorist operation underway in the West Bank what's happening there indeed there was a large scale operation in Janine in the Janine refugee camp the standoff lasted more than 13 hours uh during the this operation a a very senior commander of the fighters in the Janine Camp something known as the the the Janine Brigade which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad a person known as Muhammad zabi he was killed an associate of his was killed but maybe more shocking uh we saw there a a killing of an eight-year-old child and a and we also saw another 15-year-old Palestinian child that was killed so we're talking about a very aggressive campaign also in the abina hospital in Janine and we've also seen Israeli military going into the camp with bulldozers and destroying the infrastructure of the camp the Civil infrastructure of the camp that was journalist Sami soal in Jerusalem thanks for the latest now in return for Hamas freeing hostages Israel has been releasing Palestinians held in Israeli jails by Tuesday a total of 180 Palestinians had been released thew correspondent Tanya krer reports on one of them a 17-year-old whose family says he was arrested and detained after throwing Molotov cocktails for days now a man M has been anxiously waiting for this
