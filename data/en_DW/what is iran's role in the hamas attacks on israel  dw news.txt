well Israel has declared war on Hamas and bound to destroy its ability to govern Gaza the militant Palestinian islamist group it's considered a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States here's more now on what Hamas represents the Gaza Strip where the Israeli Defense Forces have been striking targets belonging to the militant islamist Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad groups it's from this densely populated Enclave lying between Israel Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea that Hamas has for years launched Rockets into Israel the group has governed the over 2 million residents in Gaza since 2007 since then Gaza has been seen as enemy territory by Israel and has remained largely sealed off Israel controls access by land sea and air the militant islamist group rejects any peace process with Israel and calls for its destruction Hamas is designated a terrorist group by Israel the United States the EU and the United Kingdom among other countries Hamas is part of a regional Alliance that includes Iran Syria and the islamist organization Hezbollah in Lebanon which opposes US policies to towards the Middle East and Israel the EU and other countries have deemed Hezbollah a terrorist organization Hamas has carried out attacks on Israel which have led to four major military conflicts with the Israeli Army in 2008 2009 2012 2014 and 2021 Hamas has warned that this latest wave of attacks are just the beginning and and called on other groups to join the fight Hamas depends on foreign aid of all kinds a lot of that Aid comes from Iran but Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah alih hamani he says that tan had no role in the Hamas terrorist attacks on Saturday at the same time he praised the operation as an irreparable military and intelligence defeat Iran and Hamas share the declared aim of destroy in the state of Israel my next guest now is Danny covitz he is with the institute for National Security studies in Tel Aviv he previously headed up Iranian research for Israel's Military Intelligence it's good to have you with us this evening Iran has denied being involved in these attacks whatsoever is that even plausible well uh we need to understand the relations between Hamas and Iran Iran is sending money uh to Iran uh of course sending arms to Iran training in operatives but at the end of the day uh Hamas is a Palestinian terrorist movement in a way that it's solely independent especially in the Gaza Strip so there is of course the support of Iran to Hamas activity but tactically speaking what we saw today what we saw in the last couple of days is attack carried out by Hamas operated by Hamas and Kamas doesn't need the approval of Iran to launch this attack so in that regard um it is possible uh of course there is some sort of coordination in the background all the time but at the end of the day uh it's not that Iran needs to to approve any attack carried out by Hamas it support the movement it support its activities but tactically operationally on the ground Kamas is independent to do what it wants what he able to do so actually what we saw today is there is a strategic support by uh by Iran but uh I'm doubtful that Hamas needed the approval of Iran to Carri out this attack so so to what extent then would you say that Hamas is a tool for Iran um such as other groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon well there is a difference between kisala and Hamas in so many ways kisala is a movement actually the spearhead of Iran's activity uh in the Middle East and Kamas is a Palestinian movement a Sunni movement that actually supported by Iran not because of the ideological reasons yes of course there is of course both both uh mov and Country uh want to destroy the state of Israel but one is Sunni one is Shiite so it's more uh less ideological more uh in interest wise in so many ways so it's not that um uh Hamas is uh similar to kisala in that in that effect but we have to understand what Iran is trying to do is actually build a circle of fire around the state of Israel it want to deter Israel from Attack Iran so it uses kisala it uses other movement uh organization organization like the sh in uh movements in Iraq let the in Yemen and like the like Hamas in the in the Gaza strep and West Bank in order to constantly press Israel in so many so in that way it's similar tobala butala and Iran has strategic coordinated relations that it's less uh than what we see today between Iran and Hamas again Iran is backing Hamas in so many ways uh but from from tactical reason operational reason Kamas is really independent in its own ways and and I I was reading today so Iran has this goal of annihilating Israel by what one person has described as a Thousand Cuts um and that goes along with what you saying building this circle around um Israel so is Hamas for Iran one of those Thousand Cuts that would contribute to the destruction of Israel definitely um you know wean in Hamas looking the long-term solution it's not that they're thinking that they can destroy Israel tomorrow but they believe this uh horrendous attack that occurred in Israel Are One Way Forward in in its ambition uh Vision to destroy the state of Israel so that's why we saw even if Iran didn't know about the attack tactically it will support it because it's really uh it's a part of its Grand strategy at the end of the day to make Israel disappear from the map and the Iran Supreme will supported now it's important to say one important thing despite the fact that we uh again we can only assume from what the American Administration is saying and what Hamas saying on the ground that there is no coordination between Hamas and Iran before the attack itself I'm not saying Iran won't support Hamas actively in uh in in days to come we still in the beginning stages of the campaign of Israel against Hamas and if Hamas will find itself in a dire situation we cannot rule out that Iran will actively support uh Hamas not only by uh trying to send arms or other elements but also maybe threatening Israel to stop its activity in Gaza STP so the fact that we didn't see this kind of tactical cooperation doesn't say we won't see that in in days to come yeah and and the timing of these attacks that we saw on Saturday um they look like or you could you know see them as being a means and disturbing what has been this building of improved relations between Israel and other Arab countries I'm talking though particularly between Israel and Saudi Arabia um it would definitely be in Iran's interest for Hamas to attack and um create what it has created this this uproar and Destroy any Goodwill that may have been coming from Saudi Arabia towards Israel most definitely I think that uh Iran is really really annoyed from the normalization uh uh between Israel and the Gulf States and especially this Prospect of nalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia this is something that put real Jeopardy towards Iran Iran see this kind of coordination between isra and S radi something that really jeopardizing its core interest uh in the region and Beyond so in that regard it's not that Hamas initiated that uh because of Iran uh Ambitions or trying to uh push some obstacle in in uh in the relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia but for sure Iran understand that it held that in that regard so it's it's will support it I think that even more than that what Kamas is trying to do right now despite the fact that probably it started like we mentioned the campaign alone they want to gather Iran right now into the campaign we saw what Muhammad the head of the uh uh of Kamas actually in Gaza STP trying to say trying to do in the beginning stages of the campaign trying to call for uh other uh fronts to be open and I think that is the normalization is something that Iran can relate to but we have to understand one important thing that Iran is very hesitant to open new fronts it hesitant to uh get into uh development that it cannot foresee how it will develop into the future so it's not that Iran will jump into the uh uh the events only because of realization between Israel and Saudi Arabia I'm sure they understand that it helped them in that regard but I think they would try they would TR think twice whether to support Iran Hamas actively again I'm not saying they're not going to do that but not only because of normalization they will try to help Hamas okay Danny citz with the institute for National Security studies in Tel Aviv Mr satz we certainly appreciate your time excellent analysis too on the nuances of the Iranian connection to all of this thank you thank you very
