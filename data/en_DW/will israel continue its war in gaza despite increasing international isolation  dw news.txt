I'm Phil Gail welcome to the program the UN says almost half of gaza's population has now moved to the city of Rafa in the South where they are facing bombardment deprivation and disease in a space that's becoming increasingly overcrowded despite growing calls for a ceas fire Israel says it will push on with its offensive against Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by numerous countries winter is bearing down on Rafa the city at the farthest edge of Southern Gaza bordering Egypt with the Border closed it's the farthest people can flee a destination for displaced Gins hoping to escape bombardment shelters are overcrowded almost half of gaza's population is now in Rafa which is the a small part of Gaza in the Southeast Corner again this is leading to nothing but a Health crisis rainfall makes an already dire situation worse many makeshift tents can't hold up for long against a wind and rainwater yes me a displaced Palestinian mother says she lacks access to basic necessities I woke up to my seven-month-old child who was soaking wet our house has been destroyed my other child was martyred I don't have any blankets or mattresses I took some for my sister we just have one blanket between five of us there's no covers no mattresses no food no water life is difficult humanitarian relief is barely reaching ordinary people like yasine despite their proximity to the only Crossing that allows Aid into the Gaza Strip Israel's military which is also carrying out strikes on targets and Rafa blames Hamas for the lack of access unfortunately it's not the Israeli side that are preventing it but rather what we're seeing this morning is that Hamas are not opening the the Palestinian side of Rafa and not facilitating the access of the humanitarian Aid itself so we need to ask ourselves again why is Hamas preventing humanitarian aid while the UN General Assembly has called for humanitarian ceasefire people in Rafa are pessimistic Israel is well known for ignoring un and International resolutions it considers itself Above the Law because of that I don't think it will accept any resolution with winter just setting in many fear the hardship and danger that lie ahead well Steven Ryan is rapid deployment coordinator with the International Red Cross committee he joins us from Gaza are welcome to DW can we start with your assessment of the situation in the territory at the moment well the situation for civilians here in Gaza continues to remain a living nightmare last night there was a strong wind and rain and with tens of thousands of people or more living in tents are under plastic sheating the situation is extremely difficult for families who are trying to look after their their children and for people who don't have access to enough food enough water enough shelter and genuinely it's really really difficult situation for people here now the the UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza says almost half of the territories population is now in Rafa that's hundreds of thousands of people what are you seeing there well just over 10 days ago I passed by one site one location uh not far from where our offices are based and I saw that there was a couple of dozen tents uh I passed by one week later a few days ago and there was hundreds if not more certainly tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people are on the move here in Gaza and many of those people are fleeing only with what they're able to carry and in a situation like that some very basic items become the most valuable uh a mattress a blanket maybe a meager supply of food and when they arrive to these places they're already very very crowded there's not enough if any sanitation facilities people have to queue for a very long time for water and nobody knows what tomorrow is going to bring certainly things that there's efforts to bring in more assistance into Gaza this this is a positive development but one of the things that we're deeply concerned about is their ability to meet these growing needs that are uh growing by the hour and to be able to reach people who are not in Raa certainly there are uh still many more people civilians who are protected under International humanitarian law who are outside of Raa and we also need to make sure that uh International organizations such as the International committee the Red Cross and any others that are able to work here are able to provide assistance to these people in faith to and while fighting continue that's an extremely difficult ask right and and the the problem one of many is is is there at the end you said to to be able to for international humanitarian organizations to be able to work in safety so this is hampering your ability to do your job under these these uous circumstances you yourselves uh feel endangered well certainly the international committee that we across is no stranger to working in difficult environments in fact the very basis of our work is uh helping people who are affected by conflict civilians no matter who they are no matter where they are and of course we engage with all of the parties in dialogue to remind them that we're a neutral organization that is not going to take sides our goal is to try and provide assistance to civilians people are in desperately need but to do that we need need to have access to do to to reach the places where they are we need to ensure that uh it's safe for us to do so so that we can continue doing this job tomorrow parties to this conflict need to understand and to respect that the role of the Red Cross is to help civilians and it's extremely difficult for us to do that in these conditions on just staying with Aid Israel says it's working to expand shipments of humanitarian Aid into Southern Gaza um earlier here on DW we had an IDF SP okman who was blaming Hamas for not opening the Palestinian side of the Rafa Crossing what are you seeing well from our point of view I'm like we see a relief trickling into Gaza at at the current race of not meeting the needs that are immense definitely any efforts that are going to allow more aids to come into Gaza are going to be welcomed but there's no limit to the amount of Aid that's going to be needed here people are desperate there isn't enough food there isn't enough water and there isn't the capacity in organizations such as ours to be able to respond to those needs in these conditions while we certainly welcome anything that's going to speed up the uh delivery of Aid into Gaza there needs to be a a an approach which enables us to deliver that Aid quickly and to where it's needed most and that is not limited to just Rafa that's throughout Southern Gaza and Beyond because wherever civilians are they protected under International humanitarian law and organizations such as ours who want to be able to provide this assistance need to be enable to do so by the parties of the conflict okay and of course we again appeal to all states to use their influence to make sure that we are able to do our jobs and that the parties of the conflict allow us to do so thank you for joining us Steven Ryan of the International Red Cross committee thank you Israel is coming under pressure from allies over its war in Gaza after months of staunch support US President Joe Biden criticized Israel on Tuesday for quote indiscriminate bombing in Gaza a vote by the UN General Assembly also indicates Israel's growing isolation on the world stage member nations overwhelmingly backed a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza but Israel insists it will persist with its air and ground classified as a terror group by the US the EU and several other countries there was celebration at the UN as the ceasefire resolution passed with more than three qus of the general assembly voting in favor and Israel's un Ambassador had argued before the vote that the resolution would only benefit Hamas but just a handful of countries joined Israel and its closest Ally the US in voting no has been adopted today was a historic day in terms of the powerful message that was sent from the general assembly and it is our Collective duty to continue in this path until we see an end to this aggression against our people while the vote in New York demonstrates much of the world wants an end to the fighting the Israeli government seems determined to press on it has repeatedly ruled out ending military operations until all the hostages in Gaza are freed and Hamas is dismantled that's despite thousands of Palestinian casualties and the increasingly dire humanitarian situation for those trapped within the besieged territory these Aid trucks entering the southern city of Rafa from Egypt are gaza's LIF line but far too few are making it through on Tuesday Israel said it would facilitate more Aid deliveries by starting to check Aid trucks at the Kum Shalom checkpoint before the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7th most Goods entered Gaza via this Israeli Crossing now Israel says convoys will only be inspected at Kem shalom and will still have to enter from Egypt joining me now in the studio is our Middle East analyst shaie rosanes hi shaie um so we've seen this un uh uh general assembly vote um for a ceasefire we've heard president uh Biden speaking very clearly criticizing Israel for indiscriminate bombing in Gaza do you think that this will have any effect in in uh pushing Israel to change its course well it's clear from from Israeli officials statements that they know that the clock is ticking international support is not going to last for too long they're already stting starting to talk about some Finish Line at least for this part of the offenses we've seen it in a couple of weeks uh before after 2024 starts that's unclear but it's clear that it's it's not much longer than that um but we need to keep in mind you know we were mentioning the UN which which is three three quarters of of nations were were standing you know in favor of the ceasefire the Americans are not there and this is the most important thing for is as long as they have American support and backing to keep on fighting against Hamas they will do that and despite the criticism we've been seeing from Biden Israel feels that it has the support of the Americans for the immediate goal of eradicating hamas's rule in Gaza the problem start when we start talking about the end game for Gaza this is where we see more and more um the Rifts between Israel and the Americans and the rest of the International Community growing bigger and bigger so you would say that pressure is clear growing on Israel right now definitely I mean you see the Americans we I mean they're very much deeply involved in what's happening in Israel the uh National Security adviser the American one is going to be heading to Israel tomorrow uh Jack Sullivan he wants to know what's the deadlines he wants to know what Israel has in mind and this is exactly where Israel and the Americans are going back and forth for quite some time now the Americans say where where do you see Gaza the day after and Israel keep saying Israel keep saying well first we need to get there and then we'll see and we've seen netan more and more vocal in the last couple of days against any consideration of bringing the Palestinian Authority the revitalized reformed one into Gaza and this is something the Americans are very not happy with they want to see a solution for Gaza as part of a solution for the whole Palestinian problem they also know this is the only way to bring in support for reconstruction of Gaza from Arab countries like the Saudi Arabia and UAE and other Gulf countries that say we're not going to help Israel solve the Gaza problem uh when they keep on indiscriminately bombing people with without talking about a long-term solution for Palestinians and this is something netan is unequivocally not even willing to consider right now I wanted to ask you about the um trucks Aid trucks that that are being inspected by Israel at the Kum Shalom Crossing but we know that the trucks can still only enter Gaza through the Rafa Crossing can you explain to us what the point of that is I mean why hasn't the Karam Shalom Crossing also been opened wouldn't that make it easier well to be honest it's about Keeping Up Appearance Israel said exactly right after the 7th of October attack happened we are cutting ties from Gaza we don't want not want to be in charge of what's coming in what's coming out everything that happens needs to go through Egypt you know we're rolling that ball to Egypt's uh lap but we know also again talking about the Americans and their pressure there's a mountain pressure for bringing in more humanitarian Aid the Rafa Crossing is out is is not as advanced as the kamam Shalom one the one in Israel the caram Shalom one which was the one in use the main one in use up until October um 7th attack is far more advanced and can process many more trucks so Israel is processing the trucks in the C Shalom Crossing but then sending them back to Egypt to go through Rafa there is an understanding partially probably we will see that part of the pressure applied by Sullivan tomorrow and the Americans saying drop the theatrics drop Technics let's bring Aid in in the most efficient way if it means that gums directly through Israel let's do that because this is technically you know technical elements that are eventually not helping anybody cuz we we're seeing more and more uh death in Gaza and the dire situation there it's not even helping in the benefit of Israel in it's in its cause in in you know trying to push Hamas away from from the strip our Middle East analyst shannie rosanes thanks so much shannie you're
