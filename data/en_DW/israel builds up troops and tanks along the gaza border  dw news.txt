almost one week after the unprecedented Hamas Terror attacks in Israel Israeli Israeli troops have been carrying out raids inside Gaza the military says infantry and tank units entered to track down rocket Crews destroy weapons and search for hostages the raids do not appear to be the beginning of an expected ground offensive Israel has masked troops and tanks along the Gaza border DW correspondent Rebecca rers is in Tela she told us more about this Israeli raids on Gaza well that is what we've been hearing the Israeli military saying that they have been carrying out these very small very targeted very elite teams have been going in and carrying out uh these raids as you said in the lead in there to try particularly I think to look for uh some of the more than 100 hostages we know are being held in Gaza uh this is the first shift really towards a ground Invasion though as you also mentioned not a an indicative of the beginning of such a ground Invasion though that is something that is largely expected to happen in the coming days if not week we've been seeing uh I was down there this week myself been seeing very very uh heavy Armament and and a huge troop movement around that Gaza border and it is thought by everyone though we've had no confirmation from the Israeli military but it is thought that a ground Invasion would be the next step so it isn't surprising that this interim step is a way that they can enter try and look for these hostages and and do other targeted acts in there without triggering the full ground Invasion at this stage twws Rebecca rers in t there now thousands of people are attempting to flee their homes in gaza's North the Israeli military has given over 1 million people just 24 hours to evacuate South the United Nations has called the order impossible and the terror group Hamas is telling people to stay in their homes but many Gins have decided to risk the journey before a possible Invasion Michael oh handland a senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings institution in Washington thank you for joining us Michael I want to start by asking you about Israel's military calling these localized trades do you see them as a first step in a ground Invasion and what does localized trades mean at this point greetings well I thought your coverage was very correct to say that they're looking for certain things and including hostages obviously once they go in and mass with a big Force they know the hostages lives are at even greater Peril and so if there's any hope whatsoever of finding those hostages it makes sense to try to do it beforehand however this is very hard work to find people like needles in a hay stack to find individuals whether Israeli or Hamas leaders or Hamas holding the Israelis because you just don't have a lot of ways to find these individuals you can try you can hope you might know their cell phone numbers or be able to recognize their voices or otherwise have some kind of a Telltale signature but it's not that hard to just find a basement or an apartment and put people there and there's no particular way modern technology can find a hostage or a Hamas leader just based on you know their Identity or their DNA so it's going to take some luck to be able to find anything useful with these limited incursions Israel has been watching the Gaza Strip for years obviously and so they may have some places where they suspect activity's been ongoing where Hamas tends to do uh its most important work or have a lot of its key assets but Hamas is relatively unlikely to put hostages in those places so I think Israel's probably not going to make a lot of Headway in these initial efforts but it makes sense to try because it may be the best hope for getting anyone out of there alive it's interesting to me that you used that analogy of needles in a haast stack because we also talking about an area that is very densely populated and it's an Urban Terrain that is amongst the most densely populated in the world is it given these circumstances even possible for Israel's military to avoid massive civilian casualties if this so-called ground offensive is carried out soon is it's going to be awfully hard and this is of course why Israel has asked or demanded that more than a million Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip relocate it's a Preposterous claim at one level how could they possibly all relocate how could you ever expect that Hamas would let them and yet if they don't they're going to be in the crosshairs of an operation that does not know exactly where it's headed I don't think the Israelis they have some initial targets I'm sure within Gaza beyond that I believe they're hoping that one target leads to another they gain intelligence as they proceed but it's going to have to be you know it's going to have to be human intelligence work which is always painstaking slow and imperfect and requires good sources to be done well I don't know how many Palestinians are going to want to talk to the Israeli Army that's about to enter into Gaza so my overall concern is that the Israelis are not going to be able to do very well at finding what they really want except through Brute Force building byb building searches which means that there will be a lot of firefights there'll be people with itchy trigger fingers there'll be ambushes set up by Hamas that Israel will respond to inocent people will get caught up in the crossfire Israel sometimes will think that it's being ambushed Israeli soldiers will feel that way even if they're not it's going to be an extraordinarily intense and uh unfortunately quite lethal Battleground I'm afraid in in in the coming weeks that sounds like a really difficult situation for everybody involved to navigate and I may be speaking a bit too soon but if these are the circumstances the military will be dealing with at what point can they call for a conclusion to this kind of an offensive what is the main goal at the end here that will make them end such an offensive the main goal I believe is the overthrow of Hamas now we all know prime minister Netanyahu has famously said that if you're a member of Hamas he will die and that's sort of an understandable human emotional reaction to what just happened to his fellow Israelis but I'm not sure it's a realistic military objective and I'm not sure it needs to be but I think what Israel is going to try to do is make sure that Hamas is no longer in charge of the Gaza Strip that itself is going to be a difficult objective to achieve but I think that's the more realistic goal and what they will be trying to do therefore is locate the maximum number of top Hamas leadership top Hamas command and control sites any kind of financial assets Hamas has the weapon that Hamas has and also just to be honest to be blunt create enough pain for everyone not through intentional taking of civilian life but through an operation that will lead to a lot of uh loss of life on all sides that at some point Hamas can be persuaded either to step down or to otherwise allow an international supervision of the rule of Gaza going forward I think that's where this those are the parameters of the conversations that you and I and others will be having over the next two or three weeks because you're right it's too soon to know right we're going to have to see what happens on the Battleground before we can really know but these are the kinds of negotiations and compromises and parameters for you know adjustment that one could expect to see emerge thank you for that analysis Michael handland from The Brookings institution thank you let's take a quick look at some other news concerning the conflict turkey has begun sending humanitarian Aid intended for Gaza two Turkish Air Force planes have brought food and medical supplies into Egypt the raar border crossing is in southern Gaza is the only point where eight can be delivered an artillery strike has killed a journalist and injured six others in southern Lebanon Isam Abdullah of the Reuters news agency was covering clashes on the border with Israel un Secretary General Antonio gutes warn the attack highlights the risk of the conflict spilling over German president Frank Walter Stein meire called for solidarity with Jews during a visit to a synagogue in Berlin he said the state must protect Jewish life after the Hamas terrorist group urged violence against Jewish communities Stein meire said he represents the whole nation at the side of all Jews in Germany US Secretary of State anony lincol has wrapped up talks in Qatar he's been traveling around the region in in an attempt to prevent the conflict widening he began in Israel to show support and discuss hostage negotiations linkoln also met the Palestinian president in Jordan he says it's vital to contain the violence United States and cutter share the goal of preventing this conflict from spreading uh we discussed in detail our efforts to prevent any actor state or non-state from creating a new front uh in this conflict we're also working intensively together to secure the release of hostages including American citizens being held by Hamas and Gaza I'm grateful for the urgency that qter is bringing to this effort let's get more on that with tww special correspondent a Ibraham in Washington it's good to see you a did Lincoln give any more details on how Qatar is helping contain this conflict it is expected that that with qatar's sort of special connections with Hamas a a group that is designated as a terror organization by the US and others but obviously not in Qatar that Qatar can help with hostage negotiations in uh the first uh as a as as a first priority as secretary blinkin and uh President Biden have uh reiterated again and again in in in the days um in the past couple of days that the release of hostages really is a uh priority he's also hoping I mean this is part of you know he's on kind of on a worldwind tour of the region at the moment he's hoping that Qatar can also help with the deescalation effects Qatar has uh not only relationships with Hamas but also relationships with the Iranian regime uh and so there's this is definitely also about deescalation as well as uh maybe helping with hostage negotiations when we speak about deescalation we know that in that press conference we just saw blinken in and he also fielded questions on the humanitarian situation in Gaza how did he respond to those well he did reiterate Israel's right to defend itself uh in the face of these unprecedented uh attacks he said that it is a priority or that he has brought it up with Israeli partners that uh Israel has to also consider civilian life in uh conducting uh these uh attacks pardon in conducting this military uh uh operation he said that there's also an emphasis on finding humanitarian uh corridors uh for civilians within the Gaza Strip uh but he was he was asked specifically about the evacuation order that was given to civilians in Gaza but he did not give any details about whether or not uh he approves or condones uh uh that that particular evacuation order so some careful wording from the secretary of state of the US there but we are seeing him on as you mentioned this Whirlwind tour what exactly is he trying to achieve here through that right we're seeing him um you know he was in Bahrain today in Qatar he's expected to also be in Saudi Arabia and he has been to Jordan and has met with the Palestinian Authority there and that is really in an in an effort to get also players in the region to condemn the terror attacks that took place uh in Israel but also in an effort to deescalate the situation A Ibraham in Washington DC following that story for us of anti blin trip through the Middle East thank you so much
