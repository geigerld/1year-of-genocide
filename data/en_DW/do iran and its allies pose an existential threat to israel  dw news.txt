Israel is at war with Hamas a terror organization in Gaza that is also a proxy of Iran in fact the Islamic Republic of Iran is considered the Archen Enemy of the State of Israel tyron's stated goal is the destruction of Israel but it hasn't always been this way we're joining me here at the big table now is GTO Steinberg he's a familiar face here at DW he's a Middle East analyst and a senior fellow with the German Institute for international and security Affairs GTO it's good to see you again I want to talk with you about this ring of fire that Iran wants to create around Israel we know that Hezbollah and in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza they are part of that ring of fire and I'm wondering to what extent does Tyran control both of these groups tan most likely controls hisbah simply because the Iranian revolutionary guards founded hisbah in South Lebanon in 1982 and they have never been any reports about any conflicts between tan and Southern Beirut where hisbah has its headquarters and I think and most Lebanese think that hisbah receives all its strategic orders from tan and that's totally different with regard to Hamas Hamas is uh is a Sunni organization in contrast to the Islamic Republic in contrast to hisbah it's not religiously and not ideologically aligned it only shares an anti-imperialism with hisbah and Iran and it hates Israel but uh in spite of all the support it has received by by Iran andah it's not a very reliable partner Israel's goal we know remains to destroy hamas's military capabilities will Iran let that happen we know that the Ayatollah has already accused is Israel of Crossing several red lines I mean is there another red line or are there more red lines to cross yeah well the destruction of Hamas might be a red line because uh Iran has invested heavily in in what it calls the exis of resistance and it includes hisbah it includes the hthi rebels in in Yemen Shia militia in Iraq other militias in uh in in Syria and if you try to destroy a part of this axis of resistance and especially an important one like Hamas and it's important simply because it's it's at the heart it is situated at the heart of the conflict with Israel it might force hisbah and Iran to react militarily and I think that's uh that's quite a plausible scenario we've seen rocket Fire coming from Lebanon we've also seen attempts by houis in Yemen to um attack Israel how much of an existential threat are these groups to the state of Israel right now I don't think that they are an existential threat but if all these groups attack uh and if there is a war in the West Bank as well with the Palestinian terrorist groups uh it might might become a large threat although I only take hisb seriously simply because the group is b battle hardened it has fought in in Syria for years and years on the side of the Assad regime it has more than 150,000 missiles drones Rockets cruise missiles 150,000 so they can do a lot of harm they are not an existential threat to Israel but combined Hamas hisbah and all the other groups uh that would be quite an uphill battle for the Israeli Army well what about public sentiment in Iran and in Lebanon for another War I mean is the public will there to go to war no of course not uh we have seen that in Iran for years now right now ever since 2009 the Islamic Republic or perhaps even from the 1990s the Islamic Republic has lost a lot of its legitimacy it has lost a lot of popular support same in Lebanon most Lebanese don't want a war even those who support his hisbah if they remember the war of 2006 when the Israelis destroyed major parts of the South um that's that I think is part of the reason that heah and Iran have been so calm that might be the reason why Hezbollah General SEC secretary needed three weeks uh to to hold a first speech on the conflict uh both sides don't want this war because they know about their own weaknesses in Lebanon and Iraq want to ask you about the um US military presence um today the the Pentagon tweeted a a photo of a US submarine in the Gulf um a submarine that carries nuclear Warheads or can carry Warheads very unusual for the Pentagon to do that we know that the Pentagon has also sent two aircraft carriers into the Mediterranean um is that a clear signal directed exactly at Tyron yes I think so it's it's it's quite unusual uh to see these pictures uh online and I think it's a signal uh the Biden Administration is extremely worried about the conflict escalating especially the conf conflict with hisbah but possibly also with the Iran Allied militia in Iraq in Syria and Yemen and uh possibly also with Iran and I think that's why that is the reason why we have seen these not so subtle yeah uh not so subtle pictures and hints yeah the submarine you're not supposed to see there GTO steinber as always G we appreciate you coming in thank you well from more this I'm now joined by yala zabar she's the head of thews fary services and by Shan rosanes D ww's Middle East analyst um let's start with you yalda uh the uh Iran has has vowed for years to destroy Israel yet we haven't seen any direct involvement in that current conflict yet why you know the Islamic Republic is very strategic um and they kind of uh let others do the work as they as long as they can not you know um not get involved directly but they are um we just heard it in the report they are they have paved the way in the last 40 years actually to support the the um their proxies to support the Hamas to support hisbah financially ideologically and uh military and um so this is uh they are actually now seeing it also depends on how hard and how the message from the other side is um the US made it actually very clear by sending warships to the med Mediterranean and now um also submarines in the region that um if Lebanon if hisbah uh enters the war we will hit uh hisbah so they are very aware of that and I think this message arrives there as well um and also right after the uh the the Hamas attacks on 7th October um us said that there is no uh indications that Iran has been involved directly and this is also a message in in in in in a way to say we don't want to get involved with you in a war um so you know watch out sh y has just mentioned the the the proxies that is uh the hooes in in Yemen and Hezbollah in in Lebanon how big of of a threat are those two for Israel's security well we we've seen them badgering I mean to the least uh Israel in the last four weeks um they keep Israel's Army stretched to its maximum between the Deep South you know the the middle southern part of Israel with Hamas under the north um and also we know of of shiat militias operating in Syria which is to the to the southern border uh eastern border of Israel that's also and at the same time we've also seen militias backed by Iran operating against American forces in Iraq and this is also something we need to keep in mind you know yelda was mentioning the American involvement here they are on the ground this affects the Americans very well this is not just their fear of bigger escalation for the region this has straight you know implications for the Americans as well if this goes out of hand and if Iran goes more involved deeper into this conflict Shany Israel's aim is quote to destroy Hamas how realistic is that if we're looking at the support it is getting from uh a big big player like Iran no doubt that the support the financial Al we know of equipment and training that was provided by Iran uh before the October 7th effect no doubt it brought Hamas to this very Advanced position where they managed to to surprise Israel in such a way uh during that attack um we also need to keep in mind destroying Hamas is also destroying the idea behind Hamas this is almost impossible will it be possible however to uproot the leaders of that movement and its operational um structure in Gaza Israeli idea of claims it is possible it's all depending on the costs you know how much time Israel has and how much patience that the world have to bear with the immense cost we see in civilian lives that is you know this operation is taking in Gaza yala back to you um you've touched upon this but how big is the risk of this turning into an open confrontation uh between Israel and Iran you know there are many factors behind it at the moment given Iran is trying to avoid uh getting into a war because they know uh speaking about the costs um they know that that could also there there's a high price to it because Iran is right now domestically weakened um within the population um they have basically uh based on surveys only around 10 to 15% uh support of the Iranian uh population that we have we have been witnessing the this ongoing Revolution the woman life Freedom Movement until now so they are very you know very hard on uh cracking down the protesters inside but they also know that uh now entering a war and then having the outside and the the inside Factor um they are I think not prepared for that at the moment now Iran yala is also threatening the West Iran's defense minister said that quote he would be quote Iran would be hit hard if Washington didn't Implement a ceasefire in Gaza is all this just posturing from tan or is it raising the stakes it is actually demonstrating Force I think and we have to also uh keep in mind for instance the the the well much anticipated speech of hisbah leader n Hassan nasah um some days ago everyone or his followers uh they they expected maybe a more uh harsh kind of let's go we enter this war um tone and it wasn't and um we canot we know it is clear that it is this is you know um tan the Islamic Republic and uh the hisbah leader all saying that they were surprised by the Hamas attack and really these are signs that they are you know demonstrating Force but they are don't really want to get involved and there's also another maybe important issue to mention that um throughout like these last 44 years of the Islamic Republic this Narrative of anti-israel you know people in school having to chant every morning death to Israel and death to us this has changed a lot within the the population in Iran so what we see now is basically a huge support for Israel opposing all the values of of their uh government of the Islamic Republic sh uh the US also says uh the a nuclear missile submarine has arrived in the region is that a message to Iran directly brief definitely that was the first thing that Biden said on the first day any looking at what's happening between Hamas and Israel and you know considering to join in don't that was exact a quote from Biden uh we've seen also at the same time you know you were just mentioning earlier blinkin you know visit to the Middle East we will if you look back there's another foreign minister taking you know uh tours around the Middle East and that's the the Iranian one you know he's been to Turkey he's been to leanan so we are seeing these two very clear uh parallel objecting uh alliances formed between the what the Americans are trying to build the moderate Alli Alliance which includes Jordan Egypt Bahrain the Saudi Arabia and so on and then on the other hand we've seen you know the the the uh Iranian foreign minister in Lebanon with Hamas also Turkey um and and this is basically why the Americans and the whole world is watching at this conflict because there's an understanding this is much bigger than just the immediate Israel Hamas conflict a lot a lot of players at work there that's for sure Yak head of DW's F service and Shan rosan is DW's Middle East analyst thank you both very
