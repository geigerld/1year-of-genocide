that was DW Washington bureau chief enus Paul there we're still in Washington and Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to continue the war in Gaza and called on the United States to Stand United with Israel addressing a joint session of Congress the Israeli Prime Minister defended his country's conduct of the war as protesters gathered outside to demand an end to the conflict Mr Netanyahu was met with standing ovations for most from most of the chamber but despite boycotts from some democratic lawmakers and he blamed Iran and its proxies of forting instability across the Middle East and said he would do whatever it takes to protect Israel ladies and gentlemen that Victory is in sight Israel's defeat of Hamas will be a powerful blow to Iran's AIS of Terror another part of that AIS hisbah attacked Israel on October 8th a day after the Hamas attack it has launched thousands of missiles and drones against us 80,000 of our citizens in Northern Israel evacuated their homes becoming effectively refugees in their own land we are committed to returning them home we prefer to achieve this diplomatically but let me be clear Israel will do whatever it must do to restore security to our northern border and return our people safely to their homes all right let's bring in Gerald feein a former US ambassador to Yemen who also served as a diplomat in several other countries in the region he's with the Middle East Institute in Washington DC and joins us from Philadelphia welcome to you I want to start by asking what do you think we learned from the Israeli Prime Minister speech today it's a pleasure to be with you uh this evening uh and and frankly uh not terribly much I think that uh the speech was mostly uh uh the uh prime minister's attempt to defend uh what Israel has done over these past nine almost 10 months uh to uh not really give uh any indication of in uh of introspection of any kind of review of the Plus or minuses of Israeli action certainly no vision of where uh he wants to go after the Gaza conflict uh the one thing he was much more careful uh this time than he was in 2015 uh when he spoke to the Congress about the Obama administration's efforts to achieve a nuclear agreement with Iran uh this time he was much more careful to balance uh between uh the Republicans and the Democrats between president Biden and president Trump uh and to try to avoid uh getting embroiled in the US Presidential politics but otherwise it was a very aggressive speech it was a very uncompromising speech it was not one that will give people who are concerned about Israel's actions a very much reason for optimism Netanyahu called for a de demilitarized and deradicalized post-war Gaza but he didn't say how this would be achieved do you see much of a workable day after strategy here well certainly not in terms of what uh of what uh prime minister Netanyahu talked about today uh the idea that Israeli military op operations are going to somehow lead to a deradicalized Gaza I think even most Israelis most senior Israeli military officials intelligence official offal understand that he's never going to achieve that goal in fact I think that on on the on the current trajectory uh what we should be anticipating is a much more radical Gaza a much more embittered and uh and determined to strike at Israel Gaza population the counts vary but at least 60 Democrat lawmakers boycotted netanyahu's speech one reporter said it was as as many as 130 absent does this constitute a Democratic party turning away from Israel I don't know that they're turning away from Israel and I think that it's important that we distinguish between support for the state of Israel which I believe is still very strong uh on on a bipartisan basis uh and support for Israel under the current leadership under Benjamin Netanyahu and this very extreme right-wing government that he's got in power uh and uh what they're doing in Gaza right now so I think uh I think that if uh if Netanyahu leaves the scene if we have a government in Israel uh that is more positive more forward leaning more uh responsive uh to the calls not only of Washington but the entire International Community uh you will see the support for Israel there but under current circumstances and again you know the attack that he laid that he led uh against uh demonstrators against people many of whom are sincere legitimate concerned about the situation in Gaza and basically calling anyone who disagrees with him Pro Hamas or an Iranian useful idiot is not something that's going to be inclined to strengthen his support among uh concerned parties well let's have a look at that vision and other parts of that speech with Aaron David Miller who is a senior fellow at the carnegi Endowment for International Peace he focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East welcome to DW uh this seems to be BB at his oratorial best let's start with that vision of the day after what did you make of it I mean I think it is his vision but if you were looking for nuance and creativity you certainly weren't going to find it there the reality is that right now gaza's future is pretty Grand in large part because of two or three realities one of which the Prime Minister I think reflected accurate number one Hamas is going to survive as an Insurgency uh it may not be able to control Gaza but it will through cooptation and intimidation be able to influence significantly the PO the politics of who or what actually governs there second the idea of a Palestinian Administration uh technocratic government composed of local gazit the Prime Minister didn't rule out Palestinian Authority participation but he didn't endorse it um either and that's a second issue is there a Palestinian governing structure that the Israelis would accept right now that can affect govern Gaza and also maintain uh basic law functions of Law and Order and three he rightly I think um made it unmistakably clear that without some successor security AR architecture the Israelis are going to uh have the capacity and he insisted on the right to basically deal with Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad so I I think in large part he he has failed in the sense that he's not willing to even Explore what I would consider to be a serious day after strategy but even if he were willing to do that I think it would be extremely difficult under these circumstances to create it so from what you've said it sounds like whatever before we even get to the day after the days leading up to the day after and and indeed Beyond it just sounds like an ongoing mess mess mess I mean I I I don't I don't want to rule out the possibility and I think there is a significant chance that by mid August you could actually see assuming Mr netan and Hamas agreed to um a endorsement of the three phase three stages Israeli plan which the president of the United States articulated on May 31st and then in scon the UN Security Council res I think there's a reasonable chance given the fact that both the Israeli Defense Forces and Hamas for any number of reasons uh need a pause that you could actually see the first phase of that agreement implemented a limited exchange of hostages uh for a six weeks ceasefire if you could get six weeks of quiet in Gaza you might be able to build on that to move into phases two or three but right now I don't see that one note that's important to keep keep in mind on on July 28th the Israeli conet goes into recess it will not resume until two weeks weeks roughly two weeks before our elections during that time it is almost impossible for any member of the coalition to bring about either a constructive voting no confidence or to schedule new election so if Mr netan were inclined pressured by the IDF and the need to return hostages to basically sign on to that deal he could probably get away with it right with respect to the more radical extremist members of his Coalition okay thanks for that despite the constant Applause that we saw during that 50 odd minute speech and the standing ovations it's clear that Mr Netanyahu doesn't have unequivocal bipartisan support in Congress how much though do you think that speech will have shifted the needle I think that what this visit reflects and what this speech reflects is that there is a serious frin if not deterioration of bipartisan support for Israel by one count uh only a 100 of the 212 house Democratic members showed up and roughly 27 of the 51 Democratic senators and in an amazing amazing way Israel has now become a highly partisan issue the Republican party is the Israel can do no wrong part and the Democratic party is dived into progressives who want to impose serious costs on Israel for their activities and actions and more modern mainstream Democrats you you uh showed one Chris Van Holland who along with Chris Murphy and um Chris Coons basically called for significant restrictions on US military assistance in Israel so I think that's the key issue the key takeaway from this visit is not what it's going to achieve it's what it reflect flex and the absence of bipartisanship is I think a extremely worrisome Factor both for making significant policy for any Administration uh and for the health and well-being of a US Israel relationship that's based on reciprocity and respect for Mutual interests and so if we look ahead to next year and a new Administration do you think it is simple as president Trump will um will have will have Israel's back as it were whereas a a president uh Harris will have to do a much more complicated dance I think the latter case you I think you you hit it correctly and punative president Harris will still I think she's a moderate mainstream Democrat with moderate mainstream views although I suggested earlier that there is an inner comma Harris which I think uh is very angry and frustrated uh and much more empathetic with respect to Palestinian suffering uh and the need to find a solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict based on meeting the mutual needs and requirements of both parties uh it's not as the Prime Minister wanted to portray a morality play between good versus evil that may be the case with Hamas but it's not the case with the vast majority of Palestinians so I think there might be a significant um possibility or effort on the part of a comma Harris Administration and a change of leadership in Israel that is absolutely essential if you're going to get anything done here and I think uh it would also help uh in the bipartisanship category if you got an Israeli Prime Minister who wasn't fighting the United States at every twist and turn who wasn't committed or acquiescing in his radical ministers efforts to Annex the West Bank and everything but name and who sought to be more creative with respect to what a better future for postconflict Gaza could actually uh could actually look like okay now when's this big political TV event though won't be this speech but President Biden's first overal office uh address since dropping out of the election race does that leave only Israel as the audience for Mr netanyahu's speech I think the Republican party was and there uh again the Israel can no go no wrong party and I work for Republican and democ Democratic administrations and voted for republicans and Democrats this not a partisan comment it's just a reflection of the reality it may well be Phil that the most important piece of Mr Nintendo's visit it's not the meeting with Biden not the meeting with Comm Harris not even the speech before Congress but the meeting he's going to have what I call the Neto pilgrimage down to Mara Lago where he will try to mend his rather Fray relationship with the former president he's identified he Benjamin netan his politics his party with the Republicans that's his clear preference and frankly if he could vote in our elections you know who he'd be voting for well let's pick through this that speech with DW reporter Stefan Simons in Washington DC and our middle Easter analyst shaie rzan is here with me welcome both let's start with you shy main takeaways then from this this barnstorming speech in the US Congress no doubt detan knows his craft he's master in Communications he know American audiences you know American politics through and through but at the same time it's very low in substance very very little new things we can take out of it he stuck to the main talking points we've been hearing him in his in his administration uh talking about in the last uh months uh his main goals were to defend Israeli conduct uh since October 7th I think he did it quite successfully he wanted to shift the focus you know from what Israel is doing to what's being done to Israel portraying Israel as a victim of a bigger uh you know scheme orchestrated by Iran and of course the third one to align Israel with the us sharing the same values sharing the same struggle and I think in that point it was very effective but not very much new subance that we've seen there other than that okay um Stephan Simons in in Washington so a rapturous reception uh from uh the the gathered lawmakers lots of standing ovations but some boycotts as well from Democrats yeah about 50 uh reportedly 50 Democrats have were a no-show for to this address by Benjamin nanyu and you know um Republicans all showed up uh but those 50 democrats for various reasons chose not to be in the room and uh not to show up for this address um why is that well you know we are in a election campaign here we're not only in November uh voting for or electing a new president but the ticket goes down the aisle meaning there are Senators to be elected there are of Representatives being reelected etc etc so there's a lot of un stake and a lot of Democrats are they can't afford ignoring their constituencies and how the feeling and what the sentiment regarding Benjamin Nan and the conduct of the Israeli military in Gaza is so with that being said 50 of them up to 50 of them uh didn't show up okay and Mr Netanyahu talked about the crowds gathered outside the building to protest we will hear from them and then we'll come back to you Stefan Simons Iran is funding the anti-israel protests that are going on right now outside this building not that many but they're there and throughout the city well I have a message for these protesters when the tyrants of tan who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising promoting and funding you you have officially become Iran's useful idiots well Stefan you spent some time amongst those useful idiots who was Mr Nan's characterization of them um at all accurate well it's certainly a simplification and Benjamin Nan knows that of course but I mean you know it serves the purpose and it served the speech no uh it's a little bit more complicated than that I'm not saying that there is no Iranian influence or maybe money going into specific groups which will or who do show up uh you know that's possible but that is a very very diverse crowd and it's not just a few it's a few thousand and you know they managed to shut down Constitution Avenue so that's not nothing um there is money involved uh we could see this because they were fairly uh well organized uh there was Billboards and uh a stage with with pa uh so speeches could be held and so on but it is a very diverse group group of different groups with different agendas with different backgrounds and you know what also there protesting against benjaman and against the speech and against the war in Gaza are some families hostage families who are desperate of getting their loved ones back and who are asking Benjamin Netanyahu to do more to maybe really consider a US proposed and negotiated ceasefire or even peace agreement so it's a little bit more complicated than benj Benjamin netan wants to make make um uh representatives and senators of the Republican party and the Democrats believe and the American public okay and and shaie you you you criticize that the speech as being a light on substance but we did get a glimpse of something that has been called for for some time and that is a a glimpse of what what Mr Netanyahu has in in uh in in mind for the day after this war star ends well interestingly enough that's true but interestingly enough he doesn't talk about how we get there he doesn't mention the word fire at all throughout the speech over 50 minutes of talk he doesn't talk about end to the war how do we make it to the day after only you know the only thing he talks about is the need for complete Victory it's the same slogans we've been hearing him for talking about for months without really understanding what's his concrete plan of getting there but once we are there that is true thenan is for the first time maybe uh playing you know featuring his vision that will bring Gaza into civil Administration run by Palestinians he said we do not wish to settle in Gaza but we will control it you know at the beginning to make sure that there's no defense or you know any security threats to Israel he talks about the dire need to demilitarize and deradicalize Gaza giving also examples of Japan and Germany from World War II of course very different cases and comparisons in history but again very light on how to get there who would be those people in those civil Administration you know who would be those Palestinians that will be volunteering to do that where would the money for this come from if we're talking about International alliances or Regional alliances then the world and Regional players want to see more from netan and his government before they're willing to step into this hot mess of of Gaza needs and and more commitment from Israel for a long-term Plan before being willing to you know to step in so um a lot of what we've been hearing so far from Netanyahu the need to Der radicalize Gaza but still very light on how exactly it should be happening and a word about the other audience that Mr Netanyahu uh was addressing Beyond Capitol Hill back home in Israel yeah well that's definitely Net's main crowd he I think he you know showing to Israeli crowd the standing ofation the popularity that he has among Americans helping you know helps him in his mind to retain his stature as a strong leader of Israel something that was of course completely shattered after the October 7th attack but you know there's something symbolic in this day specifically this is a day when the Israeli Parliament is going on a very long summer pause and netan when he started when this session started started shortly after the attack of October 7th nobody thought netan will manage to survive as Israel's primee Minister through all this months and we've seen him we've seen him survive we've seen him gain more and more popularity and support and we see also tonight why you know when he is in his element He knows how to Rally his base and his base in Israel but also in this case a lot of the Republican uh base that is very much the supporters he also been using a lot of biblical terms referencing to the the evangelicals who are a big crowd of supporters for Israelis especially for his administ ation throughout the years so this is some ofat what we're seeing uh tonight very well crafted and strategically uh performed uh speech by n okay so um the he due to meet um vice president uh Harris at tomorrow he's also separately meeting uh President Biden and then he's going on to meet uh president former president Trump what do you think these meetings are likely to bring well if we're honest these are actually the most important parts of his visit the speech might be you know something that he was very much looking forward you know he was talking about the historic you know record that he's breaking being the only leader to speak four times in front of the joint Congress but the real deal will happen in those meetings we we expect Biden to put a lot of pressure on Nano to try to cment the deal the hostage deal something that we've been seeing Nano quite reluctant in doing in the last weeks we know for Biden it's important as part of his legacy because he knows that his uh you know his name will forever be tied to the Gaza war and he would wish to see that comes to an end sooner rather than later so that's one thing Harris interestingly which he did not mention in his speech and did not preside over this joint Congress meeting which how she would usually do you know she needs this meeting in a way in order to help her build her stature as an international leader potential future leader of the US but at the same time she doesn't want to you know she wants to also be able to maintain some distance from Nano because you know it's very toxic and very uh uh you know very uh controversial topic when it comes to to her base in the Democratic uh party so she's going to do the minimum but still keep doing that and of course we're trumping something completely different Nan is banking on Trump to be the support that he needs once if one day in November he goes back to the White House there there there have been a lot of tensions between them in the last years and they're hoping to restart it again um in the upcoming Friday in the meeting okay um final word to you uh Stefan Simons in Washington that the relationship between um Mr n who and President Biden has been very brittle he went to Great pains to thank him but how is this going to how is this relationship going to develop now with Joe Biden not standing for um a second term and effectively being a lame duck over the next six months how does he get leverag to push to press on this uh this peace deal yeah well absolutely that's right on the money there uh Phil um you Benjamin n will get an earful from President Biden because the president has nothing to worry about anymore he's not going to go for another term CA Harris is and uh sh just referred to that a little bit um she is very aware of that the youth vote in America and the independent the independent uh voters as well as female Suburban vote they do not look very kindly on what's going on in Gaza right now and Cala Harris is protecting this President Biden will tell him uh if she wins and you don't do what we want you and ask you to do right now then you will look into um well a potentially dark hole in terms of your relationships with us and with a potential Harris Administration Donald Trump completely different scenario he's going to kiss the ring as shy alluded to there is frictions uh Benjamin Netanyahu dared to congratulate President Biden for his election about three and a half years ago and Donald Trump has never forgotten that um despite the fact that he brought the embassy from um Tel aiv to Jerusalem so there's a lot bit of hugging and schmoozing going on on Friday then with Donald Trump and that's the scenario we're looking at for Benjamin Nan with the White House and Donald Trump okay thanks for that Stephan Simons in Washington thank you so much and Shan rzan is here with me thank you as well
