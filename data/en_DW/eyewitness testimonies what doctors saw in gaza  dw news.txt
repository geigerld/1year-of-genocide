I never in a million years imagined we would get to this point anybody who requires uh any complex consistent weekly treatment those people are all dead already in Gaza no no place is safe the aim is to wipe out everything it's one thing again to die in an air strike it's one thing to be a victim of trauma but it's another thing to starve to death my name is R sub and I work as nutrition officer in mid Global in North Gaza I have witnessed and lived the war in the Gaza from the beginning and as I did not move to the S what you hear on the ground is the buzzing sound of surveillance drones that don't leave the skies this is like uh 247 music to our ears uh bad music something that we uh we haven't consented to listen to right now I'm standing in shifa hospital in Gaza this hospital is the biggest everything is collapsing in Health Systems hospitals collapsing like I said that we have 22 Health Centers we have only four now so services are collapsing the people are so tired so all the challenge you can think of is H having Gaza I've been in Jordan for the Z refugee camp for syan refug refes I was in Greece uh Tess Niki next to the Hungarian border when when there were refugees on the ground there uh I was in I've been in Haiti I've been in Ghana I've been uh with rangan refugees in in in Bangladesh I had been to Northern Syria after the earthquake turkey after the earthquake I've been to Greece during the refugee crisis to Jordan I started in Pakistan I have worked more than two years in Afghanistan Nigeria I was in South Sudan I work in the Gaza IND previous war I work in the Syria and I work in Lebanon I've been in Syria I've been in Yemen I've been in Iraq in South Lebanon all of those trips are nothing compared to this trip I have never seen this kind of crisis in my life it's different here but I've never been in a genocidal War where the aim is to wipe out everything where the aim is to take out the health system as a central part of the military strategy Gaza is on another level and it's all because everything is working against the people and you just see [Music] well the last attempt that we tried to get into Gaza I was turned away I mean one communication even suggested that if your grandparents or Palestinian that you would not be allowed to enter and if somehow you're able to enter you're not going to be to leave so this is these are the things that we're hearing now and I mean you know you can imagine the sort of Rage that you know that that sort of that I have inside of me hearing something like that I mean I speak the language I know the the Customs the practices I know the land I know the people they're my people they look like me uh their kids look like my kids and we're talking about preventing me to from from accessing this piece of land that you know I have so much connection and uh there's so much emotion that's there I mean the first question is why what purpose does that serve what purpose does it serve to prevent somebody like me from entering into Gaza and I will be testing it I mean I want to I want to I want to go back and you know you're going to have to turn me away again to prevent me from entering it it felt like uh and what I mean by that is there's no doubt that there was a purposeful manipulation of dates to make it almost impossible to go I we scheduled ourselves almost every week and it kept getting canceled with d before we leave or two days before we leave because the dates kept changing for what was approved uh for the number of people allowed to go for what day we could cross for what we like to take with us and uh I my group that was initially supposed to be eight or 10 or 12 docs ended up being just me in these hospitals or in these clinics when you're there um it serves multiple roles I mean I would say the clinical aspect of it where you're actually treating people but it's sort of the relationships that you're able to form with your Palestinian colleagues who are able to share with you the challenges on a person and professional level the stories are not getting out there in the way that they should and it's because International journalists are not allowed to enter my my suspicion is uh is that the reason they don't want that they limit the international positions from being there is they want as few Eyes On The Ground as possible so I remember once looking out of the window and and seeing a whole neighborhood go up in Flames as the Israelis dropped what we now know are 2,000 PB bombs on a neighborhood the whole neighborhood Goes Up in Flames and then there's a dust bowl and then once the dust bowl settles there's nothing left of that neighborhood and so it's not like the the building was Target the whole neighborhood disappeared when they bomb the water desalination plants when they bomb the the sewage pumping plants you could see that that there were two parallel targets one was this massive elimination and annihilation of human life and the other was the infrastructure the the the the investment in the destruction of infrastructure that they hoped would then create a genocidal killing machine diseases and of famine I can't you know I I really can't even fathom the scale of Destruction as somebody who used to take pictures of the beauty of Gaza and having gone back and then now seeing all of these places where I have memories of places where I've gotten to meet some of the incredible people that's there seeing that that's been leveled and destroyed um you know that's something that's tough to reconcile we get to the hospital we sleep in the hospital we're staying there and it's Relentless it's not stop I remember thinking at night you know just laying in the mattress in the room in the hospital and just getting so frustrated by how often I was hearing the bombing take place it's you know you're obviously you can't sleep but the second part of this is you're wondering who's on the receiving end of this bomb and you're like it's just you know and I don't know what is it a tank is it a drone is it an is it a fighter jet is it you know what is what kind of bomb is exploding I don't know and you just are hearing it fire every 5 minutes 2:00 a.m. at 3:00 a.m. it's louder you know at 4: at 4:00 a.m. you hear the call to prayer and it's it's mixed in with bombs that are being dropped and you're like you're just at you're just like you're just like yelling into the into the nothingness into the darkness just you're yelling for it to stop because you know like downstairs if I go downstairs to the emergency department I know that I know what's going to be coming in and it's all of these different families that are bringing in their loved ones by you know they're carrying them in because you know an ambulance is too dangerous for an ambulance to go and retrieve some of the injured and some of the Dead a young man had come in and he had lost both of his legs and I remember his wife I will never forget his wife kind of was kind of rushed inside and we're I mean there's people all over on the floor that we're trying to treat who had just been brought um because we didn't have any beds left and his wife comes up to us it's just the first question she's asking because she sees that he's lost his legs she said please can he can that be fixed can he get his legs back because she's seen for the last four months how many people have lost limbs and how that's devastated them and how the infrastructure means that it's a death sentence there are no wheelchairs you're not going to get Prosthetics in Gaza you're not going to get you you'll be lucky if you can get crutches to move around normally you try to have a better ensy rate of 100% it means each bed will have one patient um we seeing here the hospitals more with occupancy rate of 300% almost every single one was dis placed and multiple times so they they lost their house they lost their living and they living T and they continue to work say if you live in our shelters we have only one toilet for the 398 people and one shower for the 3,000 people every single empty space in that place was full of somebody sick dying for their family member they were displaced people everywhere in these hospitals I mean literally lining the hallways any inch of the hospital that was open was going to be occupied by a displaced [Laughter] Palestinian we are uh continuously running out of essential uh medicines like barol anti- fever medications and anti dial medications and sometimes we have to take to um to turn away patients telling them that the only thing that we can give them is only advice and sometimes they have to close down they're just announcing we cannot admit anyone any longer there was no stretchers there was no Linens there was no gauze you know very small amounts of gauze available for wound care um you know blood products transfusions infusions of IV fluids um all those things uh were an extremely short supply and that's because there's been a very conscious and structural effort not to allow any medical supplies in um which shocks people when they hear it and they think you know I've already talked to people who almost don't believe me and I tell them this isn't me telling you what I heard on the news this is me telling you what I had with me when I tried to go in to uh to to to Gaza I had you know five six suitcases full of medical supplies that I kind of prepared like I do on every Mission I've ever gone on medicines antibiotics all those things and and I was denied uh denied every one of those bags from entering and even the you can carry one bag with you that's less than 23 kg I mean we but when we were entering through rafah in Egypt myself and four other Physicians brought in 23 bags of medical supplies and that's because we know that the trucks are stalled at the borders we know that the trucks are not able to get in with medical supplies with infant formula the fundamental of the Health Service is what stable installation stable energy and the stable medicines all of them are lacking like as I said the many heal Center closed and the fuel is not coming as regularly as everybody want medicine we are running out of almost 40% of the medicines and it's summer so we have a lot of skin conditions and they want have skin medicine which we don't have yet we trying to send it to Gaza and power went out regularly so we went from situations where they already isn't adequate ventilation you know ORS operating theaters are supposed to have a certain amount of turnover of air to prevent infection and and and some of these other things and and um you know the anesthesia machine requires electricity the the the oxygen machine requires electricity those things would stop functioning mid surgery and and the room would get dark uh and if if there wasn't a headlamp in the room for the surgeon to use uh he would wait or she would wait for the for the lights to come back on and that could be a minutes or or or much longer and in the in the ICU that meant ventilators uh were at risk of of not working so patients that were completely dependent upon a machine to breathe for them would have periods of time when the machine would turn off and all the nurses and doctors would run to their bedside and have to manually use the amb back uh to to bag them when I'm walking through the pediatric department and I'm seeing kids who are struggling with respiratory viruses that's working up their asthma but we don't have enough of the breathing treatments for them you know you're just kind of sitting there with your hands crossed like hoping that things get better I remember we ran out of paracetamol Tylenol acetamin we ran out of that while there's flu and covid spreading through the pediatric department so what what am I supposed to give these kids for fevers we were doing old old remedies like okay well you know uh undress them you know try to put some you know if you can get a hold of something that's cold put it under their armpits I mean these things are not going to work everybody I spoke to told me they lost 30 kilos every single person in that months right 20 30 kilos women lost 15 to 10 20 kilos and all the men said 30 kilos you see it on their faces because when you lose weight that quickly uh you lose weight in a different way than you do when we try to lose weight right they lose the the fat pads and and their temporal area right their cheeks become kind of sunk in so when I was there one of the things the Israelis had done is that they had surrounded the blood bank and they had prevented blood products from getting to hospitals and so a lot of times we were you know when we were surrounded in Ali hospital after the Israelis had surrounded shifa is is that we needed to do amputations to save lives because we didn't have blood products and and the surgery needed to be stopped needed to be short everything refrigerated is gone and when you talk about medication you think about all the medications including insulin for diabetes is is not viable anymore right so every single patient with type 1 diabetes that is 100% dependent upon insulin they're dying there's there's nothing we can do for them I I would say more we saw more amputations from the complexity of endstage diabetes than we did from the Bomb Blast and we saw more Bomb Blast amputations than I ever wanted to see in my entire life they're choked off from the rest of the world people have the gall to say it's overstated and I I I grab them by the chest and shake them and tell them you have no idea what you're talking about it's the opposite if the death to only included the those who died from the immediate Bomb Blast those numbers are real but if you want to include everybody who dies from wound infections three four five six seven eight days after after the trauma the number is in the tens of thousands higher now even if the war support ends today people cannot go back home because home their homes are destroyed and even if you manage to go back home water supply is limited soil system limited and the food is limited economy is collapsing so let's say if the war there was a ceasefire today the famine will continue to take the lives of people the absence of medication will continue to cause people to die from chronic diseases that had been under control but became medical emergencies because they're not uh able to uh uh get their medication the infectious disease is epidemic and and recently we heard about polio being detected but hepatitis A diarrheal diseases will continue to take the lives particularly of the vulnerable uh uh children in our study in the health center almost 10% of the children are malnourished before the war it was around 1% and so it's a quite large increase and once you be one become malnourished immunity decrease and so that they have less resistance to the any infectious diseases well this is this is uh the Crux of the problem and this is the cruelty of the war and the way that it's been prosecuted in Gaza is we know that again if there is a ceasefire tomorrow and you open the borders totally and you allow all of the possible medical supplies and Aid and food and water in that there will still be thousands of people that will die because it's just too little too late and we know that that's how the conditions have been set and this has been well established this is not speculation and this is not opinion of Physicians this has been well established by John Hopkins School of Public Health the London School of tropical medicine and hygiene the lanet had recently published article thinking that the death toll is much higher and that this is what could happen and the way that people can understand this is we always talk about in covid if we ran out of ventilators and supplies how many people would die who would have otherwise survived that number is astronomically high in Gaza and it's precisely because of the cruel cruelty of the way that the war has been prosecuted this is where you see the horrifying cruelty that's taking place it's when you've stopped bombing them and you've stopped having troops on the ground and people are still dying in large numbers it's not just about the building that gets bombed and the people that die in the bombing it's the fact that where thousands of people were Sheltering they don't shelter there anymore and now they have to go to an even more crowded place so the risk of disease will spread there and then you hear that a water an area where there was available like in ra 2 days ago the Israeli Army destroyed a water infrastructure plant there you think okay it's destroyed there's damage to the building but the ripple effect it's so deep and it's going to cause so many problems that that's something that I think needs more attention because you know you know that's one thing again to die in an air strike it's one thing to be a victim of trauma but it's another thing to starve to death it's another thing to die from a disease that has a medicine that all you need is a clean bed and enough supplies in a hospital to survive but to die from that and to die slowly and painfully from that I mean that's what's going to happen in Gaza and that's what's happening already in Gaza for those Physicians that are constantly exposed to these kind of um you know horrible images of people amputated and people uh you know um butchered in in in in every possible way and this will have the future consequences because this will show up there will be a moment when this these things will will haunt us or reappear at some point in the future I was at NAS hospital when there was the dialysis center there's a dialysis building right next to nasar hospital in canun and I remember coming back and remembering that the Israeli Army had destroyed the area there was uh you know it was rans sacked and it was a you know all of Nas had become you know an empty space I remember that there were 500 500 people with kidney failure who were getting dialysis at that building what happened to those 500 people their kidneys don't work dialysis is life-saving for them and they need it three times a week three times a week they need to get that sort of treatment and you just told them you just kicked them out of the area where they were getting treatment to an area where they would not be able to get treatment what happened to them toxins filled up in their body and they died NASA hospital when it was raided a few months prior to when I got there um I had multiple people tell me and that I saw with my own eyes when I visited there one day that the entire D unit was destroyed it was selectively chosen there bullet holes in dialysis machines you know anybody who requires uh any complex consistent weekly treatment uh uh to survive or not have rapid progression of the disease those people are all dead already I had the kind of honor of having to work with Gaz and Physicians and healthcare workers and nursing staff who told me their stories firsthand and showed me pictures on their phones and and they weren't just stories they were people that I touched that I sat with and work with for a month and got to know who they were um and they told me stories of uh being detained of being targeted with weapons of being sexually abused in in detainment being stripped naked uh what one physician told me uh that for the three weeks of detainment that he was there that uh the only reason the guard stopped beating him up is because he would get tired I was able to speak to a physician at AA Hospital in central Gaza in the ICU who took me through how he was detained and arrested and what happened to him in the two weeks where he was abducted from a hospital the hospital had been shut down and how he had been stripped naked and how he was left outside in the cold cuz this was in January and that process he was just finally able to share that sort of degrading and humiliating process with somebody who's in a similar profession as him somebody who you know understands kind of the role that you have within the community and you know how you're supposed to serve people and you're supposed to and this was happening to him you know I'm able to talk to another physician who told me about how his mom his elderly mother is in a displacement Camp she's in a tent and she has a tough time walking and the nearest bathroom for her is is a 15-minute walk you know he he can't you know that's something that's the first time he was able to share that with somebody unfortunately we lost some of the stuff because of the bombardment and so that in un almost 100 more than 190 stuff were killed since the the start of the war so this is a day today one there is unfortunately targeted uh killing of our medical staffers for example one of my uh one of the director of the internal medicine Department Dr raat Lad have been killed we intimately do feel the constant fear of being uh directly targeted or a a justifiable collateral damage honestly I I don't know how they still manage to provide services and they are coming with clean clothes I have no idea how they still manage to keep this remain of of of humanity to to go every day to work because also there is in the majority of the facilities there is no salary at the moment they they're working on voluntary basis you are asking them to show up to work day in and day out despite their family being displaced despite food being a problem despite not being able to pay them they are showing up to work day in and day out knowing they don't have the medicine that they need the supplies that they need they are showing up to work knowing that the hospital could be raided that they could be arrested or killed or they could end up in a mass grave in the perimeter of the hospital and they're still doing it and they do it in an incredible fashion with Humanity with compassion with empathy and most of all with a skill set that I don't think is replicated anywhere else uh across the globe for example just today when the evacuation order was in place the sub the water supplier has mentioned has called us saying that he is not able to refill his water tank which means that we don't have clean water now sometimes we go to uh the local market and find nothing the staff is so overwhelmed you know I I remember another young man who had been brought in who had been uh had you know this is kind of really so it's just so tragic but he had come in a couple of days earlier and the thought was that the shrapnel that had hit his body was all superficial and that he would be okay well you know the way that shrapnel works is it just sort of sometimes pierces through your body and just does so much damage to your internal organs and I remember he was brought in when I was there two days later and he was really sick I mean it was clear this guy had a lot of damage inside and we were waiting to see if we can take him to the operating room but the rooms were all full with other injured people and I remember as we're trying to sort of stabilize him and do things temporarily to keep him alive um I had one of his brothers who was helping deliver you know the breaths at the head of the bed and I remember another brother or a cousin I don't I don't even know but a family member I was making him hold a bag of blood uh up in the air so that it can drip into his veins and it's because we're so short staffed that his family I had to call on his family to help me and ultimately they were there as we watched him deteriorate slowly and die I mean he he ended up dying in front of us while his family is there trying to help him these are things that you know of course I'm never going to forget but the families that have had to deal with this if we get a ceasefire tomorrow I mean are they going to forget everything that's happened are they going to live normal lives having watched you know what's happened to them in the way that their lives have been attacked no I mean it's never going to be the same I was in that hospital I lived in Alexa Hospital literally was stationed there for an entire month uh I I never saw anything more than than Hospital healthcare workers trying their best to take care of patients and their families that lived in that place families took refuge in that place I saw I never saw a weapon on campus I never saw anything more than a healthcare team Tak care of people who were suffering and dying it seems uh that what I witnessed over and over again was the purposeful uh use of of weapons to to to to make uh misery as Broad and as vast of of a thing as possible in that place this whole narrative that the Israelis created to try to justify the targeting of the health system you know from the whole idea that that sh shifa has all of these underground bunkers and none of them were found these command and control centers all of this had it been true uh uh one we would have been you you as journalists would have been taken on tours underneath shiffer Hospital in these bunkers if you can make excuses for kids being killed if you can somehow come up with an excuse and be like well you know there were these people that were hiding in the area or you know it's the in 2006 the people of Gaza voted this way then there's one of two things I mean either you don't view them as human beings or you think that it's that you're going to somehow arrive at a solution by doing this and I think both are incredibly wrong you will never you know achieve any sort of solution just by know killing as many kids that have been killed or as many innocent people that have been killed and the second part of this is yes if you don't think that they are kids like your kids if you don't view a young a young girl like uh like somebody Who You're related to then you can easily come up with these excuses but that's what I would challenge people to I challenge them to just be able to look at Palestinians and see themselves in the Palestinians see your own family see your own life story and if you can do that I guarantee you'll come up with a different answer I think that the Palestinian perspective has not been given the enough opportunity to present itself in mainstream media in Western Med stream media there are uh in my my own opinions there are biased coverage of the situation of the situation in Gaza so I think when you don't give those people under uh attack uh their voice or they don't give them a platform to uh um to speak about their restorm to speak about their situation freely the only way it's possible to get here to get to the point where the world sits back the majority of the world sits back and um allows for just a systematic destruction of a place where there's there's people um who are unarmed 40% of the population under the age of 14 the vast majority of the people who died in my hands were were children the only way that's possible um is if we've inherited or bought it into a narrative where these people are less deserving of of of our care and US recognizing their humanity and uh unfortunately we've gotten to a state of affairs where um you know Palestinian or Gaz and blunt is not as valuable as somebody else's that the tears of uh a mother who Mourns her child and Gaza is not recognized as meaningful uh as somebody else um and and what I saw when I went there was the opposite of that I saw people more deserving than everybody else ever met in my life and I that sounds cliche and but I promise you I sat with people who tried to give me gifts when they had nothing and they tried to feed me when they didn't have food and they um you know they showed me a lot of love when when the world hasn't shown been love at the end of the day if you increase the supply of weapons 10 times since the 7th of October if you ensure that the genocide continues for 10 months if you uh continue to provide political support for the Israeli government in the genericide you are just as complicit the United Kingdom the United States Germany France all of these governments who are supporting and supplying Israel with the weapons that it needs and continue to do that to this day to this day the British the new British government refuses to impose an arms embargo neither does the German government neither does the French govern but the second thing is the political cover I mean that's something that as a physician um I didn't I don't have any experience in I don't know much about politics but what I saw in Gaza gave me a crash course a lesson into how horrible things can happen and it's when you have powers that should be able to step in intervene and stop that they're not doing it everybody the entire world not just the Western world but the the Arab world uh everybody Bears some responsibility of what's taking place here um we witnessed Horrors unfold in Gaza and you can use whatever term you want to use for It Whatever legal term you can fight me on that but the bottom line is the images and the footage that has emerged from Gaza and the eyewitness testimonies they speak for themselves and we've watched it happen it's continued and continued and continued and we have not stopped it I'm embarrassed to face or speak to my colleagues in Gaza to my Palestinian Brothers I don't know what to say to them I failed them on every single level of being able to deliver what I can deliver and I think the same can be said for all of these different politicians and policy makers across the board you totally failed them whether you care about that or not I think that speaks to who you are as a person but for me it's something obviously that kills me I really would like the world particular the Europe accept more patient from Gaza because they really need your help and we could still save their life but remaining here they may lose their life that's my plea to the people in the Europe but you know our whole my whole life um I have you know kind of had to confront you know sort of the dehumanization of Palestinians you know the fact that we're always kind of painted in this you know very singular one-dimensional approach you know very violent people uh you know terrorists I mean this is the things that we've had to confront and you know I think that that's beginning to change I think we're start people are starting to see um who we are the richness of the culture The Bravery of the people the um the family oriented Society you know just the remarkable nature of who Palestinians are because the people in Gaza are finally able to sort of communic amidst all of this tragedy they're able to you know share who they are and that's coming to light and it's [Applause] undeniable the fact that I think we're people see us now we're more visible I think that's promising you sort of see the beauty of who they are you see how resilient they are how incredible of a people they are uh I do think that's coming through and I think that's step one to getting us solution long term the health of the people can only be achieved once we make Society healthy and that's toally lucky how are we going to rebuild here there is no potential to rebuild when uh the sewer systems have been destroyed and the Water Systems have been destroyed and the hospital building infrastructure is all gone uh the money wouldn't fix that problem today which is kind of a crazy thing to say out loud the it's called going to require a tremendous amount of time just to clean two3 of the Heth facilities are destroyed they are not functional if you want to rehabilitate them you have to first clean them from weapon contamination after an earthquake you can just start digging and and and you you build and you you take off the the rub rubbles and but here if you would start like this you have a high risk that it will come to further explosions there's a saying in Gaza now that I think people who have been there realized but it's like you know the lucky ones are the ones that have been killed so you know like uh it's um it's easier for the one that dies those are the ones who are lucky and it's the rest of us that are kind of living in this misery and that are living uh kind of in this in these in these horrific conditions and you understand what they're talking about the only thing that prevents us from uh rebuilding and having a bit a brighter future is the political determination or will of the government uh of the Israeli government to be honest with you a complete ceasefire and the opening of the real opening of humanitarian corridors to allow the Reconstruction and the rebuilding of the health system of the water sewage to allow food to come in so they used to always say there's a war after the war and what they're referring to is just like having to pick up the pieces having to process everything that they've lost and having to start life over again but it also told me that they were ready to I mean the the Palestinians are still looking towards tomorrow I mean there's still kind of like that that process like hey this will be over and then we're going to have to you know we'll start again
