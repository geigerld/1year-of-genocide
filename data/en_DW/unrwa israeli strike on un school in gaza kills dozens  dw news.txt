media controlled by Hamas citing medical officials say at least 27 people have been killed and dozens more wounded in an Israeli strike in the central Gaza Strip there has been no confirmation yet from gaza's Health Ministry the attack hit a United Nations School in the city of nerat the Israeli Army says it conducted a strike on a Hamas compound inside the school as it expands operations in the central part of the strip for more of this I'm now joined by DW's Rebecca rits in Jerusalem Rebecca what's the latest on this strike well uh the the news the information is slowly emerging Gad reports uh overnight in the early hours of the morning started appearing of about this strike saying from quoting as you say Hamas uh media officials saying that 27 people had been killed in a strike at this unra school uh We've also heard from Health officials at the alaxa hospital saying that 30 bodies including five children were brought to the hospital and many more are wounded so that death toll May well rise I've also seen a figure of 32 but it's of course impossible to verify any of these figures at the moment um shortly after that news came out Israel did then confirm a a strike at the school they said they'd been targeting quote Hamas terrorists who were uh operating from within that School Compound those So-Cal terrorists um were take to took part in the October 7 attacks is what the military was saying and that they were planning uh to carry out further attacks on IDF soldiers in the immediate future uh the IDF also said that a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of uh harming uninvolved civilians now this strike follows an announcement earlier yesterday from the Israeli military saying that they were beginning a wider operation in this central part of the Gaza Strip we know that since completing uh their operations there earlier in the year they have now be restarted some targeted operations in the center of the strip and also in the north of the Gaza Strip but they're certainly widening that operation uh in this central part where noat is located and where this strike took place overnight now what are the prospects of of continuing ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel well uh the talks certainly all the hope that was surrounding the potential breakthrough that was announced last week by uh President Biden or certainly as he was dubbing at the Israel uh the Israel part of this these peace talks or these ceasefire talks uh look to be stalled once again we've heard from the Hamas leader Ismael hania yesterday uh saying that no talks would be even entered into they would not consider a ceasefire deal that did not lead to a permanent ceasefire we've heard time and time again from the Israeli government from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself that they would not go into any ceasefire plan that led to permanent ceasefire without completing their military mission of uh completely eliminating Hamas so we once again fa El face this sort of stalemate that we keep seeing that there is a gap that cannot be bridged between the two sides and it really really all surrounds over this concept of the permanent ceasefire so certainly looking not very positive that at the moment talks were continuing yesterday CIA Chief Bill Burns was also in Qatar to continue these talks there were mediators the usual mediators there from Qatar Egypt and the us to try to further these talks but at the moment they are at a standstill once again DWS Rebecca it is there reporting from Jerusalem thank you Rebecca
