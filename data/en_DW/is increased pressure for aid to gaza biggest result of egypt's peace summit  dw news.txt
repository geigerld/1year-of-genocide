now as we heard earlier from our correspondent an International Peace Summit in the Egyptian Capital Cairo has ended without a breakthrough Regional and Western leaders have been trying to deescalate the conflict in Gaza and ensure that Aid continues to reach civilians there Arab Nations say it is now time to end the cycle of violence between Israel and the Palestinians Germany's foreign minister analena barok in Cairo for the so-called Summit for peace the summit's host Egyptian president Abdel El Sissi emphasized protecting civilians but Germany and other European countries expressed their support for Israel Israel has a right to defend itself and to protect its people against this Terror within the framework of international law committing but some Arab countries say that Israel's air strikes on Gaza go too far they say Israel is the one breaking international law and committing war crimes Palestinians lives matter less than Israeli ones Our Lives matter less one major theme was the Rafa border crossing between Egypt and Gaza 20 a trucks passed through on Saturday a glimmer of hope but a drop in the bucket for a population of 2 million people many countries demanded a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in the end the participants failed to reach a comprehensive agreement get more from DW's Middle East analyst shie rosanes sh the Cairo Summit was focused on finding ways to deescalate this conflict have they had any success in that regard well for most of Leaders The Very fact that they were part of this front this very big front of Western and Arab countries that for itself the statement behind that the act of solidarity with the Palestinians behind it was a a big start um nobody had HED I mean it was a bit uh too optimistic to think all of these players even within the Arab world there's so much um uh inner strife and and disagreements on the Palestinian issue and the Iran issue and the Hamas issue the idea that they will all manage to get one resolution at the end is I think at this time of age a bit too optimistic unfortunately uh the key issue was taking care of the humanitarian aid for the Palestinians we've seen more Western uh pledges to help um which was important it was also a symbolic step for the Arab country to see the the need um for the the the Western World to show their support to the Palestinian step up not just to Israel and its needs but also to the suffering of the Palestinians and in that aspect it's a relative success for AI uh this was his modest goal and I think he achieved it yes we heard them talking about pushing back against what they call a global silence on the suffering of the Palestinians um you mentioned humanitarian Aid was a big topic can you tell us a little bit about what specifically came out of that meeting well Israel is uh you know the the main crossing point now available is is the Egyptian one um Israel is very strict in what it will allow or will not allow the the biggest cont most contested uh uh article now on the table is fuel and gas I mean of course it is needed in order to feed the generators and the water pumps and so on into Gaza but um unra itself has already said this week that there have been a case of of of Hamas probably Hamas militants taking over some of their fuel reserves and Israel is very much concerned with how do we bring this fuel in without letting it fall into the wrong hands without letting the militants get even more of an advantage um and so this will be for now they're being very strong uh and they're insistent not to let it in but I'm not sure how long they can you know stand off uh this pressure yeah I'd like to ask you a little bit more about the geopolitics and potential um dealmakers what about Qatar as a possible mediator here we know that they were uh involved in brokering that deal to free the two American uh women hostages over correct we've seen it over the weekend Qatar is actually in an unbelievable position it manages to be simultaneously an ally to um Hamas and Iran um and at the same time also to the US the biggest American uh uh base in the Middle East is located in Qatar which also gives them a lot of Leverage and connections with the Americans um so they managed you know they the Qatar and the Saudis were their neighboring big uh you know uh influential uh country have a very contested relationship with very complex history connected also to uh the qatar's uh connections with Iran which is Saudi Arabia's Arch Enemy so interestingly enough this very small Kingdom manages to be now a a king maker a a power player and hopefully maybe the only force in the region to help in bringing out some of the hostages uh that are kept in Gaza uh tell me more about uh the situation of those hostages I understand we've been talking about a looming ground offensive potentially from Israeli forces and I know there is criticism from some families within Israel about um a ground offensive that could also jeopardize hostages there what is that debate looking like at the moment a lot of painful dilemmas for Israelis um on the one hand exactly there's the pressure from the families of the hostages and we also hear from qataris there's an interview today for uh the German publication velt where we a top Aid of the foreign U minister of Qatar saying he believes they are close to being able to bring some hostages out so there's always these hopes there's always this trickle of rumors which plays in a psychological warfare very crucial role and perhaps uh Israeli um defense uh uh officials are concerned maybe this is an attempt for Hamas to push away U Israeli uh Invasion or Israeli ground operation um so far it seems to be working Israel is very careful um we've I think everybody expected Israeli to be far more aggressive in its uh inclusion into Gaza so far it's been a bit more cautious probably because of that still the next days are crucial in bringing solution to the hostages situation shaie thank you so much for that analysis that is DW's Middle East analyst shaie
