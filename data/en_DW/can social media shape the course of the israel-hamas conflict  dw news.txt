another front in the fast evolving conflict between Israel and Hamas is the one found online thisinformation is running rampant across social media where Millions turned to get realtime updates I met the very real imagery are floods of fabricated videos and photos spread by both fake and real accounts the companies behind giants like Facebook X and Tik Tok say they've taken additional steps to tackle disinformation around the violence but the EU has reprimanded social media compan for not doing enough and about all that we can now speak to Caitlyn chin Rothman she's with the center for strategic and international studies where she researches the impact of technology on geopolitics and Society Caitlyn good to see you lots of people these days getting their information on social media with tensions running so high are these platforms equipped to Bear the responsibility that entails thanks Nicole first of all no I don't think that platforms are equipped to Bear the responsibility of content moderation and there's a reason why the EU has already reached out to X meta and Tik Tok about all of the disinformation and harmful content that flowed online over the past two weeks um we're seeing that platforms don't have the resources to detect very large amounts of content especially in non-language English languages I will say that platforms are in a very difficult position partly due to the very very large volume of information that's flowing but also due to the fact that platforms are making realtime decisions in very short periods of time they don't always operate with all of the information so it's not always possible for them to verify the claims that are flowing um so there are both technical but also normative challenges that social social media platforms are facing right now and how are both sides in this conflict using social media to shape views of the war we've seen um both Hamas and the Israeli government use post on social media quite often Hamas has been posting on a platform called telegram Which is less popular in the United States and the EU but more popular in other parts of the world like Russia and Ukraine um telegram has very loose content moderation policies which has allowed Hamas to post very graphic or violent images from its initial attack on October 7th um Israel as well has been quite active on social media it's been posting on X formerly known as Twitter Instagram and other platforms it's posted photos of Israeli families and individuals who were impacted by the attack Israel has also posted a pretty high-profile audio clip of what it claims to be Hamas operatives discussing the bombing of the hospital so both sides have been very active in using social media and trying to shape a narrative spread a message and I would also just add that both both sides are trying to reach the the International Community so Their audience isn't just Israel it's not just Palestine it's the entire world I want to look a little closer at telegram uh that you just mentioned because it's used by Hamas not only to spread propaganda but also to recruit new members now this is an internationally recognized Terror organization uh by much of the West at least can the platform be held accountable for that so it's very difficult in in the United States at least we have very loose content moderation laws so platforms are generally not held accountable for third party content that users upload now that is different in other countries especially the EU which recently passed the Digital Services act um and the online service Online safety bill in the United Kingdom is about to come into effect um now telegram has not seen as much regulatory attention from the EU or the UK I think partly because it's just not as popular popular in e in either jurisdiction but I think going forward I I would expect governments to become more interested in how telegram operates especially if we continue to see Violent extremist content emerge on these Platforms in real-time war situations Caitlyn you study the impact of technology on geopolitics how could social media and the content posted on it potentially shape the course of this War I think it affects everything I mean users people all around the world millions of people are going to social media to find out information about wars to respond and react in real time which means that the content moderation decisions that these platforms make are very powerful they affect how so many people view conflicts so I I I definitely think that um social media also affects how actors act for example extremist actors are finding that they can gain a lot of attention get a lot of Engagement from posting very violent or graphic content and when they get those reactions it's like instant gratification right um it reinforces polarizing views so I think we're seeing social media change both how people View and access information but we're also seeing social media change how the extremist actors themselves are playing out the conflict that's tremendously interesting stuff cait Linton Rothman with the center for strategic and International studies thanks for that thanks Nicole for having
