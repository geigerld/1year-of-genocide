journalist kareim elari joins me now from Ciro welcome back to DW kareim what are your contacts telling you about the situation in Rafa well I looked and listened the whole day to interviews a local cameraman made for us in and around the Rafa situation is really desperate of people uh running away from there first many of them were displaced for some of them more than a dozen times people ran out of money people have no idea where to go and then when they arrive at different locations they see these locations are not fit to receive so many people there is no proper infrastructure and then I mean just imagine the hold and caught Showers of the last 24 hours first as you saw leaflets which told them to leave because their home will become a combat zone then uh celebrations on the street because they s the war is over and then again military operations by Israel and now again uh negotiations in Cairo I think people uh quite confused about what to think about the situation right now understandably so the Egyptian foreign Ministry warrn today that Israel's operation in Rafa risks undermining the ceasefire efforts that you just talked about where do these truce talks in KIRO stand and what are the calculations on both sides here well it seems to move because there is a second Hamas delegation that arrived now in Cairo and that we hear so little about is may be a sign that they really seriously talk about it of course one of the main sticking points is hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire and Hamas has I think more than one calculation for this Demand on one hand of course they know Netanyahu the prime minister of Israel said that the goal or the object objective of the war of the war is to destroy Hamas so for them uh when they still exist after the war in some kind of form militarily or politically that means he will have not achieved his goals so their survival after the war is one of their priorities but there also there's a second priority people in Gaza and that means no matter if supporters of Hamas or opponents of Hamas they don't want a ceasefire for a few weeks and then hostages are exchanged with Palestinian prisoners they want an end of the war they want to that the Israeli Army withdraws from the Gaza Strip they want to return to their homes and they want to start their lives so any other result in the negotiations will be seen by them as a disappointment that it's something that Hamas of course has to put into consideration it's still Out Of Reach though that ceasefire now that the Rafa and Kem shalam Crossings are closed a relief agencies are warning that humanitarian aid for Gaza is being choked off and I'm quoting them here what does that mean in Practical terms why that this is another disaster in an already disastrous situation we know of course that there was no sufficient Aid coming into the Gaza Strip now the two important border crossings are closed and uh there's also this is one of the reasons why people there on in around Rafa are panicked prices for commercial goods are already doubling so that's really one of the things they extremely worried about that they already Spar Supply is going to become even less known that was journalist Kareem El gawari in many thanks it's always great to get your insights you're welcome to keep talking about the ceasefire negotiations and the Rafa offensive and bring in Laura Blumenfeld she's a Middle East analyst and a New York Times bestselling author joins us from Washington DC welcome good to have you on DW as well now Laura the ball is in Israel's Court now they openly rejected the ceasefire proposal but still sent a delegation to Cairo what do you expect to come out of these negotiations well look senoir and Netanyahu are hardliners right they're the anti-c compromised candidates representing both of their people but I think they understand that most Wars come to a messy end um I see three options maybe to get to that ceasefire it's kind of been a ceasefire fever and we're hoping it'll break for the good um one of the biggest obstacles is trust so if we can have someone sort of stand in um and you know stand for the various parties Israelis do not trust the homas leadership they were thinking that they were in a kind of deterrence relationship with them before October 7th and then they were sucker punched on that day and they won't be Fooled Again is their attitude um and the Palestinians don't trust the Israelis but specifically Netanyahu and they're asking for guarantees that the Israelis will keep their side of the bargain either from the United States or they're not quite sure they're going to rely on the United States at this point so they're looking to Turkey and to Russia um the second possibility is rather than um as your as your previous uh correspondent noted that there's this sticking point over the end game um right now we're involved in a blame game but if we can get past that and talk about okay so is it a permanent ceasefire or is it a temporary calm if rather than making it time based and setting a date you make it conditions based so that you have to meet certain markers um for end of hostilities that could be another way forward and finally you know we've been focusing a lot on incentives for Success um maybe we need to talk about the cost of failure um a failure to achieve a ceasefire with a little bit more leaning heavily into the negatives that could potentially be Doha threatening to expel the Hamas leadership um from Qatar and then on the United States side look tomorrow um in terms of leaning on Israel secretary blinkin has to present a report to Congress answering a very simple question which is is Israel violating International AAL humanitarian law in its Onslaught in Gaza but Israel has been very clear from the beginning that they want to continue their military operation until Hamas is dismantled do you think that there is a scenario in which a political solution really puts an end to this war you know I think right now um what what Benjamin Netanyahu has always argued in terms of politics and diplomacy is peace through strength let's get the military Victory and then we can move on to the Diplomatic I think that's part of the problem why it's falling on deaf ears when you hear you know various voices of Reason saying bring us some calm and then we can look toward the Horizon toward a two-state solution and remember that normalization deal with Saudi Arabia that we were working on before October 7th that's a big prize for Netanyahu well the normalization deal isn't isn't sort of jibing with him because what he's saying is we aren't normal Israel is not the normal Israel until we can achieve that Sheen of deterrence that we had before October 7th mhm but there is a lot of pressure of course on Netanyahu because there are still so many hostages in the hands of Hamas and Hamas said that any military operation um or further offensive on Rafa would jeopardize hostage talks do you think there's a risk that or that this is a risk that Israelis are willing to take in order to achieve their military objective of dismantling Hamas and when thing that Netanyahu is doing which he's famous for is strategic dithering and sometimes we wonder if even he knows what he's going to do next and part of the problem is the Israeli government is very divided um so is the Palestinian leadership by the way I mean there's a tremendous leadership vacuum and that's why you see President Biden stepping in very forcefully um to fill that Gap um Netanyahu would argue that you know countries don't make treaties with the weak and when he said that he came out with a public statement he's actually signaling to Saudi Arabia although the United States has said you have to choose between this operation and Rafa a major operation and peace with Riad he would say quite the opposite the road to R the road to Saudi Arabia's respect is through Rafa because we speak Middle East and Middle East means might makes right so does that mean that all the pressure coming from from its allies as well from the US from France doesn't make any difference to Israel at this point well he has said quite explicitly actually on Holocaust Memorial Day if we have to we will stand alone and he was referencing World War II when he said you know there are times when great Powers stood idly by and I think that was a little bit of a rib a little bit of a jab to the United States for not standing by or helping the UK as much as they could have perhaps during the blitz I mean this is all I'm interpreting his words um you know it's a kind of With Or Without You moment for him and yes it's to save his own political future um but I do think that he really believes that if he can get back you know he's almost like a man trying to slow walk up a down escalator if he can make it to the top that will justify it all and he keeps saying a little more time I think the way that he could potentially thread the needle and we could get to a better places if it's a pinpoint minor and strategic some kind of incursion into Rafa where there aren't Mass civilian casualties the president of the United States will not tolerate that he's made that very clear then we could perhaps get to a better day by taking the Border sealing off the border with of Rafa to Egypt yes he's what what he's saying publicly nanahu is we we want to stop the smuggling of guns and weapons into Gaza but what I would also suspect is for this final showdown with sinir he's also trying to prevent the Hamas leadership from escaping that was Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld thank you so much for those insights great speaking to you thank you
