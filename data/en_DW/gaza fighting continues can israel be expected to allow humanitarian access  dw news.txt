the Israeli military says it has killed caught numerous Palestinian militants in Fierce fighting in the southern Gaza City of konas the anabat hostilities came a day after the international court of justice in the ha ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocide in the Gaza Strip now according to the World Health Organization hospitals there are running out of f fuel food and supplies Israel says it's fighting to destroy Hamas which several States consider a terrorist organization a hospital on the brink of collapse overcrowded with injured patients the situation in Han Yunis is growing increasingly desperate the trauma W is packed wounded people here are being treated on a florish splash with blood most injured people coming to the hospital are from schools and residential areas we're not trying to treat them anymore we're just trying to keep them alive Israeli forces have advanced deeper into hunis in recent days gazan Health officials say dozens of people have been killed in the fighting which has come very close to the hospital there's no milk formula no doctors to treat the patients no food or medication for children many here had hoped for things to take a different turn on Friday when the United Nations Top Court ruled on a case against Israel's offensive in Gaza a majority of the judges called on Israel to protect civilians and allow the entry of desperately needed humanitarian Aid into the strip is the case the court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering but the judges stopped short of ordering the Urgent request of South Africa which had brought the case against Israel an immediate ceasefire a ruling on South Africa's allegation that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza will likely Take Years Palestinians broadly welcomed Friday's ruling but it offered no respite for the people of Gaza Jonathan tricks is chief of communication and advoc advocacy for Unicef in the Palestinian territories he joins us from Rafa in southern Gaza thank you for being with us Mr cricks we know that more than half of gaza's population is in Rafa right now what are the conditions you're seeing there well the the conditions are absolutely devastating so wherever you look you see thousands and thousands of makeshift tents and uh with many many children living in them they don't have access to enough water they don't have food people are getting very hungry and and and desperate they don't have even hygiene and sanitation there is sometimes only one toilet for 500 or 700 people sometimes and so this is for us a very big concern because the the the mix between the lack of water and the poor uh uh sanitary condition I conditions are are really a terrible recipe for the spread of illnesses like chronic diarrhea for example so so the situation here is very dramatic and what I have seen and what I have heard in terms of stories is stories of sorrow and and loss we can see even now you're speaking to us from a darkened room I imagine that is an impact of the electricity supplies being cut as well now we know that the icj has urged organizations like yours to be allowed humanitarian access to Gaza do you expect this to help with your work well it is absolutely needed that the humanitarian Aid is reaching the children and the most vulnerable people wherever they are but we are facing issues our Aid is coming in and I attended several uh food distribution we we went to a small community where we also distributed winter clothes and cover because as I speak to you it's 10 degrees out and the children that I have met they have literally nothing to to you know to keep them warm so it is absolutely crucial to have that Aid being delivered but many challenges are you know on our way one is the security with the intensity of of the bombing it's extremely difficult to reach the north of the Gast STP for example we have issues when it comes to communication limited cell n Network we cannot coordinate easily with our partners and then there is not enough trucks and fuel to run those trucks to to to reach the people in need so the the the aid is being delivered but we have to understand that when we have 1.3 million people here in Rafa in so such a small stretch of land they cannot leave on humanitarian Aid alone and what what is needed is more commercial trucks for example to to come in with fruits and vegetables because the the the prices of food has skyrocketed four or five times the the the prices pre crisis before this war so if if that doesn't happen we are very very worried that severe cases of malnutrition will take place and children might starve Jonathan cricks with the UNICEF reporting talking to us from Rafa in southern Gaza thank you so much thank you very much now States including the US UK and Canada have halted funding for the UN Agency for Palestine refugees that's after it emerged that some of the agency staffers were involved in the October 7th Terror attacks by Hamas on Israel that's an allegation by Israel now the agency unra said it had fired the workers under suspicion and that an investigation was underway the US was through Lea organization's biggest Financial backup the agency has previously said its ability to deliver Aid to Gaza is on the verge of collapse more I'm joined Now by Shaya Lo she's a Communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council and joins us from Jerusalem now sha good to see you again what impact do you believe this ruling will have on the work of humanitarian organizations such as your own well part of the ruling called for Israel to enable the provision of of assistance needed to meet the basic needs for survival of the Palestinian population under its control we are hopeful that that Israel and and countries putting pressure on Israel will will allow for the provision of additional Aid to enter Israel to excuse me to enter Gaza because at this point the amount of Aid that is entering is wholly insufficient to meet the tremendous needs that we've seen over the last 16 weeks of of hostilities uh the situation continues to grow more desperate and dire by the day Palestinians north of Rafa in Kan Yunis in the middle area in Gaza City and in Northern Gaza are struggling to find basic necessities people are are uh are resorting to eating animal fodder in order to stay alive in some of these places uh we are in addition to this we still need to continue pushing for a permanent sustained ceasefire this is the only way to put an end to the death Devastation the killing the destruction in Gaza and to allow the 2.3 million Palestinian civilians living there the chance to rebuild their lives and start to recover I want to bring up something else because several countries have suspended their donations to the un's agency for Palestinian refugees allegations that unra employees were involved in the October 7th terror attack now unra is gaza's largest Aid agency how is this Scandal and its Fallout which we're just now beginning to see likely to affect gazin who depend on Aid to survive my understanding is that as soon as unwa heard of the allegations against its employees it immediately fired those employees that's been reported in the press the situation in Gaza is so dire Palestinians need access to Aid however it can come Ona as of now has been providing about 80% of the aid and assistance to Palestinians the the vast majority of those internally displaced are seeking shelter at unaa facilities to cut off Aid means to to or to cut off funding to unaa would mean to prevent aid from reaching those people so desperately in need sha low Communications adviser for the humanitarian organization Norwegian Refugee Council always great to get your view of things thank you so much for your time thank you and we can get some analysis now from Sharon W she's a professor of international law at the American University of Paris where she directs the Justice lab good to have you on DW now opinions are divided on this ruling what do you make of the icj's orders uh yes so first of all I think it's a very important case because it's the first time that Israel is on trial on an international forum and uh the international court of justice is a very respected court so uh of course of course it's not Amnesty International you know it's not an NGO it's a very serious very conservative court so when the court is saying something uh it means that it's not a political statement it is a legal statement and I think what the court is saying here is very strong so it's true it did not order to stop the military operation but uh this was not expected that he will say that he will uh uh say this what the court is saying is that it is possible it is possible uh that we have uh a commission of genocide is not deciding on this but he is requesting from Israel uh to prevent any act that could uh uh amount to breaching its obligation with the Geneva Convention and it is request to allow humanitarian assistant uh as well um as well any prevention of this kind of act and I wanted just to add about this that uh the value is huge because we have the US judge the German judge all the judges uh were uh in the opinion of this uh and even the ad hoc Israeli judge judge Barack uh was supporting two of this provisional measure so I think it is a very strong judicial decision the United Nations let's talk about the icj's um kind of power in this because the court says it trusts Israel will comply with the orders but it lacks the power to actually enforce them doesn't it yeah okay so you know about power is always the question what do we expect from a court to do right uh I mean especially when we think about the international legal orders so of course the court is not the police it's not a political actor it is a court and we know well that in the international legal order international law and politic are very much inter uh very much interconnected uh but this means now that political forces could put pressure on Israel and we already have seen the European Union stating declaring immediately after that Israel has to comply uh with this and even within Israel uh the voices are very taking very seriously this because Israel is committing to the genocide convention because of its own historical background right they were victim to the genocide convention uh so of course uh um now it is up the politics but we have a legal decision saying what it says which is very strong that was Sharon wild professor of international law thank you so much for your
