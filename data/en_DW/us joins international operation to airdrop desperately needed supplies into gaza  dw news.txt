the US has joined an international operation to airdrop desperately needed supplies into Gaza the Pentagon says three Air Force planes carried out the first drop of more than 35,000 meals the Biden Administration says Israel supports its intervention to bolster existing efforts by Jordan and other nations the UN is warning that famine in Gaza is almost inevitable unless Aid deliveries increase significantly our next report contains images that some viewers might find distressing consoling each other the boys have survived an Israeli air strike in central Gaza many others did not but the fighting in the Gaza Strip is in the only danger Palestinians face disease and famine have become a major threat children are most at risk St starvation has now taken the lives of several children so the official records yesterday or this morning said there was a 10th child officially registered in a hospital as having starved to death um a very sad threshold similar sad as the 30,000 deaths we reached all over Gaza the The Unofficial numbers can unfortunately be expected to be higher and the toll is climbing k Al jazer broadcast this footage from Gaza City on Friday when scores of Palestinians were killed as they surrounded an eight conoy the Hamas run Health Ministry and survivors accused the Israeli Army of opening fire on the crowd Israel said limited shots were fired near the eight Convoy but insisted that most of the Dead were trampled or run over by the eight trucks a un team has visited alaa Hospital on Friday it reported having seen a large number of gunshot victims the incident has Amplified the demand for more eight to be delivered without delay neighboring Egypt and Jordan recently air dropped essential items in Gaza now the US says it will deliver humanarian Aid VI parachute while President Joe Biden pushes Israel to improve other roots we're going to insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and more routes to get more and more people the the help they need no excuses because the truth is Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now it's nowhere nearly enough innocent lives are on the line and children's lives are on the line and we won't stand by and let until they until we get more Aid in there reason Biden has also signal a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel could be reached soon which many here hope would be a Lifeline amid destruction and loss let's bring in Mike Martin he's a war studies senior fellow at Kings College London and also a former British army officer welcome to DW so as we just heard President Biden hello says that the US military is going to airdrop supplies into Gaza similar to How uh Jordan France and other countries have done can you explain to us how exactly something like this would work will there be coordination with the Israeli military do they do it independently what's involved uh so it is as you would imagine you know you fly a plane uh and then you push supplies out the back but what you need is an area on the ground that has been at least cleared or secured so I'd imagine the us is going to be trying to push the aid out near the coast so it can fly in over the sea and so that it's not flying over Gaza which is obviously a war zone um but then you need a partner on the ground either the israelies or perhaps one of the aid agencies who have uh in some way designated an area that this Aid can land in it's it's actually very very difficult to do when it's not your own people on the ground a securing The Landing zone for your planes so you mentioned some of the challenges that this of course is still an active war zone and you need people on the ground so is this even going to help if there isn't some sort of security on the ground in Gaza as these eight packages are pushed out of the plane as you described well I think actually you you've hit the nail on the head is this going to be effective a plane so a Hercules plane which is one of the two options that the US military has can carry about 20 tons worth of supplies a shipping container that goes on the back of a truck is 30 tons so if you've got you know a 10 truck Convoy or a 20 truck Convoy that's 300 tons or 600 tons so you know an order of magnitude bigger so really what I think we need to ask ourselves is is this just for show you can only drop food medicines are quite difficult because they get broken uh water you can't drop and as we've discussed the amounts that you can actually deliver are very difficult and we've already spoken about the deconfliction problems so I think that you know if we're cynical we could argue that this is of of a small impact on the overall scale of the problem and really I know the US is not getting much joy from the Israelis but really that is the route to opening up the humanitarian problem is for the Israelis to allow more trucks into Gaza that was Mike Martin with the Kings College London many thanks indeed for your insights thank
