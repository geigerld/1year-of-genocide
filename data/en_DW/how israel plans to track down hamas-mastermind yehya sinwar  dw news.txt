the Israeli Army says its goal is the destruction of Hamas but more specifically it's hunting the leaders of the militant organization Khan yunes is the home of hamas's Gaza Chief Yaya Sinar and although he has not been seen publicly since the beginning of the war Israel believes he is hiding somewhere in the city the house of sin is in the area of hunis you have terror infrastructure and command centers there sinir is not above ground he's underground I don't want to elaborate where and how and what we know in terms of intelligence this is not the place to talk about such things in the media our job is to find Sina and kill him all right let's get more on this I'm joined by Hans yakob Shindler senior director of the counter extremism project Mr Shindler Israel wants to find and kill Yaya Sinar can it of course uh this is extraordinary difficult uh Endeavor uh because there is this still functioning underground system in particularly in the southern half of Gaza but Sinar really is the key leader to get here he was from the very beginning part of setting up the terrorist structure of Hamas from 19988 1988 onwards he was also the founder of the Gaza Hamas intelligence organization that hunts what they call collaborators those who um cooperate with Israel and executes them so it's really an important Target to take out Yaya Sinar is also said to have masterminded the October 7 terror attack in Israel can you tell us a bit more about what we do know about him well he was born in kanun in 1962 um he joined Hamas from the very beginning as I said he was the one who set up the terrorist infrastructure he's a hardliner if you can say that within a terrorist organization um who always um argued for taking hostages to exchange for Palestinian prisoners he's the one who really strongly argued when he came up to the leadership in 2017 uh for a stronger relationship with Iran and to really build hamas's ability not only to conduct smaller scale Terror attacks in Israel but what we have seen in October 7 so he really is the brains behind of all of this and in his 20 two years that he spent in Israeli prisons before he was exchanged in 2011 as part of the gilad Shalit deal he also seem to have learned Hebrew and he um according to many of the hostages that actually talked to him in their cap captivity as speaks fluent Hebrew and Israel wants to find and kill this man you called it an extraordinarily difficult uh uh operation we're talking about aan Unice which is a stronghold of Hamas surely Hamas m is ready and waiting uh for Israeli troops and Israeli operations How likely is it I ask you again that Israel will even be able to catch him well it's not 100% guarantee because there's of course also tunnels that stretch into the Sinai which means there is a possibility for individuals to leave clandestinely Gaza however if uh Israel is going to do in the South what they've done in the north I.E create a cordon of milit control around the borders of Gaza um then escaping through those tunnels is going to be uh very difficult for Mr sinir he will definitely try his uh survival is key for Hamas so they will do whatever they can to prevent the Israelis from killing or capturing him so if his survival is key for Hamas if Israel were to find and kill sinir would that spell the end of Hamas in Gaza it wouldn't spend the end of end of Hamas but to replace a leader that has been you know key to the terrorist operations from the onset of the establishment of the group is going to be very difficult and it is going to take a long time to get someone again with this kind of experience on how to do terrorism back not only in the organization but also back into Gaza so taking him out is really a valuable Target here you know but uh this uh this argument about replacing an experienced leader this has been made in the past decades ever since the late is when Hamas was set up yet Hamas continues and now it is de facto in government in the Gaza Strip surely Hamas has other leaders that are waiting absolutely so here is the the key difference so Hamas has an ongoing concern and Hamas as a major threat to Israel so what the military operations can definitely achieve is to set back hamas's ability from the Gaza Strip to threaten Israel in any way shape or form on the size that it did in October 7th however eradicating Hamas as an ongoing terrorist group and concern will take a much longer task of course as Al-Qaeda as the Islamic State have done once they were military defeated in Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria is they simply devolved into a networked organization with smaller scale Terror attacks um this is all of course then a very long-term Endeavor and will require more than just military operations AAL coroporation but also social economic development in the Palestinian territories do you want to Hazard a guess as to how long it will take and the reason I asked this is because the head of Israel's domestic intelligence agency wants to eliminate Hamas entirely including in the region what is the time frame we are looking at and is that even possible well I mean there's a military timeline and then there's a political timeline for Israel right now and it seems very clear that um Israel has a couple of weeks maybe a month or two left uh for its military operations in Gaza before International pressure comes becomes too heavy for it to continue any major military operations that doesn't mean that everything is going to stop but not on the scale that we see in right now so this is the timeline that Israel has to destroy as much as possible the tunnel system find weapon stumps destroy the rocket launching facilities and then starts the really long-term work on eradicating hamas's ideology and for that Israel cannot do this alone it needs International cooperation we'll leave it there for the time being thanks so much for joining us today Hans yob Shindler senior director of the counter extremism project thank you sir thank you m and here's a quick look now at some other stories from around the world reuter's investigation into the death of one of its journalists in Lebanon on the 13th of October has concluded that he was killed by an Israeli tank shell six other the reporters were wounded in the incident a kilometer from the Israeli border Reuters
