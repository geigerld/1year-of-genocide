Israeli authorities say at least three people have been killed and several more wounded after gunmen opened fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem police say the attackers arrived in a car and started firing on people waiting for buses this footage of the attack was posted on social media by the Israeli foreign Ministry two Palestinian suspects were killed on the scene by Security Forces news of the attack came shortly after a truce between Israel and Hamas militants was extended into a seventh day the truth the truth was brought first break in the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza strips since the Hamas Terror attacks on Israel on October 7th let's bring in DW correspondent Ben fulan in Jerusalem Ben what more can you tell us about the shooting attack police say they neutralized in their words the two attackers bringing the total number of deaths to five several injured as you mentioned uh one killed at the scene two on their way uh dying on their way to hospital uh this all comes at a time of heightened tension here in Jerusalem and in occupied East Jerusalem as well as the occupied West Bank there have been raids by police uh almost every day since the beginning of this war and especially uh with the background of these Palestinian prisoners being released uh there are claims that police have been raiding their homes uh surrounding some of the hospitals preventing ambulances from uh arriving at those hospitals to bring in the injured and uh clashes both between um militants and Israeli forces also uh a huge anti-terror operation is what Israel is calling it in Janine uh the considered the stronghold of Palestinian militants where two young boys died yesterday Ben US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is back in Israel what does he want to achieve this time he's trying to get that truce extended uh a longer ceasefire or permanent ceasefire is not on the US's agenda nor is it on Israel's agenda but uh blink did uh just say uh recently that um after these talks that progress is being made that's the main thing that these hostages are being released that it all is going ahead uh as planned even though it's all so last minute it shows just how fragile this ceasefire is they were expecting it to be extended by 4 days only by another 24 hours so it's being taken day by day uh these hostage hostage release lists also being released and uh these lists of Palestinian prisoners yeah Israel says it has received a list of hostages who could be released today Ben what more do you know uh this is a really tricky one Anthony because we've just had news on hamas's news channels that three of the hostages their bodies will be handed over as part of that list today we can't confirm those reports uh but it does line up with what Hamas was saying yesterday that the youngest member of the entire hostage group a 10-month old baby uh is dead according to them along with his four-year-old brother and mother uh they claim this occurred during Israeli air strikes prior to the truce um whether or not this is true uh there are so many doubts over this because Hamas has claimed this before an elderly woman who they declared dead was released among some of the first of the hostages to be released alive and uh they they've claimed that some 60 of the hostages in all have died during what they call hisra the air strike so uh lots of doubts uh whether or not there will be an extension today which hostages will be Rel uh released and whether or not they will be dead or alive Anthony DWS Ben fulan in Jerusalem thank you I can now speak to a ad she's the granddaughter of 85-year-old yafa adah one of the first Israeli hostages free by Hamas welcome to DW adva after weeks of what must have been horrendous uncertainty how does it feel to be reunited with your grandmother wow H it's like a dream coming true we were waiting about these days for 59 days and uh being able to see her and hug her and smell her H it means the word to us and uh and uh at the same time it breaks our heart to think about all the others that are still being held hostage and among them also my cousin Tamir he a 38 years old father of two young children and is still in Gaza yeah those contrasting emotions obviously as you're waiting for news of your cousin um almost a week now after the release of your grandmother though how is your grandmother doing at this point uh she's very strong and inspiring and she's a she's starting to understand what happened to her what happened to this country and she's trying to recover and uh we're trying to do whatever it takes in order to help her uh recover from this Hell she's being through what has she told you uh about where she was and how she was treated as a hostage of heras I can share the information I can only tell you that the conditions were nothing like an 85 years old woman needs the the basic needs of an 85 years old woman are definitely weren't what she she's been through so um but I I can't share specific information absolutely I can't I can understand what you can and can't share with the outside world one thing the outside world did see was when she was abducted a video of her arrival in Gaza that went viral your grandmother yafa Adar was being driven around in a golf cart wrapped in a pink flowered blanket and many admired her for her calm and her stoic posture she looked like she wasn't going to dignify the occasion by projecting fear but how did she really deal with what came after that uh from what she's sharing uh she kept this strength all over the the way even uh at Hard Times she kept optimism and she kept her her strength and uh her dignity and it was very important to her uh to be able to survive this hell and to come back home and and uh she's saying that even in hard times she could hear the great grandson calling her and and that it gave her it gave her power and it's uh it told her that she has to to do whatever it takes to survive and she's done and she's it's so inspiring and I'm so proud to be her granddaughter and um I really wish that my cousin and all the other hostages will be back so we can reunite uh as a family and as a country with our loved ones and to be able to recover from this tragic uh tragic uh things that are happened here you talk with great pride understandably about the strength of your grandmother and how that helped her get through the actual experience but I wonder what kind of help is she getting to cope with what she's been through and how she's going to plot a way forward through her life now we're still trying to figure it out with her uh it's still uh we still trying to understand her needs and uh and how we can uh help her so right now we're focusing on giving her a lot of love and being with her at this really hard minute and uh and along the way we will uh we will understand how and uh we will do everything in our power to make sure she will have a better future let's come back to where we started we we talked about the contrasting emotions of your grandmother being free but many more Israelis still being held hostage in Gaza among them your cousin toir whose photo you hold what do you know if anything about his well-being at this point unfortunately nothing uh unfortunately we at least with my grandmother we had the video we knew she was taken alive with Tamir we have no information we don't know his condition we don't know if he's injured and if he's getting any medical care H it's really hard uh not knowing uh what how is he handling this and what what he needs and uh when he will be able to come back because as you know there's no deal that uh that is is talking about demands and we really need to think about them as someone's father or someone's sons and we need to return them to their families they lived their lives quietly they got taken from their lives from their houses and they are civilians that needs to come back home ad proud cousin of Tamir proud granddaughter freed hostage yafa uh thank you so much for sharing with us thank you thank
