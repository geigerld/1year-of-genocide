Israel's military escalation in Gaza has come as pressure grows on the government to secure the release of almost 240 hostages captured by Hamas among them the German Israeli National sha Luke who has been confirmed dead by Israel's foreign Ministry in the last hour she was among those kidnapped at a music festival on October the 7th when Hamas militant stormed across into Israeli territory Shaunie Luke was last seen in a video where she appeared to be unconscious while being paraded through the streets of Gaza in a pickup truck DW political correspondent Leone van Hamin is following this story Leone what more can you tell us about this well R luk first came out and talked to the German news agency DPA and told him that the Israeli military informed her late Monday night of her daughter's death and you said it the Israeli foreign Ministry has now confirmed that um Ric Luke also said that the body of her 22-year-old daughter has not been found yet but that a splinter of her skull bone um was located and that a DNA sample was taken from it and tested and um she also said that she believes that her daughter died on October 7th during the terror attack at the music festival in southern Israel possibly by a shot in the head um and she was you said it one of those Festival go goers and Israeli German dual citizen who had been living in Tel Aviv um and for a long time Shan Luke's family had assumed that she had been severely injured but alive and in the Gaza Strip and um they had been publicly calling on the German government to fight for her release and and that time was running out and when four other female hostages were relieved this had given the family A little hope um just a week ago but um this hope has now obviously been dashed by the news of her death Hamas is believed to be holding several other Germans hostage what do we know about them and if they're still in hamas's hands well we don't know much um you said that Israel's military says that almost 240 people were abducted abducted by the islamist militant group Hamas and brought to Gaza and among those several German citizens the German citizen has said that a low two-digit number of German Israeli dual citizens are believed to be still held in Gaza um the relative relatives of those hostages um have been calling on the German government to do more and the news of Shany Luke's death are very likely going to increase that pressure DW political correspondent Leon Von Hamin many thanks Hamas militants massacred around a tenth of the population of one kabot in southern in Israel those who remained have been evacuated to a resort on the Dead Sea there around a thousand survivors try to find ways of dealing with their trauma and in many cases the loss of their loved ones as DW's Rebecca riters reports from INB portraying the dead from a time before their world fell apart just one of the therapies helping these people process their trauma at this UPS Resort on the Dead Sea it's a place of relative safety in a country at War around a thousand Israelis who escaped the massacre at kabut beri were evacuated here where they'll live for at least the next few months and try to come to terms with what happened yeah in 6 and a half in the morning I'm this we heard a lot of bombs and we woke up Ella benami recalls the moment the ordal began her parents soon texted her from their home up the street they were in hiding Hamas gunman killed more than 100 people in Berry that day Ella feared her mom and dad were among them something like an hour later I saw a picture of them on telegram with both terrorist they took him it's not in Israel I guess it's in Gaza two weeks later Ella found this video on telegram showing her captured mother filmed by Hamas so looking for clues of where they might have been taken she and her sister went back to their childhood home why why why why I can't even describe it it was so hard even yesterday when I went to there I couldn't step on the ground because on every piece of ground is so body buies and I couldn't think of of of walking on there on there on the world donations from across the country have been pouring in for people who escaped with only the clothes on their back they have to tell it over and over again Dina draw is one of a team of psychotherapists stationed in the hotel to help them she says the most important thing is to get people talking how they couldn't breathe how they have had no food how were worried how they saw in the WhatsApp uh group that people are in in in a great in danger how they escaped what did they see um they have to repeat it over and over until the story has a narrative it it has a beginning middle and an ending she says for Israelis this was an event unlike anything in recent memory it's a collective grief it's something we don't see usually in Israel you have a terror attack and a soldier is dead but here because of the massive numbers we have a collective uh grief and it's also a strong thing of a community that they going through it together going through it together but each alone in their pain there isn't a family that didn't lost someone there isn't a family here all the families lost someone and even as a kibuts we are a big family together and even I lost friends and neighbors and everyone lost someone the 7th of October was traumatic for all Israelis and even as the people from ber try to heal it's clear their trauma will be felt for Generations one of the families torn apart by hamas's attack on kibuts B is the family of shaket haran shaked's family home in Berry was found burned to the ground as you can see here in footage she gave us the whole family was missing she says 11 members of her family were kidnapped at gunpoint by Hamas including her parents sister brother-in-law and their three young children two aunts and an elderly Uncle three of her relatives and her uncle's caretaker have since been found dead and shaked believes the rest of the family are being held hostage in Gaza Shaka haran is with us now she joins us from Central Israel Shaka thank you so much for having the courage to share your story with us you have given us permission to share a photo collage that shows your relatives including those who are no longer with us may I begin by asking when and how you learned of their deaths so um after the massacre in the kibuts and the attack of the terrorists we didn't know anything we had no information uh and as the days passed by we started collecting more and more pieces of information and the first um the first indication we had is that all the family has been kidnapped including my father my uncle and my aunt and my uncle's caretaker um but eventually is the day passed we received first the message that the caretaker of my uncle was murdered and recognized by his wife who is 9 month pregnant and um after that we received a message that my uncle was murdered This was um a week and a half ago and that same day at night we received a message about my father that he was also murdered um and few days after this about my aunt so they came very close uh we were still mourning my father's death and then we got the message about my aunt um and about the rest of the family members we we received um very um we we received official information that they are that they were taken to Gaza alive essentially one surreal heartbreaking moment after the next one after the other um let's be clear about this what exactly do you know about the status of your other family members at this point as far as you know are they alive are they alive is what I'm asking essentially we what we know is that they were taken alive we haven't received any further information for what we know Kamas has not passed any information about who it's holding hostage there's no third party that received leas or the Red Cross hasn't been allowed to to get to the hostages to to get Aid to get humanitarian Aid to the hostages so Kamas is not really seeing any information and not allowing any sort of assistance for the hostages shaad is Israel's Army says it has entered the next phase of the war and is increasing air strikes and ground incursions does this fill you with hope or horror it's not a question that I feel I can answer it's a strategic political question some say some say it's to get the hostages back other say it's not good I don't know it's it's a political question there's no question about that it is definitely a political question but I think people watching you today will wonder how how is she experiencing this as political events on unfold in real time you must have personal feelings about this so I I have to tell you that my personal feelings since day one are between horror and hope um and it it I don't think that this this um move or that move makes it any better and I think that you know I'm praying that my family would be brought back alive and my baby niece and my nephew um that and and my cousin that are there you know it's I think one of of the channels that we are trying to um work with is is the international pressure on this spot because we understand they're also working inside Israel but we understand that Israel currently is in the midst of the war and let's talk let's talk about that let's talk about the international pressure Hamas has released a small number of hostages including US citizens some of your missing relatives have Austrian German or Italian citizenship are you aware of any of those governments being involved in hostage negotiations so um you know we had had official um Declarations of Germany that it is taking steps in order to care for the for the German citizens there um I don't know what this practically means behind the scenes but officially Germany has said these are German citizens and it will work it will do whatever in the power to bring them back but since then we are already 23 days into this situation and and I can really honestly tell you that that I fear that every day that goes by risks my family and risks the babies that are there and the many women and many children that are held hostage and that's why we really really hope that that that these governments are doing whatever they can to bring these people back and I can seriously honestly tell you that I cannot imagine what you're going through and I think that I speak for hundreds of thousands of viewers who are feeling the same way what's keeping you going the hope the hope that that I will get to meet my family that I will hug my small niece that we will meet them and say that we did everything in our power to bring them back the hope that they are being treated human in a humanitarian way I have you know it's and and it's not all the time because some of the time I'm in fear and Terror of what they are going through and I feel helpless and I feel that there is not enough being done to bring them back and that I'm failing them day after day every day that passes and they are not here I feel that I'm failing them them and I feel that this should be a concern of everyone right now to to bring these people back I think this this type of Terror is something that we cannot just go by every day like it's you know a Justified way of action well we will end it there but your story uh and that of dozens of others continues that is a shock at Iran we thank you so very much for sharing your story and wish you all the best thank you thank you very
