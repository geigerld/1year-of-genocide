00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.080
The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal&nbsp;
Court has said he’s seeking arrest warrants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.480
for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister&nbsp;
Netanyahu, for their conduct of the war in Gaza.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.240
Israeli politicians across the&nbsp;
spectrum have condemned the move.&nbsp;

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.360
The prosecutor has also applied for&nbsp;
warrants for key leaders of Hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.760
widely designated a terrorist organization.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.280
My guest this week from Tel Aviv is Dennis Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.920
former special assistant to President Barack&nbsp;
Obama, and for more than 12 years a key player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.920
in shaping US policy in the Middle East.&nbsp;
He’s not optimistic about what he sees now.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.400
I can tell you this is worse between&nbsp;
Israelis and Palestinians than at any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.920
point on which I worked on this issue,&nbsp;
including during the Second Intifada.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.000
The ICC’s announcement comes at&nbsp;
a time when Israel’s human rights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.120
record is under minute scrutiny, with&nbsp;
investigations by major media outlets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.120
into violence by Jewish settlers.&nbsp;
Can a Palestinian state ever emerge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.760
from so much conflict and hatred? 
 
Dennis Ross, welcome to Conflict Zone.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.960
Good to be with you.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800
Let's start with the announcement from&nbsp;
the chief prosecutor at the International&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.240
Criminal Court. Arrest warrants have never&nbsp;
been sought before for Israeli leaders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
and there's a storm of protest&nbsp;
not only from those named,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.800
but from across all political factions in&nbsp;
Israel. What effect do you think that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:36.120
will have on Israel's conduct of the war if the&nbsp;
warrants are approved by pre-trial judges? 
 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.440
I don't think it'll have a positive effect. I&nbsp;
think it creates in the minds of most Israelis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.400
across the political spectrum, that a moral&nbsp;
equivalence is being established between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.520
those who came in with the expressed purpose of&nbsp;
deliberately killing innocents, kidnapping people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:05.800
as young as nine months old, raping, just engaging&nbsp;
in unspeakable violence, brutality, and in a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.760
deliberate, determined way. And you're creating,&nbsp;
in a sense you're saying, you're treating them the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.840
same as you're effectively treating the leaders&nbsp;
of a state who are responding to this kind of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.880
assault. There certainly are issues that I think&nbsp;
the prosecution is raising about the way the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.480
Israelis have conducted the war. But most Israelis&nbsp;
will see this as creating a moral equivalence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.320
where there is none. And I, in the absence of&nbsp;
that I think in terms of most Israelis will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.100
that they need to, they need to prosecute the war&nbsp;
and try to ensure that they've defeated Hamas in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.560
way. Because in a sense they're going to fear that&nbsp;
under no circumstances will they ever be seen as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.840
being justified in terms of defending themselves&nbsp;
against these kinds of attacks. Whether that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.480
a correct perception [that] should exist or not.&nbsp;
That is the perception I'm afraid will exist here.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.920
To be fair to the prosecutor, he didn't suggest&nbsp;
there was any moral equivalence. On the contrary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.200
he, the way that it's being explained by him and&nbsp;
by his officials, is that if evidence is brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.080
to him, prima facie evidence is brought to him.&nbsp;
of crimes committed on both sides of a conflict,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.640
he has a duty to act and to pursue that evidence.&nbsp;
And this is one way in which he's doing it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.520
by seeking arrest warrants for those who have been&nbsp;
named. What other choice did he actually have?

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.080
Well, I think there is an interesting question&nbsp;
here in terms of timing because there was an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.080
expectation he was going to visit Israel and&nbsp;
have discussions prior to coming out with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.040
and obviously he did not do that. It does strike&nbsp;
me that it might have been, again, just from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.240
practical, pragmatic standpoint, it might have&nbsp;
made more sense to be here in advance before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.040
issued these, but obviously he chose not to do&nbsp;
that. There's the panel he has is, I have to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.520
is a serious panel. I think the problem however&nbsp;
is I'm suggesting is by not having come here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:25.760
before releasing this, I think it contributed to&nbsp;
the kind of very broad reaction, you have people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.080
who are extremely critical of Prime Minister&nbsp;
Netanyahu who are also quite critical of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.560
So a little bit more could have been done to set&nbsp;
the stage I suspect, but we are where we are.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:47.880
If these very serious charges are not to be&nbsp;
tested by the ICC, where else would they be heard?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.280
Again, it's not, it's not clear, but I think&nbsp;
there's a larger issue here that ought to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:04.400
kept in mind. And that is when you fight an enemy&nbsp;
that deliberately uses its civilian population not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.800
just as a shield but really as a hostage, and&nbsp;
you're put in a position where, what are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.320
choices you have, not to go after them, given&nbsp;
what is going to be the civilian consequence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.120
and therefore face this again or go after them and&nbsp;
unfortunately, there isn't going to be a civilian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.640
consequence. Now, I will grant one of the things&nbsp;
that the Israelis should have done. I've made an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.520
argument for this from the very beginning of the&nbsp;
war. They should have been much more forthcoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.480
with humanitarian assistance. They should have&nbsp;
gone out of their way to demonstrate this was an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.400
effort to, an imperative to defeat Hamas and not&nbsp;
to punish the Palestinians who live in Gaza. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.680
Israel did not act in that way, and it made it&nbsp;
easier for those to portray what they're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.920
in a way that is outside of what, outside the&nbsp;
bounds of acceptability. But is again the reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.760
is Israel was faced with a very cruel dilemma.&nbsp;
You have an enemy that carries not one width&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.520
for the well-being of its own public, is&nbsp;
quite ready to expose them, doesn't mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.920
if Israel kills a lot of Palestinians,&nbsp;
in fact seems to relish that prospect.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.560
But this is what you what you seem to be outlining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.520
is that this is a watershed moment&nbsp;
for international justice, isn't it?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.760
I really do think there's a question here&nbsp;
about how we, we may have to redefine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.720
international humanitarian law. I mean on&nbsp;
the one hand you still have an obligation to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.920
try to minimize the casualties to civilian&nbsp;
non-combatants. That's an obligation that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.560
shouldn't change. But how the tactics you can&nbsp;
use, how you go about doing that. How do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:56.760
create in a clear distinction between those who&nbsp;
are using human shields as a deliberate tactic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.760
and those who have to contend with that. I&nbsp;
do think this is an issue that we're long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.960
overdue trying to come to grips with how we&nbsp;
can better define international humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.480
law given these kinds of non-state actors and&nbsp;
given their, the tactics that they employ.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.200
Whatever system that you want to work towards&nbsp;
or you think that the international community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.120
should work towards to provide some&nbsp;
kind of justice in situations like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.000
we're not going to be able to live in a world&nbsp;
where accountability is reserved for enemies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.200
not friends. Isn't that the question that Gaza&nbsp;
is forcing everyone to consider, in its essence?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.960
Well, I think, it is, at least in part. But I&nbsp;
don't think it's coming to grips with the question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:50.360
I've been posing which is what is a legitimate&nbsp;
strategy for trying to root out an enemy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.640
a non-state actor, as it seems - if you're going&nbsp;
to have to have international humanitarian law,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.240
it can't simply be one which says, ok you're&nbsp;
entitled to strike back, but you have to minimize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.840
civilian casualties. What if it turns out that&nbsp;
the choice for minimizing civilian casualties is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.960
quite limited. I mean there is something else that&nbsp;
could have been done. Something else that could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.840
have been done is in a situation like this, maybe&nbsp;
international humanitarian law should say there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:27.160
needs to be a period and there need to be areas&nbsp;
where people can be evacuated so they're not, as,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.080
they're not as shields. I mean what separates,&nbsp;
for example, how the United States approached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.880
Fallujah is that the people who lived in&nbsp;
Fallujah were actually allowed to leave.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.400
In Iraq. In Iraq.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.960
In Iraq, yes, they were allowed to leave. They&nbsp;
could, they could leave the city. The problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.920
here in Gaza, because it's so small, that they're&nbsp;
not allowed to leave, what one finds in every war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:59.680
zone is that people leave. And look at Syria.&nbsp;
About five and a half million people left, fled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.120
Syria. It wasn't a simple thing to do,&nbsp;
but five and a half million people left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:10.040
left Syria. In Gaza, the people are not allowed&nbsp;
to leave. So one of the, I think one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.560
challenges for international humanitarian law&nbsp;
is to be able to come up with if you're trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.840
to protect the well-being of civilians, which is&nbsp;
a, it's not just a moral imperative, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.400
it's a moral imperative. It should be a political&nbsp;
imperative as well. But then one of the things you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.960
have to come up with is strategies for evacuation&nbsp;
that the international community can facilitate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.760
as a way of ensuring that if a war is being&nbsp;
fought against those who are using human shields,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.960
at least the international community is&nbsp;
doing everything it can, not just in terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.640
of providing humanitarian assistance, but in&nbsp;
terms of getting them out of harm's way. 
 

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.680
It hasn't been helped, the situation, has it, by&nbsp;
the fact that some of the reporting about Israel's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.920
behavior by the administration in the [United]&nbsp;
States has been contradictory. On May the 10th,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.360
the State Department wrote to Congress with its&nbsp;
most detailed assessment of Israel's conduct,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.560
and it concluded that Israel had most likely&nbsp;
violated international standards in failing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.280
to protect civilians in Gaza, but saying at the&nbsp;
same time it had not found specific instances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.120
that would justify cutting military aid. The&nbsp;
department was immediately accused of a fudge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.800
Democratic Senator Chris Van Holland told&nbsp;
reporters “if this conduct complies with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.000
international standards, then God help&nbsp;
us all”. He has a point, doesn't he?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.080
Well, he does, but I guess I keep coming&nbsp;
back to the issue of international&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.520
standards. The international standards&nbsp;
have not adjusted to a reality where you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.960
have an enemy that uses human shields.&nbsp;
So we end up judging the actor who has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.120
been attacked as they then try to root&nbsp;
out those who are using human shields.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.800
But how do you explain the apparent contradictions&nbsp;
in the State Department report, on the one handed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.600
concludes that both action and inaction by&nbsp;
Israel had slowed the flow of aid into Gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.760
But on the other, it says “we don't currently&nbsp;
assess the Israeli government is prohibiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:16.480
or otherwise restricting the transport or&nbsp;
delivery of US humanitarian assistance into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.080
the area.” In other words, slowing the aid&nbsp;
flow is not restricting it. Of course it is.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.920
Look, I think what you what you have is that you&nbsp;
have really, I think you're raising two different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.440
kinds of issues. One issue has to do with the use&nbsp;
of weapons. That's what you were first raising.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.920
Now the second thing you're raising is the issue&nbsp;
of the permission of humanitarian assistance to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.000
go in in the quantities that it should have&nbsp;
been permitted. On the former, I think what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.320
the State Department was finding was that they&nbsp;
were looking at the totality of the people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.080
the numbers of people killed and said almost by&nbsp;
definition, we draw a conclusion that this must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.680
have been done, force must have been done in a way&nbsp;
inconsistent with international humanitarian law.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.320
On the other hand, we don't have specific&nbsp;
instances of what that was done. I can understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:14.360
that duality. The other issue you’re raising about&nbsp;
the permission, the provision of international,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.040
of humanitarian assistance, I share that view. The&nbsp;
fact that it is not popular here with the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.640
body politic who have suffered greatly from&nbsp;
October 7th and who every day see what Hamas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:35.400
is doing by holding hostages, increasing numbers&nbsp;
of them no longer being alive and there the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.960
politic here is not feeling very sympathetic&nbsp;
to the Gazan population who they see somehow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:49.000
being in league with Hamas. My own view is&nbsp;
the Gazan population is the victim of Hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.800
not in league with Hamas and Israel's&nbsp;
approach to the war needed to separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.440
Hamas from the population of Gaza.
 
Let's talk, if we may, about the state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:08.080
of US-Israel relations. Are they now as bad as&nbsp;
you've known it during the course of your career?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:16.200
I think it's... We're certainly at a low&nbsp;
point, but I wonder how much it's US-Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.240
and [how much] it's just the leadership. I do&nbsp;
think that there is enormous frustration with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.680
Prime Minister Netanyahu. I don't think&nbsp;
that extends necessarily to all Israelis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.920
and not necessarily even to everyone in the&nbsp;
current government. But I do think there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.920
growing frustration with him. President Biden,&nbsp;
who's always had a good relationship with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.320
I think has become very frustrated for a&nbsp;
variety of reasons. One is on a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.680
occasions Prime Minister Netanyahu has&nbsp;
made promises to him and not fulfilled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.960
those promises. And I think that has contributed&nbsp;
greatly to the frustration that he feels. Do I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.200
think this is something that can be overcome&nbsp;
at least between the US and Israel? Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.440
because I don't see this necessarily as extending&nbsp;
to the two countries right now. I think there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.200
a problem between the two leaderships.&nbsp;
We'll have to see how that plays out.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:16.040
On the limiting of weapons supplies to&nbsp;
Israel, you called it a mistake, what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.280
the administration had done, saying it took all&nbsp;
the pressure off the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.520
and pressure on him was the key to a&nbsp;
hostage deal. But President Biden is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.040
someone who's all but accused Israelis of&nbsp;
war crimes by saying they've been bombing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.440
indiscriminately. If he goes on giving them&nbsp;
those same American bombs to continue that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:45.080
indiscriminate bombing, it makes him&nbsp;
look weak, doesn't it? And complicit.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.160
Well, I think, you know, you can, I think you can&nbsp;
kind of present this however you choose to present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:59.320
it. The fact is, I think he's trying to strike a&nbsp;
balance. He wants an outcome where Hamas, who not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:05.160
only committed terrible atrocities on October 7th,&nbsp;
but continues to do it with the way it brutalizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.920
the hostages that it holds. There's almost seems&nbsp;
to be kind of international indifference to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.760
what Hamas is doing to the hostages. Obviously&nbsp;
there's not that indifference here in Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:22.280
where for all the families, their life was frozen&nbsp;
on October 7th. In the case of President Biden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.360
he wants to be sure the outcome is an outcome&nbsp;
where Hamas is no longer in control of Gaza,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.120
where Gaza can no longer be a platform for&nbsp;
attacks against Israel. And he's trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:40.120
strike a balance between how do you achieve that&nbsp;
objective and at the same time conduct the war in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:47.760
a way that tries to minimize the level of damage&nbsp;
and destruction done to the Palestinians who live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:54.720
in Gaza. It's a very hard, very hard balance to&nbsp;
strike. One can, one can try to be pure in one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.920
direction or the other but then you're not going&nbsp;
to achieve what is the most important objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.360
I don't think the, it's very important to find a&nbsp;
way to end this war, but this war also needs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.640
end in a way where Hamas is not in a position&nbsp;
where it has any possibility of recouping.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:17.520
Another reason surely for withholding weapons to&nbsp;
Israel is that American taxpayers are funding an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.840
Israeli offensive that the majority of them&nbsp;
now appear to be against. Some of the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:30.400
polls show 55% of Americans against 36% who&nbsp;
support Israel's conduct of the war. Don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.880
you think that the prospect is pretty worrying&nbsp;
for the Biden administration six months away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.280
from a presidential election? Is&nbsp;
that one of their calculations?

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.800
I'm sure, all the things being equal, [if]&nbsp;
you're the president of the United States,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.720
you're in an election year, this is an&nbsp;
issue that almost by definition is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:57.560
helpful. So you would undoubtedly like to&nbsp;
see this over as soon as possible and while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.680
and yet at the same time, while the president&nbsp;
wants to see this over as soon as possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.840
he doesn't want an outcome where somehow Hamas is&nbsp;
able to recoup and re-establish itself. If it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.960
this is not the last time we'll see this. Hamas&nbsp;
has shown not the slightest bit of interest in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:20.280
developing Gaza, not the slightest bit of interest&nbsp;
in doing and providing well for the well-being of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.320
its own public. It built 400 miles of tunnels&nbsp;
underground. All the materials that it did and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.800
it used in in building those tunnels, all the&nbsp;
materials that it used in building a military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:39.000
industrial base underground, all that could&nbsp;
have been used on the surface to advance Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and the well-being of the people there, it did&nbsp;
none of that. And if it had a chance, it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.920
do this all over again. So you understand, of&nbsp;
course the president wants this over. It would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.640
be much better for the president, especially&nbsp;
in an election year, if this was no longer an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.040
issue. But he doesn't want it over in a way where&nbsp;
Hamas can do this again or it can reconstitute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:06.320
itself and subject everybody, Palestinians and&nbsp;
Israelis alike, to another round like this.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.880
This is also a time when Israel's human&nbsp;
rights record has been under some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.360
the most intense scrutiny, not least&nbsp;
because of multiple cases of settler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.320
violence against Palestinians in the West&nbsp;
Bank. How concerned are you again that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:27.640
despite repeated international warnings about&nbsp;
that, very little has been done to curb it?

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.480
Well, look, I think one of the challenges&nbsp;
again with this Israeli government, you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.840
a couple of very extreme ministers, one of whom&nbsp;
is the Minister of National Security, Ben-Gvir,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.640
and he often imes looks like he turns a blind eye&nbsp;
to what extremist settlers do. Israel presents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.760
itself as a rule of law, and it has to act that&nbsp;
way. And with many of the extremist settlers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.960
including those right now who are trying to block&nbsp;
deliveries of assistance to Gaza. The law needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.720
to be enforced on them. There needs to be&nbsp;
more demonstration of that and if there isn't,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.920
the administration is right to single out&nbsp;
and sanction some of those individuals.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.400
A year-long investigation by the New&nbsp;
York Times, published in recent days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.040
claims to reveal how violent factions inside&nbsp;
the settler movement have been protected and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.880
sometimes abetted by the Israeli government&nbsp;
and now pose a grave threat to Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.480
in the occupied territories. We found the Times&nbsp;
said "a government shaken by an internal war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.840
burying reports it commissioned, neutering&nbsp;
investigations it assigned and silencing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.160
whistleblowers, some of them senior&nbsp;
officials”. Did you know about this? 
 

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.520
I did not.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.720
Does any of it surprise you?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.760
Over the years, I've always had a sense&nbsp;
that there was some protection. One of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:58.520
things that always was troubling is that it was&nbsp;
very hard to ever find the exact expenditures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.800
on the whole settlement enterprise, as if the&nbsp;
Israeli government knew if it was exposed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.120
it would actually produce a reaction&nbsp;
within Israel. So I'm not surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.680
at one level. The scope of it,&nbsp;
I have to say is surprising.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:21.360
Mr. Ross, on the ground in Gaza, heavy fighting&nbsp;
around the southern city of Rafah despite the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:28.240
strongest possible warnings from the US, has&nbsp;
Israel stopped listening to the White House?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.520
The Biden administration said multiple&nbsp;
times it wanted to see a credible plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.640
for safeguarding civilians if the Rafah&nbsp;
offensive went ahead. By May the 15th,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:44.080
at least, it was still saying it hadn't seen&nbsp;
such a plan. Is there anywhere a red line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:51.680
which in the, which under no circumstances Israel&nbsp;
would be allowed to cross by the administration?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.520
I think that the president has made that&nbsp;
clear that if they go into Rafah City,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.640
that is a red line that's been crossed&nbsp;
without a credible evacuation plan.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.440
With consequences. There would be consequences?

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:11.400
That's right. Well, there, Israel is operating&nbsp;
all around Rafah, but not within Rafah City. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.840
and right now about 800,000 people actually&nbsp;
have left. You still leave probably another 5&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.560
to 600,000 who are there. So they're still not&nbsp;
in the city. I think for the administration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.680
if they were to go into the city, there would be&nbsp;
consequences. I think the president, President&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.760
Biden is someone who when he says something,&nbsp;
he tends to mean it. So I suspect, and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.160
one of the reasons I suspect the Israelis have&nbsp;
not gone in, is because that is something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.400
they understand is going to trigger a response and&nbsp;
with a price that they probably don't want to pay.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.120
The Israeli Prime Minister has made it clear&nbsp;
that the prize of a Palestinian state is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:56.320
on offer to the Palestinians, particularly&nbsp;
after what Hamas has done. Is there any way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:02.960
that a Palestinian state can, in your&nbsp;
view, emerge from all this conflict? 
 

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.680
Well, not in the near term. First of all, the&nbsp;
Palestinians are divided between the West Bank and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:17.000
Gaza. You're going to have to politically reunify&nbsp;
them. Look, I, my own view is the Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.320
people have a right to self-determination and&nbsp;
whether that's a state, if they choose that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.880
state or there's some kind of confederation, that&nbsp;
should be their choice. But by the same token,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.440
with rights come responsibilities.&nbsp;
When we talk about a Palestinian state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.000
we can't have a Palestinian state that's going to&nbsp;
be led by Hamas. That's certainly not a two-state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.920
solution. That's a guarantee for continuing war.&nbsp;
It can't be a Palestinian state that becomes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.840
member of the Axis of Resistance, what I call&nbsp;
the Axis of Misery, being aligned with Iran,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:56.680
that's also a guarantee, that's a guarantee&nbsp;
against two states. It can't be a Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.560
state that doesn't have institutions, so it'll be&nbsp;
a failed state. So you need, you need to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:08.200
rights and responsibilities. I would like to see&nbsp;
some benchmarks created, some milestones created,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.720
all with the, all under the rubric that&nbsp;
Palestinians have a state in the making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:19.280
and they have to fulfill their responsibilities to&nbsp;
be able to achieve their rights. Now, obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:26.240
at the same time, if you're creating that kind&nbsp;
of set of standards or milestones or obligations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.760
on the Palestinian side, you have to impose some&nbsp;
responsibilities on the Israeli side, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:37.400
among other things, they cannot act on the ground&nbsp;
in the West Bank in a way that makes it impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.440
to have a Palestinian state. But everything I've&nbsp;
just said, this is not something you can produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:49.520
overnight. We have to start by having both sides&nbsp;
even begin to cooperate in a functional way again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.320
And we're at a very low ebb. You asked me about&nbsp;
"was this as difficult a time as I've ever seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.560
in terms of US-Israeli relations?" I can tell you&nbsp;
this is worse between Israelis and Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.920
than at any point on which I worked on this&nbsp;
issue, including during the Second Intifada.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.280
So we have to get back to some kind of a baseline&nbsp;
so we can move from there and move in a direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:20.560
of peace becoming possible. Right now, we're not&nbsp;
dealing with a conflict that is seen in political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.960
terms. We're seeing conflict that's almost seen&nbsp;
in existential terms and we're going to have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.640
get back to creating a sense of possibility&nbsp;
again, and we're quite a ways from that.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.920
Can I just raise with you briefly the death in&nbsp;
a helicopter accident of the Iranian President&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:44.720
Raisi? Any sign of an opportunity or&nbsp;
a danger emerging from this accident?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.280
I don't think it changes things very much. I&nbsp;
mean, it creates uncertainty within Iran. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:57.280
Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, is a decision maker.&nbsp;
Raisi was not the decision maker. He might be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.920
decision implementer, but he wasn't the decision&nbsp;
maker. My guess is the Supreme Leader will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.200
emphasize the importance of people participating&nbsp;
in the election because he likes to portray that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.000
as being an indication of legitimacy. The fact&nbsp;
that turnouts are so small right now is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.440
indication of how the Iranian public really feels&nbsp;
about the Islamic Republic and the regime. But I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.400
think in the near term, their focus will be&nbsp;
much more on trying to work out this election,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:30.880
trying to maximize the numbers of people who&nbsp;
vote and much less adventures on the outside.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.240
Dennis Ross, it's been good to&nbsp;
have you on Conflict Zone. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.600
you very much indeed for your time. Thank you.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:58.240
Good to be with you.
