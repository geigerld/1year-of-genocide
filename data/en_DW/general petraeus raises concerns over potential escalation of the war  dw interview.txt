former CIA director and fourstar General David Petraeus is a regular guest on D news General Petraeus thank you very much for making time at the very beginning of this crucial Year Mr Petraeus besides the war in Ukraine we are witnessing another major military conflict in Gaza the Israeli government says its goal is to destroy Hamas and that it will continue their military operation until this is accomplished with your experience is this even impossible to destroy a terror organization such as Hamas militarily it's possible the question is whether it is likely at this point and I think it is in question to do that uh as I've described to you before you have to clear and hold all of Gaza you have to clear every building floor room Cellar tunnel uh destroy the infrastructure kill or capture a substantial number of the actual the leaders in particular but also the fighters and we're talking tens of thousands they want to destroy Hamas dismantle the political wing and obviously gain the uh the recovery of their hostages but there need to be other Big Ideas uh there needs to be a big idea about who's going to administer Gaza I think inevitably at least on a temporary basis it's going to fall to Israel to do that there no hands going up to do that there's no capable competent Trust were the Palestinian entity that can be brought over from the West Bank and they wouldn't want to go in on the backs of Israeli tanks anyway sounds as if it's transitioning to a more targeted raid approach that can indeed kill or capture leaders of Gaza and perhaps important elements of it but we use that technique in ratti and fuia and other areas in a rock prior to the surge um and while it might disrupt the enemy periodically it was not enough to destroy the enemy to destroy an enemy you have to render it incapable of accomplishing its Mission without reconstitution the strategy uh Israel is following right now uh comes with a huge humanitarian cost I'll just say first of all that when we conducted these operations in Romani fua bakuba mosul particular mosul a very large city and other parts of urban areas in Iraq The Surge when we destroyed kaida in Iraq we were worked very very hard to keep loss of innocent life to a minimum and often the very first objective would be to seize the hospital for example fuia the first objective was to actually take control of the hospital and keep it open and to provide our medical assistance and uh Pharmaceuticals and drugs and all the rest of this uh if they were running short because we wanted to take take care of the population knew that inevitably there are civilian uh casualties but again you keep them to a minimum and when they do occur you try to treat them as quickly as you can again the objective is to create a better life for the people as you are also separating them from the extremists and destroying the extremist Group which has brought such hardship on them we also had a sign on the wall of our operation centers and every one of my five combat commands which asked a question will this operation take more bad guys off the street than it creates by its conduct and if the answer to that was no then you're supposed to go back and examine how you can change the operation so that the answer is yes if you still can't get to yes then you put it on hold for a period of time but there's no question I think that the loss of innocent civilian life has been very troubling and our president vice president secretary of state Secretary of Defense and others have uh reiterated how crucial it is uh that you not create additional enemies you don't Foster an an a new generation that might be attracted by the Hamas ideology by the way you go about destroying Hamas and again I want to see Hamas destroyed I want Israel to be able to achieve that I believe it is necessary if you don't do that then again what's left will reconstitute uh and you're going to see necessity for more such operations in the future an Israeli drone just killed a deputy Hamas Chief in Beirut um that is also causing uh uh more trouble if you want to say so so lebanon's PM accuses Israel of trying to I quote this here drag it Lebanon inter Regional War so my question is I assume How concerned are you that the war will be spilling over to the whole region I I think you clearly have to be concerned about the possibility of uh why in of the war if you will and we can walk our way around the region Lebanon Iraq Iran Yemen and so forth and and discuss that when it comes to the Iranian supported Lebanese Hezbollah however I've felt from the beginning and stated from the beginning that I didn't feel that hisb wanted to get into the kind of war that they uh provoked with their actions back in 2006 you know the original assessment that case was that the Israeli Air Force had over promised and underd delivered uh that assessment proved inaccurate and several times in subsequent years once when I was the Central Command Commander again later when I was the director of the CIA we went back and and changed that assessment as we realized how much damage uh Israel had done to Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon and the fact that they were still rebuilding I'm sure there are still signs of damage from that particular war and I think that is why they have so far been calibrating what it is they have done they want to show that they are uh supporting Hamas and they're doing it certainly very much rhetorically but their physical actions have been limited to a handful or two handfuls of attacks per day that have only gone to a certain depth within Israel and it is interesting that the mosad leader uh Avid barnea has stated that this is going to be carried out in a way he alluded to what was done after uh the terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics that they're going to hunt down Amos leaders wherever they are some people around the world say that the US however still should draw kind of a red line in regard of Israel uh supporting Israel with military equipment do you agree on that should there be something where the US says no stop that goes too far to be fair the administration did actually halt the delivery of small arms uh because of it's publicly stated concern that they might be provided to the settlers in the West Bank who are carrying out what what was essentially vigilante actions in the eyes of the administration so there has been some limit but again I think we all want by the way I think the Arab countries in the region want to see Hamas destroyed and the political Wing dismantled again the big fear of many of the Gulf States is precisely what Hamas manifests uh it is political Islam and it is Extreme islamist extremism um so again I'm rooting for Israel I want them to be able to destroy Hamas and dismantle its political wing and obviously to rescue their hostages uh but right now it is not entirely clear whether that will prove possible no situation has been more challenged ing than that which has faced Israel in Gaza the density of the population an enemy who doesn't wear uniforms an enemy who hides behind civilians uses them as human Shields holds over a 100 hostages still has an vast tunnel Network knows the neighborhood has been preparing its defenses for many years uh in some cases is willing to blow itself up to take them with him uh again it just could not be more challenging and more complex 2024 is also a presidential election year here in the United States many people around the world ask what if Trump wins what do you expect would he do with respect to Ukraine would he try to kind of do a switch up with Putin is this something possible I honestly don't know keep in mind there are many other uh bodies in Washington including both houses of Congress uh in which there are strong bipartisan majorities that support continued authorization and appropriation for Ukraine and I think we will see in the weeks that lie ahead for example that the issues in Our House of Representatives will be resolved uh of course what they're trying to do is use some of this as leverage to get the administration to a degree some to some policy changes and other actions to uh improve the security of our Southern border which I think is a is a worthy objective given the issues uh that we're seeing down there the unprecedented number of illegal uh immigrants coming across that border but I do think that this will be resolved the question is is it next week the week after the week after that but there will be very substantial uh additional authorizations and Appropriations for Ukraine and also to replenish our own stockpiles um so that is forthcoming that will take us all the way through uh until the inauguration of the next Administration and frankly the 10 months that lie ahead is an eternity in American politics as you know from being here for some time there's no telling what twists and turns uh May uh may appear uh in the months that lie ahead and I think very premature to start speculating about what one or the other candidate will particularly the former president might do if he were to come back to office however last time he was in office he tried to really pull out of NATO um I mean you as a fourstar general what do you think what would uh the military leadership think about that and could they try to throw up obstacles uh against that uh wish uh and how would they look like well there's already been legislation passed that prevents a president from taking us out of NATO so I think that's not a not a viable question at this point in time however NATO is built on trust if if he would threaten to leave NATO again wouldn't this alone this threat alone weaken uh the alliance tremendously well you know I used to say uh when uh president Trump was in office that you should read the tweets um because they are they were the unedited expressions of the president of the United States uh but then follow the troops follow the money and follow the policy and actually during his administration we returned an armored Brigade uh to Europe for the first time since it had been withdrawn some years previously I think during the Obama Administration um we approved the new NATO structure and so forth um supported a variety of other initiatives that actually improved uh the posture of NATO uh so all of that was carried out and again keep in mind that there is very very strong bipartisan support in Washington DC uh for continued involvement with NATO but also recognize that every single pre president including the two for whom I served as a commander as a fourstar in war um were concerned and expressed it publicly uh that there were certain NATO allies who were not paying their share if you will and that's why it's been so heartening to see Germany after the ziton vendon uh commit to not only getting to 1.5% of uh GDP on defense but to exceed 2% and and we look forward uh to seeing that implemented obviously uh through the bundock it's very very encouraging the number four economy in the world that increases so substantially is a very significant statement and I'd also just point out finally uh that Europe has committed to double what the United States has committed to in supporting Ukraine it's not only given more now pledged more in terms terms of security assistance than the US has pledged and the US has pledged over $44 billion do as you know um it is pledged far far more when it comes to economic uh financial and humanitarian assistance which I think is appropriate this is after all a European security issue that brings me to my question does us has really the Strategic patience to keep up the support for Ukraine I think it does and I think we also have the capability um I noted that the US has contributed over 44 billion dollars worth of security assistance but that's out of two years of defense spending that total more than 1.7 trillion so this is very affordable and again Ukraine is not asking Americans or soldiers of any NATO country to fight and die for their country uh they young men and women in uniform are doing that this is their war of independence and they re recognize it as such as their fight for their very survival did Ukraine really ever have a chance to win this offensive without Western fighter jets uh in hindsight I think not um again our own Doctrine requires air superiority not just air parity but air superiority to breach the kind of very substantial obstacles that were encountered uh in the defenses that Russia established in the South there are rumors or talks uh uh that it is possible that most of Ukraine joins NATO and the rest stays occupied by Russia do you think this is a possible likely scenario I don't know that it's likely I know that it's one of the kinds of scenarios that people are exploring um I tend to think that liberating really all that Russia has occupied including Crimea and the donbass is really necessary both from a def defensive perspective to shrink the area that Russia uh can engage Ukraine over I mean the front now is very very substantial it's vastly greater than it was uh when you just had Russia in the dabass but but the dabass is also necessary from an economic perspective if you're truly to see Ukraine Prosper uh in the way that we would like uh but I know there's a variety of different scenarios that people are looking at uh that could engage uh nato in some way certainly EU membership as well would be very very desirable uh and then commitment of very substantial funds in what might be term some kind of modern-day Marshall Plan uh to help Ukraine pursue its reconstruction what is the biggest threat for Ukraine right now well I think there are a number of possible issues um the most concerning I think right now is the possibility that Russia could on some some evening let's say really overwhelmed uh the counter drone anti-air and anti-ballistic missile defenses and do the kind of damage to Ukrainian infrastructure that it has sought to do from the very beginning uh but never really has achieved uh and I think that could be very very uh damaging it would um it could undermine morale as well and it's why I said it's imperative uh that we Rush everything we can to them as quickly as we can to ensure frankly that that is not possible but you make of reports of us uh pressure on Selinsky to cut a deal with Russia to at least freeze the war along the current front lines not much because I don't think that they are U I don't think there are those kinds of pressures um certainly it's one thing for people to explore or think about or you know how might uh this war be brought to an end but the Administration has said from the outset that we nothing with about Ukraine without Ukraine and and I believe that they have adhered to that particular big idea where will we be in six months time in Ukraine it depends uh and having taught economics in an earlier life uh you can never go wrong by beginning an answer by saying it depends it clearly depends on a variety of the different uh factors that I've explained are in play um it depends on how well the ukrainians do and generating additional forces it depends on how well the Western countries NATO countries us uh do in providing the capabilities that General zusan has identified as being required uh it depends on whether Russia can continue to generate forces on its side noting that it has never fully mobilized uh it is trying to Shield the population of Moscow and St Petersburg and so forth and generally uh recruiting forces from the more rural areas not to mention from prisons and private military contractors rather than uh from the children of the the elite if you will look I really think this is about as right versus wrong in the world that it gets I think it's very much uh in the interest of all NATO and all Western countries uh to make sure that Russia cannot succeed uh and that Ukraine is able to liberate all of its territory join the EU join NATO uh and enable uh its reconstruction thank you
