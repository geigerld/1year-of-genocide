I'm Gad alus welcome to the program Israel's prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's office has announced the temporary opening of a border crossing to allow Aid into Gaza the opening of the Ares Crossing into the Palestinian territories North was among several steps approved by Israel's cabinet to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance the news was welcomed in Washington where President Joe Biden had earlier told Netanyahu in a phone call that further us support for Israel's war in Gaza depended on such steps Biden also said Israel must take more action to prevent civilian deaths relations between the two allies have soured since Monday's killing of seven Aid workers in an Israeli air strike in Gaza speaking at a NATO meeting in Brussels US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin called on Israel to do more to protect civilians and allow access to humanitarian Aid we need to an immediate ceasefire to enable the release of hostages but also to enable um a dramatic surge in humanitarian assistance uh as well as obviously better protecting um civilians now uh as I said the president and the Prime Minister just spoke but it's uh our expectation that um Israel uh will and certainly should announce concrete specific me measurable steps that uh it will take and take as soon as possible uh to make sure that there can be an effective Surge and assistance that it can be sustained uh and that humanitarian workers and civilians are better protected DW correspondent Tanya ker joins us now from Jerusalem Tanya what more can you tell us about these these new steps to let Aid into Gaza well as you said this announcement by the Israeli cabinet came uh after this phone call between US President Joe Biden and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and I think the most significant as you said is the reopening at least for some time of the Aris Crossing that is a Crossing in the north it has been in the past used by humanitarian workers but also by journalists we went through there uh going into Gaza diplomats and also Palestinian patients uh going out from Gaza uh this is significant because uh when you cross the area Crossing uh It Takes by car about 10 minutes uh to reach the out outskirts of Gaza City passing the town of B hanon and of course right now we're expecting that you know the infrastructure and roads are heavily damaged but this will have to be taken care of and it would help uh those eight convoys uh eight organizations have said you know they rarely go into uh the north of Gaza because of various reasons uh they could be uh now reaching the area much faster and that is very important because especially in Northern Gaza the situation is critical for the people uh that have uh remained there in addition to that uh the cabinet announced that more humanitarian Aid would be going through the ashdot port the Israeli Port which is also close uh to uh in close proximity by Road uh to the areas Crossing in the north of Gaza and also that more humanitarian Aid would be coordinated through Jordan WIA the land route and then going through Kim Shalom now this of course looks first of all good on paper now of course it needs to be seen you know how much uh this will actually increase the aid and delivery also of commercial Goods going into Gaza in the coming days uh this followed Biden's call with Netanyahu in which Biden also called for an immediate ceasefire will Israel listen to that well I think I mean it's a bit in the wording and I think we've seen here uh in this call we understand from American officials that US President Joe Biden was very upset what happened uh to the aid workers of uh the world Central Kitchen you know in in in the tone and as indicating that there could be a change in a US policy with respect to Gaza as was uh written in the readout of this call it will be determined it said quote by the assessment of Israel's immediate action immediate action uh on these steps and we heard also uh US Secretary blinken before uh you know they made it clear they need to be specific and concrete and measurable measurable steps for the civilian population uh but also uh to protect uh uh um the aid workers working in Gaza in addition to calling for an immediate ceasefire and to come to conclusion uh in these hostage talks we have we have to wait and see if if this will have any impact our correspondent T they reporting from Jerusalem thank you Tanya now let's bring in y Tilman he's the Middle East program director at the international crisis group and he joins us from Brussels uh yours more Aid to come to Gaza are you optimistic or is it just good on paper well I'm optimistic that in fact more Aid will come to Gaza but um I'm not optimistic in the sense that it's still way too little uh Gaza is facing uh and is already undergoing Parts uh famine uh people are starving to death uh and um the aid that trickling in is really far in far too insufficient to take care of all the people who are in desperate need of food so yes it's a step forward but it's really not enough uh do you think that Israel has succumbed to the pressure from the US to protect civilians better well s is too strong a word for me I think Israel is giving into some pressure uh to some of the pressure in order to uh increase very gradually very slowly uh and very minimally uh Aid to to starving Palestinians um but uh more pressure will be needed uh and maybe some more some some more concrete action on the part of the United States in order to uh press Israel to to completely open up the uh the territory to the kind of Aid to the kind of volumes of Aid that are now required now given all this pressure do you think will see Israel scale down its Gaza operations uh because it fears that more mistakes could alienate them from their Partners even further you know it's a very difficult thing because I think prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't want to end the war in Gaza short of having destroyed Hamas which has been the war objective from the very beginning and in a way the United States agrees with that objective but not at the cost of destroying Gaza and his population and I think prime minister Netanyahu doesn't necessarily care so much about what happens to the population so it's a very difficult balance for him now he may have to scale down but he doesn't want to end it uh and so he's in a bind and I think he also believes that the longer he can keep the war going uh the more secure his own position is as prime minister and I think from from his part President Biden is trying to squeeze him so that he eventually will have to step down uh and a new government will come in place in Israel that will be a little bit more amenable to us pressure oh that LE leads me straight to my next question as you mentioned Nan has been under pressure from several sides both inside and outside of Israel uh and they also have been calls for SNAP parliamentary elections and even for his removal uh is iser of that likely to happen well the thing is I think uh prime minister Netanyahu popularity has taken a nose dive um compared with some of the other candidates who were there but that said um his uh Coalition still has majority support in Parliament so whatever regardless of his personal popularity will be difficult to uh move to elections when he still enjoys a majority so something else would have to happen to to trigger that uh now um clearly there's the population is asking for new elections so or parts of the population so we'll have to see uh whether that pressure builds to the point that actually they will trigger uh that your sand there the Middle East program director at the international crisis group thank you very much for sharing your expertise with us thank
