meanwhile Israel's military has presented a plan to get more Aid into Gaza the Army says as many as 500 trucks a day could soon be delivering supplies we are constructing the northern crossing a new land Crossing from Israel into Northern Gaza to enable more Aid to flow directly to civilians in the areas that have been challenging for the trucks to access we have worked with International partners to bring in more aid from the sea via the port of ashdod after which it will be transported down to the crossings into Gaza let's look at this with Bob kitchen who is vice president for emergencies at the International Rescue committee and welcome to DW and what sort of difference do you think uh this announcement will make thanks for having me it remains to be seen in short uh we've heard this before that there'll be an increase in Aid coming in and over the last few days we have seen a slight uptick but it's gone from a trickle to a small flow it's nowhere near the scale of humanitarian Aid the more than one million people that are now on the doorstep of famine urgently require and it's not just the trucks getting in it's the safety environment inside the Gaza Strip and the permissions that Israel have to provide Aid organizations and the UN to be able to move around to transfer and to distribute the aid they're sorely lacking right now at the moment the uh the the deaths uh last week of those um Aid workers uh that has that has has damaged your your faith in um assurances from the IDF the attack on world Central Kitchen was a tragedy but it's not the only attack on Aid organizations the IRC and map UK's compound was was bombed in January as have many other organizations so the the trust in the deconfliction system has been shaken many many times and it's not just that it's the day-to-day requesting permissions and then being denied even though the needs are massive last week Israel also announced that it would open the BET hanon Crossing in the north of Gaza and today we have the IDF saying a new Crossing will open in the north so is it your understanding that there should soon be two Aid Crossings into the north of Gaza I was just in Gaza I just returned last night spent three days on the ground talking to Partners in the United Nations what I heard there while I wasn't permitted to go to the north was that there is only one under consideration it's a newer Crossing uh further to the West than Ares so none of them are open right now we'll have to see in the coming days and what did you see when you were in uh Southern Gaza I saw the great destruction that we've all seen on the news that was a given the the level of Destruction is severe but what I also saw was a massive population that has been displaced from the north to the South with multiple displacements along the way now Sheltering in Rafer in the southern city which pre-war was 300,000 people population and it's now close to 1.5 that the burden on that small town with so many people now Sheltering trying to get away from the violence from the incessant and indiscriminate bombing is evident there are tents everywhere there is no open land in the whole town as people have flooded in there's not enough Aid even flowing there never mind the rest of the Gaza Strip so the situation is is desperate as has been confirmed today by the US government that famine is now a thing in the north it's a risk across the whole strip so the situation really is desperate and I saw that firsthand so even if Aid is delivered at the rate promised uh by the IDF spokesperson um that's still not going to be enough I don't think we've heard the scale that they're promising and we've definitely not seen it 500 uh trucks I'm told so up to 500 trucks trucks equals just about the number of trucks that were going in pre- Conflict what we've seen between then and now though is a complete destruction of much of the infrastructure the total displacement of of a large portion of the population and the the total annihilation of any food security so to say to we're going to get back to pre-conflict levels is woefully inadequate we have to double triple quadruple that level to catch back up to help people recover and and for that to even be feasible there needs to be a ceasefire we can't help people stabilize put back on weight move away from famine if they're terrified every day and night of ongoing attacks which continue I was working up on Tuesday Morning by uh uh missiles being fired from battleships offshore onto Rafa it it's incessant all the time thank you for joining us and uh painting such a vivid picture Bob kitchen from the International Rescue
