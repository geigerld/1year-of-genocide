Hamas says Israeli air strikes have killed two more hostages the group was holding in Gaza the islamist militia says negotiations to free the captives are being undermined by Israeli plans for a ground assault on Rafa gaza's Southernmost city is Sheltering more than a million displaced Palestinians but Israel says it's also a refuge for Hamas Fighters many countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization these displaced Palestinians are looking for help from the other side of the border from Rafa as they praise for a threatened ground offensive from the Israeli military today I'm here displaced on the border with Egypt I have a tent on this area we ask God that our Egyptian brother can facilitate the delivery of Aid to the displaced people the situation is catastropic over a million displaced people are living living in gaza's Southernmost city many of them in makeshift tents is defense Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his military is working on an evacuation plan for Palestinians to leave the area we're going to do it we're going to get the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions in Rafa which is the last Bastion but we're going to do it and in this I agree with the Americans uh we're going to do it while providing safe passage for the uh civilian population so they can leave the UN EU and eight groups have already warned that the military operation in overcrowded Rafa would have catastrophic consequences for displaced Palestinians it's unclear where they are supposed to go next journalist Sammy sule joins me from Jerusalem Sammy an offensive interfa could mean High civilian casualties so give us a deeper sense of why Israelis believe a push there is is so crucial yeah indeed it will be very uh bloody and I can tell you that natany himself has said that if Israel will not enter Rafa then there will be no Victory so the whole outcome of the war depends on the capturing of Rafa um rafah is the last stronghold of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and once Israel will take over Rafa it will be able to say that it has destroyed the chain of command all the different battalions of Hamas there are four remaining battalions according to the Israeli military inside Gaza on top of that it's the border between Gaza and Egypt and Israel is claiming that there are still tunnels that link the Gaza Strip with Egypt and therefore it needs to take over this area so is to destroy any kind of tunnel that would give any Lifeline to Hamas uh so these are the kind of main issues that Israel is talking about the importance of RA so as far as the IDF is concerned it is an imperative um Israel's closest Partners have expressed serious concern as you well know but none of that appears to be shaking Israel's resolve what's the sense about how far Netanyahu is willing to distance himself from Israel's allies I think if you look at netanyahu's history his relations with the United States his relations with the Europeans he's used to being in this position in which there is deep disagree agreement on various issues if we take the example of the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank Israel has been building settlements the United States Administration has been condemning these settlements and yet this project has been growing so clearly the administration doesn't view I I the situation in Gaza the same way that Israel views it but nevertheless Israelis most of them are not too concerned with America they're saying that so long that the Americans will be sending in the Munitions uh this kind of rhetoric that we hear from the Americans is not going to change the battlefield and they're reminding that U the secretary of state was here in November he said that the war would last for a few more weeks and here we are already in February and the war is going on so it seems that some of these statements at least coming from the Americans are for internal consumption for the Democrats who are not pleased with the way the war is going right Sammy this weekend families have been calling for the government to make a deal to bring the hostages back safely and then there are protests calling for the government to step down at this stage in the conflict is nety who still losing support among ordinary Israelis yeah well he has lost a lot of support um following the 7th of October Fiasco and most of the public thinks that he should not be uh the Prime Minister and uh it's it's clear now that he's not putting the hostages as a top priority today he gave a speech talking in a military base of the uh engineer corpse and he did not even mention as the as one of the goals of the war the hostages the release of the hostages so it's very clear that the families of their hostages and their supporters they're very very frustrated uh with the Netanyahu because they believe that uh they will not come back alive and is Samy CLE in Jerusalem many thanks
