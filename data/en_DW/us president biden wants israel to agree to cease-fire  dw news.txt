as Muslims around the world celebrate the end of the Holy fasting month of Ramadan Palestinians in Gaza are marking Eid under the shadow of war the Hamas run Health Ministry says at least 14 people were killed and dozens injured by Israeli strikes on the eve of the holiday Eid is usually characterized by joyous celebrations but this year most of gaza's population are displaced from their homes and facing critical shortages of food and other essential supplies though markets were selling festive food and clothing ahead of Eid much of it was highly inflated in price in an interview with Spanish language TV network Univision US President Joe Biden said he doesn't agree with the approach taken by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza calling for an immediate halt in fighting to allow for significant Food Supplies to get in what I'm calling for is for the Israeli to just call for ceasefire allow for the next 68 weeks Total Access to all food and Medicine going into the country I've spoken with everyone from the Saudis to the jordanians to the Egyptians they're prepared to move in they're prepared to move this food in and I think there's there there's no excuse to not provide for the medical and the and the and the and the food needs of those people they should be done now hea TV the country director of care joins me now from rala hea first up Eid Mubarak uh Eid Al fer is the Feast of breaking the fast uh tell me how are Palestinians in Gaza able to do that this year good morning Nicole and thank you so much Mubarak for all those who celebrated around the world and especially for the people in Gaza uh unfortunately we always welcome theid with after a very harsh time of uh of or harsh worship that is very diff very strong and uh difficult on on on us as as human beings but now in in Gaza unfortunately while we uh start the day with with special prayers with kids specifically celebrating with new clothes with very simple sweets it is not happening in Gaza the images that you have shown as you mentioned in the report although there are some uh uh Commodities related to to to celebrate it in the market but they are 10 times the prices or 15 times the prices and all of that in the South not even in the north um unfortunately many all of the people that we talk to I don't know anyone in Gaza who did not lose someone of their family and although it's a time for celebration they just wake up and they try to do the prayer but then immediately I just spoke to my colleagues immediately go to secure food water just like the other days and even with more Sorrows thinking and remembering those those that they lost unfortunately he to what extent have this year's celebrations in the Palestinian territories taken on a different meaning since the war broke out everything took a different meaning Dear Nicole since 7th October for us so here in West Bank um comparably we are in safe environment compared to Gaza but none of us even Ramadan it came in a different way our prayers our food on the table wasting food for instance everything all simple practices on daily basis they differed this includes unfortunately the prayers for theid all of our prayers go for the people in Gaza wishing for peace in the coming days hoping that there will not be an invasion land invasion in Rafa hoping for Aid to enter and praying for them to at least be able to be safe over the next period and of course praying for a sustained uh end of war with ceasefire so it's not like the same you feel this uh you feel all of the pain of the people looking at the images of mothers who lost their kids reunion with kids who lost their families to celebrate Eid is something that is so emotional for all of us we just heard US President Joe Biden there saying there is no excuse for Israel oh it's a very very emotional day and time for you I'm I'm very sorry um that message from US President Biden I hope you you had a chance to listen to it he said there was no excuse for Israel to not let Aid into Gaza how important are messages like this one for improving the situation on the ground over the last six months and now we are entering the seventh uh month we are calling for for the aid sustained Aid entry to Gaza the needs are massive and every day that that and go on we see the more needs that are growing including for instance access to food access to fuel access to clothes basic needs in the daily life of gazan people and we have heard even the UN saying the UN specialist saying that Gaza needs to be flooded by Aid and if this happens this will allow only for saving the lives that are at the at the edge of losing we are that that we are at the edge of losing them if this happens this will allow us if sustain with with enabling environment to reach out to distribute the aid in a more systemic organized way that would mean a lot and will literally save the people's lives over the next days and we hope it will happen that was hea TV car's country director in ramala thank you so much thank
