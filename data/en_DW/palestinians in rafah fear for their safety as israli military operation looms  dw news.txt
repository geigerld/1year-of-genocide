international calls are growing for Israel to delay its planned assault on Rafa a top United Nations official has said the attack could lead to a Slaughter with people in Rafa already suffering greatly from Israel's military operation Israel says the push is part of a plan to eliminate Hamas a group considered a terrorist organization by multiple Nations more than a million people have taken shelter in the southern gazen city on the Egyptian border conditions in the region are dire our correspondent has been talking to those seeking Refuge there about what their fears are for what might be coming ahead of a likely escalation in the war between Hamas and Israel akam Ali is worried about what it could mean for the city of Rafa Israel is preparing to launch a full scale ground offensive here it means Akram and his family have to flee again this time to Central Gaza after living in this tent for 40 days I started to unpack the tent as you can see we are heading to the central region because it's not safe here in Rafa at all the important thing is that for many days the Israeli Army has been threatening to enter Rafa we want to go to the central region hoping that some of it is left even though it's not safe there safety is in God's hands anxiety is on the rise for more than a million displaced people here many families have been forced to move their tents from Rafa to other places in search of safety some were also left shaken by Israeli strikes that led to the freeing of two hostages inside a house at the city shabura refugee camp we were in Rafa tal suan they were bombing next to it and many people died so we thought it would be better to go to the seaside otherwise where can we go to Israel where do we go if Israel sweeps Rafa where do we go give us any place we are asking the Hamas government or the human beings in charge of the Gaza Strip to come to us and give us a solution and provide us with shelter we are here of course and not going away as the war continues to disrupt the lives of people like Akram and his family those leaving Rafa hope this latest displacement will be the last one and that peace follows soon well indeed some Palestinians are already leaving Rafa in anticipation of Israel's planned assault I asked journalist kareim El gwari what's being done to assure the safety of those who've been told to evacuate well nothing basically basically they're leaving on individual basis they were not told by Israel which route to take or really where to go there are no until now no plans from for them said that his army should draw up a plan but we don't know yet what this plan is there is talk that they setting up uh 10 cities in the southwest of the Gaza Strip but it's difficult to see how they do this for 1.4 million people that's the size of the city of Munich and also who is conducting this operation of setting up this cities 10 cities and who is paying for it the original idea seems to be that the Americans and the Gulf States are paying for it there's no nothing we hear nothing from the Gulf States about it and also who is conducting the whole operation the UN already said that it doesn't want to be part of any forced eviction of people from Rafa mediators have been trying to broker another ceasefire deal as you know they've been meeting in Cairo uh but I understand those negotiations have been suspended uh what can you tell us Karim well the high level uh negotiations are over and we really don't know the outcome there are conflicting reports there's some reports saying that there was some progress about what we call maybe the exchange rate between Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners saying like how many people Palestinians in Israeli prisons are released for the freeing of the Israeli Hospital of the hostages but they say there's a better understanding now but also something else there is the one of the demands of Hamas that is guarantees for the end of the war before they release all the P all the hostages um there is nothing no report about it there is Israeli media reports saying that actually the Israeli the security establishment Drew up a plan for this negotiations That Was Then rejected by Netanyahu and then he was sent his delegations to Cairo uh only in order to listen and uh to um report back the truth is we don't know much about the substance what is talked about there was no Hamas presence and uh it seems to be like whatever was talked about has to be brought back to Hamas and we know that takes time this is saying that they will continue for three days now further consultations here in Cairo but on a lower level I think they're all waiting for the answer from Hamas and also from Netanyahu now you're in Cairo uh Egypt clearly uh is affected by what's happening in Gaza right next door what is Egypt's role in all of this kareim well Egypt fears of course that there is a mass Palestinian Exodus from Rafa if there is this offensive that's the biggest fear there's a lot of tension between Egypt and Israel Israel is accusing Egypt that weapons were um smuggled from Egypt to Hamas through the Egyptian site it's accusing Egypt to block the eight Egypt says no the reason for the blocking the eight of eight is Israel and of course there's a big concern now in Egypt about this uh upcoming possible offensive the spokesperson of the government said if Nations security issues of U Egypt are somehow uh violated they might be even recall the Ambassador from Israel that is there since the peace treaty of 19 1979 the Camp David peace treaty Kareem thank you very much that was journalist Kareem El guari in
