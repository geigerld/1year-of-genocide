meantime it has been 1 month since the international court of justice ordered Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza the icj gave Israel until today to submit a report showing that it is complying with six separate orders the court did not find that Israel was committing genocide that matter is still under consideration but nevertheless issued six orders meant to make sure genocide does not happen the court says that Israel must quote do everything it can to prevent acts that could fall within the scope of the UN convention on genocide make sure its military does not commit any acts covered by that convention prevent and punish incitement that could encourage genocide enable urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance make sure that any evidence that could point to genocide is not destroyed Israel was ordered to submit a report of its compliance by today let's get more on this we are joined by Professor Shantal Malone she's joining us from Berlin where she is with the European Center for constitutional and human rights and also an international law professor at the University of Milan welcome to the program and thank you so much for joining us today um what exactly is the hearing at the international court of justice in the he about yeah the case that South Africa brought against Israel as you rightly already recalled is about the alleged violation of the convention uh to prevent genocide so we have seen on the 26th of January exactly one month ago the court which I remember is the highest judicial institution at the UN level ordered very precise provisional measures that Israel has to take in order to stop prevent and punish acts of genocide incitement to genocide okay so now it is one yes sorry um I I just want to ask you because I really want to get to what um is supposed to be submitted today because we know that you know previously Israel um uh said that it wanted this case to be thrown out the court came back and said that indeed it did have the jurisdiction to hear this case can we now expect Israel to make this report public that they are due to present today I mean after all it is a confidential report to the icj which will be sent to South Africa for comment will we get any more information well um it's not a hearing what is happening today the report is as you said sent confidentially and I don't think that there are indications that let us think that the report will be available to the broader public there are some precedents the most important in this case is the one regarding in the case of Gambia against Myanmar we have seen Myanmar in 2020 also having to report back to the icj and that report also was confidential but of course there is a possibility that the icj uh in case the judges decide to issue additional provisional measures for instance that can be taken prop Motu by the court or also at request of South Africa which will have access to the Israeli report might in way summarize a bit the content of the report in their order in case but really there are no indications that the state of Israel at the moment is thinking of making the report public to the broader public okay um I'd like to get your legal expertise on on a separate matter as well um because hearings on the legality of almost 60 years of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began a week ago as well at the international court of justice in the ha representatives of 50 states are taking part Israel itself is saying is staying away from those hearings give us a sense of what is going on there yeah that is a very important uh advisory opinion that has been in the making for many years so in a sense it is a coincidence that now we are seeing two cases regarding Israel at the same time in parallel ongoing at the international court of justice in that case is not a state that brought Israel in front of the court it is the general assembly that put a legal question in front of the judges and it is about the legal consequences of a prolonged occupation of the Palestinian territory so basically what is at stake there and we have seen a unprecedented number of states participating in that proceeding the whole past week has been hearings to hear not only from the state of Palestine but also from 55 third states there legal reasonings will be for the court to assess whether what's going on since 57 years in the Palestinian territory can still be assessed as an occupation in case whether this is lawful or unlawful but in the end basically what we are talking about is whether there is a crime of aperti or a situation of aperti ongoing there okay and of course that's a disputed term I'm just very very very very briefly will there be a verdict in in that case and if so when yeah we can expect uh in a few months probably uh according to what has been the practice of the court in other similar cases there will be so a advisory opinion as I said it's not a judgment it is not the same uh procedure as the one that we are seeing South Africa against Israel it will not be formally B but still very relevant Professor Chantal Malone thank you so much for joining us to share share your legal expertise today thank you for having me and I'm joined Now by Michael Becker he was an associate legal officer at the international court of justice from 2010 until 2014 now he's teaching international human rights law at Trinity College Dublin welcome to DW thanks so much for your time today now Israel's report to the icj isn't expected to be made public but do we have any indication what might be in this report right you're exactly correct that these reports are confidential reports and the report will go to the court and then to South Africa for South Africa's response so we may not see this anytime soon if ever but we can predict I think what Israel will try to emphasize in the report but I should say at the start that there have been reports today for example that prime minister Netanyahu has asked for the report to be sparse I think that would be a big mistake for Israel because this is an opportunity for Israel to try to convey to the court uh everything that it thinks thinks it's doing to comply with the order I would expect Israel to focus mainly on what Israel sees as its best efforts to facilitate humanitarian assistance into Gaza now whether the way Israel portrays its efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance would be credible to a broader audience is a different question but I think that that's where the emphasis will be placed in Israel's report okay but if the report isn't made public I mean is anything going to come of this because surely there'll be less public pressure on is to to comply you know if we don't know what's in the report absolutely and that's a good reason why the court should change its practices and uh require that these implementation reports be made public but the the it's really for South Africa here to play the role of having to come back to the court and try to refute what it may see as Israel's incomplete or even potentially misleading narrative about what's going on on the ground so in some ways I actually think it's going to be South Africa's response again a confidential report but South Africa's response rather than Israel's initial report that's more important here because this is an opportunity for South Africa to point out omissions from Israel's report we've heard over the past several weeks reports about Israeli officials directly impeding certain efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance there are also ways in which South Africa can probably point out to the court other things that are within Israel's power to do that for whatever reason Israel has not been doing and so is a chance for South Africa to put these things before the court and it may in fact be the impetus for South Africa now to go back to the court and request new provisional measures or modified provisional measures but measures that would be much more specific much more pric than the types of quite broadly worded measures that the court um imposed a month ago okay now there are several organizations the UN Amnesty International Etc they've all called on Israel to comply with the icj's orders um what happens if it doesn't do anything briefly if you could well we're we're in a a situation where the courts powers of enforcement are very limited it's not really the Court's job to enforce its own decisions This falls on the International Community so we've already seen the fact that the provisional measures from last month have put enormous pressure on Israel and that pressure is coming from other countries including some of Israel's strongest supporters so I think that this process simply feeds into that broader uh political Dynamic with States including the United States putting pressure on Israel to change its course to find a way towards a ceasefire find a way to resolve the hostages crisis and very importantly find a way to deal with the humanitarian crisis that appears to only be getting worse Michael Becka from Trinity College Dublin thank you so much for your time today we appreciate it thank
