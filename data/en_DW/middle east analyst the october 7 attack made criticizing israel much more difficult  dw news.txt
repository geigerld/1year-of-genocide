We Begin the day with the biggest Hospital in Gaza on the verge of flatlining Israel's war against Hamas has entered its sixth week and hospitals inside Gaza are now on the front lines unprecedented Israeli rocket attacks forced tens of thousands to flee their homes with nowhere to go many are Sheltering inside hospitals and that includes the alifa hospital the largest inside the Gaza Strip doctors have described the situation inside as catastrophic with no power patients are reportedly dying surgery is taking place under the light of cell phones outside Israel says that its soldiers have reached the gates of alifa we have more in this report stitching up a head wound by the light of a mobile phone doctors in hospitals in Northern Gaza are struggling to save patients here too at the alifa hospital they're running out of fuel water and medical supplies and a vulnerable to the ongoing Israeli air strikes in the area Hospital under under fires the last example is chifa Hospital ICU there is another Private obstetric Hospital was targeted directly today and two of our colleague who are specialist in obstetric and Gynecology were killed to tonight there is no service for Pediatric patients in the Northern Area Israel denies targeting civilians and says that this footage is proof that its military provided the alifa hospital with 300 L of fuel for its generators but that it was rejected by Hamas we offered actually uh last night to give them enough fuel to operate the hospital operate the incubators and so on because we have we have obviously no battle with patients or with civilians at all uh and I think every civilian death every dead baby is a tragedy but that tragedy should be placed squarely at the responsibility of Hamas that is keeping its military installations inside hospitals its command posts inside hospitals inside schools inside unra un facilities and so on the director of alifa has denied rejecting the fuel which he says would not have been enough to power the hospital's generators for even 1 hour the worsening situation in Northern Gaza is forcing thousands to flee southwards mostly on foot even some health workers have made the decision to leave the situation last night was very tense very extreme the bombing targeted schools and hospitals I work for the office of the Ministry of Health at the hospital yesterday the Israeli Army bombed the hospital where I work that's why today I did not go to work or fulfill my duties fled tens of thousands have already fled the ongoing missile strikes in ground operation Israel is coming under increasing International pressure to minimize civilian suffering in Gaza so what is happening inside alifa hospital tonight to find out I spoke by phone with the head of surgery at Aliva Dr Maran abusada yes it is inside the hospital no one can get outside or income inside especially using the ambulances no ambulances getting from the shifa or coming to the shifa hospital we are in total stage in MO in most of the building no electricity no fuel no water for even personal use or no uh no food also and we are having here in this hospital now around 600 injured people who are located distributed in the H of the department plus to that we having now who are temporary plac from thereal IC unit we are having babies 36 babies are alive and they are blessed in not in a good atmosphere they are blessed in one on the main surgical theater we have to treat them because the Israeli why we moved from the Nal unit because the Israeli bombarded the oxygen generator and due to lack of oxygen and loss of oxygen we lost the three lives of this babies and also if we would like to run this generators and oxygen we need to maintain first of all and secondly we need the fuel to run the generators there and also in addition to that we have resident in in the kidney dialysis unit patients who are having kid in their stage renal failure and they have to put them on the machine for uh kidney dialysis unfortunately for the third day we could not succeed to run the machine because we need electricity and we need a disolated water and we cannot do this in Shas that was Dr Marwan abusada there head of surgery at alifa hospital speaking with me earlier well I'm joined now by the Middle East analyst Nathan thr Mr th is a former director of the Arab Israeli project at the international crisis group he's also the author of numerous books on the Israeli Palestinian conflict including his latest which is called a day in the life of Abid Sal anatomy of a Jerusalem tragedy Mr Thor it's good to have you with us tonight your book it starts with a traffic accident a Palestinian School Bus overturns children are killed and and from there you describe the tragedy that is the Israelis and the Palestinians and their conflict what goes through your mind when when you see the images of these hospitals in Gaza now places of healing that are now places of of suffering and death you know I've I've never uh felt this much despair over the future of Israel Palestine um this is on a scale that we have not seen before and um it is a horrific tragedy I mean the the amount of uh death the amount of Civilian death um 74% of those killed in Gaza now are women children and the elderly and um we need to find a way to stop this immediately I want to let our viewers know you are a Jewish American you've lived in the US you you now live in Jerusalem um October 7th the the terror attacks of that day um did they change your perception of where it is that you live right now absolutely I mean uh you know I think the the consequences of October 7th and this War uh for both societies cannot be overstated the there this is going to be a a decades long effect uh of this war on on both societies and for the first time in my life you know I can imagine um civil on civil uh conflict I can imagine this uh spreading easily to the West Bank uh it's already we have a huge surge of of violence of settler violence in the West Bank over a thousand Palestinians have been displaced uh just since October 7th um what what we're seeing right now is really uh something we have never seen before in Israel Palestine and what you what you're describing there what you fear could happen that that would be a a a victory for Hamas wouldn't it the leaders of Hamas have said that one goal of the October 7th Terror attacks was to create a permanent state of War for Israel yes I mean the the victory for Hamas will be first of all if they receive a massive prisoner exchange as many Israelis are are contemplating uh doing right now that will have been um a political victory that no other Palestinian political party will have achieved the issue of uh Palestinian prisoners is something that touches every Palestinian family even if they don't have a member of the extended family in jail now every extended family has had uh members in jail uh we're talking about you know 40% of the adult male population that's been imprisoned at one time and so uh that would be the the first victory for Hamas and the second victory victory for Hamas will simply to be to survive uh this war and remain in place Israel is vowing that that won't be the case I don't know any serious military analyst who really believes that uh Hamas will be eradicated by this war so what we're looking at in one way or another is a situation that Israel ends this conflict very far short of its uh goals Hamas uh remains in place and we uh the world remain living with a situation of uh deep Injustice where 7 million Palestinians 7 million Jews are all living under Israeli Rule and the vast majority of those Palestinians are living without basic civil rights and that's a situation that has to be addressed uh when we're thinking about the day after ending the immediate Bloodshed in Gaza what would you say that the the terror attack on October 7th what did it due to the ability to criticize the Israeli government it its policies its leaders without being accused of being anti-semitic I mean it's made it much more uh difficult in the west uh and even in inside of uh Israel you've seen Israeli journalists you've seen Palestinian citizens of Israel uh whose uh Speech has been curtailed and uh and of course in in Europe and uh the us we see all kinds of uh voices being silenced um and and the main tool to silence them is the accusation of anti-Semitism um for years uh pro-israel Advocates have used a a totally illegitimate uh definition of anti-semitism that includes things like uh stating that the the state of Israel uh is racist and you know the way that race is used these days it's not the 19th century version of uh you know four different archetypes of of humanity that race is used broadly in international law to include any kind of ethnic or religious or or racial or other discrimination and and that kind of discrimination plainly is practiced uh by the state of Israel but you're not allowed to say that without falling uh in violation of the so-called IH definition of anti-semitism which is the international holoc cost remembrance association's uh definition and that definition has been spread across Europe and the United States and made it very very difficult to speak honestly uh about what Israel is doing against Palestinians uh the fact that it is a form of ethnic domination that is at its core discriminatory and uh and this comes at the expense of the real battle against uh anti-Semitism which is coming largely from uh right-wing racists not those who are trying to defend uh against regimes of ethnic domination the Jewish German American Author Deborah Feldman she lives here in Germany she wrote a guest commentary piece that was in today's Guardian newspaper and in that she writes that the German government's unconditional support for Israel allows it to ignore the way dissenting Jews in Germany are being thrown under the bus as they are in Israel I mean do you agree with her are you would you be thrown under the bus um in Israel by saying what you're saying to us um in public there well I mean you we don't need to go to hypotheticals we can see that um Palestinian citizens of Israel were arrested just a few days ago in including former members of uh the knesset the parliament uh for holding a peaceful attempting to hold a peaceful demonstration against uh calling for a ceasefire in Gaza um and we see that you know know an ultra Orthodox Jewish uh journalist Israel fry was attacked at his home uh merely for reciting a prayer for the dead in Gaza the innocent dead in Gaza so um it is it is an environment of extreme hostility and there is a great deal of desire for vengeance which uh is being echoed by Israeli leaders such as the President of Israel who said that there are no Innocents in Gaza that the entire population of Gaza should be held responsible for October 7th uh which is clearly setting the stage for the collective punishment uh and death of thousands of Innocents let me ask you before we run out of time um just get your thoughts on what we we are seeing now across Europe and in the United States um last weekend there were some 300,000 people at a pro Palestine prop Palestinian March in London it was the largest such demonstration we've seen since this conflict broke out but there were also Hamas bandanas being worn there were signs reading um no UK politician should be a friend of Israel and there were also reports of people chanting from The River To The Sea um what do you say about that um there there's there's real fear that what is happening where you are is being exported to Europe and the US in in the form of militant um islamist goals of violence there as well what what do you say about that so I I think we need to uh disentangle a few of the different things that were mentioned at this protest the the chant uh uh first of all no UK politician should support the state of Israel or whatever that slogan said uh there's nothing anti-semitic about that I mean there are many people who don't have a racist bone in their body don't have an anti-Semitic bone in their body who don't want their government supporting a decades system of ethnic Domination by the state of Israel that's there's nothing anti-semitic whatsoever about that and and similarly you know this the the slogan from uh from The River To The Sea I mean many many many Palestinians who support equal rights for all between the river and the Sea chant this slogan and and they don't have any kind of extermination idea behind it they have no desire to see the Jews even uh leave to Europe they just want to have equality so um I think that there is a very very broad but brush being painted right now against anyone standing in solidarity uh with Palestinians and of course yes if there were uh Hamas uh posters that's that's something uh different but I I think as you can see from the images you're displaying on this program those are not uh very prominent as far as I can see author Nathan thw we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us and we hope to talk with you again thank you thank
