would think that the US is able to do it
 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.830 align:start position:0%

GMS<00:06:38.759><c> yeah</c><00:06:38.919><c> look</c><00:06:39.080><c> there's</c><00:06:39.199><c> a</c><00:06:39.319><c> lot</c><00:06:39.400><c> of</c><00:06:39.520><c> factors</c>

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
GMS yeah look there's a lot of factors
 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.309 align:start position:0%
GMS yeah look there's a lot of factors
at<00:06:40.039><c> play</c><00:06:40.360><c> here</c><00:06:40.880><c> um</c><00:06:41.199><c> whether</c><00:06:41.759><c> certainly</c><00:06:42.199><c> the</c>

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
at play here um whether certainly the
 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.710 align:start position:0%
at play here um whether certainly the

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
ship in a maritime Corridor like this um
 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
ship in a maritime Corridor like this um
the<00:06:47.599><c> the</c><00:06:47.759><c> transit</c><00:06:48.280><c> itself</c><00:06:48.720><c> is</c><00:06:48.960><c> about</c><00:06:49.319><c> 60</c><00:06:49.840><c> hours</c>

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
the the transit itself is about 60 hours
 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
the the transit itself is about 60 hours
so<00:06:51.199><c> we</c><00:06:51.360><c> are</c><00:06:51.599><c> looking</c><00:06:52.199><c> to</c><00:06:53.199><c> um</c><00:06:53.440><c> leave</c><00:06:53.720><c> port</c><00:06:54.120><c> as</c>

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
so we are looking to um leave port as
 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.110 align:start position:0%
so we are looking to um leave port as
soon<00:06:54.400><c> as</c><00:06:54.639><c> possible</c><00:06:55.639><c> and</c><00:06:55.840><c> to</c><00:06:56.080><c> have</c><00:06:56.319><c> the</c><00:06:56.560><c> steady</c>

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.390 align:start position:0%
flowing from Cyprus to
Gaza<00:07:02.440><c> um</c><00:07:02.840><c> but</c><00:07:03.080><c> we</c><00:07:03.240><c> are</c><00:07:03.720><c> very</c><00:07:03.919><c> much</c><00:07:04.120><c> at</c><00:07:04.280><c> the</c>

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
Gaza um but we are very much at the
 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
Gaza um but we are very much at the

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
mercy of the weather at this point um we
 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.309 align:start position:0%
mercy of the weather at this point um we
have<00:07:07.960><c> you</c><00:07:08.080><c> know</c><00:07:08.240><c> the</c><00:07:08.319><c> food</c><00:07:08.560><c> is</c><00:07:08.720><c> loaded</c><00:07:09.160><c> we</c>

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
have you know the food is loaded we
 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
have you know the food is loaded we
actually<00:07:09.560><c> just</c><00:07:09.720><c> finished</c><00:07:10.080><c> loading</c><00:07:10.400><c> it</c><00:07:10.599><c> today</c>

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
actually just finished loading it today
 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.029 align:start position:0%
actually just finished loading it today
so<00:07:11.879><c> as</c><00:07:12.000><c> soon</c><00:07:12.199><c> as</c><00:07:12.360><c> we</c><00:07:12.479><c> are</c><00:07:12.639><c> able</c><00:07:12.919><c> to</c><00:07:13.280><c> leave</c><00:07:13.639><c> port</c>

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we are able to leave port
 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.110 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we are able to leave port
we<00:07:14.160><c> will</c><00:07:14.319><c> do</c><00:07:14.800><c> so</c><00:07:15.800><c> so</c><00:07:16.160><c> leaving</c><00:07:16.520><c> Port</c><00:07:16.800><c> is</c><00:07:16.960><c> one</c>

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
we will do so so leaving Port is one
 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.790 align:start position:0%
we will do so so leaving Port is one
thing<00:07:17.360><c> then</c><00:07:17.479><c> there's</c><00:07:17.720><c> the</c><00:07:17.840><c> transport</c><00:07:18.319><c> of</c><00:07:18.479><c> 60</c>

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
thing then there's the transport of 60
 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
thing then there's the transport of 60
hours<00:07:19.199><c> as</c><00:07:19.319><c> you</c><00:07:19.479><c> say</c><00:07:20.199><c> how</c><00:07:20.360><c> will</c><00:07:20.560><c> the</c><00:07:20.680><c> aid</c><00:07:21.080><c> safely</c>

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
