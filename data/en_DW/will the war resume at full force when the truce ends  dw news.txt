with less than a day now before an extended truce deal between Israel and Hamas militants Runs Out Qatari mediators are trying to get negotiators from both sides to agree to a more lasting ceasefire Arrangement meanwhile a new group of 12 Israeli hostages was released by Hamas on Tuesday another night of Israel and hamas's Truce brought another series of homecomings two Tha Nationals and 10 Israelis made up the fifth group of hostages to be freed among them a mother her teenage daughter and their family dog Balor cradled by her owner every step of the journey back to Israel young people were welcomed home in the occupied West Bank too with 30 Palestinians returned to loved ones after being released from Israeli prisons it's Indescribable freedom is the most beautiful feeling in the world from the moment a prisoner is deprived of their freedom they await the day they will regain it although this Freedom today is partial and incomplete it will be complete when our homeland is liberated and all of our prisoners are free hope of freeing more prisoners and more hostages hinges on extending the current poon fighting between Israel and Hamas which is deemed a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States around 160 hostages are still being held in Gaza and thousands of Palestinians are detained in Israeli prisons only a truce could lead to the release of people held in captivity and avoid further Regional escalation this truth must turn into a permanent ceasefire Israel and Hamas accused each other of fighting flareups on Tuesday mediator Qatar said the breaches did not harm the agreement Qatar is again facilitating talks around extending the fragile truce which is now in its last day and that truce has been in place for six days I asked our correspondent Ben fulin injured Jerusalem if there are any indications that the ceasefire could be extended well Gart Egyptian officials are saying it would be highly likely and is highly likely that we'll receive some sort of announcement as to the extension today uh there's been a lot of back and forth uh high level talks uh in the region overnight and this morning and all day uh otherwise this deal will expire as you said in less than a day a former US ambassador to Israel wrote interesting L enough that the pressure and incentives for both sides to keep trading these hostages for Palestinian prisoners is much stronger than the incentive to go back to war of course Israel's ultimate goal is to dismantle Hamas but that's becoming less and less likely analysts saying that the destruction in the north hasn't been enough uh that uh to uh break this uh militant group that it's still intact it's still able to uh carry out complex negotiations keep the fire uh going among various militant groups it's not the only one operating in Gaza and holding these hostages and also the Smooth release of these hostages G now despite the truths the Israeli Army has now announced that a so-called anti-terror operation is underway in Janine in the West Bank what more can you tell us about that Palestinian Health officials have reported the deaths of an 8-year-old and 15-year-old from shots fired by Israeli troops uh the Israeli military is investigating that it had previously announced that it had launched this operation in Denine in the uh Northern West Bank considered a stronghold of Palestinian militants we've seen videos overnight in this morning of bulldozers destroying electricity and infrastructure uh of these two boys uh according to these videos that were released being shot and uh also scuffles and intense fighting um it's hasn't yet been uh confirmed but we've also heard reports of hospitals being surrounded and cut off ambulances being uh held back from delivering patients and more deaths resulting uh there've been uh raids throughout the West Bank almost every day of this war with more than 200 Palestinians killed in confrontations with troops the's Ben fulan there reporting from Jerusalem thank you Ben now Israel has made clear that the current truce in Gaza is temporary and attention is turning to its military's next move during a trip to Gaza to the Gaza Strip on Sunday prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue his mission until achieving Victory his visit to the strip was the first by Israeli Premier since 2005 it followed statements by the Israel Defense Force suggesting that the next part of their offensive could include a ground operation in southern Gaza Israeli troops are currently concentrated in the north where they have surrounded Gaza City a push into the South could follow cramming gaza's displaced population into an even smaller space the bombings have stopped but the search for safety hasn't these displaced palestin Ians are taking advantage of the PO and fighting to walk south from Central Gaza but safety isn't guaranteed there either a day before the truce took effect a deadly air strike hit can yunas sending residents fleeing in panic it wasn't the first time Gaza South was hit and Israel has alluded that it may expand its ground operation to this part of the territory we are determined to continue advancing this will happen wherever Hamas is and Hamas is also in southern Gaza on November 16th the Israeli military distributed leaflets to residents of K Yunis warning them to move out of the line of fire a woman shows them on a mobile phone in the beginning they drop leaflets telling people in the north to leave and go to the safe places in the South but the occupation can't be trusted today they're telling the people in the South to evacuate and go to other places the UN estimates that some 1.7 million people have been displaced by the fighting that's about 80% of gaza's population the foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority says that when the truce ends deaths could double the concentration of the Palestinian population has doubled all are concentrated in the south of the Gaza STP two million of them in half of the territory of the Gaza STP any Israel attack instead of killing one child we'll kill two in canun and elsewhere the question on many people's lips is where should we go now Israel has in the past suggested here in October officials spoke about the establishment of a safe Zone in maazi a town in a Sandy area on the Mediterranean Coast that's just a few square kilometers in size a recipe for disaster says the World Health Organization attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink and maazi is already stretched these pictures show a un shelter in the town on November 19th families cramming into ramshackle tents to guard against the heavy rain we thought there'd be safety in moazi but there's no safety if Israel's next step is indeed to go south and maazi is no option it's unclear where else gaza's displaced civilians can go neighboring Egypt has so far refused to take large amounts of people in now people living in Gaza have been trying to make the most of the short truce between Israel and the militant group Hamas that includes a youth group that's been holding activities to entertain displaced children and help take their minds of the war enjoying a singalong and some rest bite from a war that's left these children displaced they've been brought together by a Palestinian youth group at a school in K Unis a city in the south of the Strip we are so happy we were very scared because of the war as soon as the organizers arrived we all run towards them they played some songs for us and we danced and sank and played games we had so much fun today the majority of the children suffer from the fear of bombings and the war and our role here is to ensure that they deserve to be happy just like children all around the world they also have the right to express themselves during this destruction they deserve to play and be happy but outside the school there's no escaping the destruction one of the only ways to travel now is by Donkey and cart as people use the truce between Israel and Hamas to see what's left of their lives unfortunately our houses were destroyed struck by air strikes the situation is unfortunate life is so hard we hope to God that life will get back to what it was before the war we hope there won't be more war aid organizations are also using the Poes in fighting to deliver food water and fuel into Gaza after weeks of shortages back at the schooling KH Unice and these children have been making the most of the Peace I'm so happy with the games and with this truth there is no war and hopefully the truce continues but it looks like that truth will be shortlived and these children will soon be back in a war zone let's talk about Israel's next steps with liutenant Colonel Peter Lerner is is a spokesperson for the Israeli uh military um Colonel if no extension is agreed of the ceasefire that is will we see the war resume full force tomorrow morning and will it move to the South so what we need to take into consideration is we are operating currently on a day-to-day basis um our primary goal currently is to bring home the hostages to rescue the hostages and that is why we are holding our fire we are maintaining our defensive positions in Northern Gaza Strip indeed in uh preparing our offensive plan for the next stages uh but we are currently holding our fire in order to bring home the hostages that were abducted um by Hamas on the 7th of October from our perspective uh we have to be uh ready for the engagement of Hamas wherever they are hiding indeed we have still not completed our efforts in Northern Gaza Strip uh but we've noticed and we have seen that Hamas over the last few days have also continued to operate in the South so there is a a huge challenge here from our perspective we are making the necessary preparations but we are currently focused on bringing the hostages home but you're saying that the south of Gaza is not off limits for you but you've told the civilian population from the north to seek shelter there how does that go together what I'm saying is that we are currently focused on rescuing the hostages hostages that were abducted from on the 7th of October by Hamas and taken to all different types of locations in the Gaza Strip and so we are currently focused on bringing them home and making sure that they get home and in the meantime taking our taking the time in order to be prepared for operations in order to defend our positions where they are yesterday Hamas engaged and detonated three explosive devices against IDF forces in the north and indeed there is still a a extensive Hamas presence operating in Northern Gaza Strip we have still not completed our mission there we will take the war to Hamas wherever they are hiding in order to achieve our goal Hamas needs to be dismantled Hamas is holding Israel's H hostage is holding foreign National hostage it's also holding the people of Gaza hostage now the US have warned that a different type of military campaign is needed for a densely populated area like the Gaza Strip could you not take that into account or is pushing with full force into the south of Gaza uh an option indeed we have very attentive to our ally allies and what they are telling us especially the us but also the UK and the Germans and and and we are very attentive to those considerations and of course we will operate in a way that is in accordance to International humanitarian law the laws of armed conflict in order to distinguish between combatants and civilians in order to disting distinguish between those that are perpetrating Terror in order to distinguish between those that conducted the ruthless merciless attack on on the 7th of October and the distinguish between them and the civilians indeed it is a huge challenge for any military operating in an urban environment we've seen where Hamas is operating from from inside hospitals from adjacent to un facilities from inside schools from inside mosques there is nothing that they will not abuse and this is the challenge that we are facing so you say you're differentiating but a bomb drop from an um from an airplane is not very good at differentiating between combatants and civilians is it bomb is not dropped sir a bomb is targeting a specific location with a specific Target in mind uh this is the reality of modern-day Warfare when a terrorist organization hides in a urban center hides abuses the urban Arena hides and intentionally puts the civilians at risk what we are doing especially for instance when we're calling people to evacuate a spe specific area is calling on them to evacuate for their own well-being in order to get them out of Harm's Way while Hamas is intentionally operating in order to keep them In Harm's Way that is the difference between us and them now let's turn to the hostages that have been released what have you learned from them uh with regard to the conditions they've been kept in and also about Hamas itself we are seeing and up to date up till today we have of course experienced a huge sense of concern every single day Israelis are glued to the television's watching seeing um in a state of anxiety and concern of who is going to be released today in the last 6 days 81 Israelis and foreign Nationals have been released uh 61 Israelis uh women and children um 20 foreign Nationals mostly Thai uh Nationals but also Filipinos um and indeed we are learning both of the conditions the dire conditions the state constant state of fear of uh threat of violence that was surrounded by them by their Hamas captors um so indeed we are learning and we are hearing some very very heartbreaking stories about the terms that they were being kept um this is this is how Hamas operates you know we are very concerned for the remaining hostages that are currently being held by Hamas uh they need to come home we've demanded that the international Committee of the cross have access to them in order to assess their well-being it is Hamas that are responsible for the well-being that's an point you say it's Hamas and we're joined Now by TK yarich uh spokesperson for the World Health Organization in Geneva Mr yarich thank you so much for your time your organization has said that more people in Gaza could be uh more at risk of dying from disease than from bombs can you tell us how serious is the threat to People's Health Health in Gaza right now well the threat is very serious right now because what we have is a 1.8 million people in Gaza who had to leave their home many of them are in a overcrowded shelters uh and uh with temperatures uh dropping down and with a lack of access to clean water uh and lack of Sanitation obviously that all elements increase the risk of rest respiratory diseases of waterbor diseases of skin diseases we had teams in Gaza last week and uh uh they they said that for example uh in these shelters there is a one shower for 4,000 people there is a one toilet for more than 200 people so in these conditions on top of people who already have chronic conditions uh diabetes hypertension people who need uh their medicines and they cannot access so all these elements uh will likely increase uh mortality and then uh if there are military operations resuming that will lead to more uh to more loss of lives for sure you've made very clear the The Unbelievable challenges being faced by people there the overcrowding in hospitals the shelters that are full the lack of clean water to what extent is your staff even able to detect any serious disease outbreaks let alone prevent them I mean what can be done in a situation like this well the the surveillance system disease surveillance system uh has been functioning in Gaza before the conflict now obviously with people on the Move uh with many Health Centers two3 of health centers are not functioning anymore two3 of hospitals uh are not functioning or just functioning in a limited way obviously there is a challenges to to this disease surveillance uh we are working uh with with the UN agency uh for for Palestinians with the Palestinian red Cresent and with the Ministry of Health in Gaza to try to get a get a picture but again what we really need is full access for humanitarian Aid including medical supplies as we have just heard uh from uh from your correspondent uh what we also need really is is this uh this temporary truce to become a ceasefire because as long as As as there is a uh military operation going on uh uh there will be more Devastation uh and more more suffering so the the the peace is really the only solution uh to bring back the health services to everyone are some of the the injured and the sick still being transported to uh Egypt to get care there well there there have been a a number of patients that have been uh uh transferred to to Egypt uh our teams helped uh transfer patients from hospitals in North Gaza that that were unable to continue to provide services to hospitals in in south of Gaza but those hospitals are already full and again with the number of injuries and with the with the number of people who uh need medical care there are 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza and they need uh access to uh to to health services so all these people really rely on hospitals working so it's it's not about uh uh uh uh getting out uh some people it's really trying to make sure that hospitals that exist are repaired and are stuffed and equipped to provide those services to everyone who needs can I ask you what preparations your staff are making what will be possible if this truce is not extended again well what we will see we will see more destruction we will see more casualties we will see more suffering and and and really humanly it's difficult to to to to to to accept that what we can do as a humanitarians is really calling on everyone to to stop this uh and what we can do a little bit is that uh uh we bring medical supplies to Egypt and then when we are allowed to get it in uh but we we may bring as as much supplies as we want if if if there is no peace uh uh the the the the life uh the lives will continue to be lost t with the World Health Organization in Geneva thank you so much for your time today thank you Asha benera is the Haru chair for the study of child maltreatment and joins us now from Jerusalem uh welcome to DW really appreciate your time today it's been 5 days now since the first hostages were released what what do we know about what Emily who we just saw and and the others uh went through and and and how they were treated well we know that they went for hell basically and different H it wasn't the same for everybody some of them were kept together with the parents and they went for hell and some of them were kept alone and we went through hell and some were kept with their friends or other child kids and still went for through H it was different for the experience was different for different kids uh the traum is slightly different for different kids but the major component of the trauma was the same for everybody that's the total lot of control over their life and be it a child or an adult when you lose control over your life then you are in trauma and in major to can you tell us um a little bit more specifically about how this kind of trauma that you're describing how it affects children and their behavior especially as you just said said some didn't have a parent by their side yes well it it affects them in in different aspects first of all in the way they talk they're afraid to talk some of them they whisper I think Emily's father said in the one of the news interviews that he couldn't hear her he had to put his ear by her mouth because she was trained in 53 days or 52 days to speak very silently or to whisper so that's one aspect and that's a physic aspect the other aspect is that even if in the first day they walk and they laugh and they run then in the week after and the weeks after things are starting to surface and then kids could wake up some of them are waking up at night with nightmare some of them are waking up and shouting some of them are doing other things that they stop doing like whatever could I don't want to go into private specific examples right now the release of of these hostages has understandably created a lot of media interest but is enough being done at the moment to protect the children um and ensure that they can recover in a in a protected and safe environment yes I think that there is one thing needs to be said that the Israeli government in the particular case of the kidnapped children and the kidnapped citizen has done a very good job in preparing for their coming back home we were approached by the Ministry of Social Services two or three days after the massacre of October 7 and we've been working on developing a protocol on how to treat our children for at least three weeks and the protocol was approved and ready two or three weeks before they came back so we we are prepared does it mean that all of them will ER flourish and won't develop a post-traumatic stress syndrome no does it mean that all of them will develop a post-traumatic stress syndrome definitely not most of them and hopefully all of them will go for the trauma period will flourish and survive and even if they will have a scull or in the metal scar forever they will have a very good life in the future so just to ask you more specifically about these preparations that have been made I mean presumably you know the the first thing is just love and hugs from their family but but what specifically what what kind of professional support are you talking about providing these children with now okay I will tell you first of all that some of the some of the things are not so evident for example we passed in the protocol it's written that nobody would tell the kids what happened with their parents until they will meet a family member and a professional because the first people they meet Are Soldiers or other people you know who are doing administrative job of get receiving them from the Egyptians and moving them to Israel and so on and we made sure that nobody who is not qualified for won't be the barer of bad news some of the kids came and they didn't know that their mother was murdered in October 7th so that's one thing second thing is really to regain control over their life so our protocol basically says the kids decide if they want to meet their aunt or if they want to meet their friend or if they want to meet their dog they need to decide it's very important that you would ask them we also gave a advice not to hug them before asking them if it's okay to hug them it's not for the family members but the professionals who are working with them so it was very important to let them regain control over their life that's the most important thing that we are doing right now each one of them has a devoted social worker that works only with him and the family and he's also the coordinator of all the other professionals who are working and we each one of them is receiving a a psychotherapist a psychologist or a clinical social worker who would work with him and his parents and he was trained all of them were trained specifically for working with those families Asha benia head of the har Institute thank you so much for your time and for those really fascinating insights thank you for your time another two Thai hostages held for weeks by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip were released last night they were met at a Tel Aviv hospital by Thailand's foreign minister ppri bahid nukara who flew to Israel earlier this week there was an emotional reunion with a group of 15 other Thai compatriots who were released by Hamas earlier it's thought more than a dozen ties still remain hostage in Gaza here's what Thailand's foreign minister had to say I'm happy all of you came out safely and that you are healthy apart from some knee and ear injuries you are not seriously hurt I think this team is very ready to return to
