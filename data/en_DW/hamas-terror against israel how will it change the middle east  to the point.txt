the Hamas terror attack on Israel is the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust says Israel's president what he called his country's Darkest Hour has cast a long Shadow worldwide The Assault on October 7th is prompt in comparisons to massacres perpetrated by the terrorist group Isis Hamas Fighters killed more than a thousand Israelis including babies children old people They seized an unprecedented number of hostages so far at least a thousand Palestinians have died during counterattacks by the Israeli Army which has blocked the Gaza Strip and mobilized a record 300,000 reservists why were Israel's vaunted military and intelligence Services caught off guard what will the attack mean for an already precarious region our topic today Hamas Terror against Israel how will it change the Middle East [Music] and welcome to to the point it's a pleasure to introduce our guests starting with gido steinber who is a terrorism expert at the German Institute for international and security Affairs s swp it's also a pleasure to welcome Daniel Dyan Burma he is a senior news editor on the Foreign Affairs desk at the German daily devent shanni rosanis is a colleague here at DW she's a commentator and editor for us and has also worked for media in her home country Israel and it's a pleasure to welcome joining us virtually OFA vman he is an independent author and a musician who's equally at home and in Germany and in Israel and he joins us via Skype and ofer if I if I may I'd like to start with you you are in Israel at the moment tell us how people are reacting to this worst attack in 50 years Israel had been been Riven by divisions in recent months is that now has that receded well the people are more preoccupied with uh overcoming the every daily uh challenges we have to help those who have been evacuated from Gaza those who are being evacuated now from the northern borders I would say the larger questions like the question of um social Unity about politics these are questions that we'll have to wait until the the war is over thank you and and shaie one of the Striking things the images that we've been seeing images of terrified young concert goers of blood smeared homes in villages very close to the border is the fact that people seem to have felt so safe there so close to Gaza it seems that that very high-tech very expensive wall was viewed as an impenetrable barrier correct that was one of Israel's uh pillars of Defense when it was looking into that region the Assumption was first that there will be head notice in the sense of intelligence and that this uh barrier which was as you said very expensive and very technologically advanced will secure the border and the failure of these two is still something that isra so many Israelis are grappling with still and it's going to stay there for a long time try to figure this out we're and we will come back to that uh question shortly but G let me ask you about the comparisons that we're hearing more and more now between Hamas and and the the incredible suffering that it wreaked in uh its attack and Isis are those comparisons Justified and what do they tell us well both organizations come from totally different ideological backgrounds and uh until recently I would always have argued that Hamas is a lot more pragmatic in the Muslim Brotherhood tradition uh than Isis was but if we take a look at the violence that has been perpetrated over there uh it uh primarily reminds me uh of of the yazidi genocide in Iraq and this uh this quest for an an anihilation not only of Israelis but of Jews is is I think something new and that's quite comparable uh to Isis so I think when dealing with the organization uh we should perhaps not think as much of of Hamas of former times but rather of fighting an organization that is a lot closer to Isis than we previously thought Daniel what will have been the driver for Hamas to perpetrate this attack now at this moment in time what do we know about Hamas aims here well there is some speculation over that one of the most plausible explanations is that the sponsors of Hamas were interested in stopping the RMA between Israel and Saudi Arabia which would have been uh really a serious blow to Iranian strategy in the region um but I think we can't take this completely for granted at least the United States say uh they have no indication that Iran directly ordered this attack but we can be sure it couldn't have happened without Iranian approval and as for Hamas they always have an interest in dealing fatal blows to Israel also Melinda just I can quickly add to that we know this was in the making for many months over a year already and the Saudi American ties that have been exposed this just happened recently so there's something deeper there connecting more to what uh guu was saying about where Hamas is get heading ideologically what we're seeing as as the hatred running deep and and how it channels the actions of this organization and over all of this is taking place in a region that was already a Tinder Box what potential reverberations worry you the most well honestly speaking as I'm talking to you from the northern part of Israel next to as I was driving around my hometown here uh in Northern Israel seeing all the tanks seeing all the military we are looking towards north to the lebanes Border we ask ourselves how will the hisbah react how will Iran react it is I must admit as an Israeli again living now being in Northern Israel very reassuring to see the strong us American response sending a a carrier here to the region to send the message don't as President Biden said don't back off and US foreign minister also uh traveling to uh the region as well let's take a closer look at the hamus attack and its potential reverberations in the region Hamas and islamist terrorist group fired more than 2,000 rockets at Israel on October 7th alone it broke through the barrier around the Gaza Strip using explosives and bulldozers according to Israeli reports some 1500 militants breached the Israeli military block of Gaza into Israeli territory and killed more than 1200 people on the street and in their homes including young people attending a music festival about 150 people including women and children have been taken hostage the Iranian head of state Ayatollah Kam praised the attack while rejecting accusations that it had been orchestrated by the mul regime but some analysts say that a large scale attack of this nature would have not been possible without support from tyan Iran has repeatedly threatened to destroy its perceived Archen enemy Israel for years the regime has aided the militant islamist group Hamas providing money weapons and training Iran has also threatened Israel with the help of Hezbollah its Ally militia in Lebanon widely considered a terrorist organization Hezbollah immediately expressed solidarity with Hamas by firing rockets at the Israeli border can Israel defeat Hamas by military means G I'd like to put that uh question to you but coupled uh with uh some of the language that Israeli leaders are using they're talking about eliminating uh Hamas when they describe their intentions Gaza is a dense urban area Hamas Fighters are surrounded by civili so what does a campaign of elimination look like well we don't know exactly uh what what the Israeli War plan will be uh but according to what what leaders say we we will have to expect a ground offensive through the whole Gaza Strip uh and I think that the Israeli military uh is is capable um of uh of destroying the structures of of Hamas in the G Gaza Strip many uh Hamas Fighters will die perhaps most of them many Israeli soldiers will die and many civilians will die uh no matter um how careful the Israeli military proceeds um I don't think there is there is any alternative if if the government if the Israeli government really wants wants to go um through all the all the gazen cities Daniel the eu's foreign policy Chief and a number of other leaders as well have warned that Israel as it embarks on a military campaign must respect international law avoid harming civilians is that wishful thinking it will be hard to do that but if you take international law quite literally international law does recognize the fact that civilian casualties happen in Wars international law says that Waring parties need to take every measure they can in order to protect civilians but what is sure is that we will see a lot of Civilian casualties and we will also see media and policy campaigning from um the uh Hamas side and also in many Arab states that will accuse Israel of needlessly slaughtering Palestinians this will be part of the political fight around this conflict you recently wrote that making peace with Hamas is impossible out of the question so I know it's early days but what does that mean how does this end well I think making peace with Hamas is um at least close to Impossible because of its fundament fundamentalist religious ideology and also because it's not up to Hamas alone to make peace it is also an instrument of Iranian foreign policy I think if we want to settle the conflict around Hamas uh for good then it would need a grand settlement in the Middle East that would um somehow at least limit the confrontation with Iran from Israel but also from many Arab states this is part of the context at least for Iran and we'll come back to that point but shanni let me ask you about the hostage situation Hamas has some 150 Israeli hostages including old and young people children mothers it has threatened to murder them them if Israel attacks in the Gaza Strip indiscriminately without warning do you think that will deter the Israeli authorities well officially they say it won't um all the statements we've been hearing from Israeli officials is that they're going to fight Hamas as if there are no hostages only maybe in specific cases when they know on of specific uh place where they're being held they might it might deter them um it's a it's a it's a terrible position that that it puts the Israeli leadership in um you cannot uh there they don't control Gaza they don't know what's happening in the underground level of the tunnels in Gaza and where these people are hidden they're not even sure how many of them are there held by Hamas and Hamas is very purposely hiding that uh to use that um I wouldn't put it past them to use the hostil in any way possible uh and uh Israel is uh always it's always a touchy subject in Israel and this time specifically um the greater the outcry from the public will be the harder it will be for the Israel leadership to take uh to ignore this topic of for in the past Israel has participated in hostage exchanges in fact the current head of Hamas in Gaza was a member of a mass group that was swapped for one Israeli prisoner namely uh gilad Shalit U do you think any kind of negotiations would be going on now is there any way to try to effect such a swap at this time well there are attempted negotiations via Qatar via Egypt actually as one reads uh via Germany as well we have a different dimension now as you have rightly mentioned gilad Shalit was one person who was exchanged to around 1,000 uh Palestinian prisoners in Israel we have now around 150 uh Israeli um prisoners or Israeli victim sitting in the um in the Gaza Street young babies all old people and I must say it is a challenge talking as a journalist it is a challenge to talk about the things to talk about the human sufferings of these people actually to also talk about the human suffering of the Civil population in Gaza in a in a remote manner maybe because I see in Israel uh it is rather rather difficult and I ask myself in order to avoid from the destruction that awaits now the Gaza Strip from an Israeli offensive I think that it is the role maybe of the Arabic world it is defin definely role of the Palestinian diaspora to sound a clear voice that whatever Hamas has done um made it actually is not a thing that has been done on behalf of the Palestinian people it is not a thing that has been done for the Palestinian struggle for for Independence and that might be give a perspective that might give a a way to relieve Gaza and relieve Israel from Hamas and avoid civilian casualties on both sides as much as possible are you hearing voices like that for example from members of f which is usually viewed as the moderate uh Palestinian uh representative there are two answers to this question the Arabic silence especially the Silence of uh the Palestinian autonomy autonomy and the The Silence of the Palestinian diaspora is painful in our years especially those of us who have been struggling side alongside with the Palestinians for Palestinian statehood but within Israel we see in row of Jewish Arabic NOS we see voices we hear voices of solidarity um regarding these these attacks we see voices we hear voices who say this has nothing to do with the Palestinian struggle this has nothing to do with the with Islam but again the Silence of the Palestinian diaspora The Silence of the Palestinian Authority is painful we also need to keep in mind Melissa there's there's Muslim victims among the Israelis um and still being bombarded uh there are many uh Muslim Arab Israelis sharing Destiny in faith with Israelis shoulder-to-shoulder yeah uh gido those Palestinian civilians in Gaza Israel has called on them to leave uh undoubtedly as it's considering uh a grand offensive but where are they supposed to go Egypt for one has refused to set up safe corridors for refugees to leave the Gaza Strip well the there is an area in the Gaza Strip where they could possibly go in the southeast East and I think that there that the Israeli military would would be ready to respect uh the safety of of any persons in in the area but quite in general there simply won't be enough space for gazans gazin to leave if Egypt does not let them enter the country and it seems as if Egypt will not do that again if if Israel attacks no matter whether they there are humanitarian corridors inside or outside of Gaza many civilians will die Daniel can you um say a word about uh again how you see the further progression in Gaza let's say Israel does conduct this campaign to eliminate Hamas what does it have to do after that reoccupy Gaza it has been profoundly reluctant to do so it left more than 20 years ago and has has attempted to contain rather than to occupy will that change well I think it might change and actually when you talk to members of the Israeli military and to some politicians um behind closed doors they would tell you that maybe it was really a mistake to move out of Gaza in 2005 and that it has been evident that you can't control this place from the outside that you can't prevent it from uh becoming a time bomb that explodes in regular intervals so I think this is definitely not out of the question but I think we also have to keep in mind that there are also problems brewing in the West Bank and this could be another problem that Israel has to deal with either politically or security wise maybe even within the course of this conflict let me ask um I'm going to switch focus a bit and come back to how this could have happened and uh Shany if I look at the headlines in Israel I see headlines like uh netanyahu's recklessness has brought War upon Israel that's a quote from haret the left leaning Israeli newspaper despite the mood of national Unity or at least solidarity would you say that this is uh provoking criticism and is the debacle as much a political one as a military one well I everybody feels something is off right left strong supporter of n now everybody understand this is an unprecedented failure this is an unprecedented shock and Trauma um there are attempts mostly from above from politicians to put politics aside but the rage is such that these voices cannot be tained for too long um there is no doubt Netanyahu has been the Prime Minister for over I mean for 16 years almost uh other than a short interval last year um he has appointed many of the heads of the security and defense apparatus he is convin been campaigning to be Mr defense this is claimed for fame and failing in this point is going to be something that's going to be very hard for him to dodge so I think also if we want to stay away from cynical look into politics this is the role of leadership taking responsibility the Israeli people many of them feel they have been left without anyone taking responsibility defend for themselves during that attacked and and in the days that they are still following with a great need that is there and very little response from the government um so we it has to go hand in hand we have to see it together G you us leaders are saying that Egypt actually warned uh Israel about three days before the attack that something like this might be coming and it seems that Hamas in part through disinformation managed to lull the Israeli Security Services into uh a false sense of security so how was that possible and what does it tell us about a vaunted military and intelligence uh power look uh I'm I'm not that sure that the intell intelligence failure is as big as it is being depicted right now simply because Hamas is a very professional very secretive highly highly ideological organization it is capable of hiding some things especially because uh the Israelis were expecting a similar attack not from the Gaza Strip but from the north for four months already so I'm not that sure that and you always have to expect that your intelligence Services don't get prior information about operations they are not perfect it's a very very hard job they have been extremely successful for decades but things like that happen and that is why uh on such a border you need the military but the military wasn't there theoretically it should be one division let's say about 20 uh 25,000 uh 20,000 soldiers they were not there so that's the failure of the military leadership and of the political leadership and I agree some months after after this war has ended I believe Netanyahu and some others will have to leave well Netanyahu has now gone into a uh Unity government with the Centrist opposition uh leader Benny gun who has a great deal of military experience but the extreme rightwing members of netanyahu's Coalition remain in the government as I understand it so what if anything will change I would allow me please to rephrase your question a little bit netan was forced into a government of national Unity um we we had to wait for five days for this government of national Unity to be formed we had to wait we had to wait for seven eight nine hours between before netan who is actually usually he jumps in front of every camera before he talked to the Israeli people explaining what is going on actually the only Act of political leadership that we have seen in Israel in the past few days came from US President Joe Biden it did not come from the Israeli leadership and if to follow up on what G Steinberg just said the military was not there where was it the question is where was it I know these are questions that will be discussed after the war is over but we know that uh the Israeli military and this you know reflects upon your question about the right-wing the right extremist in the Israeli government has created many provocations in the West Bank through the settler movement and the Israeli Army was forced to take care of those provocations so we ask ourselves where was the military what is the role of the political uh of the political leadership in Israel in allowing this horrible attack to to happen and I'm I'm sorry to say I hope that g steinber is right and that Nat will not survive this war this bloodiest day for the Jewish people since 1945 but um the Israeli the Israeli politics is since 10 11 months anything else but rational so we will have and we will have to wait and see Danel I'd like to briefly yeah I the failure is in in is is in the macro we're not into the details of what happened to the intelligence the failure is the shortsightedness the failure is the arrogance the failure is the lack of prospect um that Netanyahu is not you know has given or not given uh to the region to the Palestinian for many years this is where the failure is let me come back to another dimension that was covered briefly in our report that we saw earlier and that is Iran's ongoing support for Hamas and for hisbah Daniel you have uh called uh hisbah Iran's sharpest sword so two quick questions if I may what do we know about Iran's involvement in the attack itself whether there was explicit forn knowledge and intentionality and secondly what do we think about whether hisbah will jump into the fry well as for Iran and its involvement as I I've said it's inconceivable that this would have happened without Iran knowing and approving it there have been reports from Lebanon that there was a meeting uh between Iranian Hamas and Hezbollah leaders on Monday before the attack uh this is not a confirmed report so we should treat it with caution but it is possible that Iran was uh closely involved at least in an as an observer in that as for yeah you want to please no um as for Hezbollah hisbah is uh mainly so strong because it has a huge arsenal of missiles uh not all of them are really Advanced missiles although there are some guided Precision missiles among them but the sheer number of missiles could um cause a huge problem for Israeli missile defense which as we know is probably the most advanced in the world I don't think that Hezbollah wants to ENT enter the fight at the moment there's a tit fatat at the north but this could escalate and it is already escalating gido our title asks whether this will change the Middle East could we see this turn into a regional even an international configuration it's a plausible scenario uh if hisbah intervenes if is hisbah sees it sees itself forced into a confrontation with Israel uh that is that is a scenario and that's the very reason why we have seen the movement of the American aircraft carrier towards the Eastern Mediterranean I hope that we will see a relatively short war in Gaza but I'm not that sure that uh um that this will be will be the reality in the coming weeks I'm afraid we'll have to leave it there thank you very much to all of you for being with us today thanks to our viewers for tuning in see you soon
