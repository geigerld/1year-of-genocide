I'm Claire Richards and thank you so much for joining us the Rafa border crossing between Egypt and Gaza has reopened for humanitarian Aid and vehicles are entering the Palestinian territory with vital supplies now this footage is from the Egyptian side of the Rafa Crossing which is the only entry point into the territory from outside Israel The Crossing has reopened in the past hour and a humanitarian Aid Convoy has reportedly entered into Gaza carrying food F water and Medicine foreigners who've been waiting to leave The Enclave have also gathered at the border it is not known how long the crossing will remain open let's speak to journalist kareim alari from Cairo kareim the Rafa border crossing has been reopened can you tell us what this will mean for Vital Aid reaching people in Gaza well uh in your moderation you forgot one vital detail and that is that they only allowed 20 trucks uh to come in this is the agreement until now uh it seems like the trucks already entered on the other side are now unloaded with fork lifters onto smaller trucks within the Gaza Strip to then be distributed but we're talking here about 20 trucks for 2.3 million people uh relief agencies already said that this is a drop in the ocean you need to know that the UN is saying that it needs about 100 trucks a day in order to keep bring the most necessary items into the Gaza Strip uh before the war um there was already an Israeli blockade a limited blockade where there there were 450 trucks coming every day to Gaza so just you understand the relationship of 20 trucks this is why now the the moment the first 20 trucks entered the discussion started that of course there needs to be a more sustainable and uh amount and bigger amount of of Aid that's coming in as you said mentioned there is hundreds of trucks waiting on the other side of the Egypt side in order to enter But there until now is no agreement between Egypt and Israel about further Aid coming in I just want to let our viewers know you are looking at live footage there um of trucks that are going to be delivering that Aid I want to ask you know if this is such a small amount of what is needed to provide humanitarian assistance why has it taken so long for it to get across this border crossing because there was discussions mainly between Egypt and Israel Egypt wanted to have a bigger amount of Aid coming in and also it's a question of what what is coming in Israel is only right now allowing food medicine and uh uh water supplies uh the one of the crucial things here is fuel um for give you an example in order to run the water pumps in Gaza order for water to come to the houses that needs fuel right now we have a situation like in average a human being needs about a 100 liters of water a day for its normal needs of drinking cooking uh sanitation hygiene right now the people in Gaza have an average of three liters a day so one of the items that are under discussions for example is fuel to come in and the UN is pressuring the Egyptians are pressuring that that be possible so this border opening clearly has implications for Aid coming in I'm curious about what can come out what about foreign passport holders uh thousands of them have been waiting to leave Gaza are they going to be able to get across this border crossing that remains to be seen I mean it was like in the last days when the discussions were going on between Egypt the UN Hamas and Israel Egypt tried to link the two issues they say like because originally it was only foreign people with foreign passports leaving the Gaza Strip then Egypt said they only opening the Border if that's linked to uh Eight coming in and now as eight coming in it should be that uh it also will there will be some movement from the other side out of the Gaza Strip but until now nothing happened except that people gathered along on the Palestinian sides in with foreign passports in order to leave well thank you so much for bringing us up to speed with the latest there that is kareim goari a journalist reporting from Egypt's capital Cairo you're
