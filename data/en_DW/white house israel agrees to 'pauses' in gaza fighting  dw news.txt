We Begin the day with Israel and the United States on the same page perhaps not reading the same lines today the Biden White House confirmed that Israel has agreed to stop the fighting in Gaza 4 hours every day well it's not a ceasefire it is a daily window of safe passage as The Exodus of Goins from the north to the South continues today's announcement did not come easily or quickly US President Biden and US Secretary of State blink have spent the past week putting public pressure on Israel to approve humanitarian pauses in Gaza prime minister Netanyahu has tried to downplay any differences with his country's most important Ally keeping up appearances it didn't seem to be on the US president's mind today when he spoke with reporters asking for a Applause for a lot more than three days um yes did you ask him to pause for 3 Days to get the hospit out for that time I asked for even a longer pause for some of them are you are you frustrated with prime minister Netanyahu that he has not listened more to some of the things you have asked him to do it's taking a little longer than I hope well Biden's patience may be somewhat thin but he and his administration remain on message that the US stands with Israel in its goal of defeating the terror organization responsible for the October 7th Massacre of 1400 people Israeli forces are moving ever deeper into Gaza City targeting again and again what they say is the heart of Hamas fighting their way through the Gaza Strip the Israeli Army released these images showing its soldiers operating inside the territory Israel say its forces supported by air strikes have been targeting kamasi anti-tank positions the advance Into the Heart of Gaza City comes with a heavy price for Palestinian civilians the flow of injury to the alifa hospital gaza's largest continues with some of the new arrivals sharing what they went through we were trying to flee to the South as soon as we got to the street a tank hit us more civilians have fled fighting in air strikes in Northern Gaza the UN says the bombardment has displaced about 2third of gaza's nearly 2 and a half million residents on Wednesday alone at least 50,000 are estimated to have walked along an evacuation route to the already overwhelmed southern part Israel claims Hamas is trying to stop [Applause] them we saw Hamas putting Road Blocks we saw Hamas lying about Israel killing people when they are on the way to the South we saw Hamas does everything in our power that the Civil population will stay in the battlefield Israel says Hamas leaders are hiding in gaza's underground tunnel system at least some of the nearly 240 hostages taken by the group are also believed to be the there Israeli leaders say the ground offensive will continue until they are released and the terrorist group is destroyed that means more gazin are likely to be caught in the crossfire all right for the latest now let's go to journalist Sami soal he's in Jerusalem for us Sami the White House just hours ago announced that Israel has agreed to these daily 4-Hour humanitarian pauses in Gaza what are we hearing from Israel about this well I can tell you that in Israel they're downplaying this the Israeli military is saying that this is not new that it occurred today but also yesterday that they've been enabling these kind of like tactical they call it tactical paes in certain areas in certain neighborhoods that means they're not seizing the fire they're not stopping the fighting in the Gaza Strip but rather en in certain areas uh for the people there to go south and the report is that today another 50,000 gazans went South there's even a concern among some of the Israeli military that among those who are going south there might be some Hamas Fighters that are going south in any case they're referring to this as as definitely not a ceasefire definitely Israel is continuing the fight but rather a kind of a local a breaks there were also reports today of the director of the CIA the head of Israeli intelligence and officials from Qatar meeting to talk about a possible deal to get more of the hostages released what do we know about that yeah so there was a meeting with the participation of the uh the chief of the CIA the the head of the mosad the prime minister of Qatar in in which these issues were discussed um but on the other hand uh we hear from Israeli officials even though they talk about progress that was made uh which is something that we haven't heard in in in the last days but they still say that maybe it could take up to a week until such an agreement would be made but there's still differences between the parties Israel wants a larger number of hostages released they're saying that 15 would not be sufficient they're talking about tens of hostages released and at the same time Hamas is demanding at least 72 hours cease fire also um we're hearing Islamic Jihad which is another militant group in Gaza they said that they're prepared to release two Israeli hostages for humanitarian and medical reasons is that just a coincidence um taking place at the same time as these talks in Qatar well definitely there's a high coordination between the different organizations they they they launched the attack together on the 7th of October and and we can expect that there'll be some kind of understanding between these two organizations uh what is uh also interesting that they released a video there was one child was uh 13 years old who was speaking he was addressing nany in this pre-recorded video that was released by the Islamic Jihad he called on Natan to stop the bombing he he said that he's been protected by the Islamic Jihad and that if he prevents medicine and water from going into the Gaza Strip it will also hurt the Israel who are held inside the the Gaza Strip of course Israel is rejecting this and saying that this is a propaganda and so forth but it just goes to show you uh that the issue of Israelis held inside Gaza is storring a lot of emotions here in the Israeli public journalist Samy so with the leadies tonight from Jerusalem Sammy thank you well I'm joined Now by yuel abof he's an associate professor of political science at Tel Aviv University he's also the author of mortality and the morality of Nations which looks at the nature of social and political groupings that make up Nations it's based on studies of various groups including Israeli Jews and he joins me tonight from Jerusalem Mr abof it's good to have you with us tonight in the last month many of our here on DW have told us that the October 7th Hamas attacks fundamentally changed Israel is that true or are we seeing the result of trauma and shock experienced on a national level you do see that bear in mind what you have just heard the report about the 13 year old boy and this is heartbreaking and there are about 240 captives now uh what happened on that Saturday October 7 was devastating to the Israeli psyche and the closest that it has come is the memory of the Holocaust it's also the day that the greatest number of Jews died in a single day since the Holocaust so these are the sort of the collective memory moments that October 7 summons now of course we also have to bear in mind that we humans are very adjustable animals we adapt quite quickly and this is to a certain extent true in Israel too especially when you look at Israeli civil society that has responded remarkably well to the challenge of October 7th unlike I should add the state the state of Israel which was virtually absent on October 7 if there is one defining feature experience of all Israelis on that Bak Saturday was that on that day we all felt what it's like to live in a failed state but isra Civil Society R up to the challenge and that was remoted I I want to pick up on this notion of the the the condition of society before October the 7th um it seemed that before the terror attacks Israel seemed to be Riven by Deep disagreements particularly on judicial reform that was being pushed through by the government under Benjamin Netanyahu are those types of wedge issues that were being pushed by the government are they now gone I mean is Israel United now in a way that it wasn't before the attacks no it's not it's United with a certain very specific cause which is to fight Kamas at least the overwhelming majorities of Israelis are but Israeli Society by no means is a United society and look this is the result of a 30 year with Benjamin netan in many ways by the way the massacre of October 7 is the result of 30 year 30 year of T Alliance I would say the T it alliance between Netanyahu whom you now see and and Kamas they have been helping each other continuously throughout those decades and this is partly due to nany's ongoing policy of divide and Rule and netan has been using this policy of divide and Rule not only Vis the West the US in particular and the Arabs in general and the Palestinians between the West Bank and the Gaza Street between the P andas but also within Israel itself nany has been ruling by dividing people again and again and again and it has reached a climax in 2023 for nine months Israeli Civil Society has been struggling to keep Israel a democracy against netanyahu's government and his Cron's attempt to turn it into a Theocratic dictatorship and I don't think it's over his ministers are still there they are wrecking havoc in the West Bank they Harbor certain Messianic ideas about what's to come as a result of the war and all of this is part of the struggle of Israeli liberals and perhaps many Israelis beyond the liberal C who realize now the sort of tremendous damage Netanyahu has read what you say is is very powerful you're basically saying that Benjamin Netanyahu as a political leader is partly responsible for the the the monster as as it's been called that came across the border into Israel on October 7th I know that the polls show there is deep distrust in Netanyahu at the moment um if his hold on power does not survive this war what happens then to Israeli Society in a post Netanyahu World there will have to be a lot of healing a lot of healing and a lot of Courage lot of courageous exploration of the possibility to goes beyond beond those strategies of dividing and ruling the people and I think a lot depends on our capacity the capacity of ordinary citizens from all walks of life to come together Jews and ARS religious and secular asazi and M to those of you are familiar with the Israeli discourse all of those Rifts that netan has been building his whole political career around we will have to find a way to build Bridges about it and it's going to to be a tremendous task and I think that we will need all the possible help we can get yeah the possible help come also from the out you know what you're were saying there is that Israel is a PL pluralistic society has lots of different opinions will the country be able to find it within itself to move to a two-state solution even if that means giving up settlements territory in the West Bank with the risk that doing that will be seen as a victory for Hamas there is no question to my mind about the capacity the question is that of will look there's been a lot of talk over the past months about the danger of a second front and when people speak about that they speak about obviously the north the possibility thatal will attack in fact I would argue we already have second front this is already a war in two front one front is militarily against Hamas the other is politically Vis Net's government M and I would go a step further and say that in order to win this double front War both Israelis and Palestinians will have to come together look the main thing that has been haunting us and this is not just under Nan it's been going on for 140 years what has been perpetuating this conflict is that we keep on calling it The Israeli Palestinian conflict as if it is a conflict between all Israelis or all Israeli Jews and all Palestinians or all Arabs this is simply not true even in the Gaza Street the majority of Palestinians are against Hamas and as public opinions have shown most Israelis are against n both peoples have been part of this cycle of being hijacked by the radicals and those radicals have helped each other tremendously by the way not just politically financially too yeah the leaders of Hamas are millionaires some of them are billionaires too is a very rich individual they've benefited each other and now it is up to us the people and alternative leaders to come together two-state solution is possible there is a way to further that cause with courageous leaders and not just within Israel and among the Palestinians but in the region and worldwide we will need every possible help we can have Mr yuriel abof of Tel Aviv University you have given us our viewers a lot to think about tonight and we thank you thank you thank you
