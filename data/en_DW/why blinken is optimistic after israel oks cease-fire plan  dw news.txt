now US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says that Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge differences that are holding up a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza he made the announcement after meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and president Isaac Herzog in Israel blinkin says it's now up to Hamas whose terrorist attack on October 7th started the current War to agree to the plan it is US Secretary of State and anony blinken's ninth visit to the Middle East since the war in Gaza began over 10 months ago following meetings with Israel's leaders he outlined the proposed next steps towards ending the war this includes a so-called bridging proposal which blinkin says should Bridge the gaps remaining between the two sides the the bridging proposal that um prime minister Netanyahu has has accepted and we look to Hamas to accept reflects what is in the um ceasefire agreement that President Biden put before the world uh back uh back in May that's incorporated into un Security Council resolution uh and that makes clear that this process will proceed in phases um a first uh initial ceasefire over the course of six weeks in which hostages are released prisoners uh are exchanged and negotiations commence on um the conditions necessary for an enduring ceasefire but as blinkin heads off to Egypt for the next round of talks disagreements remain between Israel and Hamas these include Israel's refusal to withdraw all of its troops from Gaza a red line for Hamas Israel would also like to retain some strategic control in Gaza including along its Southern border with Egypt the Rafa Crossing and the Philadelphia Corridor in Gaza smoke Rising above canun marks the latest bombardment by Israeli forces the city in the south of the strip Bears the scars of months of fighting its residents have grown skeptical of any attempts by the United States to secure peace Lincoln's visit to Israel will not change anything every time we hear it will but it turns out that there are no negotiations it's all [Music] Gaza and we feel that the Americans and the International Community are ganging up on us without Mercy this visit to Israel is just for the US to check in with Israel and provide it with arms and Logistics so it continues its extermination in war on Gaza this won't change anything we are very pessimistic about his visit pessimism that grows day by day as the war rolls on well Gerald fire firestein is director of the Middle East institute's Arabian Peninsula Affairs program he joins me now from Philadelphia in the us thank you so much for joining us here on DW blinkin says Israel has accepted the bridging deal but so far there's been little detail about specifics what do you think the current proposal is likely to include it's a pleasure to be with you this evening Hana uh and I think that you know as uh as secretary blinkin said uh the basic framework is the three-phase uh initiative that President Biden announced about three months ago which includes the the immediate ceasefire exchange of prisoners other issues like humanitarian relief and is then supposed to go on to more detailed negotiations uh that uh that would include establishing a format for governance Security in Gaza and ultimately hopefully uh the beginning of a resumed Israeli Palestinian dialogue that would lead to a fin final resolution of the conflict and the establishment hopefully of an independent Palestinian state but all of those things are in the distant future and Hamas has accused Israel of moving the goalpost of these talks during previous talks but are we actually any closer to a deal today well it's a it's a very good question and and again this isn't the first time that secretary blinkin has said that Israel has aced accepted proposals only to find out afterwards that uh that there was a very optimistic uh perspective that he was sharing and that uh and that we weren't actually uh on the verge of of an acceptance so uh we're going to have to wait and see what comes out of the talks in Egypt and then in in Doha afterwards uh to see whether in fact uh the Israelis have said yes and whether in fact Hamas is prepared to say yes as well and some observers have also criticized the US for not really bringing enough pressure to bear on Israel to bring about a ceasefire is the US really doing all that it can well again I think that President Biden has been trying to walk a very fine line between uh between uh pressing Israel through uh through initiatives through drawing if you will uh but not dropping a a hammer in the form of arms uh arms secession or or other kinds of of real uh pressure that would uh that would certainly create a a stir in in Israel uh but would also create a big stir here in the United States and you know keeping in mind that we are uh at the at the beginning of the uh ultimate phase of the presidential elections uh the president is going to be very mindful not only of what's happening in Gaza in the Middle East but also of course what the impact is going to be domestically Gerald firin director of the Middle East institute's Arabian Peninsula Affairs program thank you so much for joining us on DW pleasure Michael Singh is managing director of the Washington Institute for near East policy in Washington DC and a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the US National Security Council uh Michael Anthony blinkin has called his latest diplomatic push probably the best and maybe the last opportunity for a ceasefire deal is that a fair assessment well I think we are hearing more optimistic takes now from us officials whereas in previous weeks there had been a lot of concern expressed by us officials about especially the attitude of the Israeli government uh worried that perhaps prime minister Netanyahu was introducing new issues removing the goalposts I I take some of this current optimism to suggest that perhaps those gaps have been closed it's important to remember though that you know uh of course hamas's uh reply matters as well and we've yet to hear a positive or definitive response from Hamas that suggests that they're ready to accept a ceas far now Hamas has have called it an illusion uh but at a news conference he gave after the talks blinkin expressed some additional optimism uh let's have a quick listen to what he said there just last week the president put forward a proposal with cutter uh and with Egypt to try to bridge the gaps that remain between the parties so that we could get agreement to what the president put out there a couple of months ago um in a very constructive meeting with prime minister Netanyahu today uh he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal now Michael S put this if you would in LAN terms for us what is the bridging proposal and how significant is this agreement with Netanyahu then well I think as I said you know there have been these differences that have emerged between the United States and Israel over the last several weeks uh over issues like you know for example who will control and how will it be controlled at the the Israel I'm sorry at the Gaza Egypt border to prevent more arms from coming into Hamas you know how will people be allowed to move around the Gaza Strip after a ceasefire agreement is reached it does sound as though these gaps have been narrowed or closed and and what the US has put forward together with cutter and Egypt is a proposal meant to try to to sort of make compromises on these types of issues as well as the many others which are under discussion and so I take again secretary blinken's optimism to suggest that he made progress in closing these gaps between the US and Israel um but but we still as I said don't really have an indication as to whether Hamas will accept it I I think that us officials May hope that Iran Hezbollah and other parties in the region U which are maybe are looking for a reprieve from conflict or looking for a pretext to uh halt their hostilities with Israel that they might put pressure on Hamas but again it's ultimately Yahya sinir in Gaza the head of Hamas who's the decider here and he hasn't said yes Aus so in your view what Remains the main sticking point on the path to a deal well you know the sticking point in a in a sort of near-term sense is waiting to hear from Hamas whether they'll accept this deal which apparently is acceptable to the US to Israel uh to the Egyptian and Cuttery mediators and so forth but I think quite fundamentally one thing we need to remember is that even though we talk about this deal as involving essentially a ceasefire on the one hand the release of hostages and the Palestinian prisoners on the other hand in fact there is more at play here presid prime minister Netanyahu has has promised total victory over Hamas whereas Hamas wants to live to fight another day and and reconciling those two fundamental objectives is quite hard so even if a ceasefire agreement is reached you know it's tough to imagine that this won't simply be a Prelude to more fighting in the in the months and the years to come without more fundamental changes on the ground there in Gaza now during uh this trip Lincoln has also repeatedly warned it's time to make sure that no one takes quote any steps that could derail this process who and what was he referring to well I think the parties he has in mind when he says that are Iran and Hezbollah because both Iran and Hezbollah have vowed retaliation against Israel for Israeli strikes on their territory um but they have so far held off now in my view they've held off in large part because they may not want to fight a war with Israel they may worry that they would lose or that they would be severely damaged in a in a war with Israel um but they've promised essentially this retaliation and so they may be looking for a pretext to avoid it I suspect that if there is a ceasefire agreement that both Iran and Hezbollah may take the opportunity to claim credit for it and move on and I think that's what secretary blinking blinkin is hoping they'll do Michael Singler the Washington Institute for nearas policy in Washington DC thank you very much for sharing your expertise with us thank you for
