Israel and Hamas appear to be on the verge of an agreement to release some of the hostages held in Gaza according to a statement cited by several news agencies the leader of the Palestinian militants Ismael Haner has said that negotiators are close to reaching a deal it's thought the agreement would see a swap of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails for a significant number of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on the 7th of October a temporary truce of several days is also said to be part of the deal as is the movement of humanitarian Aid into the territory well as those negotiations continue several families of Israeli hostages have voiced concern that Israel's war cabinet is not doing enough to bring their loved ones home relatives met with lawmakers to urge them not to pursue a bill that would enable the death penalty for captured Palestinian militants frustration boiling over their anger is directed towards far far right members of the knesset's National Security committee the families of the hostages abducted by Hamas are against a proposed law endorsed by some committee members the draft Bill enables the Deb penalty for terrorists but the families believe even the debate around the bill could jeopardize the lives of their loved ones look at us but not as an outsider look at us as if she is your sister as if he is your child your grandchild would you risk anything that could now harm his life when he is back prosecute them raise this discussion again but he is not here and because of this he may never return farri members of Israel's government see the death penalty as a deterence I think that the death penalty is required so such events as we saw don't happen another Massacre another disaster an argument the families are not buying maybe you should stop talking about killing Arabs and start talking about saving Jews don't tell me about how we want to kill Arabs because it was us who was getting killed by them not the other way around with emotions running High many Israelis are losing their patience they have been regularly protesting asking the government to do more this is incredibly disappointing because I feel that at this point when we know that taking down Kamas we keep hearing from them is going to take months or years and it's going to take a long time on the other hand the other objective is time sensitive people are dying a hostage deal between isra is and Hamas appears to be in the works and many here don't want to risk anything now that a return of at least some of the abductees could be just around the corner let's talk to Abby on Abby is an American Israeli in Tel Aviv two members of her family were killed in the October 7th Terror attacks three others are believed to be Hamas hostages welcome to DW and we'll come to this talk of a deal in in a moment uh could you start though by telling us about the family members that you've lost and those you're worried about sure thank you for having me um on the morning of October 7th we began checking in with family we have family that lives on kots near Oz which if you look at the map it's really right across the border and the southern part of Gaza and we have family living in different houses on the kots and they began reporting uh a terrorist infiltration hearing of gunshots and so on and what transpired over the next few hours was that five of the family members were taken hostage Carmela Dan who turned 80 in captivity my aunt her granddaughter Noya who slept over at her house she was a 13-year-old autistic girl and in the other house were two other of Carmella's grandchildren Sahar who was 16 and at the time ARS was 11 and they were with their father ofair they escaped through a window and on October 8th we saw a video of Aras in hamas's hands kind of pulling him down the road and we understood at that point that they had been taken hostage uh we found out nine days later that all five were indeed confirmed hostages but one day later the military came back to let um noya's mother know that both her daughter and her mother had been murdered by Hamas and their bodies had been found that's terrible and how is your family coping we are coping through action we are doing everything we can Carmelo is an American citizen and I've been working as much as I can with the US government and Us Media um all of them are French citizens and so we've been working with mcon and with the French media as well and we're doing everything possible we can inside of Israel I don't think that there is rest until all of them are home and I don't mean just my family I mean every single hostage tell us about the sort of contact you've had with Israeli uh authorities since the the 7th of October it took a while for them to um to create a connection and to be forthcoming and as much as it sounds hard it makes sense they're dealing with such a complex situation you know I'm an American so I think about 911 but when 911 happened the terror was confined to that one day and the war we fought started later and was halfway across the world but the terror that happened here on the 7th required that we had to immediately secure our borders and protect ourselves against Hamas and so the government was dealing both with that effort as well as trying to understand how to manage the hostages I can say communication has improved but we as families don't get a great deal of concrete information from the war cabinet I think we learn more from the media right so H how long was it um into this this process of I can put it that way that that you started to to find out who you need to speak to how you can contact people within the the Israeli um uh government you you said at first it was it was difficult and you understood why so how did you negotiate that it took four days for them to even build the war cabinet I think in the beginning there was you know kind of disbelief that it took so long and then it took nine days for them to reach out to us as a family and we have five hostages there are some families that have 10 but there are some families that have one and so we felt like how is it possible that we're not hearing from them these are all members of our government so we know who they are we started trying to go after them ourselves we we started you know trying to get to them but at the same time in that same set of days Secretary of State Lincoln was here we spoke on Zoom to President Biden and we had 10 senators from a bipartisan delegation show up from the United States and I think that uh contradiction really showed the difference in the responses but again the Israeli government was focusing both on the war and on the hostages and they don't they they're not the same goal in a sense they are conflicting in many ways and it adds complexity now we're hearing a talk and it's only that at the moment we're hearing talk of a deal being closer a a deal uh that it is said would involve the swap of Palestinian uh prisoners uh for uh hostages your family amongst them um my guess would be you've been here before how do you you view this these these informal um this informal talk of a deal I try not to pay a ton of attention to it until I think it's real we've gotten our hopes up we know that things are fragile um and we are just waiting for something to be concrete the fact that four hostages have been released and one has been rescued is amazing it's better than nothing at this point but it Al feels very challenging that we have to fight to continue to make sure the hostage issue doesn't get lost and that people move on this you know yesterday was the International Day of children and we didn't hear word from UNICEF we haven't heard word from any un or Global health organizations regarding sign of life or medical status of anyone and right now we feel like we're we're unsure how the world isn't screaming on behalf of the hostages as an American and an Israeli and a human we are sad about every loss of life but it feels like the world is not screaming hard enough for these innocent civilians that are being held hostage and what you've heard about the potential or the possible terms of of this deal do you have thoughts on that or or is it just a case of whatever it takes let's get our people home I think at this point I I think there's a complexity of the ceasefire because it puts our soldiers at risk and that's clearly a challenge and something that we need to not we the government and the military need to think really really critically about but if it's a prisoner swap take the prisoners bring our families home I feel like I don't know what else can be done and so take the prisoners we can figure that out at another point but if it means that we get our families home then I think absolutely that's it's a no-brainer for me you've given many interviews since these terrible attacks obviously keeping the spotlight on the hostage issue how does all this activity on behalf of your missing family how do you balance that with your need to grieve and come to terms with the losses that you've suffered I don't I think um you just push forward and you'll grieve when when there's time I know I feel like when they're home I'm going to go to sleep for a really long time and then I'll wake up and grieve but in the meantime it's just doing everything we can you know I stood at a protest this morning in Tel Aviv I went to hostage Square after that to see the the installations and the people to meet American Jews that are here visiting to Bear witness to what's happening um and you just keep doing everything you can to make sure that this issue doesn't get lost and these people don't get forgotten 34 children people who are wounded elderly men women all of them every single one needs to be brought home we cannot no neither side can build a war on their backs have you thought about what you're going to do what you're going to say when you have these five people back in your life again I have three people back because two are murdered I um look it's it's my cousin's son that we're speaking about he's the same age is mine and the only thing I wish I I I I have zero need for myself for anything I want him and his sister to be with their mother I want them to feel whole and safe and whatever they need that's what I want to facilitate that's it that that's would be what I wanted and I think every single one of us needs to think about if this was our child if we don't have children if it was our sibling or our parent or our grandparent I would crawl out of my skin if this was my child it's not mine but it's my family and so anything they need when they come back to feel safe and to feel whole and I have to imagine that's their mother thank you so much for uh speaking to us today we wish you well with your endeavors AB be on thank you thank
