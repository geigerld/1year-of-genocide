the Israeli military has announced it has pulled all but one Brigade of its soldiers from Southern Gaza they did not provide any further details about the withdrawal but Israeli media Reports say ground operations are now likely to focus on intelligence-based targeted raids only local media is also reporting that the remaining troops will still guard the corridor separating North and South Gaza that was constructed by the Israel Defense Forces for more I'm now joined by Marina Moran a military analyst and associate professor at King's College London um Marina what does this withdrawal mean on the ground hello Melissa well given the situation on the ground this withdrawal will mean that well obviously there will be still one Brigade in the South which in Israeli trms would be one one to 2,000 troops on the ground however the nature of the military operation in Gaza will change and I expect a much slower Pace in terms of the air strikes that we have seen before that claimed many civilian lives so it will be much more focused and um obviously this will also have an effect on the plans to enter Rafa which I think are now at least for the time being are off the table is this off the table for the time being over the next few weeks is it possible for the milit milary to regroup and eventually uh take that ground offensive on Rafa that's a big question I think a lot of people are wondering what we have to understand here is that it doesn't depend on the military the military is an instrument of politics and the political situation and I think it was essentially a political decision to withdraw the troops from South and Gaza because of the mounting International pressure after the killings of Aid workers on the one hand on the other hand is Israel needs international support the US and the UK support and both countries have voiced concerns over and over again we have un Security Council resolutions we also have today um ceasefire talks in Egypt so depending on what the outcome of those talks will be that will determine the future course of the operation and we also have to understand that Israel also is expecting a retaliatory strike by Iran whether it will be direct by Iran or by Hezbollah we do not know but Israel itself needs troops and it's been mobilizing reservists which has been harming Israeli economy and then you have the population and the pressure on the Netanyahu government and the protests inside Israel so the situation for Israel is quite complicated therefore I think that reducing the pace of the situation until some of these factors can get normalized to a certain extent is a wise choice to wait out therefore I cannot say whether it will be in a week or two or maybe in a couple of months it all depends on these um conjunction of factors I just named now Israel says the goal to eliminate hamas's Han unit Brigade there have been reached and that's one of the reasons why they can't leave uh how how possible is to verify that well we don't have more intelligence than what the Israeli military says unfortunately and yes we have those gains however in the grander scheme it is not enough to reach the military objectives that um Israel has set therefore I think of course they they say that they have reached one of the objectives to explain their activities because it would be too difficult to name all the political implications that these military activities have caused therefore I think that um maybe Israel will also need to recalibrate its military aims and create a viable political aim for Gaza because the military cannot and in itself solve the problem Marina Moran a military analyst and associate professor at King's College London thank you so much thank you for having me and in the studio I'm now joined by DW Middle East analyst shanni rosanes uh shannie why do you think this is happening now is it because of us uh uh pressure um it was very clear that the Americans did not want to see a ground invasion of Rafa that's true but if you ask Israelis officially then though this has nothing to do with International Community pressure which we've been seeing mounting in last week following the killing of Aid workers in the strip um it could be that they were just using the fact that it's a six month anniversary and trying to make it not connect otherwise not connected to any certain events but sort of make it symbolic but the military has been winding down down operations in the last couple of weeks and they've been saying that they don't have any need to leave the soldiers exposed you know once they are in Gaza and they're not maneuvering they're not in action um then they're exposed to maybe uh targeted um attacks by Hamas militants they don't want to do that um so for now I mean and IDF the way they try to sell it it's always been part of the plan um it does not mean anything about Rafa because um any action taken in Rafa will have to be taken only after the population has been evicted this is something the Americans are demanding Israel has agreed to that and that will take weeks and weeks uh what does this withdrawal mean for this ceasefire deal that never seems to happen but always so close right yeah that's interesting question because Israel has always you know officially tried to to to say that the only way to get Hamas to get any concessions and agree to anything on the on the negotiations about the hostage deal is through applying military pressure and a lot of it and this is what they've been doing in the last six months we've seen over 32,000 Palestinian casualties due to that pressure um and so Israel kind of withdrawing its forces it also means a slow uh withdrawal of that position of of only pressure will be the one bringing any any um breakthrough in the negotiations it could be connected to the fact that now we know we know that the talks are being resumed there's going to be a new delegations going you know in and out of Cairo in the next days maybe we're in a point now uh where most points have already been agreed on and now what's on the table has nothing to do with that it's hard to say we really don't know what's happening between closed doors uh in those negotiations and talks I mean it has been six months um how has the view of I mean I know it's a very divided country lots of different opinions but uh how has the country changed in terms of its perspective on the conflict well I think there's a slow understanding that something isn't working you know Nano kept saying in a very confident voice again and again Israel will keep on F fighting until the complete obliteration of Hamas they're far from doing that we've seen uh racket you know Rockets against Israel this day from from Gaza you know as if 6 months has not happened so it's clear something isn't working it's clear there need to be a change but it's also clear there's going to be a political backlash from the right uh side of netan who want to see more action and not less military action in Gaza and we will see how it unfolds in the next days tww Middle East analyst shaie rosanas thank you so much you're welcome
