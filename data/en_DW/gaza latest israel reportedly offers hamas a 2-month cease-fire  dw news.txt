and there could be a possible concession in the war in Gaza the US News website axios is reporting that Israel has offered Hamas a two-month break in the fighting in exchange for the release of all hostages still being held in Gaza the report comes as Palestinians say the city of Han yunes has endured the worst bombardment since the start of the war the Hamas ran Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 50 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded several countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization smoke billows over gaza's southern city of khun as Israel's military continues its bombing campaign it's latest strike forcing dozens of the Wounded into hospitals that are overwhelmed and underresourced children and babies are among those injured or killed doctors say they're struggling to treat patients I'm telling you the hospital is on the brink of collapse we all are we're running out of medical staff and supplies nothing is reaching us there's nothing in the hospital to treat patients with no painkillers no anesthetics no medical resources Israel's military has been focusing its offensive on the southern city where its battles against Hamas Fighters are intensifying explosions and gunfire echo through the refugee camps in the Gaza strip most of the population have had to move more than once to find safety where do we go this is the 17th time I've left my home where am I supposed to go to Rafa Rafa is just one street what do they want from us do they expect 2.3 million people to live in an area that's no wider than 200 M and can't be longer than kilometer pressure is mounting on Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he rejected terms offered by Hamas to end the war in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages there and opposed the creation of an independent Palestinian State and relatives of Israeli hostages in Gaza disrupted a parliamentary committee meeting calling for their loved ones to be freed this comes as EU leaders meet in Brussel to discuss the situation in Gaza and what will happen after the war while there are deep divisions on calling for a ceasefire many including the eu's foreign policy Chief still think establishing a two-state solution is the only way forward I think that we have to stop talking about the peace the peace process and start talking more concretely about the two State solution process because piece could be many different pieces what kind of a piece you're talking about so let's talk about what we want to do all we want to do is to build a two-state solution meanwhile in Gaza many are trying to find a place that's not under siege in order to bury their loved ones as the number of casualties and displaced people continues to [Music] rise let's get across to Jerusalem where journalist Sami Sak is following developments for us Asami we heard in our report there that Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected uh hamas's conditions for an agreement to release more hostages how does he intend to achieve this goal instead yeah well the uh proposals that Hamas has been suggesting is the end of the war a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a release of the prisoners that were engaged in the attacks on the 7th of October netan was saying that Israel cannot accept this and instead he has been offering his proposals now this proposal does not mean the end of the war but rather a cease fire that would last some 60 days and during this ceas fire the Israeli troops will withdraw from some areas of the Gaza Strip they will be some movement towards the North and at the same time Hamas will be releasing hostages in the stages and Israel on its side will be releasing some Palestinian prisoners and and where do the families of the hostages believe to be held in Gaza fit in here uh what do we want as we as as we've seen in that report many of them are extremely frustrated with the Israeli government's efforts so far yeah yes indeed what the families are saying is that they don't believe that netan is actually putting the question of the hostages as a priority and that Netanyahu sees the continuation of the war his campaign against Hamas to destroy Hamas to destroy the capabilities of Hamas as being his main goal and they feel that there is a kind of a contradiction because release of prisoners needs a a a kind of a thief fire it needs a release of Palestinian prisoners and so forth they're not going into the exact details of what should be the form of this kind of agreement with Hamas but they're saying that the Israeli government is not prioritizing the topic they went into the ceset yesterday and what they were seeing is that the finance committee is kind of business as usual and they're saying that the knesset is not prioritizing the issue of the release of the hostages and so the the other institutions of the state of Israel are not putting it number one and Sammy I'd like to take a quick look at Israel's military operations in Gaza Before I Let You Go uh Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the city of Han yunes can you tell us a little bit more about the fighting there yeah well first of all I want to come out with the news that has come out from the Gaza Strip which is the H death of 21 Israeli soldiers in a massive explosion that took place in the area which is Al the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip we're talking about an area that is a perimeter within the Gaza Strip where the Israeli military is creating a perimeter by destroying homes and houses all along the Gaza Street and in one of these building they put explosives in order to blow it up and there were a solders still inside the building when it was mined and this building was attacked by a Palestinian Hamas Fighters with an RPG and this brought about a massive explosion Israel is seeing its biggest disaster during this war with 21 soldiers being killed thank you so much for bringing us up to speed there that is a
