meanwhile the UN is warning of widespread famine in Gaza with one in four people facing starvation as food deliveries struggle to get through the majority of Aid trucks cross through Rafa on Egypt's border with Gaza but heavy bombardment is hampering efforts following us pressure Israel opened the former Goods Crossing at km Shalom as well as an inspection station at nitsana both have been blocked by Israeli protests at DW's Rebecca R reports now from the port city of ashdot this port should be processing much needed food donations for Gaza but it's not the Israeli government is in a battle with unra the agency tasked with Distributing the aid and has blocked its passage shipping containers of rice flour chickpeas and even cooking oil enough to feed more than a million people for about a month are stuck here in the port city of ashd less than 70 km from Rafa and the people who so desperately need it these people are making it even harder for Aid to get through the group of Israeli protesters are at the nitsana border crossing with Egypt trying to stop the trucks that are brought here for Israeli inspection French Israeli Rachel TWU was among one of the first to take action she helped form a group called Sav n and says its support is growing we started uh up a month ago we were 40 50 people uh protesting now uh we have the on the on our greatest day we were 400 and it's been only 5 weeks they site Israeli media reports that suggest a majority of the aid that makes it into Gaza is diverted by Hamas as the reason their movement began we are basically blocking uh the humanitarian Aid what I call the inh humanitarian Aid that goes into Gaza and falls into the hands of Hamas the convoys include foods but it also includes fuel the fuel is what is very problematic for Israel we're fighting Hamas and on the second hand we are giving him the fuel to continue to fight us to element the the tunnels the terror tunnels the Iration system and the and electricity in a statement to DW unra says there's no evidence of systemic diversion of Aid in Gaza by Hamas or any other armed groups Sav n claims to represent a crosssection of Israeli Society but most people at this protest wore distinct clothing of far-right and religious activists though surveys suggest blocking Aid is a majority opinion with International pressure on the government to allow Aid in these protesters say they're doing what the government can't everybody here here in Israel is mourning the losses that we've had to endure in Gaza and on the second hand our government is giving International giving in to International pressure and is giving out the the humanitarian Aid to our enemy their attempts have proved successful not in completely preventing Aid transfer but certainly hampering its flow somewhere between 1 and 200 trucks full of Aid are supposed to come through here get processed by the Israeli authorities before heading back up to Rafa and Crossing into Gaza we haven't seen any be process today none have come through the protest say though their numbers are small it's because of them that the crossing has been closed a good day for the protesters who say they'll keep up their Civil Disobedience for as long as it takes while they protest the situation for civilians in Gaza gets more desperate by the day let's look at some of those points with hea Tibi who leads the NGO care in the Palestinian territories as she joins us from ramala in the West Bank welcome to DW um with we've now seen multiple hospitals being hit by Israeli raids where are civilians in Gaza now able to receive medical attention uh good morning dear unfortunately um the situation in general is very dire and when it comes to the medical system it's even more and more becoming more and more and more difficult since months now uh we are uh explaining that the situation is bad the very last few hospitals are being unfortunately affected Medical Teams are affected we at care try to do the mobile clinics what we do what we call as mobile clinics so it's a tent where you are receiving people who are in need of medical support similar to other actors but this is not enough it's very very limited services that we can provide and the number of those who have uh imputed Parts is the biggest number that we have seen ever in in Gaza it never happened before this is basically because of un being unable to provide the medical services that they require in normal days so now we appear to have a deadline for a raid on Rafa that appears to be less than three weeks away what effect would an Israeli raid have on an overcrowded City uh like Rafa I'm afraid of even imagining what this would look like on reality we have seen what happened in the North in the center and the problem is that this is the most crowded area ever we have seen over the last months and the potential impact we have seen it before we expect it to be much much bigger because literally people are staying in the streets there are no places for them to be taking or seeking refuge in the in the city um it's a it's a big chotic situation in the in the South specifically in rafah it's as my colleague describe it it's a live live nightmare that they live in reality but it's a constant Nightmare and this is what people are saying we are very afraid of that because there are no places to go to even rafah is not suitable as a shelter place in its current current specific moment it's not suitable imagine what can happen if this this is if the military actions The Invasion takes place in three in three weeks this is going to be very scary Rafa is also where AID crosses into Gaza is enough of that reaching civilians at moment no it's not even closed not even Clos to be enough uh it's very limited now we are hearing about people from the north the of course we don't have staff there but some of our partners even our partners most of them move to the South but the very limit number who are staying there to provide medical support of course again not enough for the people they are saying that there is nothing to eat if they find any kind of food it's extremely expensive and people don't have money if you are lucky even to find let's say a sack of flour it will be mixed with other things that they discover that it is not proper for eating when they start baking it so unfortunately this is the situation my dear it's not enough we thank you for your time and wish you well a hea tib from the NGO Care thank you thank
