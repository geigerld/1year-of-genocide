the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says an Israeli attack on the southern part of the territory has killed at least 71 Palestinians and wounded almost 300 the ministry says the injured and dead were taken to nearby NASA Hospital in hunus news agencies cited hamus media and witnesses as saying that the strike landed in a tented area for displaced people Israel's military says the strike targeted two senior Hamas officials in an open area surrounding Ed by trees several buildings and sheds the Reuters news agency is also reporting a separate strike on a camp west of Gaza City killing 10 Palestinians for more on both incidents let's bring in funny fcha our correspondent in Jerusalem give us the latest on this strike in hunas and the other attack west of Gaza City one only needs to take a look at the pictures coming out there from Han Yunis some people described the situation on the ground as if there was an earthquake so there was really a significant air strike you see people really coming through the rubble digging with their bare hands trying to find their family members relatives civilians who are still believe to be under that trouble while we are hearing that the Naser hospital is apparently overwhelmed by the number the sheer number of casualties now the various numbers that the authorities in Gaza are working with the Hamas ran media office is speaking of about at least 100 people killed while the uh uh authorities are speaking the health officials are speaking about at least 71 people killed without knowing the final number of casualties here what's really interesting to see how Israel is reacting they're not speaking of any numbers so far with regard to casualties what they were very quick to say that their target was two top commanders of Hamas military Wing one top Commander Muhammad deif uh as as as as one of the main targets and it's being currently that's what Israel claims currently being verified well whether that top Commander Muhammed deif who's believed to be the Mastermind behind the October 7th attack has been actually killed or not while Hamas is saying that all these claims are quote nonsense they are saying just like you you you've mentioned in Gaza City a separate attack that the target of Israel the the Israeli uh government and IDF are civilians the big question really is how that's going to further influence the political uh uh uh movements here with regard to any way forward towards a framework to a peace agreement while Israel keeps bombing gaza's strip and by that uh killing a lot of civilians on the ground what about the varying reports as far as the locations targeted hun is this is where the attack took place which is one of 16 governorates of the Gaza Strip in fact this is the part of Gaza Strip that at the beginning of the war was deemed to be a safe Zone when that changed because uh the the shifting Focus to say of Israel from North to the south over the past few months was very much visible with so many air strikes hitting the uh various areas of hunis the people were asking themselves really where should they go now there's a big question here revolving around whether this attack as Hamas claims was actually in what is still designated the safe Zone which is the alasi camp as we just heard Israel saying they said that they attacked a place that is an open area full of trees buildings and sheds so it's unclear really if that was uh the doet the alasi camp or other PA Beyond but regardless of that the sheer number of casualties are just trickling in we have to see what's going to uh come in as this news develops further the latest there from DW's funny V
