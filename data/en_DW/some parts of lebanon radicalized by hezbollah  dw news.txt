the powerful organization Hezbollah considered a terrorist organization by many countries holds sway in many areas of Lebanon its Fighters have been firing Rockets into Israel Northern Israel while Israel has responded with its own attacks DW's funny faar went to the district of kandak el kamik in central Beirut where a combination of social economic and religious factors have kept Hezbollah and their Affiliates in control despite the risk of war with Israel this is the Bayo District of Honda Alik the name means the Deep trench it's a poverty-stricken neighborhood with a dangerous reputation Hezbollah leader Hassan Nala is pictured everywhere but you can't just walk in and start filming first you have to meet with the so-called Community leader it's for our safety he says he used to be a fighter for a militia affiliated with nzala says we are supporting Gaza so we are now fighting to reduce tension on Gaza Hezbollah doesn't want [Music] war Nala's words are seen by his followers as the message of Allah on Earth even as he talks of destroying Israel his ideas echo in the mosque Israel is our enemy we are a glorious Nation and we have glorious leaders but Hezbollah is not only a Shia islamist militant group considered by many to be terrorists it is also a political party which with Allies won the 2018 general election and even though it lost its parliamentary majority in 2022 in predominantly sheer areas like this one it functions as a state within a failed state that means it funds schools hospitals social institutions services that because of the economic crisis many communities depend on but that has a price stack many have paid with their lives as so-called Martyrs for young people here the future looks bleak lebanon's economy in Ruins its infrastructure crumbling and there's no functional government with all that this district is considered notorious for poverty and radicalism every country is against us but Hezbollah is with us when the time comes we will go and Fight This Is Our Land and we are with them Hezbollah feeds people here a resistance narrative Shia Muslims fighting Western domination some dedicate their children to the cause resistance means dignity my pride my glory we were born to die to become Martyrs I've already given two sons and my nephew his sons are pictured here both died fighting for his Walla against Israel Maha yya writes on political violence and identity building in Lebanon she says Hezbollah has clear reasons for providing services to people these Services create a special bond very very strong between the families who are receiving these services and Hezbollah Hezbollah has the larger social service network but also other parties do the same so the main problem is the inexistence of the state asa's power in hak shown to us as we entered is always present for locals many would not speak on camera but as the prospect of war with Israel looms not everyone even here is willing to give up their children for the cause I worry about them that maybe when they see all the men fighting there is something inside them that encourages them to join I don't want my children to join I've raised them from when they were little until they were grown up sending them to war to lose them no people in this area will pay the priz if there is a full-blown war with Israel I'm joined Now by our senior International correspondent funny faar she is in Beirut tonight funny good to see you I understand you visited a district there in Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway it's in control what was the atmosphere like there and are people afraid that war is going to come to them certainly across sect lines and this is what I find quite interesting that Lebanon is a very diverse country as such it is divided on many issues across sectarian lines but when it comes to this issue whether people want the war or not most people will tell you certainly not a lot of people here have vivid memories of the last war in 2006 between hisbah militants and Israeli forces which erupted in the same region and this highly disputed and volatile border area between libanon and Israel the very same location where we see an flare of violence during the past four months ever since in fact Hamas assault on Israel and retaliation Israel attack on Gaza and the ongoing war in Gaza so people are very much concerned that Lebanon will be pulled in one way or the other into a full-blown War the question is only by which party here by a non-state actor as people refer to hisbah the Shia islamist militant group or by Israel as we heard in your report funny this District it f functions as a state within a state how does that work and I'm wondering who or what is funding it I think it's really important to understand that here in Lebanon hisbah basically originated from the Shia block of of of this population uh during the Civil War which was uh during the 70s until 9090 uh however uh when hisbah was created as we know it today in the early 80s Iran was very much behind that group financing it and is financing this group up until today which also means that it's been considered in this region as a proxy a non-state organization basically part of this bigger axis of resistance that Iran talks about with Proxes in Iraq in Syria in Yemen and as a result it functions as a state with an failed State I would actually have to stay say at this point because there's no functioning government in Lebanon there's no president at this point to empower any government and in fact hisbah is not just considered a terrorist organization by multiple countries but it's also political party so it is sitting in the cabinet it is sitting in the parliament in in many ways it has a influence in calling the shots both politically but also militarily yeah and it's in a country that has political problems severe Lebanon is also in the midst of a recession one of the deepest that the entire world has seen for centuries when you consider all of this does the government in Lebanon does it really have any influence whatsoever over Hezbollah the situation is such that hisbah militants are part of the government as a party as we've pointed out in the report as well and I think this is what is often maybe not seen internationally because internationally what we hear is one thing that hisbah is a designated terorist organization by various countries but people forget that it is really very much interlined with parts of the society specifically the Chia population of this country which is about onethird an estimated onethird of the country which also means that there are other parts of society who do not endorse the hisbah group and also not all people who are Shia will tell you that they are a fan of of of of hisbah melians and their Doctrine however since the state here is very weak and their state institutions are incapable of solving major problems what hisbah does is really received or or or as a fertile ground in many parts of the society and a lot of people here that I've been talking to are saying that they're actually Fed Up by two things that they feel that the hisbah militants are hijacking not only the Shia part of the population and using and misusing their religion the Shia Muslims but they're hijacking the entire country yeah it's an excellent explanation of how power is wielded in a country that is paralyzed by crisis our senior International correspondent Char tonight in Beirut buddy thank
