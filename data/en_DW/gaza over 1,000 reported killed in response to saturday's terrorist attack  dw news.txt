Israel is keeping up its campaign of air strikes on Gaza in response to Saturday's terrorist attack which killed more than 1200 people inside Israel officials in Gaza say more than a thousand people have been killed and at least 260,000 displaced by the bombing they also say the territory is about to run out of power after Israel imposed a total blockade cutting off supplies of food water and electricity Israeli air strikes hit hundreds of Targets in Gaza overnight leaving entire neighborhoods in Ruins rescue workers and locals went door too searching for survivors Israel's military says it was targeting locations used by Palestinian militants to launch attacks on Israel with the sunrise the aftermath of the Israeli strikes is obvious shops and homes turned to Rubble the targeting has been unjust we've not seen this anywhere before they targeted humans trees stones and even children they didn't leave anything safe Gaza is under heavy fire thousands have fled their homes to seek shelter elsewhere but for people in this densely populated area there are few safe hiding places how is this our fault what did my children do there's no electricity internet food or water why we suddenly found ourselves displaced going from a car to a hospital to a street one person was told to come stay with us and they got hit by an air strike another person asked us to come stay with them and they got targeted I'm in the street where should I go even un facilities have been hit uh un facility a school Sheltering the displaced has been uh directly hit um a few days ago um and uh overall we are hosting uh some 70,000 people in over 80 schools and other facilities across the Gaza Strip these are families who uh have fled the the the shelling and the bombardment Israel says it has destroyed the homes of many members of Hamas the militant islamist group viewed as a terrorist organization by the EU and the US it has also imposed a Siege on the Gaza Strip stopping the supply of food Fuel and medicines and there are reports that the sole remaining access from Egypt has also been shut after Israeli strikes at the Rafa border crossing for civilians caught up in the fighting the conditions are becoming increasingly difficult officials in Gaza say Fuel and medicines are running short and the UN says that damage to water facilities has cut supplies to hundreds of thousands of homes ju Hilman is director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the international crisis group I asked him what he makes of Israel's response so far well um it is uh not surprising that uh Israel is responding in the way that it is now which is massively because it has always responded to uh um Hamas rocket attacks which what we saw in the past mostly uh in this way massively by destroying uh buildings and uh you know going all out in the Gaza Strip um now this time they have additional reason because of the nature of the Hamas attack on Saturday which was horrific um and has has caused more Israeli Cas casualties than ever before um and and so prime minister Netanyahu has has already said we're going to flatten the strip uh other Israeli spokes people uh have have made similar comments about that they will give No Quarter uh totally in violation of international law um but uh I I expect that that Israel will go all out uh and even more than in the past but I what I don't see is what the end game is because in the end what do you have you have a destroyed Gaza Strip uh you have people without homes right you may have defeated uh Hamas but who who then rules the place are you going to reoccupy are you going to do it yourself this is not really an option for Israel can I just uh dig deeper on when you say Israel will go all out what do you mean what will Israel exactly do are we talking about ground Invasion followed by occupation what are we talking about so I don't know what it will do but it's but I I can tell you that if it does what I think it will do uh then that would be the consequences so um if if there is going to be a ground Invasion and all the signs are that there will be one um then uh they will it will be aimed at uh fiting out Hamas fighters who are currently in hiding in tunnels mostly on theg ground um if that happen those Fighters will come out and there will be houset toh house combat that will utterly destroy whatever is still standing today uh there will be nothing left in those parts of the Gaza Strip where that fighting would take place I don't know if it will be in the entire strip in the end people as your correspondent said have nowhere to go absolutely nowhere to go so uh Israel must take that into account it it will have to confine them somehow in a in in a smaller part of the strip as it is trying to fight the fight these find and fight these Hamas Fighters um but it's very hard to imagine that there will be much left standing when they're done with a ground Invasion and then yes the question is will they leave again the Israeli troops or will they stay uh and and take care of this population which is then suddenly without its protector and and Governor right uh and um you know what what to do you know we're talking about uh what Israel could potentially do uh and at the same time we're talking about an Israeli response to a Hamas attack that caught the Israeli establishment completely by surprise I wonder if you think there are any assumptions about Hamas that the Israeli security establishment needs to have a rethink about especially when it contemplates its next course of action well I'm sure that there's going there's already a lot of rethinking happening inside Israel about their overall approach and people you know remember the 1973 October War when Israel was caught by surprise and they say they said then we we can never let this happen again and so that means there was a whole um culture in the in the Israeli security establishment about you know always questioning their own assumptions which is a very healthy thing to do by the way uh but somehow it fell apart in this case why because they they had seen signs that Hamas was not planning anything in the near future they had still been weakened from the last round of fighting which was not so long ago uh and they were completely preoccupied with the threat of hisbah in the northern border and the security of the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank uh so um so it was a failure of imagination in a way I do have to ask you about what Hamas was thinking or currently continues to think what is hamas's end game here attacking Israel which is a stronger military power and then uh almost certainly expecting an Israeli response what does Hamas think it is going to achieve and beyond that what do Palestinians gain from this attack by Hamas so it's a good question about the the end game that Hamas they must have one otherwise they wouldn't have started this attack they had to to think about it um it's not a happy end game um in my view uh because it brings about the autod destruction of Gaza and possibly also of Hamas as a military movement in Gaza um but they must have thought we have now been here for 17 years under a uh tight Israeli Siege uh where people cannot really uh leave or go to the largest open air prison in the world um where you know services are not arriving goods are arriving only of a certain kind food U Med medic medicines and stuff like that but otherwise there's a lot that cannot come in so what can we do after we fought Israel so several times five times in the past and nothing has changed it's only gets worse we have to go For Broke we have to go for broke and that means uh let them come in we'll fight them we will inflict further casualties but then eventually the world will have to recognize that the situation in Gaza is unsustainable and it's their responsibility about 40% of gaza's population is under 15 and the conflict is taking a huge toll on them Saleem OAS is from unicef's middle EAS office welcome to DW so how is this new conflict affecting children in Gaza a region the UN had already described as being in the midst of a humanitarian crisis yeah this is this is really a crisis over the crisis uh we're talking about uh now a few days of continuous violence and leaving hundreds of children uh um killed and injured on both sides um in in Palestine in Gaza um there are two6 260 children killed now over 500 children are injured and these numbers are are increasing by the hour unfortunately um uh the situation is really really dire as you said Gaza has already been a place where uh Children and Families uh um we're living a really hard uh hard life uh with very very uh limited uh basic Services um access to water access to uh to health supplies all that is now even uh more hindered uh by by the current violence so yeah situation in in in Gaza is really really bad um hundreds of of thousands are being uh um displaced as we heard from our our honor colleague just now uh there are a lot being uh sheltered in in schools um and there's no place that's safe in in uh in Gaza right now unfortunately and so how much access does UNICEF have given Israel's complete blockade so so far we don't have any access from or to uh Gaza and that's a key ask that we have a key call to all all uh parties of the conflict and to the Israelis to um uh open open uh um safe uh uh humanitarian corridors for Aid to get inside because whatever Aid uh is um has been stored uh and prepositioned inside Gaza is running out for all agencies and for all organizations um we can't sustain our operations uh and we can't help uh Children and Families in Need unless we we get Aid inside this is this is really critical at the moment and you you understand the the the likelihood of uh a humanitarian Corridor being opened up is extremely unlikely given that we appear to be uh building up to an Israeli ground attack yeah but that's this this is this is the ask the ask is for a halt uh in violence uh humanitarian poses and corridors for this Aid to come to come in um this is not helping any of the civilians inside this is not uh giving them the chance that they they need to live uh this is really um um being so hard on them and on humanitarian uh actors on the ground um we are calling for secure and uh for protection for for the humanitarian Aid workers for patients for children their families that are seeking help um also um all uh the civilian uh infrastructure is being uh damaged and and uh hit by by the attacks um these infrastructures are crucial for children and their families to to live and to sustain their lives um this should stop and violence should stop at least for for the aid to come in if the violence doesn't stop if there is no humanitarian Corridor what will be the consequence well we're talking we're talking about uh a place where uh over over a million uh of its of its uh population over half of its population are children um 1 million. one uh children in Gaza and the West Bank has already been uh uh in need uh uh for uh um urgent humanitarian assistance so you can only imagine if this continues without any any stop without any Aid coming in this this is going to be really a humanitarian uh uh uh a humanitarian catastrophe inside of Gaza thank you for joining us we wish you well with your efforts Saleem OAS from
