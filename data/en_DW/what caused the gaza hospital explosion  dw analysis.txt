gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says 471 people were killed in an explosion at a hospital in the territory Hamas is blaming an Israeli air strike and Israel and the US President Joe Biden both say a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants was responsible for now there has been no independent verification of either claim this is where the sick are supposed to be healed instead the alaki Arab Hospital in Gaza City has become the latest casualty in a conflict that's costing so many lives hundreds died in this attack we were just sitting here and suddenly there was an explosion the glass shattered on us many people were killed many of of those caught up in the blast were Palestinians who'd been seeking Refuge this place was a safe haven for women and children who fled Israeli shelling near the hospital they saw this place as a refuge for them to feel safe and secure there was no advanced warning before targeting the hospital there were more than 3,000 people here for whom place was a safe heaven the terrorist group Hamas which rules Gaza blamed Israel for the attack anti-israel protests have been held across the Palestinian territories including in the city of Ral in the West Bank no craters these are the but the Israeli Army says it has proof the attack was carried out by another Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad and that Israel is being unfairly blamed it was at the time that 6:59 p.m. when there were reports of an explosion at the alali AL mahani Hospital in Gaza City according to our intelligence Hamas checked the reports understood it was an Islamic Jihad rocket that had misfired and decided to launch a global media campaign to hide what really happened Garin meanwhile are left to pick up the pieces from the night before knowing this conflict is far from Over Now The Carnage that we've seen at that Gaza hospital has inflamed emotions in many parts of the world protests erupted across the Middle East and world leaders are calling for accountability there's World Fury over the explosion at the AL early Arab Hospital in gazam protests are taking place in Libya Yemen and Iran among [Music] others our demands are addressed to Arab leaders not to the West we don't want half Solutions or half speeches like we condemn we denounce we are asking them to break off relations with a Zionist enemy the Palestinian people did not commit a crime they don't want anything it's their home islamist militant group Hamas claims the hospital was hit by an Israeli air strike Israel says it did not carry out an attack on the hospital it says a rocket was misfired by another Palestinian group Islamic Jihad as the blame game goes on leaders around the world are condemning the blast horrified by the hundreds of people killed at alhi hospital this same day in Gaza by a strike that I strongly condemned earlier today I call for an immediate humanitarian cire there is no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians all facts need to be established and those responsible must be held accountable in this tragic hour we must all redouble our efforts to protect civilians from the fury of this war many people around the world want those civilians to be protected the hospital blast is also spurring demonstrations far from the Middle East including in the United States in Philippines security analyst Justin Crum from the risk advisory company Cil line joins me now from London Justin good to see you again now conflicting claims over the blast at the hospital in Gaza City what do you make of the situation the well as you say I mean this this tragic situation uh there is a certain amount of confusion as ever on the battlefield and on this sort of environment in terms of allocating blame and in previous instances that happening Gaz sometimes Tak years in in Far quieter circumstances than now for inators finally to work out what's happened and of course there's no investigators on the ground now looking at this um the Israeli story though certainly does have a lot of evidence a lot of Merit um to back it up it's uh there was definitely a rocket that was misfired that was over the hospital at the time um and the blast and everything else every expert I've spoken to um feels does support the sort of size of rocket that was talked about from Palestinian Islamic Jihad um but the real point I think is an instant in this tragic good course and the way in which it's been viewed and seen that the scenes we've seen after it in parts of the Middle East the evident anger um in many parts of the world I don't think that's going to change whatever the assessment subsequently is because it'll be impossible to know fully yeah US President Joe Biden made a high stakes visit to Israel to show support but also to deescalate do you think he succeeded in doing that the real blow I think for Biden's visit was the fact that he couldn't visit the the Palestinian leaders the Arab leaders he was due to see in Jordan um so we didn't see the full benefit of the Diplomatic effort that was under taken and it is amazing to see the president of the United States flying into an active war zone um to lead on diplomacy and I think that was a very bold move and very important and the clear thrust has been we support Israel but the very strong message that Israel cannot forget the suffering of the Palestinian people in this and it's no good fighting a war against Hamas and forgetting about the Palestinians themselves and actually delivering to Hamas what they sought to achieve which is the victimization the people of Gaza and an increase in Anger against Israel so I think that message very strong the effort towards humanitarian support very clear we're waiting now to see does it get followed through them on the ground in Gaza and Biden called on the Israeli government to not repeat the mistakes the US made in the wake of 911 um you hinted at it there what would be the biggest mistake Israel could make is it really the sustained civilian suffering in the Gaza Strip yeah this is what we call the center of gravity for Israel's war effort really and I think there was a a failure to recognize this in exactly the same way that after 911 we failed to recognize what Al-Qaeda had sought to achieve with the attack in the United States which was to suck the us into an unwinable conflict that created more enemies than the us could deal with and um this is obviously pretty much exactly what Hamas have sought to achieve so the the advice is very apposite and it comes from a nation that's been there it's a nation that has gone through this and has recognized that you can't just tackle a problem like this with military force however vengeful you are and however angry upset and justifiably terrified your population is you need to box clever you need to think more widely and not do what your adversary wants you to do and I think that is the very strong message being delivered and hopefully that that lands home yeah Israel says it plans to destroy Hamas given everything that you just laid out is that an attainable goal not just purely militarily I was a very small Cog and a very large machine in what was called the global war on terror at the time and it was very clear that a military solution alone will not defeat terrorism you need a comprehensive approach the the war is one part of it but the other tools around it the diplomacy the thinking the humanitarian Aid the approach the problem is what makes it something you can ultimately manage um it's a bit like a war on crime or anything else you're never going to get rid of it you have to actually control it manage it and win support so it's inherently a war aim at the moment just to destroy Hamas that's a simple statement that's going to be difficult to do I think we'll see an evolution of how Israel approaches it um and an evolution of that war aim which may or may not affect how operations on the ground are conducted I think certainly affects how the Palestinians are looked after and the degree of international support that comes in for the the poor population of Gaza that are trapped in all this and I'd like to bring in Shaya loow a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council um sha hundreds of people are believed to have died in the explosion at the Ali Hospital in Gaza City um what else can you tell us about the casualties there I don't have much more information than what's already been reported I do know that the people that were there were people who were seeking shelter there's no safe place in Gaza people often go to medical centers hospitals uh un facilities thinking that that will be a safe place uh so many of the people there that were killed were just ordinary civilians trying to find a safe place to stay with their families to be protected from the onslaught because we've seen that despite um Israel telling people that they needed to leave from the north ostensibly that the South would be safer we're seeing that the Central and South of Gaza as well are not safe so that's why people are going to hospitals and un facilities thinking that that will provide them with some degree of protection now sha you and I have spoken before can you give me an update now on on what you're hearing from your organization staff in Gaza at this point so I'm in contact with my staff as regularly as I can be over the last few days connectivity has been an issue there's limited uh regular mobile celles service there's limited internet so really we're trying to check in as much as we can through SMS um through WhatsApp when it's available but it's really really challenging to get updates from the ground what I am hearing from Han Yunis where where one of my colleagues is is that it's just chaos and panic I can see on the screen that you're showing people struggling to get bread I've heard about these uh long bread lines people are fighting over just small amounts of food there's limited water it's not pable we're also hearing about uh shortages in medicine Doctors Without Borders reported that they have surgeons operating on people without painkillers or anesthetics because there just aren't supplies the situation in Gaza is getting more and more dire our colleagues are losing hope they feel like they can't go on much longer that's what they're telling me that it's just too difficult and they don't all they want is a ceas fire all they want is even if it's just 24 hours for them to uh collect their things bury the dead find food find resources get Aid in the situation really is quite desperate and for medical workers there's even another challenge um we've been hearing urgent calls earlier this week that hospitals are running out of fuel to run emergency generators um are we already starting to see that happen at this point I'm I can't speak to the specifics of what type of fuel hospitals have I do know that they've been warning all week that supplies are quickly dwindling it's not surprising to hear that um considering that no Aid has been a or anything has been able to come into Gaza since October 7th the Gaza Strip is a place that has um that has very few uh supply supplies and stock they are dependent on on uh on things coming in through Crossings on a weekly basis there isn't that much stockpiled in terms of fuel or other things to uh to supply generators and other things that are needed when when there's no electricity and no water coming in we have the news today that Israel has said that humanitarian Aid um can be made available in a humanitarian Zone in southern Gaza uh does that does that give you hope that there will be a clear road map to achieving that what we need is not only for there to be safe zones but we need assurances that for people that can't access those safe zones or choose not to go to those safe zones that there's sa safety for humanitarians to access all throughout Gaza to be able to distribute Aid and Reach people who are in need people also are going to be able to need to go to distribution centers to access Aid and so what we really need are assurances that there will be safety for all uh for for all people seeking Aid and it can't just be restricted only to these safe zones we need humanitarian pauses in which Aid can be uh collected and distributed accordingly shanea loow from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you as always for taking the time to speak with us on DW thank you and I'm joined Now by military analyst Mike Martin from Kings College London hi um we know military's uh Israel's military has denied hitting that hospital in Gaza City is there a way for researchers to find out whether that is true certainly uh if if you look at social media at the moment there are a number of videos of the strike and photos Post strike and um what researchers can look at is for instance uh the angle that any uh objects fell into the ground they can also look at uh I can see it on your screen there the blast radius of the impact and they can look at things like trajectory and burn marks and with all of this material it is actually possible to determine whether it is you a misfired rocket as the Israelis say whether it is a missile strike or even an air dropped munition and and that will take some time and people won't want to immediately come out with the answer they want to be quite sure but it is possible to determine uh what type of strike it was now several Arab countries uh have already come up with an answer and blamed Israel do you think that they would have uh done that without having intelligence uh pointing in the direction of Israel uh war is very confusing and you know you've heard of the phrase the fog of War um nobody at the point that this happened including the Israelis or the Palestinians will have known exactly what caused the missile strike you as I've just laid out it takes some time uh to determine post fact what has happened so at the time that there was claim and counter claim going on uh neither side knew for sure what it was that had occurred let's look at implications um of this terrible attack um this explosion how do you expect this to affect the course of the conflict going forward what will the repercussions be well we've already seen a number of repercussions that today with Arab leaders pulling out of meetings with uh President Biden but I think going forward actually this has uh hugely narrowed no matter who it is that ends up being you know that it gets pinned on this has hugely narrowed the scope I think for Israel's uh future activities I think a number indeed all of the Arab countries are now calling for a stop to the conflict and pressure will grow amongst Israel's allies like the United States and Europe as well for the conflict to come to an end so I I actually think that this ground Invasion that the Israelis have been talking about since uh that terrible Saturday I think that is now there is a question over whether that will go ahead in the form uh that people think it will have done thank you so much for your analysis that is Mike Martin from Kings College
