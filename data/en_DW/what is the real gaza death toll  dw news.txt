giving a death count in Gaza is a contentious issue the Hamas run Health Ministry in the territory has been offering figures since the beginning of the war and international organizations including the United Nations as well as media organizations often rely on them as they are seen as the best available but as the figures rise the task of documenting the deaths is becoming more difficult and more disputed our report assesses the changing process of counting the dead in this conflict in the war in Gaza only one institution has been providing a detailed death toll the territory's health Ministry which is overseen by Hamas the ministry collects data from hospitals and regularly updates a central list including not only the name sex and age of the victim but also their personal identification number whenever possible multiple independent Studies have shown this list to be trustworthy in January of this year even Israeli intelligence confirmed that the gazen health min count roughly match their own estimates although they remain skeptical of how many casualties are combatants and how many civilians but now as the war drags on Counting the dead has become more difficult and has led to renewed accusations from Israel that the figures are unreliable with more than three out of four hospitals damaged or destroyed the traditional system for establishing a casualty list has all but collapsed more and more Hamas authorities are using on the ground media reports and eyewitness testimony to count B IES over 30% of the Health ministry's death doll now consists of unidentified individuals and yet even as Israeli authorities draw attention to the increasingly poor quality of data some independent analysts say the Gaza death toll could be vastly underestimated a study published earlier in July in the medical journal of the Lancet claimed that at least 186,000 Palestinians had most likely died as a result of the Israeli bombing and ground offensive in Gaza a clearer picture of the death and destruction will likely emerge after the fighting is over and a nonpartisan investigation is allowed to take place Michael spaget is a professor at the Royal hallay University of London and chair of every casualty counts an NGO that is committed to ensure that victims in armed conflicts are recorded recognized and remembered welcome to DW it's great to have you on the show now Michael according to the latest figures published last night by the Hamas ran Ministry of Health and Gaza over 39 9,000 people have been killed since the War Began 9 months ago how reliable is this number so I would say that that's a plausible number but uh it consists as your report said of of two components and one component is actually much more credible than the other component uh I should say that just yesterday the Ministry of Health released another detailed list of victims that has 28,1 185 five on it and that comes from their morg based monitoring system plus a form that people can fill out reporting tests that they know about so I I view that 28,1 185 as a highly credible Rock Bottom minimum the other bit of it essentially 10,000 additional deaths that bring you up to the figure that you just mentioned is really a black box and they've never explained where that comes from they say that it's based on reliable media reports but they've never actually published those those reports or even a methodology for how they go about compiling them yeah I I want to talk about methodology because other studies estimate that the number of deaths in Gaza could be multiple times higher than those 39,000 that we were just talking about how do you explain this this enormous difference well really that um letter I won't even call it a a study because it's it's it's really really um more of a joke than a study I mean that that that letter is just not a serious piece piece piece of work but they're they're tapping into something that is real which is that there are some deaths that are not directly caused by the conflict in a in a violent way so um so that's that's true there are going to be some deaths like that but the where that number comes from is is is really just not serious in in any way that they they just took 13 other conflicts none of which really resembles very closely the Gaza conflict and then they used some very poor measurements for indirect deaths caused in those those conflicts and then they said well if Gaza kind of looks like what happened in those 13 very dissimilar conflicts then there there there could be this huge number of deaths it's just it's not serious and people should just ignore it I've got a whole article about this by the way yeah that is some very very important context you're giving us there I really appreciate that um I'd like to focus for a minute on the Israeli government's perspective and Play a clip from prime minister Netanyahu speaking yesterday at the US Congress and then return to you that's why despite all the lies you've heard the war in Gaza has one of the lowest ratios of combatants to non-combatants casualties in the history of urban Warfare and you want to know where it's lowest in Gaza it's Rafa Michael is there any evidence whatsoever for the claims being made there by prime minister Netanyahu no that's just ridiculous what what what he's he's saying um he also said apparently that um there there are V virtually no civilian deaths uh in in Rafa um I I can tell you based on the the latest detailed list of deaths that was released by the the the Ministry of Health yes yesterday that since the Rafa in uh um Invasion began there there were recorded by the Ministry of Health which as you pointed out has an imperfect monitoring system right now but they still manag to record about 3,500 new deaths and of those 1,656 were children children under the age of 15 so so it's it's not anywhere near as as clean as as as he is trying to make it out to be yeah and back in in May Benjamin Netanyahu himself put the number of deaths in the Gaza Strip at 30,000 saying back then that 14,000 of them um were said to be combatant which would leave 16,000 civilians but let's look beyond the fighting that is happening right now because once the the guns fall silent what will have to be done to establish the real picture and for us to know the true toll of this war this is going to be a major project that is going to take probably a decade or more to to complete uh we have an excellent starting point fortunately here which are those detailed lists that the Ministry of Health has been releasing those lists are imperfect they have many flaws in them I've written a series of articles that puts a lot of effort into exposing flaws in in in those lists but we must not lose sight of the big picture that those lists are really a gold mine of of information and all subsequent work is going to build on that but it's going to take a long time it's going to be a major project uh but I'm confident that this is something that that is going to happen and I'm I'm confident that eventually we're going to have a very clear picture of the death toll both civilian and non- civilian in Gaza we talk a lot about numbers here but your organization precisely strives to recognize every death from armed conflict as an individual human tragedy how is that possible under the current circumstances in Gaza well you know the scale of it is is so vast that uh you you know you can't really give um every individual his or her due I mean not not not even close but but really I think the the place to start is by listing each person killed by name and then trying to say something about each one of those in individuals and when I refer to a project that will happen when the fighting finally stops that will take at least a decade this is going to be a central part of it that we we want to produce as complete a list as possible of the people who have been killed and then we want to know something about each one the circumstances of their deaths who they were but but of course no human can keep all that information uh in in their their mind because it's so so large but there have been a number of projects that that attempt to do this and it's it's an important undertaking and we absolutely must do it for that was Michael spaggot share of every casualty counts thank you so much for your time you're welcome please to be here
