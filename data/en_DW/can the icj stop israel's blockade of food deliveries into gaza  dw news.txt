South Africa has made a new application to the international court of justice or the icj asking it to prevent famine in the Gaza Strip South Africa is seeking an emergency order to compel Israel to allow more Aid into the territory warning that Palestinians in Gaza are facing starvation Israel has launched an offensive in Gaza to root out Hamas militants following the terror attacks of October the 7th South Africa has urged the court to order all parties to seize hostilities and releasee all hostages and detainees for more on that our correspondent Diane Haw joins us from Johannesburg Diane good morning this is the second time South Africa has asked for the court to take measures on the war in Gaza they got turned down last time do they have a better chance of success this time well this time around the the focus of the application ation is somewhat different with the uh earlier the the late January application South Africa was focusing on the situation in the area of Rafa uh saying that the court should prevent Israel from entering that territory the court felt that the measures that were already in place were strong enough to deal with any situation that arises there now um the the the application brought by South Africa it comes after Israel has actually submitted um the timeline for Israel to submit its report to the international uh court of justice on what it has done uh to ensure that life is is preserved and also the focus is different looking more on the human humanitarian aspects um of Aid and and making sure that Aid actually reaches people across um the the the area of Gaza what exactly is uh South Africa expecting the court will will do this time around because last time the court I think asked Israel to take preventive action when it came to that genocide case that South Africa had filed what is South Africa expecting the court will do this time around well South Africa is being more um explicit it seems in its request and saying that there needs to actually be a halt an immediate halt um to the conflict in the area and it's also uh requesting the release of all hostages um which would not only apply um you know to Israel but it would also apply if the court were to order this uh to the the the Hamas uh group and any other groups that are holding hostages now South Africa is saying that it believes that Israel hasn't complied with the initial court order um and it would obviously have to motivate why it says that um it says that Israel's actions over the period since the initial court order and now do not demonstrate that it has complied with that court order so in a way it wants the court to examine in Israel's actions in this period as well as to make a further uh step by requesting um or ordering that there should be a halt to the conflict itself how much support is there in South Africa for the government's efforts at the icj in in South Africa I would say there is quite a lot of support of course there are different perspectives uh from all different walks of life but we regularly do see protests taking place usually on a Friday and Saturday where there are large groups Gathering particularly in the Western Cape um where there's a large Muslim Community um where people are requesting that um you know South Africa should continue this and also saying that there should be other interventions not only from South Africa but when it comes to the International Community um I think it is important to also note that there have been other countries that that have expressed their support for example Nicaragua has requested to join the the broader case um at the icj and a number of other countries in uh the the Arab League have also expressed their support thanks so much for that our correspondent Diane Hawker reporting from Johannesburg
