Israel's war on Hamas is having repercussions outside of the region demonstrators in many countries have held both pro-israel and pro Palestinian rallies here in Germany public opinion is also shaped by the country's historic responsibility for the Holocaust a senior political leader recently posted a speech condemning anti-Semitism but surveys show that people's views on the conflict are in fact complex the war between Israel and Hamas has touched many lives not just in the Middle East but for instance in Germany too many feel it's a conflict with no end the latest infr test dmap poll reveals almost three qus of Germans say they are concerned about the flare up in hostilities since the terror attacks by Hamas on the 7th of October many of them say they feel fear about what might happen next of course I'm scared I'm afraid of anything that spreads hate yes with this conflict that we have now the Middle East Israel I hope they stop on both sides you get really scared well I think I've never been as afraid of the future as I am now now also with Ukraine and with Israel Germany has seen demonstrations on both sides large crowds determined to show solidarity with Israel and awareness of Germany's historic responsibility towards Jews but also protests in support of the Palestinians sometimes peacefully drawing attention to the plight of civilians in Gaza sometimes angrier Gatherings with anti-semitic chants and slogans according to police there's been a surge in the number of anti-Semitic incidents in recent weeks including Molotov cocktails thrown at a Jewish center and the Star of David dbed on Jewish homes but the infest dmap survey shows only just over half of people in Germany acknowledge this rise in anti-semitic hatred more than a third said they did not recognize the problem I'm afraid there will be attacks I'm afraid the mood will turn to the right I'm afraid that something will happen to Jews no I'm not afraid I think here in Germany it will be kept under control I think the problem has always has existed and it's breaking out now there's an opportunity for people to show it and they obviously feel empowered by global Trends and social media and everything they see on the internet social inter Chancellor Schultz is among a string of politicians who've spoken out against anti-Semitism on Tuesday interior Minister Nancy faser moved to ban groups linked to Hamas in Germany such actions may help to keep the peace on the streets of Berlin and other cities but the atmosphere of fear and division will not be easy to dispel I want to bring in DW political correspondent Hans Brun now Hans the German government has made a point of stressing Germany's historic responsibility to stand up for Israel but opinions among the German public aren't quite as clear-cut are they yes indeed it was in a spectacular video or a video that has been viewed millions of times since it was published just recently the German um minister of economic economic Affairs a member of the green party once again stressed that support that Germany uh has for for Israel but if you look at this poll it's actually fairly balanced there is uh the poll reflects some criticism of Israel quite a lot of criticism as far as attacks are concerned that uh um cause uh civilian injuries in Gaza um and at the same time there is severe criticism of Hamas of the fact that uh well 3/4s of Germans make Hamas responsible hold Hamas responsible uh for the um the chaos the the war the injuries the deaths that are taking place at the moment so there is criticism both of Israel and of the Palestinian side um and I think the kind of uh unwavering support for Israel is not quite as wides that the government that the government stresses is not quite as widespread in the German population it's interesting Hans uh the the poll also shows that while two-thirds say they're worried about Israeli civilians an even greater number 72% say they're worried about the Palestinians yes indeed this is part of that phenomenon we are talking about that there is a tendency uh that the Palestinian side has more sympathy amongst the uh German population we must emphasize here that the poll was taken amongst German voters German citizens and there are about 10 to 12 million foreigners living in Germany who are also obviously affected by this situation and also um participate in demonstrations and so on and I think uh one can say that amongst those non-germans living here many of whom are from the Middle East the simp Sympathy for the Arab side for the Palestinian side is probably larger as well so I think in general one can say that uh uh Israel's stand in the German public in the public of people living in Germany um is a difficult one Hans as we heard in the report preceding you the uh recent weeks have seen a spike in anti-semitic uh incidents across the country but German intelligence agencies had been warning of this worrying Trend uh even before the war what might be behind this surge well there is certainly a surge that is connected to Pro Palestinians de demonstrations that have been taking place or many that have been prohibited especially here in Berlin the German Capital because the authorities feel that these would lead or could lead to anti-semitic uh um calls to calls for violence to calls to destroy Israel these kinds of things and so they have been prohibited and as we saw in that report there were several incidents involving Jewish institutions both here in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany uh and these are clearly connected to the rising tensions uh caused by uh the conflict in the Middle East by the war between Israel and Hamas um but it has also to be said that there is um a constancy amongst anti-semitic about constancy of anti-Semitic feeling ings in Germany coming mainly from the far right in this country um that is something that authorities have always warned about that in the past uh most of these anti-semitic incidents have been committed by extremists on the right of the political spectrum and that's something that has probably gone sort of merged into the background at the moment against the background of this current conflict but it's something that's always been there in German society and well have to end it there our thanks to political correspondent Hans
