5 months into the war in Gaza and deadly chaos around an aid Convoy has glaringly highlighted the desperation and climbing death toll among civilians the Carnage of inhumanity is something we haven't seen for decades my guest this week on conflict zone is Nabil Fami former Egyptian foreign minister and longtime Diplomat at what point does Egypt have no choice but to consider opening its border to Gins on humanitarian grounds have the shocking scenes of suffering brought this conflict to an inflection point nabami welcome to conflict Zone thank you tragic deaths around an aid Convoy in Northern Gaza have highlighted the desperation of civilians for food and the lack of security in The Enclave after everything that you've seen in the past days is it time for Egypt to open its border to civilians from Gaza the problem with opening the board of civilians is this would be participating in a premeditated consistent effort by the Israelis to uh decrease the density of Palestinians on their own territory and it's something which politically we will not do because we support the Palestinian State side by side with Israel uh we continue to take Palestinians in need of medical supervision or medical help uh we take those but a large scale uh uh number of Palestinians basically mean we're playing into these many hands but you know Egypt has certainly made that red line quite clear that it will not accept any forc displacement of Palestinians but how do you balance the humanitarian desperation I mean you know save the children just out this past week saying that we are quote witnessing a mass killing of children in slow motion because there is no more food left how do you how do you balance that with your red lines it's an absolutely great question uh we are in a very difficult situation we cannot allow Palestinians to starve we don't want them to be shot at at the same time we don't want to be forced into a position where we collaborate uh indirectly with Israelis by by decreasing the dens of Palestinians so what we're doing is providing as much assistance as we can through the Border we had an air drop also just uh about 48 hours ago and we continue to host negotiations with the Israelis and the americ cies to try to deal with all these issues but I guess my point is you know at what point does Egypt have no other choice morally than to open the Border because you know we know this is not a crisis of you're making but does Egypt need to do more to help the people on the ground I think we are doing quite a bit but yes I agree with you there will be a situation where if they're forced AC cross the border we will have to make very difficult decision but how we respond to we we clearly are not going to kill Palestinians but that being said uh it should not be interpreted as meaning push them across the border and we will acquest because pushing them across the border is not only a violation of Palestinian rights it's also by the way a violation of the Egyptian Israel peace agreement and that will have consequences yeah and um you know I'd like to ask you a little bit about what is happening right now on the ground at the border because there's been a lot of questions about that Egypt has been building some sort of security Perimeter at the border last month your foreign minister classified it as what he called maintenance on the border isn't Egypt planning an area to house Palestinians in case of an Israeli offensive on Rafa in know honestly I don't know exactly but let me tell you what I do know the area where there is construction was originally an area of unlicensed buildings they were taken down and people were moved out the government rebuilt that area and invited the Egyptians to go back to that area they have not yet gone back to that area and it's something has been going on for over a year you had the the Gaza breakout during the last five months so the pressure also became uh what are we going to do if the Palestinians are forced across the board uh we will have to deal with a very dire humanitarian situation but we will also have to deal with the situation where we will not in any way directly or indirectly condone Israel action that violates Palestinian rights in that respect but also that violates the Egyptian Israel peace agreement and that needs to be clearly understood yes so let me ask you a little bit more about the diplomacy that might be going on behind closed doors right now because I mean Israel's foreign minister has said that they have to and I'm quoting here deal with Rafa because they cannot just leave Haman there um and that it would coordinate with Egypt to address concerns about refugees what conversations do you think are happening right now between Egypt and Israel especially when it comes to you know potential incentives for example I mean you know money and incentives for Egypt to take refugees wouldn't hurt would it this is not an issue of money and incentives this is an issue we are committed to a two- State solution the two state the Palestinian part of that of the two states is Gaza and the West Bank if we were to to reduce the numbers there that would be very very dangerous some isra politicians in the cabinet have openly said yes we need to move Palestinians out of Gaza uh into Egypt or even into Europe and we'll find financing to do that so that's their declared policy we didn't make this up uh but we have made it also clear that we will not participate in this process uh and I can tell you that affects our national security and that's a violation of the Peace of taking it back to getting Aid in um airdropping of Aid is picking up even the United States has joined in there are currently discussions on how else to expand the flow and you know it's been reported that President Biden spoke last week with President D CI about urgency of negotiations and bringing more Aid into Gaza I mean as Egypt your next you're trying to get convoys in do you see the potential of anything shifting on the ground so that more Aid can enter yes I do see if there's a hostage a partial hostage change versus the incarcerated and a temporary ceasefire that will facilitate Aid going in uh the re most recent incident that we saw uh just two or three days ago this was Aid action you brought in and organized by Palestinians and Israelis but given that it was a conflict Zone Israelis themselves attacked the the group of people who had gathered around uh the the vehicles there so you can't have a sustained uh substantial amount of Aid going in in a war zone in a conflict Zone there's no really pure secure area so yes we want why are we hosting the negotiations on ceasefire and H exchange one of the reasons stop getting people killed but also allow for more effective humanitarian Aid right and just to pick up on one thing that you said there I mean the IDF has actually said that indeed they did fire but they didn't actually fire on individuals um who were seeking to get aid but again there's there's two sides of the story so I just want to highlight that that's the the perspective that they are bringing in in the official statement um let's take it back to the ceasefire talks because they they were due at the time of this interview they were due to kickoff um in Cairo Egypt and Qatar have been mediating between Israel and Hamas and your foreign minister has said in the past days that he's optimistic about a temporary ceasefire being reached before Ramadan what do you think that he sees that might point to optimism for a deal well again you have to ask Sam himself but let me tell you what I think he he means uh if you simply listen to the international uh rhetoric everybody under everybody has been telling the Israelis and Hamas let's have a SE before Ramadan they're worried about the situation on the ground humanitarian and political but they're also worried about it breaking out beyond the borders uh in the states uh on the on on Israel's borders so there's also the threat of expansion uh that's that is what I think we're seeing now again two points two caveats here one this is not a full ceasefire nor a full hostage exchange this is a partial hostage exchange versus those incarcerated and a temporary ceas so it will be a positive step towards a complete ceasefire you're not going to get resolution of the conflict or an ability to start rebuilding what has been destroyed unless you get a complete seire as one of the you know the the traditional mediators between these parties um talk with us a little bit about how you think the pressure on those parties might be right now because mean we have world leaders speaking out loudly against um the scenes of suffering right now in Gaza even the US is real strongest Ally seems frustrated do you see this as an inflection point in the crisis do you feel the mood could change the Dynamics ground again thank you for that question I think it does but it's an inflection point from either we we start a process of trying to deal with the humanitarian situation more substantially and hopefully then the Pol the politics the policies uh and the security situation or the inflection point will be that it we're going to move towards a highly volatile Regional context and I don't mean full-fledged Arab Israeli Wars but I do mean you see everything from tension in the r sea to the Lebanese border to the Syrian border stuff in Iraq what's happening inside Gaza problems on our border as well this is going to break out of hand so the inflection point is either we find a way to slow this process down and try to resolve it or it's going to break out beyond control so you've made the bridge there basically from the temporary ceasefire talks now um to something a little bit more longer termin there seems to be a lot of Will and diplomatic momentum we have to say from both Arab states and Israel's allies including the US and the UK to secure such a long-term lasting peace that would indeed include a two-state solution you know you you've seen over many decades the all of the previous efforts that have failed is something different this time es the Carnage of inhumanity is something we haven't seen for decades it was always a horrible incident in uh in inside Israel or among Palestinian territories including assassination of leaders by the way not by the other side but by their own people so we've seen that but to see five months 30,000 people killed at least because there are those under the rubble that we don't account for 70% of them are women and children and children starving we have not seen that in a very long long time so that's something which frankly I come from Egypt we were the first to have a peace agreement with the Israelis and that's almost 50 years ago 50 years after the first peace agreement with Israel to see not only the lack of conclusion of comprehensive peace completely but to see the level of killing and and and and and and counter violence is frankly quite shocking and it it it really Burns in my gut as have having been part of this process for so long and as and as you are coming from Egypt I'd like to ask you about um this Saudi Le group of Arab states that includes Egypt Jordan Qatar the UAE um which is reportedly now pushing this post-war plan that would include a reformed Palestinian Authority governing Gaza an irreversible path toward a two-state solution from the perspective of Arab diplomacy what could be offered to sweeten the deal for Israel because I mean you've highlighted the trauma of these societies the the violence the Bloodshed there's no appetite right now for a two-state solution in Israel after October 7th that that's why I mean when I let me talk about what I think can be done rather than what's on the table by the Arab group because I don't know actually how far they've gone uh I said crisis and conflict we need to I'll give you 10 quick points in 10 seconds ceasefire hostage exchange to incarcerated humanitarian support uh security Arrangements between Palestinians and Israelis in Gaza including a withdrawal of uh Israeli forces uh a a declaration uh recognizing inian State based on 6967 Palestinian State under occupation by the way I'm not saying it's it's established Palestinian State under occupation based 1967 a reaffirmation by the Arab countries of their Arab Beirut Summit where they said they will all have relations with Israel if there is uh uh an end of of occupation I want to put all of that under a security Council resolution every one of these points by the way is supported by all International Community I want to have that adopted by the by the security Council in an affirmative vote and then we go to the parties because that will also require by the way elections in Israel elections among Palestinians the establishment of the new government then let me ask you Palestinians yeah I mean it's it's you know you're presenting here a plan but I I I also want to ask you how you get that plan done with the mood that is currently on the ground the Israeli cabinet right now has said that any recognition of a Palestinian statehood in the wake of the Hamas Terror attacks on Israel on October 7th which as we know killed 1,200 people um and 250 were taken hostage they've said and I'm quoting here it would give a huge reward to unprecedented terrorism what's your response to that we're not dealing with one part of the problem rather than the other what I'm dealing here with is the whole issue and I'm not actually asking the Israelis and Palestinians to accept it at the beginning what I'm saying is that Us Egypt Russia China France UK you name it we've all supported two states of let's agree to this annotated package and go with it to the Israelis and Palestinians showing that that okay you have a ceasefire you'll have secur Israel has will have security Palestinians will have a relief from what's Happening you're going to have to establish a new government the Palestinians to deal with Gaza and the West Bank so we're dealing with the whole thing as to together and slowly within a two-year period we can get there if you go to the to the Arabs today because I know this is probably on your mind okay why can't the Arabs take charge of Gaza and manage that and provide security and that's a question which Egyptians have been asked for hundreds of times it's probably the most illogical irresponsible question anybody could think of because we will not be surrogates of Israelis I said they will preserve let me just continue but here's but I I just I need to follow up with you on that because you know and and ask you to actually respond to what Israel has put forward theyve set out this competing plan for postwar Gaza it does not include a two-state solution it does include overseeing Security in The Enclave you you've talked about security there um in fact Netanyahu says that Israel should have security control over the Philadelphia Corridor we know um that's that border zone between Gaza and Egypt do you see any circumstances you've talked about coming together do you see any circumstances under which Egypt would be willing to accept that absolutely not because that would basically mean so what are the Alternatives reoccupy from a security perspective this is my point yeah let me just let continue if you tell me that this 10-point plan or eight whatever number of points you want will ultimately lead to a Palestinian State down the road then you can get you you can and it will not involve Israeli security supervision over gas the Arab states are definitely ready to help rebuild not alone but they ready to help rebuild and will help train and create mechanisms for better Management in Gaza with the West Bank but they're not going to be surrogates of Israel security there's absolutely no way that they would accept that furthermore the reason why I said it's irresponsible if we were to put Egyptian forces or trainees in them we have a peace agreement with the Israelis and the Israelis intervene militarily what do we do shoot them we end up shooting Palestinians and Israelis it's not going to happen you've highlighted all the challenges but what are the Alternatives the alternative is give me a structure for a plan and then we can look at okay is is security managed by an Arab International contingent or International contingent Palestinian contingent with Arab oversight the details are are are plausible and we can look at Creative Solutions but not solutions that end up with the facto Israeli occupation of guys that can't happen but I I I look again we were the first to sign a peace agreement with Israel so that Israel wants security we accept that and we're looking at ways to achieve that but only based on you can't have security unless you solve the problem the problem is occupation and Israelis want more transparency and more effectivess on security that we can that we can look at provided that the principle of anic occupation is there let's let's move on because um you know Egypt has been also part of this rethink of politics in in Palestinians are Palestinian areas and part of you know the plans for potential governance um within Gaza itself how do you see the prospects for fragmented Palestinian politics to be able to unite after the war because I mean the Palestinian Authority president mmud Abbas is looking set to stay in his position along with his security Chiefs do you think Palestinians will accept that and that the PA might administer Gaza he's widely unpopular let let me put it this way the only way to really administrate Gaza in a way that's effective for Palestinians and ultimately also accepted by the Israelis uh without occupation is to have a Palestinian Palestinian a new understanding uh whether we like it or not Hamas had less support before October 7th now they have more support not because of what they did but because of these ready reaction to to what they did that has without a doubt eroded the PA's Authority the PA's credibility excuse me uh but we need to rebuild that it may require new leaders I'm not agnostic to that all I'm saying is that yes you're you're hitting the the point right on the on on the head we need to get Palestinians to look for a new form that's why I said we need elections and we need a new technocratic government to deal with both W back and guest there's a big debate also raging right now about whether or not um to what extent Hamas should be involved in all of that um Egypt for its part has acted as a mediator between Hamas and its foes Israel and fata as we've highlighted it's also worked with Hamas in recent years to counter an Islamic Insurgency in the Sinai but you know for you personally when you look at the situation after the horrors of October 7th can they really be part of a post-war scenario again depends on the scenario if it's a post-war scenario where we continue to have cycles of violence they'll be part of there's no question they'll be party because the asymmetrical balance even though many countries around the world consider them to be a terrorist organization the United States the EU Israel itself Listen to listen to me carefully here I didn't say a postm scenario where you have peace I said if we continue to have a cycle of violence they they they are others other forms of Hamas will continue to exercise what they pursue as their policies what I'm putting forward is I want to rebuild a Palestinian constituency that is effectively supportive and persuant to a two-state solution if parties don't want to accept that then frankly they can't qualify themselves be part of that process if they do they will have to change and let's also be cynically candid if you want who are we negotiating with now the PA they get the to change who is Israel negotiating with Now who is the US nego with now who is it nice question for you it's ham so they are there my issue is not whether they're there or not they are there my issue is how do I build a a a a scenario that allows for Egyptian for Arab isra peace including Palestinian isra peace those who don't want peace we will then work against but frankly uh on on the one hand we're being asked to talk to Hames whose relations with Egypt were always very very careful uh but we're asked to talk to them now and then we hear but they're not part of the Paradigm well okay so who should we talk to so then I mean you know when you look at all of the scenarios that are possible coming out of this first of all how do you think the war in Gaza ends and when do you see it ending uh do you think you'll see a permanent end to this conflict anytime soon I don't I don't I don't think you'll see a shortterm complete ending you will probably find get one hostage agreement temporary ceasefire and then another uh but then you will have outbreaks from the agreement and a regression uh neither side really is ready to make a strategic decision be that the the Israelis or Hamas uh and that's the that is what is required that's why at the beginning I said let's put together a package that we outside the region out we we beyond the parties except and then we start talking to the parties their center to see if we can sell this piece me I I I agree with you the sentiment today is not for a two-state solution but actually it's the only one that will get them out of this process as a former negotiator do I think I can go and and do it tomorrow of course not and if a two-state solution cannot be reached then what I mean what realistic alternative do you see to a two-state solution that can provide peace in the region or is there none uh there there is none what the other alternative is a one-state reality which will be a continuous conflict between Palestinians and Israelis because they both want national identity on a very small piece of land and neither side will give it up completely to the other furthermore uh if you don't allow them equal rights you will have conflicts within the one state so a two-state solution is extremely difficult a one state solution is completely impossible it is a one- state reality of contined conflict n um we have unfortunately run out of time we thank you so much for joining us here on conflict Zone thank you for your time thank you [Music] [Applause] a
