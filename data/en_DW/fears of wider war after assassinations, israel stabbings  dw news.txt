fears are growing of a wider conflict in the Middle East Jordan's foreign minister is to hold talks in Iran amid increasing tensions in the region tahran has been readying its response to the killing of the political leader of Hamas a group considered a terrorist organization by many countries and early on Sunday the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets into Israel in response to recent Israeli air strikes Ro fire lit up the sky in Lebanon as Hezbollah launched barges of ordinance at neighboring Israel across the border Israel's Iron Dome system intercepted the Rockets this time at least there were no reports of damage observers fear the recent killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders could have moved the needle closer to open conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and its Iranian backers as tensions ratcheted up long lines are forming at beirut's International Airport the US the UK and other governments are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible the US Embassy in Lebanon told its citizens to leave on any Ticket available after several Airlines suspended and canceled flights to Beirut I'm very very scared but I'll pull myself together and go I've already booked a ticket and now at the airport they're saying it's going to escalate so I'm scared honestly I'm very scared I'm scared I won't be able to leave this country and of dying here and yeah I'm scared meanwhile in Gaza the violence continues unabated this was the scene after an Israeli strike on a School Compound Israel claims the school was being used as a Hamas weapons fact but local officials say the building was housing gazin displaced by the [Music] fighting after they struck we came here and found the school and the houses completely destroyed and there were people who were injured further away on the streets behind the school they were killed and injured people many Israelis are calling for an end to the fighting and a deal to bring home the the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza but with negotiations seemingly stalled and tensions Rising that's looking increasingly unlikely for now in Israel two people have been killed and two others hurt in a stabbing attack police say a suspect who they described as a resident of the West Bank was shot and killed by responding officers the attack occurred in holand a city near Tel Aviv a police statement has called it a terrorist incident I have DW's Middle East analyst Shan rosanis here with me in the studio for more hi shanie let's begin with this stabbing near Tel Aviv this morning what does this tell us well it tells us we know it but it's coming more and more clearly the West Bank is boiling it's been simmering on low heat since October 7th and the last months have been quite intense and definitely last week you know Palestinians have learned the assassination both of De who was the leader of the military leader of Kamas who was already killed in the middle of July but was confirmed that this week and of course hania uh he was uh assassinated in tan these two are from the old members of Hamas are very well known very popular also in the West Bank and of course um we see that you know the tensions are high the emotions are high the frustration the anger West Bank also there's a high level of unemployment there's you know lives in the West Bank have been very hard since October and we see it infiltrating more and more into Israel and that's just one of the fronts Israel will have to probably face soon um as we're seeing more and more tensions rising and this is also partially what yir the leader of of Hamas and Gaza wanted you know when he launched the 7 of October attack in um you know he wanted to have as many fronts that Israel would have to face as possible you know he was hoping not just Gaza to be there but also West Bank what we've been seeing in Lebanon what we're seeing now happening in Iran in many ways for senoir this week is actually finally uh seeing the the wide extension of you know of the goals that he has set to himself you know wider uh wider conflict in the region seems to be serving his purposes so this does sound a fun sound like a fundamental change in Regional Dynamics here and it also sounds like you know the war in Gaza is is not the only active front anymore cor yes indeed I mean when Israel decided to Assassin one of the leading um military leaders of hisbah it was clear that hisa will have to you know respond more than just what we've been seeing the back and forth you know the fire exchanges we've been seeing since October but rather than you know uh there's a two separate almost you would say uh uh fights that hisbah is holding you know with Israel on one is the solidarity one with Gaza on the other is its own need to avenge you know the death of its own people and this will make things more complicated if you add uh Iran to that which also feel like despite the fact the Assassin was an was a Sunni Palestinian leader it was done on their land you know in one of the most secured compounds in the heart of their of the capital the day after inauguration of a new president it's clear Iran cannot you know just sit atly by and not respond so Israel what was was doing this week is basically saying uh anybody who thinks that we are winding our efforts down or we are trying to you know strive for a deal and bring this whole uh conflict uh you know to a close we're actually doubling in we're going all you know all in on all fronts and we're are trying to show we're not deterred we're not afraid of anybody or anything and we can deal also with multiple fronts you know happening simultaneously or at least this is the message is would like to send uh we will have to wait for the response to see how well Israel manages to actually deal with these threats yeah indeed sh we don't have much more time but just very briefly Iran uh now a few days after these assassinations already clear what kind of response we will see from we see it's not a it's not a gut response we see Iranians are taking their time they're very happy to keep Israel on edge to see everybody you know uh on high alert um probably we will see some some kind of a joint attack uh with some of the proxy militias that we know are connected to Iran um and I guess the threshold that we've seen in April of over 300 different missiles that were shot in Israel that would be the minimum they will start from and I guess they would have to try to spike it up and be a bit more efficient and effective in their uh targeting this time well thank you so much for joining me in the studio that is a ranes
