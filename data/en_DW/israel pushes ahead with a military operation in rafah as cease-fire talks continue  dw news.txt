Israel's military says it now has operational control of the gazen side of the Rafa Crossing it has released these images claiming to show armored vehicles in Rafa Israel's push into the area comes as as as an Israeli delegation heads to Egypt for more talks on a ceasefire proposal Hamas which carried out the October the 7th Terror attacks had already accepted the terms of the truth but Israel says negotiations need to continue DW correspondent Rebecca rers is in Jerusalem and she told us more about what is happening in Rafa right now well Anya we saw air strikes picking up uh on Sunday night over Sunday night and into Monday yesterday after a Hamas strike on the kamam Shalom Crossing we saw uh pretty significant targeted strikes pick up and there were fears that this were they were signs of an imminent ground Invasion as had been been being threatened and then last night uh we did in fact get confirmation or this morning I should say we had confirmation that uh there is now currently a targeted ground operation taking place in that southern city of Rafa we know we've even seen uh IDF released uh footage of tanks on the gazen side of that Raaz uh Gaza the gazen side of that Rafa Crossing excuse me uh and uh we just I just spoke to I was just on an call with the Israeli military they were briefing the media they were at pains to say that this at the moment at least is a precise and limited uh attack based on intelligence and that it was targeting specific areas in that Eastern Rafer area that they were sweeping that area that there was a special ops team sweeping the area that they were looking for the what the the intelligence says is Hamas operatives operating from within that area and that's what they say they you know was an indication when that strike came to that Kum Shalom area on Sunday night that it came from that area and that particularly the area they're targeting we know yesterday they gave about 100,000 people in that area evacuation orders to move towards uh a so-called humanitarian safe Zone closer to KH Yunis a little bit further north in the Gaza Strip though we know that for Palestinians who've been dealing with this now for seven months uh there is nowhere safe to go and that even some safe areas have been targeted in the past we don't know much more about the operation and how it will continue whether it will widen or how it will widen but we have seen that in other cities in Gaza that it starts off in a limited uh way and then and then spreads out but we don't have any more information this is an ongoing operation is reporting there from Jerusalem now as that Israel operation inside Rafa unfolds negotiations are expected to get underway in Egypt on a proposed ceasefire deal Israel says a plan put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators doesn't meet its demands Hamas had earlier agreed to the draft deal a small step towards possible peace that triggered celebrations inside the Gaza Strip a rare sight of Joy after 7 months of War Palestinians across Gaza celebrating in the streets as news reaches them that Hamas has agreed to a proposed ceasefire I haven't seen my children for seven months when I heard Hamas accepted a proposal I was very happy as we want to return to Gaza City we have no homes left but we are ready to sleep on the rubble it was gloomy this morning and the situation was terrifying honestly but now it's better and we hope for the best over the Border in Israel the families of hostages still helding Gaza also hope for a ceasefire they marched outside the House of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanding he also accept a deal for sure after Hamas told that he accept the deal we should say yes let's sit and talk and uh do anything we can do to bring the hostages home we call our government to accept this netanyahu's office says a delegation is returning to Cairo for further talks but has so far rejected the proposal saying it does not meet Israel's demands soon after Hamas accepted the deal the Israeli War cabinet voted to push ahead with a military operation in Rafa in southern Gaza Israel has told 100,000 Palestinians there to evacuate in the biggest sign yet of an imminent ground Invasion they've been told to move to alasi a so-called humanitarian Zone with little in the way of infrastructure Israel says it has expanded the zone to accommodate the new wave of arrivals Israel's allies have been warning against a military escalation in Rafa where more than 1 million gazin have sought shelter the fear now that a ceasefire won't be reached in time to stop any further military action and the inevitable cost to civilians trapped in southern Gaza and we can get some analysis from Daniel gak a Middle East expert and the Editor in Chief of zenith magazine he's joining us now from Riad welcome to you Daniel H given everything that is going on morning what do you think is likely to happen now with the ceasefire talks what can we expect well I think this is really the last chance with the current setup of negotiators to reach a deal and I think everybody knows this and we can see there has been some some conflicting and contradicting information about the status about the quality of the proposal and who agreed to it or not um but the fact that the Israeli government is sending at the same time while they are uh conducting strikes in Rafa a delegation to Cairo to negotiate this deal shows that it's very difficult for Netanyahu to get out of this proposal um yet last night there was some reports about Hamas agreeing to a to a ceasefire deal that Israel had not agreed to and that was not enough for Israel but at the same time it's quite difficult to imagine that uh the CIA director Bill Burns who has spent some time now in the Middle East in Qatar and in in Egypt who and who is responsible for negotiating this deal made a mistake or unclear communication with the Israelis so I think everyone knows what it comes down to it's the question if Israel is is able and willing to accept in exchange for the hostages a permanent ceasefire whatever they may call it and I think that's the target of the negotiators and that's why Netanyahu is hesitant to agree to because if he if he agrees to a permanent ceasefire and he calls it a permanent ceasefire then he would not reach his goal to uh to eliminate Hamas and he would not satisfy his Coalition partners and he would probably have to step down as a prime minister of Israel okay now Israel is talking about core demands though isn't it it says the terms of the deal are unacceptable they don't meet their core demands so so so what what are these core demands what is it that Israel is specifically referring to there well I don't know yet because I don't know the documents but my understanding of it is that the negotiators were trying to to let's say disguise this idea of a permanent ceasefire into a plan of phasing the deal uh three phases of six weeks of ceasefire which would then of course impede any further military operation because a political process would be on the way whereas Israel is insisting on the netan government is insisting on its right to to to achieve both goals which is the liberation of the hostages but also have the prerogative of if intervening militarily in the Gaza Strip and targeting Hamas and of course the Hamas leadership knows that for them the hostages are the only way they can still they can protect literally their lives and that's the only leverage they have so they would of course not agree to that and it seems that some sort of a permanent setup of a permanent ceasefire mechanism is now underway with the negotiators and since the negotiators I don't think they've made a mistake or have not clearly communicated this to either side I think also it's a tactical move by Hamas to to come out and say yes we agree to this because they wanted to make sure this happens before the uh military operation in Rafa escalates but at the same time I think um that the negotiators wanted this time to preempt Israel uh in particular the netan government to to as they say sabotage the deal because uh we've heard from the negotiators before that they were quite uh quite discontent about every time they were coming close to a deal it was sabotaged by either side and it seems that this uh negotiating strategy tried to preempt such a an act of sabotage if we could just come back to the issue of the hostages I mean if if Netanyahu agreed to a deal to bring some hostages back I mean this would surely help him regain some Trust among the Israeli public how important would that be for him I think it is immensely important for Israel to bring back hostages because you remember it was the first commitment and uh in the beginning his uh his like Daredevil strategy to apply full military pressure to go in with a full-blown military campaign and at the same time negotiate the release of the hostages worked astonishingly many people were skeptical about it because of course these goals are actually not really complimentary they are they contradict each other but of course when it comes to the end game and when Hamas has only like these hostages left and is the only way for Hamas to get out of this mess uh then of course you see that these goals run into each other and they become much more complicated and on the other hand many people in Israel uh believe that Netanyahu tried to prolong this crisis in order to stay in power as long as possible and the hostages were not his priority and I think he could not really debunk this I think he still many people believe that his political future is much more important than the release of the hostages and I'm not so sure if if when he gets a significant number of hostages released uh that the Israeli public will come down and say uh this is now netanyahu's success I think the question will come of why didn't he uh negotiate this earlier why didn't we get more people home and and what happened to those who who who died in custody in Hamas custody whereas they could have been surviving and could be with us today Daniel GAA
