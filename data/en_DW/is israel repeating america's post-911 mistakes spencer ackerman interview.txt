as soon as Hamas carried out its terrorist attack on Israel many sought to grasp its scale and Terror through historical comparisons the one that has clearly become dominant is 911 but there's another way to read this comparison and that's by focusing not on the attack itself but on the response to it the US lad war on terror resulted in hundreds of thousands of Civilian casualties in other countries and in the erosion of civil liberties within the US now as the is is Hamas War threatens to grow into a wider conflict President Biden himself has warned Israel not to repeat the same mistakes that America made after 911 to unpack this comparison we wanted to talk with Spencer Akerman he is a piter prize winner columnist at the nation author of the newsletter forever Wars and of the book reign of terror which is really a good examination of not just the 9911 attack itself but also of the Grim chain of consequences that followed this interview offers only one possible reading of a very complex situation but given akerman's extensive writing on this topic we really wanted to have his perspective on this comparison we recorded this interview on October 26th so keep that in mind as events quickly unfold and the context evolves many have compared the Hamas terrorist attack against the Israel 2911 as with every comparison the aspects that are similar are highlighted while the differences are pushed in the background you have written extensively on 911 so I really wanted to ask you what are the similarities between these two terrorist attacks and when we make this comparison what is that we are highlighting and what is that we are perhaps forgetting so the comparisons themselves to the actual attacks are somewhat superficial um they're better understood in terms of politics and less so in terms of um what you might call a military analysis of the strike first uh Hamas attacked on three domains air sea and land and then secondly Hamas carried out um violent raids against civilians um in nearby cim in southern Israel um there was no followon attack that Al-Qaeda had um from 911 what's similar is the sense of profound psychological shock that this caused to both societies that that had come to think of themselves as for more so in the American sense than the Israeli sense but firmly insulated against attacks of this uh of this sort there's another way to look at the the attack itself but on the resp response to the attack but before we do that let's revisit what the US response to 911 was so what is the legacy of the war on terror what did the US achieve the legacy of the war on terror is one of absolute devastation and disaster abroad and the uh erosion of American democracy at home the war on terror was a Doorway to the worst aspects of American History its history of settler colonialism and white supremacy given undercover of trauma a pathway to yield state power and to do so in a manner that devastated Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan Libya Syria Somalia all given both the tools and the cover of counterterrorism I I think it's pretty clear that in terms of its achievements abroad the war on terror was a failure the US left Afghanistan 20 years later defeated but I don't know if the effects at home are as clear can you elaborate on how the 9/11 response led to the erosion of civil liberties and Democratic institutions with some examples yes from the start the war on terror created an enormous surveillance drag net expanded the ability of law enforcement to collect records without warrants from judges specifying specific crimes Muslims around the country found themselves at the mercy of not just the Department of Homeland Security but also the FBI and local police forces all of whom had additional resources both money and material from counterterrorism fundings both from the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security and these were put to use surveilling imprisoning uh Muslim civil rights leaders Muslim Business Leaders everyday Muslims for the generation in many ways of informants in order to keep mosques and other community centers um suppressed as this went on increasingly this mood of um permitted and normalized nativism aimed against Muslims spread as these things always do these things inevitably expanded the aperture of the possible um allowed islamophobia and uh the politics of um minority suppression firmly into the Coalition that would become Donald Trump's magga Coalition and these are now enduring features of American political and social Landscapes so with this assessment in mind do you think that Israel is making the same mistakes absolutely Israel is making the same mistakes and America is complicit in permitting Israel to make the same mistakes out of 911 so what do I mean by that first of all the distinguishing military feature of the global war on terror is the pursuit not of achievable and art even articulable States but of the application of violence as a substitute for that with prevarications all along the way by American political and Military figures saying that you know a stable Victory is to be had you know it's some months down the road provided we stay the course maybe modify the course somewhat but fundamentally stay the course Israel is engaging in a Devastation of Gaza not a Devastation of Hamas Israel cannot destroy Hamas among the reasons we know this is because Israel did not destroy the PLO during two decades of occupation in southern Lebanon Israel ultimately made Hezbollah stronger and itself less and less able to safely extricate after Israel did in fact extricate in 2000 by 2006 after hez Bala took some hostages in Northern Israel very similar to what we've seen um after um on uh October 7th Israel launched yet another devastating war on Lebanon to expressly destroy Hezbollah that failed as well and now Hezbollah is both strong as it's ever been and aiming an enormous rocket and missile Arsenal as a potential second front supported by Iran on um Israel's northern border it would be Folly it would be the deliberate disregarding of extremely recent history to expect Israel's response in Gaza to October 7th to be anything but Israel has told um Palestinians to flee the North to the south of Gaza and then bombed the south of Gaza Israel's response to October 7th was Collective punishment extending and constricting The Siege that is existed in Gaza for 16 years keeping food fuel water life-saving medicine out of Gaza um nearly a week ago Gaza had run out of um uh anesthesia at its hospitals Gaza long since ran out of fuel um Israel's response is a collective punishment it is not aimed at Hamas there is no Theory at work here of what a victory over Hamas let alone a decisive victory of Hamas looks like and it also raises the question that the United States decided um after 911 it didn't have to confront out of its trauma which is what is the day after Victory look like what is the day after this operation is finished look like is Israel going to reoccupy Gaza it doesn't want to do that there was no constituency for that even among the most right-wing um government in Israeli history before October 7th is it going to have a discredited Palestinian Authority on behalf of Israel administer the West Bank is it going to make an agonizing choice that politically it has cut itself off from in terms of Permitting uh Gaza to still be governed by Hamas because that might be a more stable way of extricating Israel from this ground operation that we're fearing or is Israel going to commit ethnic cleansing all of this supported by the United States those are the only four outcomes there are here uh you mentioned the United States so I want to get right into that Biden said that he doesn't want Israel to repeat America's mistakes but are America's actions going in that direction absolutely they're going in that direction it was very conspicuous to me um that Biden spoke about not making the same mistakes which he said were mistakes of Rage after 911 first that he didn't detail what those mistakes actually are he also said we got Justice I don't really see there being much Justice out of by a conservative estimate killing 900,000 people creating millions of refugees even a 2019 Army study US Army study said quite possibly the only beneficiaries of the war on terror were Iran whose position throughout the Middle East was strengthened and then secondly after meeting with the Israeli War cabinet attending an hours long meeting of the war cabinet Biden came back and made a speech to the American people that detailed not at all the barest theory of what Israeli Victory is and how it's achieved what the end state is and its pathway all of this is deeply reminiscent of the war on terror and that ought to be a cautionary tale because there is still time to stop a ground Invasion I want to make sure that we leave some space for some Israeli uh narratives here and one of them is that it's easy for people sitting in Berlin or New York to condemn Israel's overreaction but when you're dealing with terrorists you cannot be softed what do you think how did the terrorists get there the terrorists got there if you want to take the most immediate example of a policy by the current Israeli Prime Minister to permit Gaza with funding flowing in from Qatar uh to be governed by Hamas for Hamas to govern Gaza to keep gazin under hamas's thumb so that the Palestinians could be divided and in that division Israel would not have to divest itself of the West Bank this was deliberate Israeli policy that turned out to be catastrophic and I have loved ones in Israel my people I love here in the United States have loved ones in Israel I am Jewish I feel this very acutely this is a predictable outcome of this policy that we have seen manifest throughout Israeli history the reason why the Israeli government did that is to make sure that it can hold on to the West Bank rather than deal with a final status negotiation for the just causes the just aspiration of the Palestinian national project only when th those just aspirations are credibly addressed will we actually have safety for the people I love in Israel as well as for the people I love in Palestine everything beside that is a very real human consequence we of course have to keep space for the fact that Hamas committed a terrorist atrocity that there are innocent people kidnapped in tunnels right now and that there were innocent civilians massacred by Hamas in southern Israel there is only one stable way to stop that from happening and it is to credibly address adjudicate and reach a final status a just pece for the just aspirations of Palestinian National Liberation and Israeli safety yeah although not every path the US took after 911 at least According to some critics looks mistaken in hindsight and for example the decision to destroy the Islamic State rather than seeking coexistence with it many considered a good call I understand that I am sympathetic to it it is also important to ask the crucial question how did the Islamic State get there in the first place and the answer is the 2003 invasion of Iraq where before there was the barest minimum of an Al-Qaeda Presence by the very next year Al-Qaeda had established the most nihilistic murderous capable and aggressive franchise in its entire existence to the point where Osama Bin Laden himself had to plead with the head of al-Qaeda and Iraq to stop killing so many Muslims the United States thought it destroyed Al-Qaeda and Iraq it never in fact did them that it gave it a second chance at life in uh American Military prisons and then when uh the war on the civil war in Syria became a disaster next door these two strains merged together and created the Islamic State the American supported war against the Islamic State was a direct consequence of America having to clean up an earlier mess of the global war on terror what is the outcome of the destruction of the Islamic State there are at least 55,000 people in an open air prison supported by the US in eastern Syria the size of a small town is held in a prison where the ultimate disposition of those inside men women and children is entirely unclear this is a powder keg we have not perhaps seen the end of where the war on Isis is as as as horrific a thing as Isis is another iteration may still be possible and unless the US deals with these fundamental material conditions that make all of these policy decisions that make all of this worse we have no reason to expect them to get any better we can only expect periods of quiet that last however long they last I know we have reached the end of the conversation but I really wanted to ask you one last thing you make a point uh that I would like to highlight that the 9/11 attack was so hideous that presenting a context to try to understand it was seen as outrageous can you elaborate on that and are we seeing the same now too yes so uh one of the most important aspects of 9911 politics is to make scandalous the presentation of context uh after 911 uh people like the um American intellectual Susan sag were shouted down and driven out of respectable public and media conversations because she very delicately wrote In The New Yorker that the 911 attacks came not out of thin air came not out of as the President of the United States put it a hatred of freedom but instead as a response to Decades of American violent and exploitative policy in the Middle East you don't to sympathize with Al-Qaeda to recognize that it had a political agenda that it articulated that came out of grievances with American policy that are shared far beyond people who would ever be sympathetic to Al-Qaeda she was shouted down so that those conditions did not have to be credibly addressed by policy makers the result was the narrowing of respectable opinion that became a Glide path to the Wars and all of the devastations that that they existed the exact same thing is happening after October 7th um both in Israel and America the refusal to accept the humanity of Palestinians and we have seen the Hideous consequences of this not just in Gaza but also in the United States where a six-year-old boy in Illinois Fida Alf was murdered by his own landlord who had been ingest ing nonstop media narratives dehumanizing the Palestinians and killed him and put his mother in the hospital by screaming you Muslims have to die we're right back to the darkest days after 911 is there something that I didn't ask you that you would like to add to the conversation all I would say is these are choices that American and Israeli policy makers are making after 911 there was a presentation by politicians and journalists that war was the only answer that there was no alternative that America had to militarize and transform its own understandings of the relationship between freedom and Security in a new post 911 world that was always a lie it led to a disaster and we don't have to make those same choices a second time Spencer thank you so much I really appreciate you taking the time thank you so much Chris
