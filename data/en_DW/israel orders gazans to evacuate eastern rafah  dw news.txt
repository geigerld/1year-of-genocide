Israel's Army is calling on residents of gaza's southern city of Rafa to evacuate to a humanitarian area ahead of a possible offensive the Israel Defense Forces say people in Rafa's East should move to a refugee camp west of Han Yunis on the coast more than 1 million displaced Palestinians have taken shelter in Rafa since the war broke out now despite growing alarm over an assault Israel has said that an offensive there is key to eliminating Hamas in the wake of the October the 7th Terror attacks Let's cross straight to DW correspondent Rebecca RS who joins us now from Jerusalem hi Rebecca tell us more about what's going on in Rafa right now well Anya we had conf confirmation from the Israeli military just a little while ago to say that indeed this evacuation order was beginning to be carried out just uh shortly before coming on air we were told that the Flyers that is the the part of the process of these evacuation orders had been dropped over the area uh advising the citizens there to evacuate that area that Eastern Area this is not an entire evacuation of uh the whole Rafa area but it's what they're calling a limited scope operation so we're seeing that Eastern part the very corner of Rafa down by the Israeli and Egyptian border that is the area that is being asked to move on they're being asked to move to to an area a humanitarian area that has been expanded uh an area called alasi but also that will reach areas of deala and Han yunas uh now the Israeli military say that there's a field hospital at least one if not more field hospitals in that area being set up and there will be more humanitarian Aid uh and services there provided for people who are going to be evacuating there uh of course we've seen these evacuation orders and how they've been carried out in the past and many people of course have been saying for weeks that they don't want to evacuate again they don't want to leave this rougher area again many have evacuated several times already from other parts of the Gaza Strip and they're exhausted nor do they necessarily trust that they will be out of Harm's Way we have seen in the past that some of these evacuation areas have also been uh you know targeted uh in in strike so people fearing very very nervous about what's happening they're being asked to do in Rafa that's about all we know at the moment it should affect about 100,000 people that's the other thing that the Israeli military said this morning that they're looking to move around about 100,000 people on you all right Rebecca stay with us we're going to take a look at what's been happening with the ceasefire talks uh between Israel and Hamas we'll come right back to you these Israeli protesters are demanding their government push on with its plan for a military operation in Rua in southern Gaza many of them are relatives of soldiers killed in the war they believe a RAR incursion is the best way to pressure Hamas to release the Israeli hostages it still holds visiting troops in the central Gaza Strip Israeli defense minister yav Galant indicated that he agrees with the protesters there are concerning signals that Hamas is not planning to accept any deal or agreement with us this means an operation in Rafa and in the entire Gaza Strip in the very near future galant's sentiments were echoed in a video message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu capitulating to hamas's demands would be a terrible defeat for Israel it would be a great victory for Hamas Iran and the excess of evil it would show great weakness to our friends and enemies bring the next War closer and push the next peace agreement further away but outside netanyahu's office in Jerusalem dozens of protesters made it clear that they don't share his feelings we are calling for um saying yes to the deal uh to the hostage uh release deal to release as many hostages as we can while they're still alive the hostages are there for 212 days the deal we are talking now about about now is a humanitarian deal it's for elderly people it's for sick people it's for young women and they can't last there anymore we know that hostages are dying all the time and if we don't release them now we don't know who we'll have to release later a temporary truce could also avert a humanitarian disaster across the border in Gaza the UN says parts of the strip are already experiencing famine earlier on Sunday Israel closed km Shalom a key border crossing used by Aid convoys after Hamas militants attacked it all right we're back with Rebecca RS in Jerusalem so Rebecca if we look at the situation no sign of any breakthrough in the ceasefire talks you were telling us about what's happening with the evacuations earlier does all of this mean that an offensive is imminent well it certainly does look that way Ana that is what the Israeli government and military have been saying for some time now that if this deal wasn't able to come to fruition that they would be going into ruer in fact prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu say he he would direct the Army to go into Rafa whether or not there was a deal now we know Hamas are not willing to accept a deal that doesn't include something that would move towards a permanent ceasefire Israel is saying that there is absolutely no way they will agree to offering a permanent ceasefire in exchange for a deal so we are at that stalemate I think it's wrong to say the talks have completed completely collapsed the CIA Chief the US CIA Chief is headed to Doha to try to continue those talks but yes we definitely are at a at a point that we have been hearing about and you know many people have been fearing would go ahead and happen and that does seem to be what we're looking at what we're facing now that these talks do seem to have been uh stalled once more and agreement cannot be reached it certainly looks like this Rafer offensive could be imminent as the Israeli military say they will do it in stages uh we yet to see what what that looks like Ana and I wanted to ask you about the the closing of the Southern Kem Shalom Crossing what more can you tell us about that well the Kum Shalom uh Crossing was the IDE of say was targeted last night uh earlier in the evening last night three soldiers were in fact killed in that in those strikes I believe there were about 10 uh projectiles fired that's the estimate and there were retaliatory strikes the fire the fire came from the Israeli military is saying it's coming that came from the Rafa area and that area was targeted we know that 12 people were killed in strikes in that Rafa area last night and indeed that caram Shalom Crossing was closed we have no more information on when that might reopen but it is in the zone that is being evacuated so it's unlikely to open anytime soon the Israeli military saying that they've they're working on other borders and it will not affect uh the am the amount of Aid coming into Gaza Rebecca thank you that's DW's Rebecca Ritter's reporting from jur Jerusalem now Israel has ordered the closure of the local offices of the Qatari broadcaster Al jazer the channel has also been removed by Israel's main cable

reasons behind the decision are political this is very dangerous decision against the jazer and against the international media at all because at least it's clear that they want to uh prevent from any
