the UN General assembly's recent vote on a ceasefire in Gaza has had overwhelming backing yet Israel still insists it will continue with its air and ground offensive against Hamas which is classified as a terror group by the US EU and other countries the Israeli military has now designated a narrow strip in South Gaza called al- muui as a humanitarian Zone it has directed Gins to relocate there but the area lacks the basic necessities of shelter and water for thousands of displaced refugees a strip of barren land crammed with desperate gazin seeking safety andas mosle heed Israel's call to flee to almasi in southern Gaza when her home was bombed she now lives with her children in a thin plastic tent there is no place for us to wash our pray if we want to wash our kids hands there is no place for that there is nowh we can bake or get bread there is no bakery or Supermarket it's a completely remote area anas and other Palestinians in almasi describe it as dangerously overcrowded and lacking in basic necessities like shelter medical services and food but Israel has described elmasi as a humanitarian Zone and issued orders for civilians to evacuate there saying Aid will arrive we've been making again with everything we have our uh in our capabilities every effort we can to facilitate the movement of civilians in the south in order to mitigate civilian casualties and we're doing everything we can to set the conditions for the humanitarian Zone in the almasi coastline the area makes up just a tiny fraction of the densely populated Gaza Strip about about 14 Square km Israel has changed the exact borders of the safe Zone several times and some evacuation orders have not mentioned almasi at all Aid groups have called Israel's offer of safety a cruel Mirage and say the situation in alasi is dire if you imagine a car park of people stacked on top of each other still without a toilet still without a drop of water so here you would absolutely have have S zones that are zones of disease that would become in any same projection zones of death so it's such an important narrative to to break this idea that people can just go to a safe Zone if they wish there is absolutely nothing safe about this the gazin Sheltering in almasi say they have found no sense of safety there we spent all night listening to the bombing we're living between life and death at any moment it may be our turn and our it's turn to Die the United Nations says more than 85% of gaza's population has been displaced by the war and that here in al- muasi like everywhere in Gaza there is nowhere truly safe to go and journalist hzim balha told me about the status of humanitarian Aid delivery meant to reach people in al- moesi well this is the problem not only in Al Moi um across the Gaza St we are talking three places like North Gaza uh the South and Al maasi North Gaza is suffering from uh uh uh the the shortage of everything um um according to the people I talk to and the reports coming from there there is no nothing um um from uh anything um delivered there except the time when there was the Bose the south is like um we are talking about 1.9 million people are living in a very small area and the need is very high for the alasi al- maasi is um it's um a designed place a small place not everybody is there so some organizations are delivering aid but it's not enough of course now the idea of keeps calling Al Mesi a humanitarian Zone I wonder if the Israeli Army is doing anything to facilitate that well what what Israeli Army is doing is calling people to go there um and and they said from the first day of when ask the people to go or um to evacuate U to the South but um what they are doing is like um according to the people no Boman there but I mean it's not clear who's responsible for it Ona is said like we have no responsibility for that area it's not under our our uh Duty other organizations as well they are saying we we don't know um but still some some some Charities and some organizations only delivering some food and some Aid which is people still say it's not enough and especially in this um rainy and cold weather ham is there any place in Gaza that's actually safe for civilians um this is the question I have been asked like all the time uh of course not um there is no shelters I mean like under I mean uh proteced shelters as a proper shelter for gazans um um um many people were killed or some at least according to the officials about 40 or even more per of the casualties were from the south where the people asked to leave um uh to and and and and um many people were displaced from the north and they were killed in the South um um a huge number of people were um matching this case um all the people in Gaza say no no safe place of course there is some places less danger than others especially the areas where um the ground invasion is taking place the UN General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly for a ceas fire and President Biden has criticized Israel for its Court indiscriminate bombing in G G do people in Gaza think that the world is on their side uh in Gaza they care about first about um um the basic needs that they uh they want at this level second they call for an immediate ceasefire um um third they they uh they complain and and um criticize the whole world um um because they are not doing enough for them whether helping them in this circumstances or pushing Israel um to stop um the hostilities um they think they are abandoned uh isolated and they left alone uh this is the common thing that I hear from people uh ordinary people across the Gaza Strip uh of course there are some some efforts every day that when I'm talking to people there and they ask me what what what's happening is there a sign of a season fire or something um people talking about um but definitely they feel that they are abandoned and alone we'll leave it there for the time being thanks so much for joining us journalist hzim Bala in Aman thank you all right let's get more on this from Peter lenana spokesperson of the Israeli Defense Forces he joins me from Tel Aviv Mr lenana US President Joe Biden says Israel is carrying out quote indiscriminate bombing in Gaza what is the ID of doing to change that good morning V indeed the IDF is continuing its efforts in order to dismantle and Destroy Hamas and make sure that they never have the power again to conduct a brutal Massacre as they did on the 7th of October we are very attentive to our American Allies specifically the administration and also from a military to military perspective and we are listening very carefully to their messages their messages are in line with our overhauling goal of of dismantling and destroying Hamas and of course we are operating within the the foundations within the framework of the laws of armed conflict our military activities are uh targeted at hamas's infrastructure in order to dismantle and Achieve our goals we understand that but then what are you doing to not bomb Gaza indiscriminately as the US president was pointing to there the IDF does not conduct indiscriminate fire I would argue that the reality on the ground and we have Rel released extensive footage that DW has been broadcasting over the last two months uh of precision strikes the strikes are specific targets at strikes that are based on intelligence based on understanding based on Military necessity as in and in accordance with the laws of one conflict then why so many Civ sorry for interrupting sir then why are so many civilians dying we will continue our war in order to achieve our goals and REM remove the threat of Hamas the civilian casualties and every single one of those is a an individual tragedy and a tragedy for the community and the people of Gaza right um they are nevertheless based out of the understanding of hamas's concept of operations Hamas have intentionally positioned its capabilities all of its capabilities beneath hospitals in schools in mosques um in uh in and around un facilities uh in residential areas they're doing it exactly to exasperate the civilian Strife our goal is not to strike civilians on the contrary we're going out of our way to and sometimes putting ourselves at risks to to evacuate civilian areas so that we can conduct our strikes against Hamas exactly and as as expected of us you are evacuating a number of civali civilians I'd imagine in southern Gaza to al- muui is that correct or are there other evacuation zones as well um so we've throughout the course of this war in the last two months we've evacuated people from different locations to safer locations to get them specifically out of H's way precisely because how Hamas has established Lo centers of could you just tell us which are these safe locations the safe as I said it depends on specific locations that it's not only one location but there are when there are operations under conduct when there are operations taking places in specific locations like in against specific Target again in kanun so we evacuate that specific area and tell people where to go specifically the un's emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffith said last week and I'm sorry again for interrupting he said last week there is quote no place safe for civilians in southern Gaza is he lying I would say that the UN need to be part of the solution and not part of the problem telling Israel not to defend itself not to protect itself not to change the Paradigm in uh with in relations to Israel and Gaza is unacceptable for Israel we won't sit back and not protect Israeli civilians because Hamas are hiding behind Palestinian civilians that is an absurd expectation from us our responsibility is to change the Paradigm our responsibility is to make sure that that what on the S of October can never ever happens need to be part of solving this and alleviating the situation that is precisely why as you correctly reported we are increasing the efforts of the humanitarian Aid the access today we will have another 200 uh trucks which will access into Gaza and this is a number that has been increasing day by day unfortunately it's not the Israeli side that are preventing it but rather what we're seeing this morning right that Hamas are not opening the the Palestinian side of Rafa and not facilitating the access of the humanitarian itself so we need to ask ourselves again why is Hamas preventing humanitarian Aid people of Gaza why is Israel not opening the Kim Shalom Crossing for trucks to cross through K Shalom is closed K Shalom is closed precisely because Hamas decided to attack Israel the the goods are being inspected in the is on the Israeli side and they are continuing to the Egyptian side where they then they can be processed by by the Palestinians in Rafa we'll leave it there for the time being thank you so much for joining us today Peter Lena IDF spokesperson thank you sir good
