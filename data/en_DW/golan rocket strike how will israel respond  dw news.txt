Israel's security cabinet has met amid growing fears of an escalation of the conflict along the Israel Lebanon border prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the meeting to discuss expanding their response to Saturday's deadly rocket strike on the Israeli occupied Golan Heights let's get some context on this from military analyst Frank ledwich Frank good to see you almost a day later we've still got conflicting accounts about what has happened here Israel saying it has evidence that Hezbollah carried out the attack but Hezbollah denying any involvement when you look at this case could you talk us through which scenarios seem likely good evening CLA there are a number of strange issues about this this attack first of all as you saw in the report it's the Drews community that received it secondly it's in the Gan Heights or the Jalan as they call it on the Syrian side and it's internationally Syrian territory uh similarly on the Israeli side it's difficult to see any alternative than this being a hes attack the only possible attack I can or the only other possible explanation I can think of it's a an anti-aircraft missile going AR but I don't think that squares with the evidence we've seen so uh conceivably perhaps a rogue group or some form of accidental targeting um either way we see a mass casualty event and the possibility now of of some degree of escalation as I said it is the first time that Hezbollah has Den denied an attack of the many hundreds of attacks they've made on Israel over the past few months which which says something I suppose but it's a mystery no question about it indeed as you say either way Israel has vowed to strike back hard against Hezbollah what do you expect that this might look like well you saw then some there some air strikes or some footage of air strikes and that's been going on now that kind of activity for the last uh well nearly a year isn't it now it's nine months or so and Israeli sources have told me that they have killed about a quarter of senior HB Hezbollah leadership in strikes like that so the kind of escalation we're likely to see I think is not mass escalation we're not I don't think we're going to see a huge War erupt over this for the simple reason that it's in neither side's interests and on neither side would such a war have support but what we will see is an increase in rhetoric and in the scale and intensity of Israeli air attacks must be remembered that a large proportion on the other hand of is the Israeli armed forces are deployed to the northern border and have no doubt at all that at very short notice they could they could conduct major operations in southern Lebanon but that would be disastrous and catastrophic I think for all sides and all sides know it so if it is in neither Sid's interests as you say I'm curious why you think we are now in response to this specific attack seeing Israel vowing such a quick and and hard retaliation against Hezbollah no there'll be a quick and hard retaliation but I don't think it'll take the form of the kind of attack we saw in in early earlier in the century in 2006 where for armed divisions entered the country although the Israelis could certainly do that what we'll see is an increase in int intensity on attacks on pre pre pre-targeted or pre-identified targets such as commanders and most importantly missile launching sites and we we we have to remember the Israelis have been identifying these sites now for for nearly well certainly 15 years they're they're fully aware of where many of them are and the main threat posed by Hezbollah isn't the 50,000 or so troops that they have well trained and experienced though they are it's the missile Force they can deploy which the Israelis acknowledge that would cause major casualties in Israel work to be deployed but it's essentially a One-Shot deal for hesah and they know that too so yeah we'll see a continuing attacks on high value targets and missile sites but not I think a huge intervention such as the kind we've seen early earlier in the century
