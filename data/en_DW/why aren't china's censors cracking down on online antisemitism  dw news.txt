all around the world including right here in Germany countries are grappling with a rise in both anti-semitic violence and rhetoric following the October 7 Hamas Terror attacks on Israel that sentiment is also being seen in China anti-jewish hate is sweeping across online platforms there people are praising both Hamas and Adolf Hitler for example and posting anti-israel abuse in a country that normally heavily censors its internet those comments are largely being allowed to stay up I'll be speaking to our China analyst in a moment but first here's a look at the situation at this press conference in Europe there is grief and anguish for a Chinese Israeli women kidnapped in the October 7th Hamas terror attack but in China an interview by Noah aamani's mother met with hateful responses online the most liked comment said I don't want to pay attention to her even more anti-semitic attacks have flooded China's directly censored internet since the Israel Hamas War erupted on way a micro blogging platform like X some nationalist influences with millions of followers compared Israel's bombing on Gaza to the Holocaust in World War II some comments praised the late German dictator AR of Hitler and his persecution of Jews and on a map widely used in China only the City Jerusalem has been labeled the country named Israel has disappeared the Israeli Embassy temporarily closed its comment section over abusive post and this Diplomat publicly expressed disappointment publicly the Chinese government has repeated its STS against online hate speech China's laws unequivocally prohibit promoting extremism ethnic hatred discrimination and violence via the internet but generally Chinese censors wipe out online content not approved by the government yet anti-semitic comments related to the October 7th Terror attacks by Hamas have lingered for weeks we can break this down now with DW news Asia analyst Clifford Co and Clifford hi there I guess it's important to point out that anti-Semitism online isn't just a problem in China but how widespread is it there well I think with China um because it's such a big country when you get um examples like anti-Semitism online you get big numbers as well because it's such a huge online population there um we saw last month how the state broadcaster China central uh television uh broadcast a clip showing um about what it said was Israeli influence in the US elections and it said that um 3% of the population was is was Jewish is and it controls 70% of the wealth which is one of these tropes anti-semitic tropes that's out there um a clip of that got 120 million views so it's it's very um um it's very uh widespread to that extent on the other hand you don't really see that much anti-Semitism um in my time there I you would see sort of stereotypes about um anti-em about uh Israel and about the Jews but they'd often be about business Acumen and these sort of things but they wouldn't have been hostile in any way so in some ways what happens in China is that things sort of pick up pace and they pick up heat and um until now you've seen more examples of anti- um anti-muslim Behavior particularly in in shinjang where you've had a million um Muslims incarcerated you've had imams with having their beard shaved and um being forced to drink alcohol because of of China's repressive policies in in shinjang so in some ways I don't think anti-semitic um online behavior is typical as such but it's certainly taken on a new Pace uh since since the recent uh Hamas attack on Israel yeah I want to get on to that if we can sort of take a bit of a broader look spill out for us what is China's official position on Israel and the Palestinians and then this this wider conflict that you mentioned well I think historically uh China has been very Pro Palestinian the People's Republic of China so the communist China has been very Pro um Pro Palestine um Chairman Mao Zedong uh helped support the Palestinian Liberation Organization during the 70s there's in the 80s a group of Israeli soldiers found all these documents um you know Guerilla instru instruction books from China um there's always been sort of backing as as an agent against what what China described as imperialism um and also in China's anti-us stance which has been fairly common for many years h in recent years that's changed though the attitude to Israel has become much more uh positive because of technological issues primarily uh Israel has been able to help uh China's uh Ambitions in terms of building up its its technological prowess and things like that so it's become much more Pro but in the last while we've seen um we've seen a a different definite change in stance how do you think then these positions feed into a public sentiment among Chinese people in particular the anti-Semitism that that you've been talking about well I think one of the big factors that we we've seen recently has been um growing nationalism in China and that nationalism tends to manifest itself as being anti- us and Israel has seen very much as a very close Ally of of the US so I think a lot of it is feeding out of that um in some ways uh it's kind of been almost weaponized to a certain extent and um we've also seen China's growing closeness with Russia with Iran with these other uh actors who are very anti-israel so um a lot of these things are kind of coalescing together and it's it's feeding into a broader Coalition um of of thought within China that would be anti-israel China's internet sensors are known of course to be very very rigorous but it seems as we've seen in that report not in this particular instance why do you think that and and what could that signal well I think with China the the level of control of the internet is total I mean it's very very if there's anything sensitive it can be taken down anything sensitive that gets left up there you have to presume there's some kind of tcid approval either for the sentiment in the message that's left up there or whether they just want it out there to create a debate but um basically if there's anything that they feel harmful to Chinese interests it will be removed and within hours so that would SU suggest that there is some kind of interest in maybe while China says you know it it's neutral it still hasn't condemned Israel's attack on on uh sorry um hamas's attack on Israel and um you know so it its neutrality seems to be not the neutrality that it appears and a lot of that can be seen with the way that um these comments that are left online are left online Clifford I just want to look back and turn our attention and finally to the Middle East China has had some success there as a mediator particularly in the case of Saudi Arabia and Iran how is it positioning itself in terms of the Israel Hamas conflict well I think um we've saw in the Ukraine conflict that China is is Keen to put itself forward as a as a broker there uh and it's similarly suggested that it could perhaps be an honest broker in the in the relation in the um Israel uh Hamas conflict however this is slightly undermine just as it was in Ukraine by the fact that its interests it's not entirely neutral um like we were saying that it hasn't it hasn't condemned uh the Hamas attack on Israel and um it talks very much more about the bombing of Gaza um so its focus is slightly different just as in Ukraine its focus was much more uh even though it says it's neutral there it's a pro- Russian neutal neutrality uh sort of a tacid support and I think that undermines China's role as a possible mediator despite its successes as you point out in other areas of the Middle East so something will have to change within the chi within China's approach to the Middle East if it's going to be seen as a as a an honest broker there great to get your insights dwe news Asia analyst Clifford coer and cord
