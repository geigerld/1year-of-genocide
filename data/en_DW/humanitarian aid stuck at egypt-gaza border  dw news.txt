the race to free a child after Israeli shelling in central Gaza The Rescuer efforts were in vain the child another casualty of the conflict other gazin have heeded warnings and fled South after Israel issued an evacuation order for more than 1 million residents of Northern Gaza families are taking shelter at United Nations schools many traumatized from the journey we are living under stress we haven't seen anything like this before it's huge a massive danger children as you can see where should we take them especially today when we fled our house we saw burnt out cars along the way thank God we're safe and that we've reached the South near gaza's border with Israel Israeli forces are assembled for a ground incursion Israel has vowed to destroy the Palestinian Hamas militia after its unprecedented Terror attacks on Southern Israel but Hamas has taken hostages into Gaza complicating Israel's Invasion plans on Saturday the Israeli Army said it had recovered the bodies of hostages killed just inside the Gaza Strip perimeter we need to be very delicate around this issue we are concerned about the hostages uh we are continually working in order to identify and the process of identifying bodies that have been mutilated and burned is very tedious and very timely I want to be respectful to them yes of course we did say yesterday that there were Israelis retrieved in the in the ground operations Israel has vowed to uphold its Complete Siege of Gaza until all all hostages are freed Pope Francis has called for humanitarian corridors to help those under sieg in Gaza the Pope's appeal comes as Israel readies its troops for a ground assault and retaliation for unprecedented attacks it suffered a week ago as we have heard now Pope Francis has also renewed his call for the release of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas militants I am again appealing for the release of the hostages and I strongly urge that children the sick the elderly women and all civilians should not fall victim to the conflict humanitarian law must be respected especially in Gaza where it is urgent and necessary to guarantee humanitarian corridors and help the population Ahmed al- mandari is the World Health organization's Regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean and I asked him how far it has been possible in these days to evacuate patient answering your question I'd like just to share with you numbers uh there are around 22 hospitals in that area in which Israel ask you know them to be evacuated uh hosting around 2,000 patients many of them are on ventilators um many of them are on regular uh 24 hours you know medications like cancer therapy renal dialysis unfortunately what you know this represents around 61% of the bed capacities in the whole of Gaza the other hospitals on the other side you know in which they were pushed to move are already full 99.9% full capacity there are no IU beds there are no beds in the ordinary WS operation theaters are fully working 24 hours with a severe shortage of supplies uh there's shortage of water and electricity in the coming few hours you know if no solution is coming out in addition to that clear you know I'd like just to share that there are around 120,000 people in Gaza Strip you know suffering from different types of chronic illnesses like you know 52,000 of them 52,000 patients with diabetes there are around 25 pregnant women uh in which 180 deliveries a day so it means that we are really putting death sentence to those group of people who are in need of that service in in every second of the hour so it's not just in hospitals but also health concerns for people across the Gaza Strip I want to look at aid from The Who yesterday your organization has told us that it sent a plain load of supplies that is now sitting in Egypt waiting to get into Gaza do you think that we are close to an agreement that will allow those supplies to finally cross into Gaza this is what we are hoping you know to to to get in the coming few hours based on whatever negotiations our director generalus is making and also my counterpart Hans clogan from the regional director you know of Europe in addition to the other political leaders around the globe asking the Israelis you know to make sure that you know ra for example border nearby Egypt is open our supply is there in Alish airport which is around 20 kilometer away from rafah it is there available to be shipped to Gaza our teams are also available in the regional office here and headquarter uh there are further supplies available in our logistic Hub in Dubay uh we we manag to re you know secure around 3 million plus 1 million US dollars to buy these supplies so we are available in in each you know the moment they tell us the you know RAF Cross Point is open we are ready to go inside and provide the support so your team is ready to move in as soon as it is allowed and possible can you tell us a little bit more about exactly what is in those supplies that will be sent to Gaza to help people there these supplies included in fact you know trauma kits that can be used to treat those injured people either on streets in the field or in hospitals uh there are kids you know containing um surgical kits to do operation inside the hospitals there are medications for um chronic illnesses like diabetes hypertension uh there are kids also
