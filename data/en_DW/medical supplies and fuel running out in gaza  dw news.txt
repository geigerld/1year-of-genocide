the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees says it has suspended Aid operations in Gaza because of a lack of fuel and the collapse of communication networks this as the un's world food program warns that starvation in Gaza could be imminent because of a lack of Food Supplies un officials say that only 10% of necessary food Aid has entered Gaza since the beginning of the conflict Rafa near gaza's Southern border with Egypt the AL rabaya Family live here in the part of Gaza that Israel said would be safe for civilians but the family says their home was destroyed by an Israeli bombardment on the first day of the war at night they sleep at a un school but during the day they return to the rubble of their old home they say every day is a struggle to find enough to eat sometimes there's nothing but tea but even worse than hunger they say is the constant fear of Israeli bombs there's danger all the time because there's no specific time for the bombing it could happen at any time and you could be hit at any time we don't want food or drink we just want to be safe with our children after the fear we have felt and the destruction we have seen we just want Safety and Security because now there is none the bombing and the blockade have also pushed gaza's Health System to the brink of collapse staff at the Turkish Palestinian friendship Hospital say they had to shut down gaza's only Cancer Treatment Center due to lack of fuel also caused by Israel's blockade without medicine or chemotherapy there's little the doctors can do to help dozens of cancer patients the situation is not only tragic it's more than tragic cancer patients are a fragile group they need a lot of care from nurses from Medical Teams medicine as well as psychological support which we don't have now the blockade on fuel hasn't just affected hospitals gaza's Communications network has shut down and an aid delivery by the UN was canceled both from lack of fuel Israel says it will begin allowing two tankers of fuel per day to enter which the UN says is only a fraction of what they need Israel's National Security adviser says the decision to allow fuel trucks into Gaza is aimed at improving Health Care in the territory the decision was intended to prevent the spread of disease we don't want diseases that could harm the civilians or our forces if there are diseases the fighting would be halted we cannot continue fighting in the event of a humanitarian crisis or an international outcry well for more I'm joined Now by Margaret Harris she's a spokesperson for the World Health Organization she joins me tonight from Geneva Margaret it's good to see you again so Israel says it wants to prevent the spread of diseases with these fuel deliveries is that going to work considering we're talking about just two trucks it's let's say at least it's a start but it's certainly not enough uh the needs we've assessed simply to keep the Water Sanitation the hospitals going are considerably more the numbers I have are that we need at least uh well considerably more than that and the other big issue is you've got people crowded together they as you've so graphically Illustrated with your report they they're living in makeshift conditions they don't have enough to eat they they don't have water to wash with there's only 5% of the water that used to come into the um ter the area is coming in now and they're in horrific conditions uh just the effect on their mental health of the constant bombing means that all the factors are there that will lead to massive outbreaks of disase and we're already seeing outbreaks we're already seeing more than 45,000 cases of diarrhea over 70,000 cases of upper respiratory tract infections these are the outbreak diseases and it's only going to get worse unless something really really big happens and that the biggest thing the best thing that can happen is a ceasefire and it doesn't look like we're going to get a ceasefire anytime soon and we have to you know admit the fact that more than half of the hospitals in in the Gaza Strip are now closed due to a lack of fuel how many trucks do you need to restart Hospital operations so and again they have to go to the north as well as the South what we're hearing at the moment is the uh the the fuel will only be permitted to go to the South so what we need to see is at least 120,000 lers a day um and I think we've been promised a lot less than that uh and and that's going to come in per day and to get things really started you've got to get a large amount in because there are so many things that now need to be restarted because of this blockade on the fuel the Israeli Army said that it delivered incubators for premature babies at the alifa hospital um Can those incubators run without Fuel and oxygen that according to the hospital staff is also Al running out so that's a big Point yeah the the reason they they had to take the babies out of the incubator is they didn't have power incubators are things by Nature that must be powered now all those sort of bits of equipment can run for a while on batteries but not forever you have to have power and if you cut the power off you cut the the lifeblood this the the chances of the seriously ill the vulnerable of surviving and horrifically we are now hearing uh reports of those very vulnerable patients in alifa dying Margaret Harris with the World Health Organization joining me tonight from Geneva Margaret as always we appreciate your time thank you thank you stepen cook is a Middle East Analyst at the Council of foreign relations and a columnist for foreign policy magazine Mr cook it's good to have you with us on this Friday evening with you your latest article in foreign policy it comes with the headline this war won't solve the Israel Palestine conflict why are we in this doomed Deja Vu well primarily because despite all of the horrific destruction and death that this conflict has caused the basics of the conflict uh have not changed um uh the Palestinians uh have some basic demands that the Israelis cannot uh cannot adhere to and the Israelis have basic demands for peace that the Palestinians can't deliver and that leads to a stalemate and there's nothing about this war that changes those uh demands and the inability of either party to be able to deliver them for the other side so for example Israel insists that it's capital B Jerusalem uh that it will not live within the June 1967 June 4 1967 borders and that it will not accept uh Palestinian refugees back in from 1948 back into Sovereign Israel uh the Palestinians say they must have a capital in Jerusalem uh they need to live within a contiguous fully sovereign state and that uh refugees uh should return to uh their homes uh from 1948 uh none of these things uh are changed as a result of this uh horrific conflict that is happening in the GSA strip yeah I want to talk more about us policy in just a moment but first I'd like to get your take on this we've noticed in the last few weeks that more and more Israelis are openly criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu even predicting his demise sooner rather than later he has not accepted any blame for October 7th do you think that the voters will hold him responsible well I think he has U at least hinted that uh he was responsible for uh for what happened on October 7th but of course um it is for Israeli voters to decide and his uh public opinion polling in Israel uh indicates that he is not popular as a result of the attacks on Israel on October 7th this is someone who built his political career on being Mr security uh and he was successful at that for many years but if you are the prime minister at the moment of Israel's worst security failure in the history of the state it's hard to make that case he was already UNP with about half of the population um I will I expect that when there is uh when there are elections in Israel uh he will not be able to survive it at least it would be an amazing feat of political survival for him to not go down and resounding defeat so let's consider then a post Netanyahu Israeli policy towards the Palestinians would we see a change or would it be as right leaning as ever I think the hope is that a Netanyahu less L Israel would be more forthcoming on the Palestinian issue but there's very little reason to believe that's the case that's why it's called a hope uh Israelis have moved to the right um over the course of the last decade or so and this conflict uh in particular with the amount of death and destruction uh that was caused by Hamas terrorists on October 7th um suggests that um Israelis um do not uh want a government that is is interested necessarily at least in the short term in peaceful coexistence but actually interested in securing the country um there's been a noticeable uh rightward shift in the polls that have been taken thus far so that um when Israelis finally do go to the polls uh it strikes me that what we will see is another center right right Coalition uh likely without netan and likely without um the those parties that are on the the furthest right that are currently part of the Coalition but never nevertheless um there is no peace Camp um there is really no Center left and there's barely a center yeah and yet you have the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin looking towards a a postwar future with the Palestinians relying on a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern on the West Bank and in Gaza is that just wishful thinking I think the Secretary of State and the people around him um are bereft of any new ideas on how to bring um not the current War but the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians to some sort of uh successful end uh much of what he has been saying uh particularly when he was in the region two weeks ago are things that are non-starters uh what is the United States going to do what is the International Community going to do to re quote unquote reinvigorate uh the Palestinian Authority does that mean elections uh Mahmud Abbas and his fat faction would likely lose those elections are we going to pour more money into a hopelessly corrupt and dysfunctional uh dysfunctional quasi State uh on the West Bank um the Israelis have already rejected the idea of extending the Palestinian authorities uh Administration from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip so it it strikes me that the secretary of state is hopelessly behind the curve here of course that's not his fault this is uh a conflict that may in fact uh defy resolution defy resolution so does that mean the two-state solution has no future the two-state solution died uh quite some time ago I think it's something that um American policy makers and and policy makers uh around the world uh say the words to State solution because they don't have another idea but they but they don't have another idea it it strikes me in particular after this conflict um that the sides are further apart than they ever that they have been at least since uh you know pre since the the establishment of the state of Israel um as far as they could possibly be in terms of the establishment of two states sitting living side by side and In Peace So if you had the US president's ear right now what would you advise him to do next yeah this is a it's an extremely tough question because this is such a a tragic uh a tragic situation um but I would say to him that um uh this is a problem that's not to be resolved it's a problem to be managed um that um he is correct in calling for uh humanitarian pauses in the fighting but that um if he were to apply significant pressure on the Israelis uh to stop to actually um uh put pressure on the Israelis for a ceasefire at this point um it would likely make him look weak because the Israelis have defined their conflict with Hamas in existential terms and are unlikely to listen to even the president of the United States under those circumstances let me before we let you go let me kind of broaden this out um President Biden had a face-to-face meeting this week with the Chinese president and that is where we know his attention is at the moment so you've got China you've got Ukraine and you've got Israel Gaza Hamas is the US stretched too thin is it juggling a lot of balls here and slam dunking not a single one uh I like your use of slam dunking by the way um you know I I I think that there us relations with China are uh of extraordinary Global importance and are a core interest of the United States to have a stable relationship with a strategic competitor like China I think the war in Europe uh the Russia's invasion of Ukraine is um of extraordinary importance to the United States and to the global order I think the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis as important and as emotive as it is and how it as much as it has affected people personally around the globe uh remains a local conflict and um despite being an expert on the Middle East um I'm sort of heartened by the fact that the president took time away from the conflict in the Middle East to spend time on something that is of true Global importance and that is US relations with China all right that's a great way to end the talk then Steve Cook at the Council of Foreign Relations we appreciate you joining us on this Friday night thank you Steve my pleasure since October 7th and already tense situation on the Lebanon Israel border has become more precarious with the Lebanese Hezbollah labeled a terror group by Germany and the US carrying out near daily strikes on Israeli targets the vast majority of rockets are intercepted but some do make it through and Israel retaliates both Hezbollah and Israel say they do not want allout conflict but both say they are ready for anything residents who live along the border have been ordered to evacuate not everyone has complied shuted shops and empty streets cats and soldiers pretty much all the life left in Kat Mona Less Than 3 kilomet from Israel's northern border with Lebanon kirat Mona is right in hezbollah's Firing Line This strip of shops was struck by a rocket from Lebanon nearly 90% of this town have been evacuated there's only really soldiers walking around and every now and then you can hear the outgoing fire of the Israeli military like a six or five cars 18-year-old Elia of flalo was here the night the Rockets hit the bomb uh fell on the roof and the explode under the car can you feel the oh wow here there he's one of the many who's moved away from the town but he travels back for work each day in this sandwich shop that now opens mainly to feed the hundreds of troops stationed in the area all the city have evacuated my family evacuate so me too and uh I came every morning to walk to feed my soldiers going to the mil next week he'll start his compulsory military service and perhaps end up back here in uniform I know one thing the Israeli Army is one of the best in the world and they is strong don't afraid and uh they trust them in this now deserted town we happen across one of the few residents who says she'll never leave sure it's scary when there are explosions here but we have faith Esther donon moved here with her husband last year for the countryside clean air and the quiet but a lot has changed since then all the neighbors have left maybe there is one or two still here we rarely see anyone here in the street there is a military base there are Israeli soldiers I'm not afraid holds I am not a mind reader no one knows what will happen next we are hoping that this will be over we want to stay here until the end of our lives for now though kirat schona remains a town of of cats soldiers and a few Hardy citizens like Esther DW correspondent Rebeca Ritter she filed that report she joins me now from Jerusalem good evening to you Rebecca what is the latest at Israel's northern border tonight but it's been another pretty tense day on that border Brent we've seen uh as many as 10 or more rockets launched from the Lebanese side claimed by Hezbollah into the Israeli side and today we've seen also uh four Israeli injuries we're not uh yet sure we've not been updated on the state of those people but four people have been uh injured in rocket fire that have landed in uh into Israeli territory so it's it's incredibly tense I mean it was quite strange being up there actually you feel the tension you feel the tension particularly with the authorities we were followed by police who were asked to move on we're asked not to film obviously any military Target but you can't even actually see much military it's very different to say when you're in the South for example you know it's it's quite a different tension in the air but it's something that Israel are particularly worried about that that border we're talking about 150,000 Precision rockets that Hezbollah have and if they decide to activate uh then we're talking about a very very serious front opening up that's something that obviously the International Community and Israel are trying to stop and at this stage it looks like what we're hearing from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nella is that he's trying to tie up troops Israeli troops in the north rather than actually launch a fulls gay scale attack so we're everyone concerned and waiting to see what's going to happen tension's very high Rebecca in your report we heard residents there worried about the conflict reaching their doorsteps how worried are Israelis elsewhere about yet another front opening in this war people are obviously concerned I mean you can probably see behind me I'm in Jerusalem and in Jerusalem it feels a little bit like life is normal of course the war is something that everybody is talking about not just the war but the hostages the the situation in Gaza the political situation everything here it's it's very at the Forefront of everyone's mind but but the the opening up of the particularly the northern front obviously worries people though as I just mentioned it sort of feels as though that's not going to happen it's not going to happen into a full SK wall I spoke to somebody in the US state department saying that they also believe somebody that works on that on that file they they say that they also believe that Hezbollah are not keen to get involved but it's just going to take a misstep you know it's going to take a misstep from either side Israel obviously retaliating but if they do something that that Hezbollah says crosses their red lines then they may well get involved and of course that is a concern for everybody not just here but everybody across the globe I understand a funeral was held for the hostages whose remains were found in Gaza what do we know about that yeah that's right uh one of the soldiers that was known to have been kidnapped uh we we saw video of that Soldier actually alive uh last week and then another video was released showing her body and Hamas claiming that she had been killed by Israeli rocket fire now uh by by bombardment Sorry by missile fire but obviously that we can't we haven't been able to verify but the body was found in the shifa hospital complex or near that area and was brought back to Israel so she could be laid to rest today another uh hostage was also found at the complex and today we've also this evening just seen another video of a very elderly and sick man who's also been taken hostage his condition not very known but obviously huge concerns about his welfare and we're starting to see this happen at rather a pace we know that there are negotiations ongoing for the release of these uh some at least some of the hostages up to 50 hostages in return for a short ceasefire but there a sticking point particularly from the Israeli side not wanting to allow that ceasefire so so far no progress on that our correspondent Rebecca ridos with the ladies tonight from Jerusalem Rebecca is always good to see you thank you the body of Israeli soldier Noah Marciano was discovered by Israeli forces earlier this week during their ongoing Sur of gaza's alifa Hospital the 19-year-old was captured by Hamas on October 7th while she was serving at the nahal O kibuts near Gaza Marciano appeared in a propaganda video filmed by the militants that was released earlier this week showing her alive 4 days after she arrived in Gaza the next images shared by Hamas were of her dead body she was laid to rest on Friday as questions remain over exactly how she Soldiers the body of Corporal Noah martiano is brought to its final resting place the end to a long search to find the 19-year-old she was captured by Hamas on October 7th while she was serving on an IDF base near the border of Gaza from that black Saturday we've had no rest our pain turned into the nation Spain we've tried everything 40 days in which we've turned every stone we've searched every path we've climbed every tree and today we're asking for your forgiveness we're sorry that we did not succeed you protected us but we failed in protecting you isra troops say they found Marano's body in a building adjacent to the al-shifa hospital in Gaza City during their raid the body of another Israeli hostage a 65-year-old woman was reportedly found near the hospital Israel has not confirmed the cause of Marano's death Hamas claims she was killed by Israeli bombing but this cannot be independently verified flags were raised a loft by mourners at the funeral friends and family expressing grief that resonates across the whole of
