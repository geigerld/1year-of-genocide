here in Berlin a large rally in solidarity with Israel and in support of the Jewish community in Germany is underway thousands have gathered at the iconic Brandenburg gate to show their support among them are also friends and family of those who have been taken hostage by Hamas on the October 7th Terror attacks that left more than 1300 Israelis dead German president Frank valter steyer was among those speaking at the rally he called for an immediate release of all hostages well for more we can now speak to DW reporter Jared Reed who is at the rally underway in Berlin good to see you Jared so what were the strongest messages that have come across at the rally so far Mariana there have been just a lot of impassion messages here today at the rally we heard from uh Ronnie Raman who is a sister of one of the hostages uh she talked basically about the anguish that her and her family have been going through uh since the October 7 Hamas attack and it's actually her sister's birthday today so she asked the crowd to join her in singing Happy Birthday uh to her sister I've been speaking to a number of people and I guess the overarching mood I guess is is one of sadness that's why people have uh come out here today to show their support and solidarity a young woman I spoked to said that she felt compelled to come out because of the historical crimes that Germany committed against the Jewish people and that's why she came out today to show her support an older man I spoke to said that uh he doesn't necessarily agree with the the policies of the current Israeli government but felt solidarity with Israel and the isra people lots of mood and messages here today but I guess the overarching one is is one of sadness and now Jared we know that since Hamas launched its attack on Israel and Israel has been taking its retali retaliatory attacks on Hamas militants in Gaza all of those casualties in Gaza what we're also seeing is a really uh large increase in anti-semitic attacks both in Germany and other countries in Berlin we just um had an attempted firebombing of a synagogue just a few days ago so um how strong is the police presence at this rally today Marana there are a lot of uh police around uh at this rally and and you're right there there has been an increase in violence ever since the Hamas attack German authorities say that they've registered over a thousand individual crimes ever since uh the Hamas attack on October 7 there have been various instances of violence including as you say a Molotov cocktail being uh thrown at a Jewish Cultural Center so uh police have been stepping up their uh presence and security both at uh rallies like this one and of course outside uh Jewish institutions in Germany and uh I'm joined in the studio by DW's Middle East analyst shaie rosanas to unpack uh some of what the German president was talking about some very emotional language um very firm but also very empathic Shani what what stood out for you well we we've seen this day um it's quite important we've seen also um the messages we stand with Israel We Stand by Israel the very fact you see Israeli flags being waved you know strongly proudly out there in the open in the German Capital that for itself should not be taken for granted many Israelis many Jews living in Germany in the last two weeks will tell you they have been living in great fear uh the idea of having any recognizable symbol like the Star of David being displayed outl is something they would never imagine to do for themselves without the support of so many Germans that we're seeing coming today to the Boga tour to the symbolic place the heart of the German capital in unanimously saying we support you we are against anti-Semitism the message it sends to the Jewish and Israeli population living in Germany and in Europe I would believe is quite a strong and very much a positive reinforcement they need after two weeks where we have seen constant reports of of course the attacks and raisins incidents and anatis but also people if you talk to them they will tell you they're not sending their kids to I mean Jewish schools Jewish takers who have been practically shut because of the fear the great fear the parents have for this well-being of their children um still injured Germany um you know the symbolism behind that so many years after is it's quite striking and and the president was talking about that as well feeling ashamed for that and uh he also mentioned that police have strengthened uh security for Jewish institutions uh in Berlin but also around the country but is it enough like can Jewish people in Germany feel safe security is always a touchy subject there we always hear more and more from um the communities around Germany that feel that they need more support more financial support in order to have more security many times they feel they don't get enough backing from the local government um for that purpose but we also have seen uh in the last couple of weeks a new campaign uh around Germany saying the number of days a Jewish institution should be you know secured by policemen in Germany should come to zero so as much as they want this security they would also very much want to have a different environment in which they feel safe enough to not need that and Germany is not there not just Germany let's be honest I mean most Jewish institutions around Europe are such that they need protection so is sometimes the case in the US we've seen you know this also uh trickling there um and the fear is is immense so uh these declarative um you know statements that we're seeing that the S the symbolism behind so many Germans we have seen all of the German parties Unite Here aside from the uh right uh rightwing IFD coming and joining along with um the Christian uh Evangelist Church and the Confederate of Bishops all of them bringing you know joining forces against anti-Semitism anti-Semitism in Germany together this is very meaningful in the statement is trying to send out loud we also need to keep in mind as you said that Stein Maya is aware of the growing also uh resentment of of of German citizens of palestin of Palestinian origin who feel that their freedom their right to show solidarity with what's happening in Palestine that's also being jeopardized and they feel that they are not giving the right to express their grief and their anger um and he was trying somewhat tread the line carefully saying we are against Hamas also because it is jeopardizing the lives and the livelihood and the dignity and the safety of those in Gaza the Palestinians themselves also again calling the need for humanitarian corridors and securing humanitarian needs of the Palestinians in Gaza I'm not sure it's enough um for the Palestinians who feel very much um that they are you know their right of speech is being you know uh pushed aside these days but but it's definitely showing that there's awareness to that at least in the higher uh levels of German uh government and can you tell us more about what kind of people would be attending today's rally you mentioned um the major political parties and religious groups and it does look like a rather large crowd so so who is likely to show up to a rally like this that is specifically in solidarity with Israel and against anti-Semitism and which groups are likely to maybe stay away well we've seen I mean I I cannot say I've not checked myself who exactly is there but we've seen definitely many people of of all the parties that's for itself is quite a big statement we we know that a lot of Muslim organizations that were asked to join we're not feeling that this is the kind of event they can take part of despite of where they stand uh many of them are aware of the complexity but still cannot find it so easy to be taking part in this event that seemed very one-sided to many of them um but we've also I can also tell you that as much as this is a in solidarity with Jews um it's also probably not attened by too many Jews the fear um uh of of Jews and Israelis in Germany to congregate these days either you know be it in their synagogues be it on the streets be it on you know schoolyards um the fear is so deep that many of them I I know from Firs hand have chosen also to not be attending today despite I'm sure that great security and um many uh uh different you enforcements this make sure this is a safe uh um this is a safe place for anybody who chooses to take part yeah very tense times for everybody at the moment that was Middle East analyst sheny rosanas shenny thank you so much you're welcome the
