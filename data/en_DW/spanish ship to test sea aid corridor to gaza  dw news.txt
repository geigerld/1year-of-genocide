a ship belonging to the Spanish NGO Open Arms is getting ready to leave for Gaza via a new sea Corridor carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza it'll depart from the port of lanica in Cyprus where it's been loaded with food European commission president Ursula fond Delan says the EU will help coordinate the relief effort alongside the US United Arab Emirates and other countries this follows President Biden's announcement that the US military would build a floating Pier off the Garen post to facilitate Aid deliveries here's more from the commission president and today we are facing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and we stand by the innocent civilians in Palestine and this is why Europe is financing a major humanitarian Aid effort for Palestinians in Gaza and in the region we're now very close to the opening of the corridor hopefully this SU Saturday this Sunday and I'm very glad to see that an initial pilot operation will be launched today let's pick up some of those points with Ahmed bam who's Regional media and communication adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council he joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman welcome to DW uh we just heard Ursula felion saying she hopes this new Maritime Corridor could open this weekend um do you think that realistic good evening Phil thanks for having me in terms of this being realistic probably uh I mean we hope so at least that you know any aid from any any side of uh of the uh border comes in to Gaza however the question is what happened to the to the actual land roots that we have have we given up on those have we given up on convincing Israel to allow more in and have we given up on diplomacy as as a tool of bringing some uh you know some relief to people who are who are literally Starving in in Gaza right now I mean this of course this scheme is is welcome because people are so desperate particularly in Northern Gaza where you know we are hearing reports of children dying of malnutrition how however what we need to see uh is is uh the uh reopening the full reopen of the of the land Crossings in Rafa and Kum Shalom right um well perhaps you could answer your own question uh do you believe that we have given up on uh reopening the land Crossings I mean all this distraction we hearing in the media all you know all the this new promotion of of port and Maritime routs and and you know uh this corridor from from Cyprus does tell us that looks like uh the uh ramping up of AG Roots land routs which are the fastest the most efficient and the most affordable the the the least expensive and the quickest it looks like we are now looking at a scenario where you know this has been politicized so politicized that uh we're not able to you know bring in just extra few hundred trucks a day to to relieve the people so it looks like more and more you know I mean it looks like the diplomacy and politics is now you know interfering in the works of Aid and and Aid uh Aid relief efforts and at the same time you know we're looking at Rafa which is the Zone where you know you you have two Crossings uh one Rafa war in shom that have been obstructed over the the past few weeks so probably the answer is I mean hope not but it looks like yeah it looks like you know these Alternatives it looks like they are being floated as a substitute to land rout and this is the real danger here all right what is the danger if uh Aid is coming in uh um via C and we also have this American announcement of this this temporary port in due course but if Aid is coming in uh by sea so long as the aid gets in why does it matter whether it comes by sea or by land it does matter because while we're brainstorming how we going to bring this in how we're going to construct where are we going to construct the Ford how long it's going to take there are people who are starving at the moment and the the danger is as I said in promoting this as the you know um as the the Holy Grail as the replacement of of AG roots and you know of course if that if that takes place there are questions about inspections about who's going to who's going to oversee the who's going to have control over inspections is Israel going to also interfere in in the shipments that are coming in who is going to actually uh you know unload offload these boxes of the of the ship docks um you know it's it's a whole catalog of questions that we we have to ask all while you know you know displace people pregnant mothers children starve and have to skip meals and you know we're talking about Ramadan in the next few days and that's another reminder that people have been actually almost fasting to to death here in Gaza so that's the that's the danger we should not be distracted from the solution which is the land routes through Rafa through K shell there are thousands of trucks that could be could could be Crossing and that's what needs to be encouraged given us much to think about thank you for joining us Ahmed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem told us more about the reaction from the Israeli government well we got a short statement now uh from the Israeli foreign uh Ministry uh saying that they're welcoming the decision to establish a maritime Corridor that they will work with all those organizing it and it said that this initiative will allow more humanitarian Aid uh coming uh into Gaza but there one key Point Key point it also stresses that this will be of course done after uh Security checks that are carried out according to Israeli standards uh uh this has been uh in the past a key point of contention between uh the uh humanitarian actors here and Israel because the uh screenings and Security checks of all the aid going into Gaza bya the land Crossings um has been uh that has been a really lengthy uh progress and it seems it will not be much different also for this Maritime route Tanya Kramer let's talk to Mike Martin he's a military analyst from the war studies department at Kings College London uh welcome back to DW Mike Phil hi how involved is Israel likely to have been in what looks like a unilateral us decision uh well I think actually the the security checks that your correspondent cited some of those in Cyprus are going to be carried out by a team that includes Israeli government officials so I think it's very unlikely that the us would have launched this initiative without first arranging that that piece of choreography with Israel so Israel is giving its support and indeed being part of the the process of opening this Corridor right and we heard the European commission Chief hondel Express and the hope that this Corridor could open this weekend is that realistic uh well I think I think there's two things going on one is the the the maritime port or the pier that the us is going to be building and and that won't be open for at least several weeks if not a month um need to get the equipment from the US and all the rest of it and but the US seems to be the EU seems to be talking about another initiative where uh they are sending ships but they need to dock somewhere else so they either need to dock at an Israeli port or at a port in Egypt and other ships have left Cyprus over the preceding months and have have taken these routes so I think I think there's two things going on right I mean this isn't a question for you I suppose but what one wonders if they can do this now with no Port why this wasn't done months I know that that's not really one for you just one that just occurs it just occurred to me um let's talk about the this this port um this temporary structure how complicated a logistical exercise would is that likely to be it's actually it's actually pretty easy um what you need to do is um put a floating dock in place and a country like the us will have lots of these in it supplies and then you you anchor that you put an anchor down to the seabed and you and you secure it with chains and then once you've done that and that will be several hundred meters off the coast you then have a a pontoon uh Causeway that links up to the land so that bits pretty easy the bit that's really difficult is once you get the supplies onto the beach or onto the coast in Gaza how they get distributed from there that's the real challenge right and so we haven't heard anything in this deal about that that sort of that that final uh bit of this who distributes it uh distributes the aid and and how because this has been a real uh point of contention across the last two months well one of the things that's happened that I think hasn't been uh reported uh very extensively is that the Palestinian police in Gaza have effectively stepped down because they were being targeted they they carry weapons and they were being targeted by the Israelis and so without police of course you know Law and Order breaks down this happens in any society if you get rid of the police and these are the guys who would be protecting and distributing Aid convoys other than that it's Nos and I don't think NOS really have got the manpower to do that so there needs to be some kind of deal that allows the Palestinian police to come back to work perhaps not carrying weapons carrying sticks or something on that enables them to help secure the distribution of Aid okay thanks for that Mike Mike Martin thank you so much from Kings College London thanks
