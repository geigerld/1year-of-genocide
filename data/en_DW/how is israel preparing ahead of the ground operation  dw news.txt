in response to the Hamas attacks Israel called up 360,000 reservists now that figure amounts to 4% of the country's population it has also been massing forces close to Gaza Israel says that it will destroy Hamas and has signaled again and again that it will send in troops to carry out that task Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on the planet fighting there is predicted to be very hard and costly ahead of that ground oper in Gaza the US is sending military advisors to Israel here's White House security spokesman John Kirby uh what I can tell you is that um that there are uh a few um relevant Military Officers with experience the kinds of experience that uh that uh that we believe um is is appropriate to uh the sorts of operations that that Israel is conducting and may conduct in the future uh to go over there to share some perspectives from their own experience and to ask the hard questions the same hard questions that we've been asking of our Israeli counterparts since the beginning all right I want to take this now over to Brad Bowman he's with the foundation for defense of democracies it's good to see you again Brad among the military advisers that are going over I understand one is Marine lieutenant general James Glenn who he has experienced fighting against Islamic State he served in fujia in Iraq one of the bloodiest Urban battles in recent hisory history all of that considered what kind of expertise can the US offer Israel here you know the Israel uh Israel has a formidable military it's the best uh most effective military in the Middle East uh but the United States has a lot of experience in the Middle East too to say the least over the last 20 years after 911 and you have uh gentleman such as the the Marine Corps Lieutenant General who spent many years fighting in some of the toughest places a lot of that the kind of urban Warfare where there are lessons that were learned at Great cost great human cost that can be shared with our Israeli allies to help them accomplish their objectives at at the lowest cost for them do you think the US believes the Israelis have a properly conceived well-thought out plan to enter Gaza I think after the October 7 terror attack and your previous guest helped your viewers kind of understand some of the anger that I'm also hearing from Israelis which is understandable right it was some sort of combination I think for them of Pearl Harbor 911 under per capita terms it was roughly equivalent to 40 or 50,000 Americans dying roughly 13 to 14 times more Americans that died in 9911 but these terrorists didn't come from Afghanistan they came from a mile or two away and came crashing into their living rooms doing horrible things and so uh there there's great anger in Israel and that's understandable they uh they want to defend their military but saying you're going to destroy Hamas and doing it are two wildly different things and after you destroy them what comes next Israel doesn't want to occupy Gaza so if they're not going to occupy it who's going to rule it there are very tough questions uh that need to be answered but right now Israel just wants to prevent October 7th from happening again yeah and if you if you go in how clear does your objective um appear to be I mean to the untrained eye to people looking from the outside Israel's objective of destroying Hamas seems to be more of a desire than a clear objective how do how do you see it yeah no you know we have something in the US called the the wine Burger Doctrine or the power Doctrine it's it's a list of questions you ask before starting a military conflict and and one of those questions is you know what's your exit strategy right and so uh you know we call that a phase four oper you know what do you do after you you accomplish your military objectives but to accomplish your military objectives in one of the most dense environments on Earth Urban environment Ms with many many miles of underground tunnels stocked with weapons that enable Hamas fighters to survive bombardment and conduct surprise attacks many of their arsenals stored under hospitals and schools they know the territory you're literally talking about block by block building by building room by room fighting and then you have to hold that ground once you have it right and then you're looking at a counter Insurgency so this is as General Petraeus said fishlyn um and so I think what Israel is looking at right now is maybe just focusing on Northern Gaza and transforming Northern Gaza and and then maybe stop there because they're looking out of their one of their eyes at Hezbollah on the North and wondering whether when they get bogged down in Gaza is Hezbollah gonna come in in a major way in the north and do you think that's that's a big worry too Among Us military advisers that Israel is going to find itself with a multi-front war yes absolutely that's the the the US has sent extraordinary combat power in the last couple weeks to the Middle East two carrier strike groups a Marine Expeditionary Unit f-15s f16s f-35s a10s air and missile defense units the list goes on and on and President Biden looks in the camera secretary Austin looks at the camera says don't don't who's he talking to he's talking to Iran and it's Terror puppet Hezbollah to try to prevent a a a another front in Israel's North not to mention the West Bank which could light up as well let me ask you before we run out of time we've got about a minute a minute minute and a half the the us we know it's aiding Ukraine we've talked about that before it's also keeping an eye on China and it's now committing we what two aircraft carriers to Israel's defense in the Mediterranean or in the Gulf region is there a danger of the US military overreach here no I think in this moment there's a danger of under reach I think if we don't deploy combat power now we're going to have a a smaller problem become a bigger problem thereby siphoning off more resources so this is the danger here is American weakness not strength and the indopacific commander recently at the Pentagon Podium said not a single asset has been pulled from the Indo Pacific for this this fight so the United States is a great power we can walk in ch gum at at the same time and this is a moment to stand in my view with our Ally Israel and to recognize that Behind These Terror puppets is the puppet master and that's the Islamic Republic of Iran and how close do you think a war with Iran is due to events that have happened in the last two three weeks hard to say but the big question is Hezbollah does Tran use its Varsity Terror team to try to save the junior varsity Hamas Terror team the primary purpose of Hezbollah is to deter Israel from conducting an attack against Iran's nuclear program Brad Bowman with the foundation for the defense of democracies Brad is always good to talk with you we appreciate the analysis thank you thank you now Israel is expected to launch a ground offensive into Gaza in retribution for the terrorist attacks and to free the hostages being held in Gaza so let's get some analysis from Frank led a former British army officer and a senior lecturer at the University of Portsmouth in the UK it's good to see you Frank um Israel's military says that it is ready and waiting for instruction from political leaders on the next move what do you think is going through Benjamin netanyahu's mind right now what's he waiting for well good afternoon Ana there are multiple vectors of advice going into netanyahu's command group at the moment first of all there's a dispute apparently between the military advisers and and political advisers come back to that in a second about whether now is the time to begin this campaign this is further Complicated by American uh perspectives to the effect that they don't believe that there are achievable goals in the current Israeli plan and they're particularly concerned of course about an aftermath and not making the same mistakes that we made in Iraq and Afghanistan so it's a highly complex situation of course that's Complicated by the hostage situation I suspect no decisions going to be made for several days and there'll be no offensive for that time but look it's uh it's Crystal Ball stuff it's very complex a very difficult decision you mentioned the hos hostage situation how is still holding more than 200 hostages what would a ground Invasion mean for them well the assessments are being constantly updated it's extremely Dynamic and the advice going to Israel's commanders and and political leaders will be roughly like this that they may have identified certain certain places uh where hostages are located and they may feel or may not that they can get these out and that'll be weighed against the potential disadvantage of delay which I I don't see that many frankly but uh that's not what I think doesn't really count uh certainly the Israeli uh hostage release teams will have identified certain places by now in what hostages have called the spiders web of tunnels that's the key thing here uh but y they're part of the decision and of course that further is Complicated by Hamas using the hostages as an extended negotiating tactic as prolonging this time increasing confusion and of course Alig them more time to prepare the US is reportedly saying it wants Israel to delay its military operation to give the hostage negotiations more time so are you suggesting that a further delay wouldn't play into the hands of Hamas militarily no I think it cut it cuts two ways I mean if Israeli planners will be always interested in gaining more intelligence understanding the battle they're going to fight but of course as the Americans speak about hostages there are other concerns and even greater concerns and that's the real fear the US has for horizontal extension and escalation of this and just by way of example one example the US has sent Only Yesterday announced the sending of uh what I call terminal high altitude uh interceptors now these are only use they're not useful against the Palestinian Hamas or Lebanese hollah they are designed against Iranian ballistic missiles so the US is very concerned now about escalation and they feel any that the time taken in consideration particularly for any aftermath and the operations taken to get there that's to say to try and reduce as far as possible the political significance of heavy casualties that time would be well spent a hostages of course are an extra advantage and the longer the this goes on of course the more the chance of more hostages will be released but the danger is this is a Hamas negotiating tactic to to to prolong this and prolong the agony as well well and let's not make the mistake of thinking this is human these are humanitarian releases they're not Frank thanks so much for your analysis that's military expert Frank
