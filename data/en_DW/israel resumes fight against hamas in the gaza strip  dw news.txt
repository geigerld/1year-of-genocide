we begin with breaking news this hour as Israel's military saying it's resumed operations in the Gaza Strip just minutes after a 7-Day paus in fighting ended the temporary ceasefire expired at 7:00 a.m. local time but negotiators failed to agree a further extension that would have secured the release of more Hamas held hostages Israel said it resumed combat after the militant group violated the terms of the truce there's been no immediate comment from Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by the US and the EU we're joined Now by DW correspondent Ben fulan in Jerusalem Ben Israel's military says it has resumed combat operations in the Gaza Strip do we know any more detail at this point it confirmed exactly that Anthony 30 minutes after the truce had run out we were expecting a possible extension of that truce but uh that hasn't happened uh it's said that uh or rather we saw videos on social media smoke billowing from jabalia refugee camp in the north also journalists reporting artillery fire in Gaza City and drones seen in the south of the Gaza Strip as well as a house in Rafa being targeted and many wounded according to reports um this is uh the first time in seven days that uh we've seen fighting that had been sporadic rocket fire tank fire and artillery fire but uh this now sounds like the war is back on in full force to use the words of the Israelis netanyahu's office confirmed the resumption of fighting as you say saying Israel is committed to achieve its Targets in the war what exactly are those targets uh the targets haven't changed uh to release all of the hostages to um ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to the civilians of Israel and that Hamas is dismantled over this 7-Day pause we'd seen over a 100 hostages released 240 Palestinian prisoners in return and more Aid getting into the civilians remembering that uh some reported 15,000 civilians have died in the fighting in Gaza including uh Hamas Fighters and other combatants uh some 1.7 million people having been displaced mainly from the north to the South uh remembering that Israel had made it clear if this truce or when this truce uh is over it will concentrate its operation on the south of the Gaza Strip hence the warnings from the US to be more precise in its targets because so many civilians have been caught up in the crossfire and those civilians now expect to move to the north what's left in the north uh much of it is a wasteland according to reports and the pictures we've seen and the uh small areas uh that have been set up as safe areas in the South according to um groups humanitarian groups way too small to house all of these uh displaced people uh another thing benan Netanyahu said was that Hamas failed to agree on the release further hostages you've reported extensively in this space since you've been in Jerusalem where does a resumption of fighting leave efforts to negotiate further releases well according to Israel uh its resumption of fighting will only put more pressure on Hamas to release those hostages uh the hard part though is uh for Hamas is finding those hostages according to reports were receiving this morning that it was finding a difficult to uh find the rest of the women according to Israel the terms were all of the women would be released by today uh a list coming last minute according to reports and uh Israel not happy with that the other part of the problem here is that Hamas fired Rockets towards Israeli civilians uh according to Israel early this morning in the last hour before the truce and in just the minutes before the truce ended and afterwards there were more Sirens going off in southern Israel more rocket alerts um also Hamas refusing to uh give any sort of explanation refusing to take responsibility so a lot of uncertainty this morning as to exactly what's gone wrong uh with those ceasefire negotiations and the negotiations to extend the ceasefire DW correspondent Ben folan in Jerusalem thank you well ham belalia is a journalist from Gaza who was able to escape to the Jordanian Capital Aman in the early days of this conflict we welcome him now ham Israel says it has resumed its military operation what are you hearing from Gaza what are gazans going through in the early stages of this resumption in fighting yeah since the the the time um of um the the ending the season Fire or the bows the the air strikes continued clashes reported from different areas whether from the north from the east of J in the middle area even in in the South um many air strikes take place artillery shells here from different places according to the medical um officials in Gaza many casualties are reported uh whether from kanun or Rafa or even from Gala City Israel accused Hamas of firing Rockets from northern Gaza this morning ham can we confirm that well it's not easy to confirm any any party um uh statement on this regard nobody is close to the fighting um front line um Israel accused Hamas Hamas didn't admit this it could be happening or but we don't know nobody on the ground can confirm or deny is um uh this is a competing area um anybody approaching it would be shot um many incidents happened before the Palestinians approached some areas they to to check their houses and they were shot tell us about the humanitarian situation in Gaza hasm has it noticeably improved during the weekl long pausing fighting that brought us to this point if we compare it between uh before the bows and after um of course there is a little bit of improvement but whether it's enough or not it's not according to the ordinary people they there there are shortages of everything of food um um of water uh no electricity telecommunication is very poor um uh access to the areas is limited um people are suffering from um finding basic needs like um cooking gas as lines are still there um people are taking long time of rech recharging their their devices mobile phones to to be connected um items of food that entering are like it's it's very limited cans and some medical supplies as well uh whereas the the access to the water is is is very hard as well so as they fight for daily Necessities the Israeli military has called on Palestinians to stay in Southern Gaza how safe do they feel there um if we if we talk about today more air strikes happen in the South than the north um there was um air strike uh reported in Rafa City it's the southr city of of Gaza stb one in kanun about 200 M away from ner Hospital according to a colleague there there was another strike in maazi east of uh of Central Area many casualties were reported there so people believe like there is no uh complete safe place uh in in across the Gaza Strip journalist hen bisha thank you so much thank you now as Israel presumes operations against Hamas militants International pressure is growing to do more to protect civilian lives according to the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in the 8we conflict I made clear that before Israel resumes major military operations it must put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians that means taking more effective steps to protect the lives of civilians including by clearly and precisely designating areas and places in Southern and Central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire it means avoiding further significant displacement of civilians inside of Gaza it means avoiding damage to life critical infrastructure like hospitals like power stations like water facilities and it means giving civilians who've been displaced to Southern Gaza the choice to return to the north as soon as conditions permit there must be no enduring internal displacement well for more Let's cross over to military expert Frank lewi who is in Oxford Frank is what the US Secretary State Anthony blinkin calls for feasible from a military perspective in such a tight area well if uh I was advising the IDF which fortunately for them I am not I would suggest that a safe area for civilians might also constitute a safe area for the remnants such as it is of Hamas I can't imagine the Israeli military are very keen on this idea uh for for very good reason and of course they're not the only ones right on the other side of the spectrum Egypt has said that it doesn't like them because it sees them as a precursor to expulsion in other words Gathering people in one place to be moved about and humanitarians rather more reasonably say look you can't crowd people in areas like that without proper supplies food medical uh facilities and so forth and expect them to survive and this is supported Again by The World Health Organization for slightly different although very closely connected reasons of Public Health it's a it's a very tall order this and uh but to ran back to the military issue a safe zone for civilians hamas's major defensive weapon of course is the civilian population and they will use that Gaza City then has already been hit particularly hard as we've seen over and over what more is there to achieve for the Israeli military that has already been achieved in its war against Hamas where might Israel's Focus be from this point on well Anthony they haven't finished dealing with uh or clearing the northern part of Gaza yet in fact my take on the maps that are available they're probably about onethird the way through there they found in that time 400 tunnels they've killed probably hundreds maybe thousands of Hamas activists and uh they will continue to do so I suspect by the way that the rate of Civilian casualties thankfully will go down partly as a result of blink and uh intervention uh but back back to what they have yet to do it's a token I think of how much there is to do that none of the three major targets uh Isa T and above all shinari have yet been uh killed or indeed captured and I think those would be major targets for the Israelis in as individuals and as we will no doubt see Hamas still will retain some coherence as a military force we'll see what the extent of that over the next few days no there's plenty for the Israelis to do uh Secretary of State blink's concern is that whilst the Israeli Defense Forces seem to be planning for an operation for months he says look politically you've got weeks and uh for them to to to achieve their objectives in that time will be really difficult I think is there any way of knowing Frank how much of a threat Hamas still poses to the better equipped Israeli military at this point how much capability does Hamas still have well I think what the Israeli would say considerable and we will we will know when the Israelis think that they have achieved their objectives when they they say so and when the operation rounds and gr grinds to a close and we're nowhere near that I mean the first thing that happened this morning was was a rocket attack which uh seems to have breached the ceasefire and caused the uh resumption of hostilities we noted note by the way earlier in the week Hammer still retains of significant terrorist capability within Israel as well as a huge terrorist capability within Gaza having killed at a bus stop three three civilians I have no doubt at all that Hamas is still a going concern and so are the other groups alongside it and of course let's not forget as well the remaining 150 or so perhaps even more depending on whether we can believe how many are still alive according to Hamas uh uh Still Still within Gaza there's so much for the Israelis yet to do you refer to the fragility of the truth Frank how hard is it going to be to achieve another truth what does history teach us about breaking a truce and then achieving a pause in fighting again yes I think that's that's a very interesting question and we have to remember here that the people involved in in this on all sides are really grit gritty pragmatic let's say if we can call them that uh pragmatic uh individuals you got mosad on the one side and Hamas leadership safely in sconed there in Qatar on the other as well as Americans qataris to some extent other other s too and these are realists and it may well be that both sides May calculate at some point in the future just as they did last week that the stars are aligned for another uh another ceasefire possibly for humanitarian reasons possibly to release more hostages and exchange more prisoners now i' I've little doubt that this could be repeated um and and I think we may well see that but uh that's uh we're casting ahead into the future there's so many contingencies very difficult to say Obviously great to get your Insight Frank Military expert Frank ledbridge in Oxford thank you so
