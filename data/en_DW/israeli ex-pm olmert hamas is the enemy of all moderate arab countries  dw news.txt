and for a special perspective I'm pleased to welcome ahud Almer he was Israel's prime minister from 2006 to 2009 and mayor of Jerusalem for 10 years until 2003 Mr alard welcome to DW in a recent interview you claimed that the Hamas Command Center was not in fact under the alifa hospital but in Kan Yunis in southern Gaza I want to quote you there you said that is where they have the leadership they are hiding they have the bunkers they have the command position they have the launching pads what is your evidence for that we'll find we'll show you the evidence I hope the Israeli Army will reach out there and will provide you the evidence now you could see that underneath the shifa hospital there were bunkers there were weapons and they uh they were uh taking the uh hostages into uh shifa and uh we have evidence that some of the hostages which came alive to shifa were killed there so uh uh you don't really expect that uh we will provide you with videos of the bankers underneath hunis but we have the evidence and we have the uh data that uh I think make it quite reliable and uh uh hopefully within days we'll reach out there and uh you all will be able to see why then the focus on the alifa hospital if hunis is really the bigger military Target not the only from shifa hospital they were launching uh the missiles to Israel they were using the shifa hospital as a hiding place for many of the killers and the uh terrorists and they use the uh underground for the hiding weapons and uh the terrorists the leaders ran away when we came close to shifa they escaped for obvious reasons but um that doesn't make shifa into a legitimate um place it's definitely more than just a hospital by the way it was built by Israelis it was designed by Israeli Architects but the bankers were built by Hamas and so from what I gather we are bound to see Israeli troops expand their operations to the South that is precisely where gazin from the north were told to seek safety where are the people who live there in the South plus the over 1 million displaced now supposed to go that even Han Yunis and the area surrounding it is not safe anymore look uh I don't think that I need to uh and I don't know to be honest with you I'm not in the government now I'm not in the general staff of the Israeli Army and I can't share with you the specific military planes for the expanded Israeli operation we'll do everything as we did we try to do in the north of Gaza to avoid any unnecessary collateral damage and that's why we are it takes time we try to be as careful we can and uh we hope to be able to reach out the centers of where the terrorist leaders are hiding without affecting the civilians that move South uh this is it's not a game it's a very difficult and complex and painful and bloody and we try to uh avoid the necessary uh uh consequences to uh noninvolved civilians but you must understand one thing and I tell you on the basis of liong lifelong experience and very good connections with all of the Arab countries that surrounding the state of Israel to this day there is nothing that they want more of Israel than to destroy Hamas Hamas is obviously the enemy of Israel but it's the enemy of all the moderate Arab countries they are scared that if Hamas will prevail the stability in those countries may be jadiz in a very serious way and they are anxious that Israel will continue what we are doing now which is to destroy and Isis which is part of the area here which threatens the stability of the entire region and this is the only not only be in Israel's interest to uh to to destroy Hamas I understand that but there has been widespread condemnation of the blockade of Gaza that came as a result or that intensified as a result of the October 7th attack the humanitarian crisis and the number of civilians killed in this war and we're seeing this week again thousands of protesters in cities around the world almost every day demanding a ceasefire so I I want to know from you is Israel at risk of losing international support over how it is conducting this war as someone who is not directly involved they unfortunately uh you are correct in describing the U uh reaction in different parts of the world against the state of Israel on the 7th of October they all demonstrated in favor of Israel and in the meantime as it turns out and uh since life is not a linear line uh they Focus now on the pictures coming from Gaza and they forgot the Israelis that were beheaded and tortured and and raped and uh slaughtered um only um 45 days ago now I think that there is certainly a danger I can't ignore it that the international public opinion will not be patient enough and tolerant enough to understand that we have to live with the consequences of having Hamas here and that it has come to a point where we just can't continue as it was we have to get rid of them however I think that what the Israeli government has to do and this is not something I don't speak for the government as you understand I don't represent the government the government is probably on an entirely different direction but I speak for what I think most Israelis want we need to do the following things number one we have to declare that at the end of the battle the military battle we will pull out from Gaza we don't want to occupy Gaza it's not in our interest we don't want to be there we want to destroy the Hamas and move back to the international border that's number one number two I think that it is important it's essential that uh an intervention in military force um European International uh military force will take over Gaza when Israel pulls out no Arab no Palestinian will ever take over from Israel so if we don't want Terror to immediately return back into Gaza we have for a period of a year a year and a half to have an international intervention Force just as we did in the south of Lebanon after the war in Lebanon in 2006 which was very helpful and which created an a quiet area for 17 years yeah under the current leadership sorry to interrupt you there under the current leadership do you think what you're laying out is an attainable goal this is something that needs to be achieved uh needs to be uh uh accepted by President Biden and the European leaders uh Rai sunak and president macron and Chancellor Schultz and all the rest of the European leaders and I think that there is a good chance that they will understand that there must be an international Force because if Israel is not to stay there and don't want to stay there and the International Community doesn't want Israel to stay there and if Palestinians or Arabs will not come over so what then so number one as I said I think there should be an international Force for a period of interim period of a year a year and a half that will help create a restore and a civil Administration that now will disappear because of the radication of Hamas but at the same time and this is perhaps the most critical and important thing the Israeli government has to declare today and make a public commitment that at the end of the military battle we will immediately embark on negotiations for peace based on the creation of a Palestinian state in both the West Bank and Gaza does Israel's current leadership want peace though not only for Israelis for everybody in the region yeah I if you ask me whether the present Israeli government is ready to say this or that to work for it or to declare it or to make any commitment about it I don't think so I have to be very honest with you that's why I think that this government has to be removed today I think that this government has failed completely in providing security of the state of Israel and at the same time is unable and un unprepared to make the necessary accommodation in order to create the corridor that can lead us from where we are now all the sides into a potential meaningful peace negotiations for the creation of a Palestinian state that will live alongside the state of Israel on the basis of the plans that I've have submitted to the Palestinians or anyway within the framework of acceptable principles that must be worked out between us and the Palestinians unfortunately I just want to remind you miss flish if I can just one thing briefly in 200 in 2008 I presented the Palestinians with a peace plan based on the creation of a Palestinian State on the basis of two of 67 borders and of having the Arab side of Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state of having the holy Basin of Jerusalem uh controlled by an international Trust of five nations the Saudis Jordan the Palestinians Israel and America under the uh offices of the United Nations security Council and the solution of the refugee problem within the framework of the Arab leak peace initiative which was originally accepted in 2002 and was reconfirmed in 2007 this is a peace plan which was presented to the Palestinians unfortunately then they didn't say yes and they fil away yeah this is the Secretary General of the United Nations has also said that they will not take care of the situation in Gaza after this war and I'm really sorry we'll have to leave it there we're running out of time Mr aled great speaking to you thank you so much for taking the time to coming on to
