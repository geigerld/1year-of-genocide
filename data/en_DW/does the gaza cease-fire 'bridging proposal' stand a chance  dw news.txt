US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has left Qatar his last stop on a diplomatic tour aimed at brokering a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza earlier he spoke to qari leaders who have been pivotal in trying to mediate the deal Lincoln says Israel has accepted a new bridging proposal but Hamas which committed the October 7th Terror attacks has accused Israel of making changes to the proposal that go against what Hamas agreed to last month blinkin spoke to reporters before flying out of Qatar he rebuffed media reports that the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu had forced changes to the plan including leaving Israeli troops in some areas of Gaza the United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza by uh by Israel um more specifically the agreement is very clear on the schedule and the locations of IDF withdrawals uh from from Gaza and Israel has agreed uh to that let's get more now from journalist kareim alari who joins us from Cairo kareim the latest American proposal aiming at bridging gaps between the two sides that's still on the table where do things stand now in negotiations well doesn't look very promising um Hamas is saying that they want to go back to the Biden plan they agreed to uh in July already and uh in this package of the Biden plan there was uh the possibility of a permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal of the Israeli forces now Hamas is saying uh that Israel is adding new terms to this bridging proposal there is no more guarantee uh for a permanent truce and there is no full withdrawal of the Israeli troops no matter what blinkin just said commentators in the Arab media saying that this deal that is suggested by the US that is a good deal is in reality a catastrophe for the Palestinians so there is a lot of pessimism on the Arab side also relative Silence from the other mediators Carter in Egypt about these suggestions um they are far less it seems enthusiastic than the us about this briding proposal so given what you just told me kareim where do things go from here are we expecting the talks to continue well the blink mission is uh finished but we will have talks in Cairo with in day technical end political talks um they have to fill enormous gaps uh Netanyahu wants the option to continue the Israeli offensive at a later stage in case there's a ceasefire he still talking about eliminating Hamas and Israel wants to stay the Israeli Army wants to stay in parts of the Gaza ship uh that seems to be part of this deal although blinkin just stated that the United States does not accept any long-term occupation by in by in by of Gaza by is talk to us a little bit about the Philadelphia Corridor we're hearing a lot about that kareim that's the Border region between Egypt and Gaza Hamas and Egypt are opposed to Israel keeping troops there why is that such a divisive issue well it seems that Netanyahu convinced blink to put exactly this into the bridging proposal that Israeli Army will stay in the so-called Philadelphia Corridor that's a corridor 14 kilomet long that separates Egypt and the Gaza Strip that is right now the Israeli Army is present in this strip is present at the Rafa border crossing um the Israelis say they want to stay there because of weapons smuggling of course that would mean that the Israeli Army is going to be fully surrounding the Gaza Strip even after uh a Seas f fire deal Egypt is opposed against this because they say it's violating actually terms of the Camp David peace agreement that's the oldest peace agreement between Arab Arab State and Israel from 79 between Egypt and Israel um there is talk now of maybe some other Alternatives talk about some uh International Presence at this Border strip or maybe some kind of highte proposal I think that probably will be part of the nego of the upcoming negotiations in Egypt tell us what's writing on this deal in terms of the regional implications kareim because there's are massive tensions uh between Israel and its neighbors including with Hezbollah in the the north uh in Lebanon but also Iran is a big player in the background here what what are the implications of this deal if it falls apart or if negotiations continue well basically everyone is waiting for the answer of Iran and hisbah after the killing of the head of Hamas is Han in tan and the killing of a high ranking um military commander of hisa in Beirut for shuk um it seems like this answer is on hold they are waiting now what's coming out of this uh peace of of this ceasefire negotiations if the ceasefire negotiations are successful they will say this is part partially because of our pressure uh coming from this possible answer if not they might strike at a later date but it gives of course this talks upcoming talks in Ciro an urgency that is recognized by Israel is recognized by and also recognized by all the mediators Kim thank you very much for your insights that was journalist Kareem elari in cirra you're welcome
