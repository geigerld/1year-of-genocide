the UN Secretary General has said he's appalled by the escalating violence in Gaza and has condemned the killing of civilians a spokesperson for Antonio gutterz made the remark after Israel bombed gaza's biggest refugee camp for a second day in a row Israel says its strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday killed two Hamas commanders and destroyed underground military infrastructure a strike hits gaza's biggest refugee camp for this second consecutive day displaced Palestinians many of whom have lived in the densely populated jabalia camp for decades pulled from under the rubble of what used to be their homes what is their fault in all this it's all gone my sister's house along with her and her children my brother's house with his children I lost all my siblings except for my younger brother these are all the names 15 names they're all innocent it's literally a massacre complete destruction the UN has called the attack to quote latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza the devastation is nearly identical to an Israeli strike the day before that killed dozens of people Israelis said that strike targeted a Hamas military commander the group is classified by Germany the EU and the us as a terrorist organization as was published yesterday we eliminated the commander of the jabalia Battalion ibraim Bahari he was a murderous terrorist striking him caused the collapse of the building and of the tunnels that were under the camp all of this led to the collapse of further structures Israel has intensified its offensive in Gaza the Israeli military released footage that shows the deployment of air and Naval forces as well as ground troops carrying out operations into the strip we are hitting the terrorists at all levels from those who fight in the field to the level of commanders IDF activity leads the exposure of tunnels the finding of terrorist and heavy losses suffered by them unfortunately there is also a price on aside as happens in every battle while Israel says the fighting has killed several of its own soldiers officials say the war will go on until their mission is complete Israel has been bombing Gaza from the air for weeks but since moving into the territory with tanks and troops over the weekend it faces a different threat that of urban Warfare Israeli forces have been preparing for this eventuality but so have Hamas militants Urban Warfare it's every soldier's worst nightmare the enemy could lurk behind every corner but Israel's military given the long history of conflict with Hamas militants has long been preparing for the possibility that one day troops might be sent in to fight in Gaza a concrete Labyrinth full of hiding places for potential ambushes which has proved deadly in the past soldiers have drilled in what house-to-house combat might look like at the idf's urban Warfare Training Center known as little Gaza at a site in southern Israel now Israeli soldiers operating inside the Gaza Strip are putting those lessons to the test as they inch closer to Gaza City before the war it was one of the world's most densely populated cities the Israeli military after ordering civilians to leave Northern Gaza has has now designated the area a battlefield the United Nations citing Hamas ran local authorities says about half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed ahead of a possible Invasion some people including those unable to flee due to sickness or injury remain in Gaza hospitals Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals as military headquarters and using civilians as human Shields and then there are the risks underground the terrorist group and their allies have built a vast network of tunnels in Gaza the tunnels are estimated to stretch hundreds of kilometers it's likely the corridors could be mined or booby trapped and Hamas Defenders will have the advantage of being more familiar with the Subterranean web Israel's Army is aware that ground fighting inside Gaza is likely to result in a high number of casualties for Israel Hamas and Gaza civilians joining me now for more context is Marina Miron she's a postdoctoral researcher in the war studies department at Kings College London Marina the Israeli Army has seen action in Gaza before would it be facing similar challenges as it did back in 2014 for instance good day well it might be facing those challenges from 2014 in addition to the fact that Hamas had the time to develop its defenses to learn more about idf's templates how they operate so I think today we're seeing a more prepared adversary who has amongst other things human Intelligence on the IDF and how IDF is going to conduct this operation so U we also see a proliferation of new technologies such as drones which will most likely be deployed during this conflict and deployed extensively so I think the overal environment that the IDF will be facing will be much more challenging than that in 2014 and we have also seen that 2014 was not a successful operation for the IDF we just play a report in which we show the Israeli Army preparing for combat in Gaza particularly in its Urban combat welfare Warfare training center in southern Israel they call it euphemistically little Gaza as far as we understand so based on what you are saying whatever training templates they have had so far do you think they are out ofd date or they will need to be updated as the Army continues its uh operations in Gaza I think what is important to understand of course having um as you said um that training camp little Gaza is a benefit to train for urban combat however a training environment is always different from an operational environment and whatever you plan for is probably going to fall apart once you enter an urban area because you cannot account for all the challenges multidirectional challenges that will be facing the troops in Gaza therefore I think on the one hand Hamas will probably know or estimate how the Israeli troops will be handling themselves on the ground on the one hand on the other hand it is not just the preparedness the Tactical preparedness in urban Warfare there are also other components such as air and sea and space um feeding into this so overall the operation is much more complex and in order to train it in a training environment it becomes impossible POS and very costly so I don't think that um anything beyond Urban combat has been trained there such as coordination of air and Naval assets speaking of air and Naval assets Israel is also carrying out an extensive aerial bombing campaign in Gaza is that also designed to assist with a ground Invasion well um the idea of this bombing campaign is to um destroy the capabilities or as much the capabilities that Hamas has in the Gaza Strip and obviously also to damage its um underground tunnel Network system however the effectiveness of these attacks uh remains to be seen and we will be seeing that when actual urban combat begins because um the tanel network is very extensive um build of several layers and if we remember as a battle of mosul in irq um the Islamic State had only two years to dig tunnels and it took about eight months um to make progress there so um Hamas had a decade or more than a decade to develop that system um beyond that the intelligence that the Israeli um intelligence forces had on those targets needs to be updated because there might be new points because Hamas is quite flexible they will be relocating knowing that the Israelis will be using air power and they will be trying to maximize civilian casualties in order to exert political and legal pressure on the Israeli Defense Forces so it is a bit of a controversial topic with the air strikes we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today Marina Miran from Kings College London thanks so much thank you very much at Le at least 320 foreign passport holders left Gaza through the Rafa Crossing on Wednesday alongside dozens of severely injured Palestinians around 7,500 foreigners are expected to leave over the next 2 weeks under a deal brokered by K these were some of the first foreign passport holders to reach the safety of Egyptian soil on the other side hundreds were hoping for their chance to cross but only those on a list agreed by Israel in Egypt would be allowed to do so after more than 3 weeks under Israeli bombardment and blockade people here were desperate to escape we are relying on God and hoping we'll get out it's still our country and we feel sad for it for its Destruction for our friends and loved ones entire families were destroyed and erased all martyred and if it weren't for what happened we wouldn't leave as well as those allowed to leave for good Egyptian authorities have agreed to a small number of medical evacuations with ambulances crossing the border to retrieve the severely injured once in Egypt they were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment gaza's own medical facilities are desperately short of even basic supplies and are overflowing with the injured and while more Aid trucks were allowed through once again on Wednesday Aid groups say it's only a tiny fraction of what entered daily before the Hamas terrorist attacks the head of the un's relief agency in Gaza stressed that residents were in urgent need after he crossed into Rafa for a visit and I was shock by the fact that everyone there was was asking for food was asking for water we I saw almost every children trying to express their way that they need to eat they need to have water um I never ever have seen something similar in Gaza when I came before after conflict Egyptian officials say more people will be able to leave over the coming days but it's unclear just how long the Border will remain open to foreign passports holders what is certain is that unless Egypt's government lets Palestinians cross to for the vast majority of those trapped in Gaza Escape will remain impossible some 30,000 people have had to leave their homes in southern Lebanon due to intermittent fighting between militant group Hezbollah and the Israeli Army there fears Iranian backed Hezbollah could open up a new front against Israel at a time that it's already fighting against Hamas in Gaza it's why Israel is taking no chances on its border with Lebanon Israeli soldiers on high alert tanks maintaining positions near the border with Lebanon since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel border clashes between Israel and Iran backed militant group Hezbollah have become a daily occurrence hezbollah's rocket attacks have killed around seven Israeli soldiers Israeli drones have hit hisbah fighters in the southern lebanon's Rocky terrain and Olive Groves along the border dozens of hisbah Fighters have been killed many believe the Shiite group strategy so far appears to show caution in getting involved in a fullscale war with [Music] Israel so far I see that Hezbollah is managing these issues with rationality and wisdom and the rules of the game remain limited however at the same time I cannot assure the Lebanese about anything because things are subject to hb's timing even with widespread support for the Palestinian the uncertainty is a cause of concern for many Lebanese already reeling from one of the worst economic crisis in the country's history thousands of people in the Lebanese Villages and towns in the crossfire have evacuated volunteers and local authorities are scrambling to help people with limited means the displaced families have little appetite for War what in the 2006 War Lebanon had a government and a president the government ordered the towns to take care of us but now no one cares about us except for the mayor on his own initiative in the economic crisis and complete paralysis that the Lebanese government is suffering from we as municipalities depend completely on donations from Civil Society expatriate and charities Civil Defense Force in South lebanon's Maron area say their fire and rescue service cannot afford even basic equipment our gear is very primitive and there is a shortage of all tools such as fire resistance suits and extinguisher cylinders we don't even have helmets or flak jackets to protect our team so they can extinguish fires during the bombing nearby in the mountains Hezbollah continue to pose a major threat to Israel and Israel with its Readiness at its northern border is not taking any chances and joining me now for more context is DW Beirut bureau chief Muhammad sh Mohammad how Keen is Hezbollah to open up a full front against Israel at this stage well we know that hasah has been deliberately keeping all options on on the table his leadership said in many occasions that it is willing to do whatever needs to be done uh in the right time when is the right time we don't know but everyone is anticipating the speech of hasah Chief Hassan nasah tomorrow Friday this will be his first uh public appearance since the outbreak of the conflict uh in in Gaza and Israel on October 7 there have been a lot of speculations about this speech some are analyzing that this could be the moment when nah announces that his party will open a full front with Israel others just say it would be um another speech where he nah will end up ensuring the status quo on the Lebanese Israeli front uh Remains the Same despite the expected escalation in his language but give us a bit of a context about what we can expect potentially uh in in this speech for instance how close are Hamas and Hezbollah and uh could the progress of Israel's war against Hamas determine what Hezbollah does it did actually determine what what hasah does to a large extent hasah joined the conflict on the very second day after hamas's unprecedented surprise attack on on Israel on the morning of October 8th so the party attacked Israeli military posts in the Shabah farms in uh uh on the Lebanese Israeli border which Lebanon consider uh occupied territory and this was a clear statement that hasbullah considers itself in the core of this uh conflict we know that Hamas and and hisbah are part of a um um Regional Alliance the so-called resistance access both parties receive fund and logistic and political support from Iran and they long talked about being part of one strategy of unifying all fields of confrontation with Israel and the West as they name it speaking of Iran Iran's top Diplomat in fact warned earlier in the week that Iranian proxies whom he referred to as resistance groups something you also alluded to that these groups would not remain silent unless Israel's war against Hamas is stopped how seriously should one take that threat and does it reflect the popular mood among groups like Hezbollah well we are near the the end of the third week of this uh conflict and we've been hearing These Warnings from the Iranians since the beginning now we've seen some engagement from Iran's Regional allies like huis who claimed a couple of missiles and drwn attacks on on Israel other Shia militias in Iraq claimed attacks on American basis as well but so far these attacks were limited even hisbah which is considered to be Iran's strongest Ally in in the region has been keen on keeping the scrimmages with with Israel on the lanese Israeli borders very calculated and within acceptable Rules of Engagement we just played a report where lebanon's kak prime minister najib mikati said he can't reassure the Lebanese about anything because things are subject uh to hezbollah's timing so the Lebanese government doesn't appear to have any control over Hezbollah right well hasah is the political party with a military wing it is by far the most influential player in uh Lebanon it is seen to be even stronger than the Lebanese Army the the head of hasah said that it has a fighting force of some 100,000 foot soldier or fighter and thousands of rockets at its uh disposal now the government has been clear about working to prevent War but the truth is it's hasah who controls the decision of War and Peace in in lebanan and what has the impact been on people living in the Border areas with Israel I think the the answer really lies in um what the mayor and the head of civil defense said in in the report Lebanon has been Wheeling from the world worst financial and economic crisis in its modern history the country's economy is mainly uh relying on money transfers from the um Lebanese many Lebanese in the diaspora who send uh money to support their their families in here the government's ability to support the people in case of war is near zero it recently presented a an Emergency Response plan that many opposition Parliament members perceived as delusional because it it depends on uh promised aid from International organizations we'll leave it there for the time being thanks so much for joining us today Muhammad sh DW beut bureau chief thanks so much in Israel Hamas militants massacred around a tenth of the population of one kibuts in the south of the country those who remained have been evacuated to a resort on the Dead Sea there around a thousand survivors try to find ways of dealing with their trauma and in many cases the loss of their loved ones DW's Rebecca ritters reports from in booki portraying the dead from a time before their world fell apart just one of the therapies helping these people process their trauma at this upscale Resort on the Dead Sea it's a place of relative safety in a country at War around a thousand Israelis who escaped the massacre at kabut beri were evacuated here where they'll live for at least the next few months and try to come to terms with what happened yeah in 6 and a half in the morning something like this we heard a lot of boms and we woke up Ella benami recalls the moment the ordeal began her parents soon texted her from their home up the street they were in hiding Hamas gunman killed more than a 100 people in Barry that day Ella feared her mom and dad were among them something like an hour later I saw a picture of them on telegram with both terrorist they took him it's not in Israel I guess it's in Gaza two weeks later Ella found this video on telegram showing her captured mother filmed by Hamas so looking for clues of where they might have been taken she and her sister went back to their childhood home why why why why why I can't even describe it it was so hard even yesterday when I went to there I couldn't step on the ground because on every piece of ground I so body bodies and I couldn't think of of walking on there on there on the world don't donations from across the country have been pouring in for people who escaped with only the clothes on their back they have to tell it over and over again Dina draw is one of a team of psychotherapists stationed in the hotel to help them she says the most important thing is to get people talking how they couldn't breathe how they have had no food how they were worried how they saw in the WhatsApp uh group that people are in in in a great in danger how they escaped what did they see um they have to repeat it over and over until the story has a narrative it it has a beginning middle and an ending she says for Israelis this was an event unlike anything in recent memory it's a collective grief it's something we don't see usually in Israel you have a terror attack and a soldier is dead but here because of the massive numbers we have a collective uh grief and it's also a strong thing of a community that they going through it together going through it together but each alone in their pain there isn't a family that didn't lost someone there isn't a family here all the families lost someone and even as a kibuts we are a big family together and even I lost friends and neighbors and everyone lost someone the 7th of October was traumatic for all Israelis and even as the people from ber try to heal it's clear their trauma will be felt for generations and that's it for now there's continuing updates on the Israel Hamas war on our website dw.com and you can also follow along on our Facebook and X Pages this of course in addition to
