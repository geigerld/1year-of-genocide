now the United States said on Wednesday that it had attacked 14 missiles that were loaded and were to be fired from Yemen and this was the fourth day of us strikes in less than a week on iran-backed houthi militants who've been attacking Merchant ships in the Red Sea now according to the US Central Command a drone launched by the houthi rebels had struck a us-owned vessel ship tracking sites show that the boat then turned back towards the SE Canal the houthi attacks and the response from the US follow the outbreak of fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas which the US and others classify as a terrorist group with tensions rising in the Middle East there are concerns that a wider regional conflict could develop Israeli bombs strike Han yunas in the Gaza Strip after more than 100 days of fighting despite claims that the war is entering a new phase there has been little sign of a letup in a conflict which the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says has cost over 23,000 Palestinian lives on the Israeli side almost 1,500 have been lost what started with an unprecedented terror attack on October the 7th is quickly spilling out beyond the borders of Israel and Gaza drawing in Israel's traditional Ally the United States on the one side and on the other Hamas backer Iran recent days have seen dozens of attacks throughout the region in Yemen iran-backed houthi Rebels are continuing their campaign to disrupt International shipping lanes that despite dozens of air strikes from the United States and others targeting houthi military installations in Iraq and Syria tayron attacked several sites including one it claims was being used as an Israeli spy headquarters Lebanon has also seen several Israeli air strikes which the Israel Defense Force says were targeting Hamas leaders in Hezbollah welcome to D ret as leaders gather in Davos for the world economic Forum US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan warned the world was on a path to an escalation of hostilities in the Middle East an escalation that could see the bloody conflict that began on October the 7th spreading to The Wider region okay let's put this into perspective with Ian lesser he's the vice president of the German Marshall fund of the United States which is a nonpartisan American public policy Think Tank and his exper includes Middle Eastern security Affairs Ian thanks so much for your time today before we get into the nitty-gritty of this can I ask you on a scale of 1 to 10 how dangerous do you deem these current developments in the Middle East well probably it's good to be with you it won't surprise you probably that I would say eight but we weren't at eight uh over the last years we were at perhaps five there was always the potential for escalation many of the things that we're seeing now are actually U building on long-standing unresolved disputes frictions violent actions all sorts of things that existed beforehand but they've come together now in a very dangerous way can we focus in on Iran's strikes on Pakistan and now Islam abad's uh retaliation do you see a link here to the Israel Hamas War I actually don't necessarily see a link except to say that Iran is now in a mode of uh of striking out at uh various groups around the region on its borders uh in ways that probably are driven by the fact that the regime simply sees this as integral to its survival that it's simply built into the to the sort of operating strategy of the regime in Teran that they should be actively uh striking at groups working against their interests and supporting other kinds of crossb terrorism in many cases uh that they see as promoting their interest and so it's a period of particular activism uh for Iran but also there are probably groups looking to to take advantage of this even inside Iran as we saw Isis striking in Iran uh not long ago so you're so you're saying that tan provoking So many actors at once is essentially it trying to show its own strengths well I you I think you know just like many regimes uh Iran sees the protection of its sovereignty uh not only that but its own regime survival is something that is foremost in its planning and uh you know the ability to keep supporting these movements uh is something that's simply built into the structure of the regime and of course there are now many many more um disputes conflicts coming to the surface where Iran is going to see some stake in intervening and I think that's what we've seen in Iran and in Iraq uh and now in Pakistan looking at the Israel Hamas War do you think that a a resolution to this conflict could allow things to more or less return to to where they were or has a wider geopolitical struggle you know started now that will essentially reshape the Middle East well the crisis in Gaza obviously Builds on a very longstanding unresolved dispute between Palestinians in Israel and uh that's really the underlying issue here uh many people over decades have tried to make progress on that front sometimes it's looked better than others we're at a particularly low moment now I think if there is a ceasefire in Gaza it certainly would help but it's not going to resolve many of the things that we see happening uh it's it's not really going to change many of these Dynamics Hezbollah and Lebanon will still have the same grievances with Israel Israel will still have its same security concerns Iran will have its own interests in the region and you know the fear of course is that now in a sense we're pulling on a string and you don't really know where this ends and where will all of this leave Israel do you think I mean will it now be in a weaker diplomatic uh position in the region might it now be forced to make certain concessions that it had ruled out in the past uh Palestinian statehood for example well most of this depends obviously on the political equation inside Israel and that's that's in flux obviously uh in the wake of events um you know Israel before the current set of Crisis uh had been in a really a rather strong position diplomatically in normalization with many uh countries that were important to Israel in the Arab world uh that now much of it not all of it has fallen apart um in some ways it's not s it's surprising in a way that given what is happening that certain relationships have actually been preserved in a sense with Saudi Arabia most surprisingly um but obviously there are others where there was an opening including with turkey that have now uh you know really been set back and so yes I mean Israel does face greater diplomatic isolation it's it's not complete in any sense uh but it's something that any Israeli government is going to have to reckon with in the coming years Ian ler vice president of the German Marshall fund Ian thanks so much for your time today and for your insights good to be with you and it's to Gaza now where a shipment of medicine has arrived intended for scores of Israeli hostages being held in the territory as well as for gaza's own desperate population the delivery comes after Qatar and France mediated a deal between Israel and the militant group Hamas which is deemed a terrorist group by many countries it's the first agreement between Israel and Hamas since a week-long ceasefire in November now the Israeli president Isaac Herzog has called Iran an evil empire which is at the root of tensions in the Middle East he was speaking at the world World economic Forum in Davos Switzerland and he said that Hamas which many countries classify as a terrorist group was armed and financed by Teran Iran was using Hamas he said to derail stability not only in the region but in the entire world October Terror right let's get some analysis now with Mayra zonshine she's a senior analyst with the international crisis group myav in the past few days we've seen the houis and the US exchange fire has continue attacks on the Israeli border Iran attack Targets in Iraq and Syria I mean is this the region-wide war many have been fearing I think it's fair to say that we are in a regional War um I you know it's not an allout War there's degrees um and I think where I'm standing in Israel you know if there was an allout war with Lebanon with kisala it would look quite different where I'm sitting in Tel Aviv so there's obviously it could get a lot worse uh but as as far as Israelis are concerned they're fighting on several fronts and I think as far as um you know some analysts would argue and I probably would agree that uh in some ways the US and Israel are now at war with Iran in in various ways speaking about Iran because Iran does appear to be heavily involved whether it's with the huis in Yemen or Hezbollah in Lebanon or militias in Iraq and Syria what does Iran want right well I'm not an expert on Iran but I can tell you that this is uh we're seeing after October 7th kind of the culmination of years of a buildup of power that Iran has directly funded and in different indirect ways has built up as well and we're seeing it now in action and so I think that is something that is both directly and indirectly a product of of Iranian strategy uh to to build up power and project it against Israel and the us and we're seeing it now take effect and and that doesn't mean that Iran is necessarily uh directing what's happening I I think the houis are you know somewhat autonomous and not always Cooperative balah has its own interests in Lebanon you know it's while it's a very difficult and failing state right now it's still a state um and in you know Hamas for example the October 7th attack it's it's quite likely that Iran didn't know about it even though it works into its strategy of keeping up pressure and attacking Israel so I think what we're seeing is a culmination of years and years of building up of power and strategy given this buildup do you think that the future of how this moves forward depends on how the Israel Hamas War turns out or have things now been set in motion that are independent of the outcome of that war it's a very good question and it's one that I'm also grappling with but I think it's pretty clear especially from the short pause that we had in late November in the Israel Gaza war that if there was a full ceasefire uh in Gaza that we would see a cessation of hostilities on most most of those fronts if not all of those fronts that doesn't mean that those don't have their own nature that they could you know uh spiral out of control but I think what we've learned since October 7th is that the entire Regional stability of the Middle East depends in large part on what's happening in Israel and Palestine and so absolutely the first thing to do would be to immediately call for an Implement a ceasefire here and then hope that that would uh start to calm the situation and deescalate across the region and then of course you would have turn to diplomacy How likely are we realistically myav to get a ceasefire at stage unfortunately it does not look good uh there's even a fight within the war cabinet in Israel and amongst the families of the hostages who would very much like to see a cessation of the war right now in order to secure the release of the hostages that's something that they're pressuring the government on the Prime Minister has said outright that he refuses uh he has his own political and domestic reasons to do that as well but he also claims that the goal of deteriorating destroying dismantling whatever you want to call it of Hamas is still something that he believes Israel will achieve and he wants a lot of time to do that um I think the way to get to a ceasefire is for the US to pressure Israel uh to agree to one and it has not done that so far but can us pressure actually work on Israel I mean it's the US has been trying to pressure Israel for a number of weeks now we've had deliber the UN Security Council as well but Israel continues with its operation in Gaza in fact it is winding it down but the operation does continue how much influence does the US really have on Israel the US has a lot of Leverage it could condition its military uh weaponry and Armament of Israel that Israel relies on uh it could condition Aid things that have been floated Now by certain Progressive Democrats something that has become quite has been quite Taboo in the the us but is now becoming a little bit more accepted and that would be the leverage the US has the power it has chosen not to use it I think Biden has really tried to to go along with Israel's war effort and to try and navigate Israel into a more strategic place but Israel clearly isn't going in that direction and the US also has has sided with Israel in this war so it would require a lot of political will and capital from the bided Administration when they're now entering an election year so it would be something Biden would have to really go all out for we'll leave it there for the timing but thanks so much for all that context Mayra zonshine from the international crisis group thanks so much thank [Music]
