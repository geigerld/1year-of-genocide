Israeli activists continue to try protecting Aid convoys headed for Gaza from attacks by extremist Jewish settlers before the war 500 truckloads of supplies a day sustained gaza's population due to strict Security checks and the attacks far fewer trucks now cross into the territory tww Za Ibrahim reports from Takia Crossing where right-wing activists have been vandalizing egg convoys on route from Jordan through the West Bank these Israelis aren't going on a day trip they're on a mission they want to make sure that eight for Gaza makes it there safely but when they get to the junction food is already scattered on the ground we've arrived at the site of an attack by Israeli extremists on and Aid Convoy meant for starving civilians in Gaza and as you can see behind me activists are now busy trying to save really what can be saved from that food they're encouraged by the effect they've had because we were here and we made the police come here as well and we encourag the police to do whatever needed to stop them we can see that only few of the boxes were falling down and most of the thing in the TRU continue to Gaza we've also seen the police try to come between the activists and the attackers who even as the police is standing right next to them can continue vandalizing the food as it lays on the pavement they full of Fate right now and they are acting as if they don't care that people die from anger this is not the country we want to be we are not leaving this checkpoint till the settlers will leave the area and we'll make sure that all the trucks will go and bring food to Gaza the police officers on site refused to give us an interview on camera but said that on that day they arrested at least two people in connection with the attack whose aftermath we witnessed a few days earlier near this checkpoint there was a violent attack on another eight Convoy activists there said Israeli soldiers did nothing to stop the vandalism extremist settlers have been waging attacks like these regularly in Israel a report by the garden newspaper even suggests that some members of State security tip off attackers ahead of time about the location of eight convoys it was violence like that which inspired this group of activists to organize their solidarity guard it's not only the question of what's going on in Gaza it's a question of our society and which kind of a society we are going to be are we going to be a society that will allow hunger and um famine and destruction and death to be celebrated or are we going to stand against it and to say we are human we are fighting for our own Humanity it's infuriating the fact that that that we need to be here we always find people that will be disruptive but I'm a citizen of Israel I'm also an American citizen um as a human being why are we not doing more it's happening in my name and it's for the government for the police for the Army to do everything possible insults come thick and fast Nazis and Hamas their fellow Israelis call them but they continue to try to get the food onto a truck and back towards Gaza by the end of the day they told us all the trucks had gone through with little damage to them a victory and Aya joins us now from Jerusalem how common have these attacks on eight convoys become Aya they've become very common since uh April we've been seeing on social media on an almost daily basis videos of uh Israeli extremists uh associated with the settler Community intercepting these eight convoys and uh destroying them we've also uh heard reports of truck drivers uh being assaulted even if they're not carrying Aid at all so that gives you a sense of the chaos uh that is uh around the story right now if the you know particular settler groups suspect that a truck is carrying Aid uh what they usually do is that they put a roadblock with rocks and they start attacking uh the driver uh if he is Palestinian looking if they suspect that he's carrying uh Aid he's often sort of by himself in that situation um and that's really uh you know the the the frequency of these attacks and the randomness of it is as we mentioned what inspired this group to start organizing and what they're saying is is that their modus appara is to really try and stand between the aid and the attackers and also with their presence uh because they make their presence very well known to the police try to encourage and force the police to come and um according to them do their job and chaos is a good way of describing the situation I mean what about protecting these truck drivers as well as protecting the aid what what is the police doing what are what's the Israeli military actually doing so when we were uh there uh present the police was present uh and as you as we tried to show in the report they sort of tried to keep the two groups separate from each others but what activists have been saying is that previously and certainly uh this claim is corroborated by the you know the visual uh documentation of these attacks the police has not uh been uh uh present um and has in some cases just stood by and watched these attacks that's according to I witness uh accounts uh by activists and um I just want to you know paint a bigger picture about the situation with the police in Israel right now for our viewers who may not be famili familiar uh the police is of course under the supervision of the national security minister the far-right national security minister itamar bavier and um we have seen him in the past couple of days uh sort of implicitly support openly support uh these uh attacker saying that he understands their anger he understands their frustration um he says that he wants to see them block it but that they shouldn't be burning or attacking drivers so there is some support coming from the man who really controls the police and he has also boasted about being a member of the security cabinet who's actually voted against Israel facilitating Aid uh uh to Gaza and there are a lot of accusations coming from the activist Community saying that basically because of this roric coming from political leaders ership namely the national security minister police isn't really motivated to do their job and in fact the national security minister has spoken out against the police providing so many resources to protect the aing that he doesn't really understand why so much police is there uh to protect the aid going to Gaza and there's been widespread condemnation of these attacks of course from Germany included how's the Israeli government reacting to that well if touched a little bit on what the National Security uh Minister has been saying so from there you can definitely see that there's a a he's he's not he's not condemning the violence openly but there's certainly an understanding for what uh the attackers are doing um but you're absolutely correct we're now in a moment where Israel is getting a lot of pressure from the International Community on many fronts when it comes to this war Germany has condemned a these attacks the United States Israel's biggest Ally has condemned these attacks as well but we're also hearing a lot of condemnation from Jordan because remember um a lot of this Aid that's coming through the West Bank is originating in Jordan and that's another that's Israel's immediate neighbor an Arab country with one of the oldest peace treaties with Israel now also speaking out about this and so it gives you a sense of the level of concern that this you know domestic issue we could called it that is also resonating well outside of Israel's borders at a difficult time for the country and its political leadership in this war context there from a Ibrahim in Jerusalem thank you
