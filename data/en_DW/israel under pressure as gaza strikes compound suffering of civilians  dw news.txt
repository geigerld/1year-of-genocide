renewed fighting in Gaza has stretched into a second day after truce deal between Israel and Hamas expired early Friday explosions lit up the night sky over the eastern part of con yunes as International concern grew over Israeli plans to expand its offensive to the south of the strip the Israeli military says it has carried out some 400 strikes on terrorist targets since fighting resumed with conun seeing some of the most intense bombardment since the war started started the Hamas controlled Health Ministry in Gaza says almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed hostilities the resumption in fighting is compounding the suffering of some 2 million Palestinians trapped inside Gaza with the fighting in Gaza resumed Israel faces mounting pressure to do more to protect Palestinian civilians as it continues with its stated aim to destroy Hamas and the challenge es don't end there an air strike on Rafa in southern Gaza with much of Northern Gaza under Israeli control Israel's focus is now turning to the South this means fighting in an even more densely populated area than before hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled the north are now here the Israel Defense Forces released a map showing Gaza divided into numbered sections this means that will receive evacuation notices based on the number of the section they live in and should make it easier to evacuate civilians before an area comes under attack however in fleeing they may expose themselves to an attack as well which happened when Palestinians fled the north another challenge Israel says more than 130 hostages are still in Gaza many of them soldiers that Hamas wants to trade for its own high value prisoners in Israel many are thought to be held in South there are fears that indiscriminate bombing from the air could kill hostages as well as their captors and civilians Israel also faces International pressure especially from the US which is Israel's main Ally and Backer there is political turmoil in the US over civilian casualties in Gaza and the government worries that Israel has no EX plan from the war but Israel has the most sophisticated one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world it is capable of neutralizing the threat posed by Hamas while minimizing harm to innocent men women and children and it has an obligation to do so Israel says the need to eradicate hamas's threat is overriding all other concerns but after 8 weeks of war and with a death toll of over 15,000 Palestinians it might soon need to re-evaluate its plans DW's Tanya Kramer joins us now from Jerusalem Tanya Israel says it hit more than 200 Targets in Gaza on Friday with a clear focus on the increasingly congested South and I say congested because in the early days of this conflict it's where Israel had urged gazin to flee what's the situation there now well absolutely there have been a lot of reports coming out of Gaza of course we are not on the ground there uh from heavy uh air strikes across Gaza but also uh mainly focused uh on uh Southern uh cities in Gaza there has also been some rocket fire uh coming out from Gaza overnight uh but the main Center seems to be uh right now in the center like uh areas like the AL balak or Khan Unis where people have a city in the south of the Gaza Strip where people in the Eastern Parts have been asked again to move towards the west or towards further south um but of course you know we we've he we've heard from Israeli officials that they are saying uh they're assuming some of the Hamas leadership might be in Kan yunus that might uh indicate why there's so much attention uh to this place right now but as you said with 1.8 million uh uh residents in Gaza Palestinians there you know being displaced and having been told to go to the South uh to seek uh you know in some safe areas where there are no safe areas it's a very difficult situation uh for the civilian population and the Israeli military has also released a map on Friday uh saying that they had uh um split Gaza into uh different uh areas and districts uh as they are saying this should indicate to Residents where they combat active combat zones but of course uh humanitarian organizations have very strongly criticized this that this is not the protection of civilians because they have simply uh no safe area to go also in the South uh we've seen also before the pause of fighting there have been air strikes there with a lot of Civilian casualties some military experts here some military analysts in Israel have said that this could be an indication uh that potentially Israel might um expand its ground offensive also uh towards the South but that is of course very very difficult there for the civilian population in these areas m and for the families of remaining hostages and of course besieged Gins the fact the truce has ended must of course be a blow what hopes if any are there for any possible ceasefire well it's really too early to tell um this was the uh concern all along that this is just a pause in fighting um of course hostages Israeli hostages uh that were held in Gaza um have been released east of course not all of them many remain in Gaza and then humanitarian Aid came in but as the report indicated uh uh not nearly enough to meet uh all the needs but right now uh the fighting is back uh the war is in full force with uh dire consequences for the civilian population and there's no indication if both sides would agree uh soon on another fighting uh PA and fighting that is Tanya Kramer thank you so much Tanya for more let's bring in military expert Frank ledwidge in Oxford Frank uh the war is now very much focused on the south of the Gaza Strip where thousands of gazans have fled since the beginning of the conflict is it possible to fight a war there and still protect civilians well good morning Michael the answer is evidently no and we discover yesterday that the targeting system the Israelis are using which is generating so many targets every day and integrates all the intelligence sources human intelligence a air intelligence space signals is in fact driven by AI which raises real concerns I think for ethicists indeed for military professionals as to the automation of warfare so in other words the target list is generated and then choices are made and those choic will often have a bias to them of acceptance that seems to be the case so to come back to your question self-evidently uh we've seen so far it's very difficult to do that but especially if your target list is extremely long you just tick them off and there they are usually what would happen is every strike would have something called a CO collateral damage estimate in most Western countries and I think Israel used to do that very difficult to do that when you're striking hundreds of targets every day uh just one gloss on what Tanya said I little doubt that the ground wall will extend to the South it will need to do so in due course of Israel's to meet its objectives meanwhile that ground war is carrying on very intensively alongside the air strikes in the north of Gaza right um one of the biggest challenges and we' we've talked about this I'm sure in the past one of the biggest challenges the IDF faces is dealing with hamas's tunnel system as someone with General combat experience how difficult do you imagine it is for the Israeli military to fight there well Michael Israel's been preparing for the Gaza Metro as people call it the 500 kilometers or so or so it said of uh deep tunnels within Gaza and they have been dealing with them comprehensively since the start of this this campaign air and ground so for example just before the ceasefire the Israelis announced that they had found in the north of Gaza where their soldiers are in excess of 400 tunnel entrances now it's all very well of course finding the T tunnel entrances but of course the tunnels are up to 50 some say even more meters deep and no Israeli soldier however Elite and the Israeli combat engineer tunnel Corp uh is an elite unit are going to go down there themselves so they will be using robotics there are clearly other devices use I mean there's various forms of foam for example there's some talk of flooding the tunnels from the sea uh theyve all kinds of devices for dealing with these things but the point is that this is that's the military center of gravity for Hamas the tunnel system it's where they are and it's why many of those bombs that you see are produce so much damage because what the Israelis are trying to do is trying to get down into that tunnel system using bunker buster other kinds of bombs many of them by the way supplied by the United States Frank of course we don't know definitively where the remaining hostages are one has to imagine that a good number of them if not all of them are somewhere along that tunnel system how dangerous is the situation now for those remaining hostages in Gaza yeah some interesting comments came out clearly the when when some of the hostages were released and a few details of their de briefs were released now clearly look the reality is that all of those hostages will now or will have been be debriefed by Israeli intelligence in detail to try and determine where they were uh How deep the tunnels were what their perceptions were how many hostages in each place the slight every detail counts because that's is where they were and the debriefs that we've seen or the readouts from them obviously these Israelis for very good reasons are keeping that very close hole very tight uh indicate that course of course that's where the hostages are but I don't think Israeli Special Forces and Israeli hostage recovery teams are particularly have a particular expectation that they're going to find them be able to get in and get them clearly that the aim here is as far as possible to negotiate them out at the moment that's a military expert Frank ledwidge in Oxford as ever many thanks Frank thank you Michael and for more on this we welcome now journalist hassim baloa from Jordan uh hasham the UN humanitarian office has said that hell on Earth has returned to Gaza you were reporting for us from there at the beginning of the conflict you're now in Jordan you have friends and relatives back there how do they say the situation is now indeed um this is what um the people say um hostilities uh resumed since uh Friday morning uh arist um across the Gaza STP in different areas um um there is movement of of some tanks in different in in certain areas especially in East ofun in th Gaza stb um in jabalia in the north east of Gaza City uh as well some people were asked to evacuate um um recently there was a um an air strike on jabalia refugee camp in fuja neighborhood um um on um um a family house that housing over 100 people um some reports that coming from there about 100 were killed um according to the medical um uh um to the doctor of the director of the kamalan hospital in jabalia said 12 um were received 12 killed received to the hospital um I talked to different people in kanun and they said that air strikes didn't stop there were uh air strikes on hammad uh compound about six buildings were destroyed there and it's going up to now I think and um um people are running out of of some certain areas and hasham big picture wise during the past weeks we know that thousands tens hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Southern Gaza which is where the fighting is now focused so where are people supposed to go this is the question this is what the people are asking they don't know I I I talked today to someone who told me that they um her and her and and her family um displaced for four times um first from their house to the father-in-law house then to noat in Central Area then to east of kanun and now they are in the west of kanun they don't know where to go I talked to other one who's from K east of kanun and told me that he he he ran he fled from his house before the bows returned during the seven day of the Bose and now um again at um ran Ona School uh people um wonder where to go they are ready they might be asked to to to evacuate and there is no place to go um some areas are experiencing some ground Invasion but other places are under air strikes as well and help us if you don't mind understand the sort of no no Safe Haven situation Israel says it's carried out some 400 strikes on hamus since the end of the truce hamus says that around 200 Palestinians have been killed since that uh began do those numbers sound plausible to you accurate well um just like um um less than half an hour the Ministry of Health held um uh a press conference in Gaza and said that the the death toll raised over 15,000 uh actually this number of 200 were was was U uh uh for yesterday and um today death toll is not um updated yet so these numbers are happening because there is uh overcrowded areas and people are killed when there is a single air strike or artillery shell journalist has belala reporting for us from
