and Israeli strikes on Gaza are continuing the latest killed at least 11 people in a residential building in the northern gazen town of bet lahia that's according to Palestinian media families in southern Israel have held funerals for former hostages whose bodies recovered from in Gaza this week now they were among 250 taken during the October 7 Hamas Terror attacks which triggered the war [Music] tears of anger and despair y bsta was kidnapped from koods Nim on October 7th now his family and his whole Community is laying him to rest in what world does a mother have to thank for the return of her son who was abandoned and murdered in what world do families have to beg and cry for the return of their family members alive and murdered today I ask you again for forgiveness my child I'm sorry we didn't make it I'm sorry Israel says it recovered book staff's body and five more in a tunnel in Gaza earlier this week the Army has come under heavy criticism for its failure to predict the October 7th attack and for its slow response that day the outgoing head of Israeli military intelligence says the failures of October 7th will haunt him for the rest of his life we failed in the most important Mission we entrusted with giving a war warning the ultimate responsibility for the failure of the Intelligence Division rests with me according to Gaza officials Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed over 40,000 Palestinians in the strip since the war started prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure at home and from abroad to reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas but negotiations have been deadlocked for months many who attended the funerals of the Israeli hostages lamented the fact that months of talks have yet to yield a deal releasing the differently they could have been brought back in March and we could have extended the deal and they could have returned alive then we wouldn't be in cemeteries today Hamas is believed to still be holding around 110 hostages captured during the October 7th attacks Israeli authorities estimate around a third are dead now behind the scenes negotiations over ending the war in Gaza are due to continue in Cairo so far representatives from Israel Qatar Egypt and the US have been involved but not the Palestinian militant group Hamas the technical talks are based on a peace plan suggested by the US in May and approved by the UN Security Council the plan includes a six week ceasefire a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return of hostages held by militants in Gaza Israel would release Palestinian prisoners and withdraw the rest of its forces then the Reconstruction of Gaza could begin both sides still have their differences which it's hoped will be addressed by a bridging proposal but Israel and Hamas are accusing each other of adding and changing conditions Hamas says it can't accept Israel's plan to keep control of the Philadelphia Corridor that's a buffer zone along the gazan border with Egypt nor can it accept Israel's demand of a veto over the release of Palestinian prisoners or its plan to search Palestinians for weapons before letting them return home to Northern Gaza there are fears that a wider War could erupt if a ceasefire doesn't come soon journalist kareim algari has been following developments in Cairo well welcome kareim um what's your assessment of where these talks are at the moment well we have very little concrete news really there is still a gap Israeli wants a continued military presence uh in the Gaza Strip and they want to have guarantees that they can continue the war even after ceasefire at a later Point Hamas wants the opposite they want the Israeli Army completely out of the Gaza Strip and they want guarantees for a permanent ceasefire there were talks between um US President Joe Biden and camela Harris and Netanyahu um yesterday they urging him to seal a deal somehow a bit contradicting the optimism spread by state Secretary blinkin in the last days um there's also some indications from um Arab officials from the mediating States Qatar and Egypt in official ones uh some say the US went too far accommodating Netanyahu with this continued military presence in the Gaza Strip uh another one is saying there's an impass right now there's no point in holding highlevel negotiations until this is sorted out and there is also anger at the Arab mediating States about the fact fact that the US is portraying Netanyahu is the one who signs the deal and is ready for a ceasefire and Hamas is the as obstructing party but having said all that um we know really in in fact very little what is happening behind the courus okay so we're at this this onass it sounds like um roadblocks on both sides and meanwhile there is this threat of Iran and its proxies attacking Israel unless progress is made well right now when we get back to Gaza both sides are trying to reach something they could have they were not reach able to reach in the war Netanyahu wants to establish a permanent military presence Israeli military presence signed off by Hamas Hamas wants the Army to go out both sides put pressure on the ground right now Hamas is for except for example attacking the narim corridor that's the corridor that's where the Israeli Army is positioned separating the Gaza Strip in a northern and southern part um Israel on the other side is pressuring by not stopping the bombing uh issuing more and more evacuation orders now for example in the two biggest population centers in the center of the Gaza Strip Kan Yunis and D balah at the same time uh there is only 10% now of the Gaza Strip that is a designated safe zone for the people so so uh it's a way of pressuring Hamas into a into a deal simply by creating a desperate situation situation on the ground for the Palestinians but that of course is a double-sided sort because the Israeli Army now is going back to Kan yunes for this third time that shows that they cannot really destroy Hamas whenever they go in they leave they have to go in again that counters of course somehow netanyahu's claim to be able to eliminate Hamas militarily and that of course increases the need for some kind of political deal okay thanks for that Karim Karim Al gaari in CYO you're wome meanwhile police in Israel have clashed with Orthodox Jewish protesters in Jerusalem who were opposed to military conscription five people were arrested officers could be seen beating and forcibly removing demonstrators they blocked a roads to prevent demonstrators blocked a road to prevent people summoned for military service from attending the enlistment office aridi Jews had long been exempt from military service until June when the Supreme Court ruled they must be drafted
