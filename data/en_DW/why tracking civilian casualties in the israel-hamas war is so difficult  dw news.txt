the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says the death toll from the war with Israel has surpassed 19,000 but independently verifying these numbers is difficult with many journalists and human rights workers having fled the T territory and outside access severely restricted now despite the challenges in documenting the Dead the UN says civilian casualties are unprecedented just a warning our next report contains some distressing images counting the dead an already gruesome job made almost impossible by on the ground fighting the Relentless bombardment of Israeli forces and the sheer chaos of War they are targeting children as you can see that's what happened two missiles from F-16 hitting little children [Music] the human toll of the fighting is often conveyed by Witnesses and by overwork doctors repeated blackouts mean social media is sometimes their only way to give updates no longer able to provide surgeries at Arley Hospital the hospital is now effectively a first aid station hundreds of wounded now at hospital with no access to surgery they will die from their wounds an official toll of casualties is being kept by the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza its latest update said Israel's offensive had killed more than 19,000 Palestinians the Hamas run Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but has said that most of those killed were women and children thank you Secretary General for this the United Nations has backed this claim despite stated verification challenges what is clear is that we have had in a few weeks thousands of children killed so this is what matters we are witnessing a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict since I am Secretary General not yet included in the official death toll are the thousands of people who are missing and feared dead under the rubble when or if they are recovered officials in Gaza will have to figure out where to bury them cemeteries are either full or inaccessible because of fighting an unknown number of bodies has been buried in Mass Graves toes Paton is the project leader at the Upsala conflict data program with the Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry reporting more than 19,000 Palestinian deaths I asked her earlier how confident we can be that this number is accurate well the numbers reported by the gon Ministry of Health have been shown to be rather accurate and precise in earlier phases of this conflict when for example the UN has been able to uh conduct their own investigations later on so we have no reason to believe believe that the ministry is not telling the truth this time uh one should remember that it's extremely hard to gather real time data in the midst of War uh communication channels are Disturbed internet is down um so I'm not surprised if these numbers are revised later on both downwards could be because of double counting but more likely upwards when more bodies are found under the rubble um and and people have been buried uh hastily in Mass Graves for example but we have no reason to believe that these numbers are exaggerated in any way gazen authorities don't distinguish between combatants and civilians when giving these numbers but Israel estimates that around 5,000 Hamas militants have been killed since October 7th is it possible to verify this uh I wouldn't say that it is at this point as you said the health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants we know that a big proportion is women and children so we can assume that those at least are civilians um but we cannot really trust Israel because they on the other side has an interest in over reporting insurgents and Under reporting civilian casualties so we this is just one of the things that we have to accept that we cannot know right now but that will become clear as time passes and like I said it's really hard in in real time to get accurate data um from war zones yeah I would like to talk about your work right now because the upsel conflict data program has been recording the death toll in global conflict since 1989 how has the limited access to Gaza made this more difficult since October 7th and you know maybe even before that well it's definitely a problem and mean we collect data we collect preliminary data on a monthly basis but we also have our yearly data which is more um thoroughly investigated so we are used to the situation that information becomes clearer as time passes and we always go back and revise the data as well and actually Israel and the Palestine conflict is one of the best covered conflicts in the world historically so this is one of the conflict zones that we get the most detailed information from uh in many areas of the world it's much harder so this is not uh a new thing it's not unique for this uh Conflict at all but we work a lot with different types of sources trying to triangulate different um types of information using social media uh and Nos and um different news media to to be able to get a sense of what's going on now that you mentioned social media this is of course also a war of images a war of words a propaganda war of sworts as well how much does that complicate your work of course it's uh really hard and again it's not unique to this conflict at all we always need to be aware of the where does the information come origin from originally and that actor has that actor an interest in portraying this conflict in a certain way and also with video images we need to be really careful it's been shown in this conflict and in Ukraine for example and many other conflicts as well that uh videos that were uh released as um evidence of something going on in the conflict was in fact from a video game so this information flow that we have right now is of course we need to be cautious and and really be careful about uh trying to to check where the information comes from and if we can trust that Source thees Pon project leader at the upsot conflict data program in OBS in Sweden many thanks thank you Joe Dyke is lead investigator at air wars a nonprofit that tracks civilian casualties and conflicts welcome to DW the hamus Run Health Ministry in Gaza say more than 19,000 Palestinians have died in Israeli attacks civilians and Fighters can you confirm that number uh thank you first of all for having us um no we can't confirm that number explicitly but I think it's worth putting in context of there are two major Trends here one is as you said earlier uh human rights workers journalists Etc are not able to operate in Gaza uh and the the context and then International journalists have been prevented from entering by the Egyptian authorities and by the Israeli authorities so you have this uh huge gap of information and then you have uh a dispute an unprecedented dispute over the numbers uh and as you say uh you know then can you confirm these numbers is very difficult thing to do but the night the night broadly what we can say is so we as an organization are tracking all allegations of Civilian harm but every incident goes through a five or six stage review process so it takes a long time we've published more than 100 instance already of more than 1,600 that we have monitored meaning that have been uh that need to be assessed and reviewed so it's a long slow process what we can say is that in those hundred that we have published and that have been through the full uh process we're also crosschecking them with the details that were released by the Ministry of Health the Palestinian Ministry of Health that released the names of 7,000 victims we're crosschecking them with those and broadly we're finding that the name that we are in we are finding in a completely different methodology are the same as those released by the um Palestinian Ministry of Health or many of them are the same so that so broadly we're finding that those uh methodology and those figures that have been released by the Ministry of Health we're finding them broadly uh uh consistent uh but we can't say that the 19,000 would it will just take us a long long time to do that process in general what about the proportion of civilians in in those numbers yeah I I think uh again it it will take a long time to make full assessments but I think what we can say is so air wars as an organization has been tracking civilian harm in conflicts for a decade so in Iraq Syria Yemen Libya um Ukraine in the last year H and one thing that we can say for certain here is that we're seeing far more incidents of entire families uh killed in their homes together than we have seen in other contexts uh that that doesn't necess necessarily uh you know we uh talk you about full it would take a long time to have full assessments the Israeli military says that it assesses that two two civilians have been killed for every militant it's very hard to objectively judge that I have no idea what methodology they reached that uh uh conclusion um but what we can say is that the number of cases uh of of entire families killed in is unlike anything we have in other conflicts uh and therefore that indicates that you know there's there's very large civilian harm inance jaia for example there was an attack on the refugee camp where we individually monitored more than a hundred specific civilians that were killed in that incident again with the attack on alage which is a a residential building in Northern Gaza we monitor we tracked more than a 100 civilians uh killed in that incident as well so you're seeing huge uh incidents in which many many civilians are killed in one one case do do your assessments go as far as pinpointing uh or or or holding accountability to you know which side is is to blame in all of this uh I mean so so uh they do they do to a certain extent uh we obviously you know that uh absolute certainty requires people on the ground looking at Munitions remnants and that's true wherever you are in the world um what ever conflict you're looking at I think in the context of something like jabalia or something like Al there is no ability nobody else in the uh in this conflict has the ability to destroy a building uh a 12 story building in one go there's just I mean the the Israelis even accept that they uh carried out jabalia and they accept that They carried out Al so like there's not um in certain incidents they they they accept it I think in General it's it's very it will take a long time to be certain on every incident is as to whether it is a um you know whether it could have been Palestinian rocket fire we we in 2021 monitored all uh civilian harm from in the war there and and we found that around at least 151 civilians were killed by Israeli strikes and 15 uh were killed by Palestinian misfire so that you know that gives you some indication okay uh but I think it's it will take a long time to be certain on that but I think there's there's certainly uh an overwhelming uh Power in the sense of military capacity and impact is the Israeli military forces Joe dke there head of the investigations and accountability unit at air wars thank
