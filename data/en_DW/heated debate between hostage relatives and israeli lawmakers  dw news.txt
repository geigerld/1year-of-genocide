the chief of the Palestinian militant group Hamas says it's close to a temporary truce with Israel that would allow for the exchange of Israeli hostages for Hamas prisoners US President Joe Biden also said he believes a hostage deal is near even as an agreement appeared to be taking shape relatives of some hostages were angered by security minister itamar Ben's call for the death penalty for Hamas operatives currently in Israeli custody at meeting in the knesset relative said plans to revive Israel's dormant capital punishment laws for Palestinian prisoners of War would endanger their own loved ones lives Israel detained a number of suspected Hamas Fighters after the October 7th Terror attacks let's get the latest with DW correspondent Rebecca rtis in Jerusalem Rebecca what's the latest you're hearing about those hostage negotiations well gal this it certainly feels like the closest we've come to a deal being agreed of course there have been negotiations ongoing pretty much since the beginning since October let's say 8th even um where these negotiations have been like going up and down on and off they were getting pretty close we were hearing prior to Israel's uh ground offensive then that completely uh stalled the talks and now we're hearing more and more positive noises coming out of the negotiations we heard over the weekend from qatar's prime minister Alani now he of course or the qaris at least negotiators playing a huge role in these hostage negotiations uh we heard very positive words from him saying that that a deal was Clos then of course we heard contradictory remarks from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a deal was nowhere near being finalized uh he's under a lot of pressure to remain firm of course their one of their main objectives or the main objective you might say uh is to eradicate Hamas so he's needing to maintain a public firmness on that line while at the same time trying to ensure that these hostages are released but this is certainly the closest we have now heard we're hearing from the White House and as you reporting also from is one of the Hamas leaders saying that a deal is imminent the deal we're talking about is somewhere between 50 and 100 hostages to be released predominantly women and children um all civilians none of the military captives uh in exchange for some prisoners from the Palestinian side in Israeli prisons women and children up to about 300 as well as a 3 to 5 day ceasefire to allow for humanitarian Aid to be L into the Gaza Strip now that has been a major sticking point uh Israel worried that it will give Hamas a chance to rearm and recoordination in the next hours if not days uh Rebecca it appears from what we've seen earlier that relations between the uh um relatives of the hostages and the government government have become rather tense is that correct well we saw yesterday and you were reporting it there uh in the leadin that a very tense session in the knesset as members of the far right or far far part of the far right Coalition this odds Yehuda party Jewish power they are seen as an extremist party they are trying to reintroduce the death penalty for Hamas militants in prisons here or that were that are um held captive here and that is something that the families or many of the families of the hostages say is counterproductive to getting their loved ones out of Gaza alive they think it will anger Hamas that it will give them impetus to perhaps uh do harm to their family members in Gaza so we saw a very heated uh exchange very emotional very passionate pleas from the families to these members who are championing this bill now I'll I'll also say that the bill doesn't have consensus in the Coalition it doesn't have uh huge a huge support so it may not go through but the families uh think that even just talking about it is going to jeopardize the the situation inside Gaza for their family members uh so we saw you as I said very heated exchanges and even the the members of UDA the members of that far far right party calling the the families of the hostages saying that they are actually doing hamas's work for them so some very personal exchanges happening their families very worried that the government just isn't doing enough or isn't taking the right action to ensure that their their family members are freed thews Rebecca R is there reporting from Jerusalem thank you Rebecca nearly 30 premature babies evacuated from gaza's alifa hospital have arrived in Egypt for urgent medical care Medics brought the babies into Egypt via the Rafa border crossing that's the only way out of Gaza that Israel does not control an urgent evacuation premature babies bundled into ambulances to get them out of Gaza the World Health Organization says all of them are fighting serious infections the babies had been trapped at gaza's largest hospital for days several others died after incubators at alifa stopped working amid power outages United Nations teams helped coordinate the evacuation working with Israeli soldiers to get the tiny patients out of the hospital which Israel claims is home to a Hamas Command Center the babies were brought South some reunited with their mothers I have twin daughters I did not know about their condition today I saw them for the first time since I gave birth to them thank God I was reassured that they were fine I was always communicating with sha and they told me you can come and take them because their health has improved but I could not reach them waiting ambulances then whisked them across the rougher Crossing to Egypt taking parents where possible they are innocent children premature babies toddlers I left my three children in Gaza I didn't even get a chance to hug them because I couldn't leave my daughter in this state something might happen happened to them they could be bombed my message to the world is enough these are innocent children we are just protecting our country our country Palestine the children's agency UNICEF says it's working with Egyptian authorities to find out the circumstances of each evacuated baby including those whose relatives are not with them doctors say they have a long road to recovery ahead with many of them critically ill let's bring in Toby frier he speaks for the United Nations International children's emergency fund uh UNICEF he joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman now uh first of all how are the babies and where are they currently yeah so the babies are currently in a stable condition um they're getting the care thankfully that they urgently needed and we have the most of the babies are now in Egypt uh getting more Specialized Care uh as we know the hospitals inside the Gaza Strip are massively overwhelmed alifa hospital was could not look after the babies anymore could not look after anyone it's particularly uh almost non completely non-operational and that's why the health authorities called on UNICEF un uh and others to to help that evacuation now there were also a report that some other babies died in alifa what do you know about that yeah that's right our understanding is that reportedly initially there were uh 39 premature babies that needed Urgent Care uh sadly by the time the operation happened and that we were able to coordinate and get to the hospital there were 31 babies two had had died within 24 hours tragically um which goes to show why the operation was so urgent and it's not even we hope those 31 of course that we can save their lives it's tragic that we couldn't get there earlier um and it's tragic that the hospital has become this sort of centerpiece almost of of of the conflict um and and it's not just alifer it's other hospitals as well but right now they're getting the best care they can you know thanks to multiple partners thanks to to the Egyptian authorities as well now gaza's Indonesian hospital it's the last one still operating in the north of the strip what are you hearing from your colleagues on the ground there yeah that's right so we heard um um you know horrifically that yesterday according to the World Health Organization as well there was reports of this uh you know attack in theal hospital that hit the hospital um the conditions even before have been deteriorating day by day at that hospital as well um so the northern part of the Gaza Strip the Health Care system is is all but ended um which is why it's a massive concern we have two out of three hospitals across the Gaza Strip not operating due to damage or lack of fuel and we have children in densely packed shelters who are increasingly at risk of potential disease outbreaks particularly as as winter comes and the Health Care system is is not there to to support them or treat them if they need urgent care now the World Health Organization has warned about the threat of disease spreading in Gaza what efforts are underway to uh uh counter that that's right so we have 1.7 million people displaced inside Gaza Strip around half those around 800,000 are children and they're living many are living in un schools in hospital grounds in public facilities uh densely packed together you know families in classrooms the conditions are horrific you have very little access to Safe Water about 3 lers per person per day the emergency threshold that we try to reach is 15 liters uh you have sanitary conditions which are getting worse one toilet for hundreds of people and of course now with rains you have the risk of waterbor diseases you have children who have missed routine childhood immunizations who are now more at risk of preventable but deadly diseases so this is a this is a huge that's why it's absolutely urgent that we can try and improve those conditions in those shelters particularly but also elsewhere to reduce the risk of any Mass disease outbreak thank you very much Toby frer there from UNICEF Germany's foreign minister analina Bok has said a ceasefire in the Middle East would prevent Israel from defending itself speaking to DW Bok defended Germany's refusal to back a ceasefire in Gaza instead Berlin says it backs humanitarian pauses that would allow for Aid to get into Gaza she also hit out at criticism of Germany's support for Israel calling it extremely disturbing Germany's foreign minister has a message for the Arab world taking a break from International diplomacy an Elena bebok joined DW's Arabic show Jaffer talk for an in-depth interview on the war in the Middle East first on the agenda why Germany has so far refused to back a ceasefire in Gaza that would mean Israel would no longer be able to defend itself amid the ongoing barrage of missiles every day Hamas makes clear that it wants to wipe Israel off the map that means they want to annihilate Israel and in such a situation Israel has to protect its population at the same time I am we are working with our International partners with the Americans but also with many Arab countries to do everything possible to ensure the people in Gaza have safe places where they won't be killed where they can access clean drinking water and medication in visits over the past month German officials have repeatedly emphasized their support for Israel saying German history means it has a unique responsibility to the country but critics in the Arab world say Germany's guilt means it's afraid to call out potential war crimes I very irritated by those people because to me it sounds like the complete relativization of genocide the worst crime this world has ever seen my country the Nazi regime in Germany is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jewish men and women the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Europeans in Europe we have committed ourselves as an International Community and that's what international law is built on that's the lesson we learned from the horrors of World War II turning to the future of the conflict bebok said it was likely that a peacekeeping presence of sorts would be needed to protect civilians in the long term but she would not be drawn on where those troops would come from in order to ensure security we need International responsibility we've learned this from the terrible Wars in Europe's Western Balkans there too the International Community assumed a responsibility to protect it was also situation where the worst crimes had been committed and actors in the region had simply lost all trust I see the same thing there the question now is which countries can command the trust of both the Palestinian and Israeli people now DW political correspondent Matthew Moore joins me uh Matthew Germany has been criticized for not supporting a ceasefire how did the foreign minister justify this position that's right Gad put simply analina bearok says Hamas cannot be trusted to hold up its end of a ceasefire at one point she threw up her hands and said it's not simply a case of politicians saying stop this so instead Germany is working on humanitarian pauses that allow for Aid to reach those people in Gaza who are desperately in need and also for hostages to be released this could be she said hours or even days and I was struck though throughout the interview she repeatedly sought to express her Sympathy for the innocent victims on both sides of this conflict she said the suffering of Palestinians kept her awake at night as much as the plight of Israeli mothers whose children were taken or kidnapped by terrorists on October 7th but the bottom line Gard is Germany calling for pauses rather than a fol ceas fire now Bach has also responded in that interview to criticism from the Middle East that Germany is turning a blind eye to the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza because of Germany's responsibility towards Israel after the Holocaust what did you make of her reaction there well this is a criticism that we've heard over and over in the past month last week the Turkish president Reb T Eran was in town in Berlin and he said because of the Holocaust Germany was really not able not free to tell the truth implying that Germany is ignoring human rights abuses bearok pushed back really hard against this throughout the interview and this was where she became most animated and most impct passioned saying that criticizing Germany for its past is relativizing the crimes of the Holocaust and she said she was extremely disturbed by the accusation accusation she said for her there was no contradiction between standing up for Israel's right to exist and defending human rights now why did the German foreign minister do this interview now yeah jaffar talk is a show that has real clout in the Arab region and on social media so this was clearly an attempt to engage with the arabic speaking audiences and to explain Germany's position on this conflict I have to say this was the first time I think I've seen dur since this conflict has reignited where I've seen a senior German politician scrutinized in this way this was a 36 minute interview the full version of which you can watch online but normally interviews like this might last 10 to 15 minutes at most and bearok knew that this would be a challenging interview and there was really no attempt to backd if anything she was defiant setting out Germany's position on a ceasefire on the lessons of the Holocaust but also stressing that she is equally concerned about the suffering of Palestinians as well as Israelis in the region our political correspondent Matthew more there thank you very much
