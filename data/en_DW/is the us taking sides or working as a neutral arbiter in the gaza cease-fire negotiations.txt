in the Middle East US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is keeping up his push for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas but serious obstacles remain on Tuesday blinkin held talks in Egypt on the proposed truce before traveling to Qatar both countries along with the US are acting as mediators on Monday blinkin told journalists in Tel Aviv that Israel had accepted what he called a bridging proposal designed to address the differences between the two sides but Hamas the militant group that committed the October 7th Terror attacks says that proposal goes against what it had previously agreed to bringing Laura Blumenfeld she's a bestselling author and Middle East Analyst at John's Hopkins University Laura welcome back to the day now you served in the US state department as senior policy adviser for the peace process in the Middle East what would be your advice for Anthony blinkin today as he's in the region trying to broker a ceasefire deal well I would say there are the ceasefire 3ts from success um number one timing number two trust and number three tough an ability to get tough um first of all with the timing I mean I was I happened to be in Secretary Ker's office uh in 2014 uh during during a Gaza War when the Israeli tanks just rolled over the border into Gaza and his first instinct secretary Kerry was let's go for a ceasefire um the truth was then and perhaps now is that neither side was ready for that and as much as we pushed and TR red Not only was Israel not want ready to lay down their arms but Egypt as well that was helping broker in 2014 you know felt like that there needed to be a little bit more of fighting before we could reach that ceasefire so number one timing um the second thing is trust uh secretary Kissinger uh said one time that trust is the currency of diplomacy there's very little trust right now um we're seeing actually a degradation of that unfortunately we're going in the wrong directions uh Hamas today said that they are you know increasingly suspicious of the United States that America is siding too much on the Israeli side so unfortunately that's that's not looking good the third thing is tough an ability to sort of get tough um depending on you know which party is the recalcitrant one um mateline alright a former secretary of state was very good about being tough in terms of keeping the negotiations quiet and private I think one of the problems we're seeing today is it's all being played out in public and with all the leaks in the media um that makes it very very hard for the negotiators and the parties to make concessions and save face secretary Albright used to say to the Press when they would ask her about negotiations with Syria and Israel she would say mushrooms and what she meant by mushrooms was that negotiations especially when it comes to treaties are just like mushrooms they do better in the dark it it's from what we know and and from what you're saying it seems like we know a lot of what is being talked about there it does seem like like it's one step forward and one back when Israel is on board Hamas is not and vice versa is that really so or is there progress being made that maybe isn't being conveyed as such well there is progress the problem is those last few percentages or yards if you want to use the football analogy that the Americans have been using are always the hardest right that's always those final details sometimes are the stickiest and they can actually stick so hard that it blows up a deal again that happened to us in 2014 um we hit a kind of detail about a prisoner release actually and the sides couldn't agree on it and that then we were you know the whole thing unraveled and few months later we there was a war um I I think right now what we're seeing is a kind of diplomatic holding pattern you know we're circling uh are we going to run out of fuel Hamas is accusing the Americans of of playing for time um and then the question is can we land the deal before the really big uh problem comes about which is uh Iran and Hezbollah are poised to retaliate against Israel which hopefully in the bestc scenario will motivate the sides and mo to compromise rather than lead to a you know Regional configration which is our number one priority from the beginning of this uh you know terrible 10 months for the United States number one priority has been avoiding Regional escalation yeah and I'm glad you mention Iran because there's a lot to unpack here ceasefire was build by many as a way of keeping Teran at Bay when it comes to avenging the killing of Hamas political chief on its soil but an Iranian foreign minister a foreign Ministry spokesman gave an interesting statement in that regard let's quickly listen in and then get back to you the issue of the Gaza ceasefire has nothing to do with Iran's legitimate and legal right to punish the aggressor and it will not relate directly to it we are not looking for intensification of insecurity in the region we support efforts with good intentions regarding the ceasefire Laura what do you make of that statement well I think it's important for Iran to put that statement forward because the West is telling them to stand down but they still have the need to save face Iran is playing a long game here um they're absolutely right when they say one thing isn't connect to the other I mean there's a clock in Palestine Square in tahon which is ticking down backward it's a Doomsday Clock for Israel that by 2040 Iran will eliminate the state the state of Israel so you have to understand in the larger context of what their goals are it's also important to understand the weapons that the United States has poised whether it's at Iran's proxies or whether it's at you know the regime itself whether it's the supreme leader is the gun pointed at his head or is that is that their proxies I think that could make a big difference if they understood whether the American Firepower that they're rushing to the region whether it's the battleships or the fighter jets is that aimed at Iran what is the US Iran policy here I think that there's been a lot of discussion of that is it tough enough um is it too tough you know we're we're we're in the middle of a presidential race so it's kind of a hard time to start debating foreign policy and acting on it but I think that really goes to the core of the issue here you know where is the United States with Iran and that's what Netanyahu was arguing for when he spoke in front of Congress several weeks ago he said to the American people and Congress our fight is your fight the question is is it really yeah um I want to pick up on something that Anthony blinkin said when he arrived in Israel on Monday he said this was the best and perhaps the last chance to get a deal over the line what happens if that doesn't happen well I think it was very interesting and thank you for quoting that because he was hedging right he said maybe the best and perhaps the last um Israel's uh prime minister Yak Shamir said years ago never give yourself an ultimatum because you box yourself in right Americans are always the optimists um and so there's there will be another time and another time the reason why this is very different though again is because nothing quite focuses the mind like a gun to your head and Israel truly does have a gun to its head right now um you know with this potential twin assassinations um that they that they conducted in the past few weeks with the potential retaliation for that both coming from the north and from the east from Iran so it is a little bit different the stakes are much higher and and sometimes when the stakes are so high you know you can say it's too big to fail this diplomacy watch the skies is what I would say look the the lights are going down the Sun is setting over the Middle East now watch the skies not only for whether there'll be rockets and increased uh you know drone strikes but also for the aircraft I mean for the first time since October fly Dubai the Emirates Airline is grounding their aircraft at night that does give me some concern that's Laura Blumenfeld author and Middle East analyst thank you so much for all those fascinating insights it's always great speaking to you
