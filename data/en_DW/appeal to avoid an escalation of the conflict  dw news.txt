now the blast in Iran happened while foreign ministers from the G7 Nations wrapped up talks on the Italian island of Capri the seven leading industrial democracies warned of new sanctions against Iran for its drone and missile attack on Israel last weekend they called on both sides to avoid an escalation of the conflict now during this Summit Germany's foreign minister analina Bok criticized Iran for its attack on Israel against the backdrop of reports about uh the attacks on the 19th of April we call upon all parties to work to ensure that there is no further escalation as the G7 that is exactly what we're doing these days in Berlin this morning the government's crisis unit met under the guidance and Leadership of the foreign office the federal government continues to watch the situation on the ground it's a fact that last weekend Iran in an unprecedented manner escalated the situation and tried to take to the brink of CHA a region at large uh colleague the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says measures will be taken against Iran you saw as well or you'll see soon in the G7 statement a commitment to hold Iran to account uh to account for its destabilizing activities uh holding it to account by uh degrading its missile and drone capabilities uh and yesterday the United States announced additional sanctions on Iran targeting UAV programs the steel industry companies that are associated with the irgc the ministry of defense and its Armed Forces Logistics the G7 statement makes clear that G7 countries will adopt additional sanctions or other measures in the days ahead thew Chief International editor Richard Walker gave us his assessment of the G7 statements there's been a a pretty kind of Cy and very cautious uh response uh from Western leaders from the G7 uh echoing that today so so you know using the kind of language we just heard from analina bbok in the clip there the wording that she used was something along the lines of inlight of reports of strikes on April 19th so today's date we we urge all parties to work to prevent further escalation that's almost exactly lifted out of the G7 uh foreign ministers communic that that was issued today so they're really kind of sticking to a script I think there um and I think it it it points to really two priorities that they have first of all um is that priority of trying to ensure that there is no further escalation they really don't want this to spin out of uh control so they don't want to say anything that could heat up the situation further um and then uh as a second point a priority is reassurance to Israel um that they've got Israel's back diplomatically that it's not up to Israel really to try to resolve this entirely militarily that for instance as we just heard from Tony blinkin the US Secretary of State there that more sanctions are on the way either already from the US in the UK or potentially down the road from um other G7 member states so trying to kind of reassure Israel enough that Israel doesn't feel that it's got it completely in its hands to respond to to Iran's very large um attack which happened so recently so so I think the Hope among the G7 foreign ministers among the Western Community as a whole but of course also in the Middle East and really everywhere is that you know escalation can be avoided that that that this may even be uh the end of this particular exchange between Israel and Iran now let's uh take a look at the wider region how did the neighboring nations react yeah so what I think I would be interested to look at Jordan um as a really interesting player here because um Jordan uh as we saw when Iran launched those 300 plus missiles and drones towards Israel um Jordan was alongside the United States and other Western countries was one of the countries that helped Israel uh to shoot those down um shooting down um uh uh uh such projectiles that were going over its territory so so a really strong um you know really concrete Act of support there from the jordanians to the Israelis um and the Jordanian foreign minister today was saying that Israeli Iranian it retaliations must end and that the inhumane war on Gaza must end now so trying I think like we just heard from Christian hellberg trying to get the focus back uh to the situation in Gaza saying that is the priority for for for Israel's Arab neighbors and that it wants this um not to spiral into an escalation between um Iran and Israel and I I think Jordan's position here has particular weight not just towards Iran which will be seeing okay this is one of Israel's neighbors really helping it against us but also its words have weight towards Israel for towards the Israelis thinking well the Israelis don't want to put a a country that has just shown such solidarity with it stuck its neck out for Israel um not to put it then in the more difficult situation uh by moving to an escalatory response so that could have been one of the factors that contributed to and if this is the case that this really was the limit of the Israeli response that we're going to see this pretty small response by Israel to that large attack uh from Iran um Jordan's position could be one of the factors that it's considering the's Chief International editor Richard Walker there thank you very much Richard
