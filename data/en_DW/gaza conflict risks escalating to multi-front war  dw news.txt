as well as ongoing fighting with Hamas Israel has faced an outbreak of violence on its northern border with Lebanon since Sunday the iran-backed Hezbollah group has fired both Precision missiles and Rockets at Israeli military positions in towns Israel responded with a barrage of artillery fire on Southern Lebanese towns Hezbollah said three of its Fighters have been killed a Shiite political party and militant group Hezbollah have long been a sworn enemy of Israel's but where did they come from and what do they want and how powerful are they now it was in the chaos of Lebanon Civil War in the 1980s that Hezbollah emerged as a shadow faction funded by Iran the group vowed to drive Israeli forces out of Lebanon and carried out bombings on Western powers like the US and France after the Civil Civil War lebanon's militias were disbanded except for one Hezbollah Hezbollah is basically a political party with a military wing it is by far the most influential party in Lebanon with significant support among the public the party says it originated to fight the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon in the 1980s but has since said its aim is to counter what it calls Western predomination and expansionism the party remained committed to the destruction of Israel Western intelligence say the group carried out bombings on Israeli Targets in Argentina and Britain in the early 90s killing and injuring scores in 2006 the group sparked the second Lebanon war after they abducted two Israeli soldiers in a crossborder raid and killed three others 1,00 Lebanese mostly civilians and 158 Israelis mostly soldiers were killed at home Hezbollah only grew in stature Hezbollah has dominated the Lebanese political scene for the past two decades its leader says it has a fighting force of some 100,000 men and tens of thousands of rockets at its disposal the group's biggest backer is Iran who according to the US gives it 700 million a year to fund its operations money it used to send several thousand and fighters to Syria in 2013 to support Bashar al-assad's regime underlining the groups increasingly powerful and divisive role in the Middle East as well as support from Iran the group is a member of the so-called resistance axis along with huis in Yemen the popular mobilization in Iraq Hamas and the Islamic Jihad in the Palestinian territory and the Syrian regime but Germany the US and others have designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization now again Israeli forces in the north are on edge as Hezbollah appears poised to step up its attacks all right hanen Hadar is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute where she focuses on Shia politics throughout the Middle East it's good to have you with us this evening I want to just ask you about Hezbollah and Israel we know that they have traded rocket attacks this week Hezbollah Fighters have been killed that said How likely do you think it is that we're going to see this conflict turn into a two-front war if you will one with Gaza and one with Lebanon Hezbollah in the north yes that's mainly the question that's on everybody's uh mind today is that this so far has been a very calculated uh engagement between Hezbollah and Israel on both sides actually Hezbollah wants to still keep playing within you know like the rules of the of the conflict that has been set after 2006 War there haven't been really any serious um uh break in that U the rule of the conflict the the engagement of hasb clashes of that hasah has been engaged in with Israel along the border has still never been uh beyond the you know attacking the North Military posts Etc but they they are trying they are trying to say that we are part of this war they want to reap the benefits of this war like Iran obviously they want to uh maintain the gains of this war with the plausible deniability where they can say we are not really your target so what they want today is like basically this is this is an Iranian strategy of deniable uh uh plausible deniability in this specific War where has playing a very risky game because this might change any moment um to make sure that Iran Keeps The Edge that that the the Iran it's its proxies maintain the edge that they have uh gained in this war so far which is freezing the Saudi Iran deal responding to Israel exposing Israel's weaknesses and obviously Shifting the Arab Street uh away from normalization and away from Western open us back to the Iranian Edge and Iran's resistance narrative uh gaining the popular support that they needed so this this is a main this is a big win for Iran if you want until now but it's also a very risky game where hasah today if they do not get involved and maintain this calculated engagement with Israel they will be able to uh maintain these gains uh shift The Edge to their advantage and at the same time Iran and hollah will still be able to hold this very strong pressure card which is hezbollah's precision missiles and weapons in Lebanon as as a strong card without actually using it honey let me just ask you if I understand what you're saying then um hasah is cognizant of the fact they have to do something they have to be some type of distraction um for the isra military if not um you know their benefactor Iran is going to look at them and ask well what what good are you what use are you really for our plans is is that what you're saying I'm I'm saying that there's a coordination very close coordination here between Hezbollah and Iran Hezbollah will not be involved in this war unless Iran asks them to this is this is a decision that is made in tahran this is not a decision that is made in Beirut or hasah stronghold in Beirut this is a very coordinated decision about Iran's interest interests in the region and Hezbollah will or will not be used depending on these interests in the region Hezbollah today internally does they do not want to lose their Lebanese Lebanese uh interest their Lebanese decision uh they don't want to expose their own uh um infrastructure in Lebanon because it would be very cost to costly to reconstruct that they do not really have the budget for war or the budget for the Reconstruction um it's going to be very devastating for them but at the end of the day if this becomes the war with the capital W where Iran realizes that this is the war that's going to shift everything to its own Advantage hasah cannot say no to Iran on these big decisions H it's it's they can decide within the Lebanese domestic politics but not on these Regional war and I want to say that if they go for it it's not only going to be two war two fronts it's going to be the the Palestinian front the Lebanese front the Golan front which already has has been heated recently and I wouldn't be surprised if also the huis in Yemen uh were asked to launch missiles into Israel as well so this will be a multi-front war what about the the Lebanese people I mean they are already dealing with suffering one of the biggest economic most severe economic downturns that the the world has seen in the last 200 years is there any any any type of broad support in Lebanon for has people you know attracting the the wrath of Israel no I think I think the Lebanese most of the Lebanese that say because there's always some Lebanese who are going to support hasah and Iran and Hamas no matter what but I would say the majority of the Lebanese can make the distinction here between there is a support of or you know I would say sympathy to the Palestinian peoples that are falling vict victims of of this war right which is the Hamas Israel war uh there's a lot of Sympathy for the Palestinian people in Gaza there is very little sympathy for Hamas but there is some uh support for Hamas by certain groups within the uh Palestinian camps and and the Hezbollah Community but not all of them but I would say there is no appetite for war from anyone everybody wants to support the Palestinians or even Hamas at one point from a distance but they do not want to be part of this war because Lebanon has been through so many Wars and we have always realized that at the end of the day it's the Lebanese and the Palestinians who pay the price for war the only H H where only the Iranians and its proxies in the region win okay everybody in Lebanon understand this now this is there's zero appetite for war no one wants it and hasah knows it hanen Hadar from the Washington Institute we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you thank you for having me
