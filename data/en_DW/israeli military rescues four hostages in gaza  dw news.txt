the Israeli military has rescued four Israeli hostages alive from Gaza one woman and three men were freed amid heavy air strikes from two different locations in central Gaza Noah aramani seen here is among the four she and the others are set to be in stable condition they've all been taken to hospitals in Israel for further medical examinations Hamas kidnapped all of them from the Nova Music Festival during its terror attack on October 7th a short time ago an Israeli Army spokesman had this to say about the rescue operation this morning at 11:00 a.m. Israeli Special Forces conducted complex hostage Rescue Mission and successfully rescued four of our hostages from Kamas captivity in Gaza no gamani almog Mayan schom and Andre kov they are back home in Israel they are alive they are well they will under they will undergo medical examination and will soon be re reunited with their families in the hospital we're joined Now by our correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya Kramer Tanya good to see you I imagine it's an incredibly emotional day for Israelis and especially for the families of the rescued hostages how is this news being received within the country well I think you're right I mean this is an incredible uh emotional day there's a lot of Joy um uh and also you know you have to understand Israel has been in agony over uh the hostages uh that are remaining uh in Gaza and of course uh this rescue operation uh carried out and in broad daylight in new sad that is in central Gaza now we are hearing from the military spokesperson there earlier he gave some more details that this was in preparation for weeks as he has said uh with many uh uh different units uh involved uh those uh four hostages were uh kept in two different locations they were extracted from there and then flown by a helicopter to uh the hospital in uh uh to the Sheba Hospital in uh Tel aiv where they are now and we're seeing here of course in the past hours images from that hospital in um um on on the Israeli channels um we've seen also Noah aamani there she was talking uh on the phone to prime minister Benjamin and Netanyahu now we understand that they are all in reasonably good health they are undergoing of course more checks they have been reunited uh with uh their families but it's certainly a very very important day here because this week had started on Monday actually with the announcement by the Israeli military that four more hostages uh were uh presumed Dead uh in Gaza and now uh a couple of days later finally uh some good news for the family members and the relatives uh of those four hostages uh that they uh were rescued now after almost 9 months in captivity well indeed I imagine that Israelis have been hungry for some sort of good news to date just three other hostages have been rescued in more than 8 months of Israel's military operations in Gaza Tanya do you think today's rescue will somehow boost public support for the war and possibly even for prime minister Netanyahu himself well it might give him some respire from all the international and all the domestic pressure he has been under especially the past couple of days because there is an agreement for a ceasefire that also includes the release of hostages on the table and both sides Hamas and Israel have so far not really uh agreed uh to this uh latest proposal and he has been under a lot of pressure because publicly I mean a majority you could say of the Israeli public wants to see uh uh that those that this agreement is being done uh but uh prime minister Benyamin netan is also under pressure from his own cabinet and he himself has kept on saying that only maximum pressure will bring the results so this is kind of you know supporting him in his military strategy uh to say uh there will be no end uh to this war but we also uh have heard from uh the uh from Benny guns a former Defense Minister who's a member of the war cabinet he was actually uh supposedly giving a conference tonight and was expected that he might actually quit uh the uh War cabinet that press conference has now been uh postponed so you could say maybe this pressure will at least uh for the time being be a bit less but still there 120 hostages still being held in Gaza and these rescue missions have been very rare so I think you know the reading here in Israel is at least that there needs to be some kind of agreement to bring all these hostages back home well meanwhile Hamas Health authorities say a large number of people were killed uh amid these heavy air strikes to rescue the hostages I mean the area where this operation took place in Central Gaza is the site of a refugee camp Tanya what do we know about the situation there well absolutely uh when those news broke I mean uh first that um you know the Israeli Army I said they carrying out intensive uh strikes air strikes and an intensive uh operation in nerat refugee camp now this is in central Gaza this is also an area where a lot of Palestinians that had fled or had been ordered to go south by the military had now gone back because of the offensive uh taking place in rafar it's a very crowded area and after nine months of War we all know the situation in Gaza is extremely difficult for civilians now we're hearing that there were reports of many injured and killed being taken into the hospital one of the few hospitals that's actually still somehow working in d balar which is south of narat and the Ministry of Health there said that at least 55 people were killed it doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians but there's also a lot of footage out on social media of the devastating footage I have to say about the aftermath uh of uh that strike that it's showing that our hospitals there are struggling with the influx of injured and of course these are very contrasting pictures that we are seeing that coming out of Gaza with those devastating scenes uh once again and of course uh the joy and um you know the the development this this positive development uh bringing those four hostages home uh that we're seeing uh in Israel DW's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem for us Tanya we appreciate your reporting thank you so much
