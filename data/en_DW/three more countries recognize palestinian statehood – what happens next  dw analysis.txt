Ireland Norway and Spain have announced that they will recognize Palestinian statehood Israel has long opposed such International recognition for the Palestinian territories and the move will increase the Diplomatic isolation generated by its military offensive in Gaza Israeli reaction was Swift and Furious prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is completely opposed to an independent Palestinian State and said the announcement amounted to a reward for Terror that would threaten his country's security 139 of the un's 193 members already recognize as Palestinian statehood but today's announcement carries weight because most Western European countries have held back from establishing diplomatic relations with an independent Palestine barred off from Israel by fences and barriers the Palestinian territories will be formally recognized as a state by three more European countries Spain Ireland and Norway choosing to support the Palestinian push for sovereignty a step they say towards [Applause] peace the time has come to move from words to action to tell the millions of innocent suffering Palestinians that we are with them that there is hope and to make it very clear that no matter how many walls are erected no matter how many villages are bombed and no matter how many illegal settlements are built the land and the identity of Palestine will continue to exist in our hearts in international legality and in the future project of a Mediterranean in harmony previously 139 of 193 un countries recognized the state of Palestine latest signatories calling on others to do the same in the midst of war with tens of thousands of dead and injured we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Ians two states that can live in peace with each other Israel and Palestine Germany's foreign minister rejected unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood I have repeatedly made it clear that a solution to this terrible situation that we are currently experiencing does not require symbolic recognition but a political solution a solution to the Middle East conflict and a two-state solution requires direct negotiations on both sides Israel's government also hit back regarding a Palestinian State there are people who support this opinion and there are people who do not but this is not the place nor the time now to come and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian State and any such decision harms Israeli sovereignty and Israeli security and we will not allow it I order to recall our ambassadors back home and we will take all measures to prevent that President Mahmud abas the leader of the Palestinian Authority welcomed the recognition and called on other nations to quote support the struggle of our people for Liberation and Independence Daniel Levy is president of the US midle project that's a nonprofit organization that focuses on the Israel Palestinian conflict and aims to to promote peace he was part of the Israeli team of negotiators that took part in the Oslo Peace Accords process in the 1990s and advised a former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak welcome to DW can we start with your reaction to this announcement one I guess primarily wonders what's taken so long for countries that are committed to two states and why are these countries relatively isolated among the European States who are yet to recognize Palestine and then one wonders what next because the act of recognition as long as it remains just that is rather symbolic the state that they have recognized is under an occupation in which there are daily violations of international law so will these and indeed the states that have not recognized Palestine begin to hold Israel accountable for those violations and if not why should we expect anything to improve anything to change and for there to be still a prospect of the two-state outcome which even those who have not recognized such as the German foreign minister uh have said that they endorse and so I think that becomes the question so when I when I spoke to the the Norwegian foreign minister uh earlier today put some of those points to him and one of the things that that that he said uh was that well this adds to the pressure on Israel recognizing that this is somewhat symbolic until the United States shifts its position well I think he's correct that it adds to a sense of isolation is too strong a word but of Israel losing uh some of the support of even his friends the Israeli reaction has been uh somewhat hysterical but I think that's partly performative as a way of hoping that one can intimidate and pressure these countries not from doing more and other countries not from following suit yes I think the Norwegian foreign minister and others are correct to suggest that where the the real heavy leverage resides is with Washington DC but and it's an important but to say well you know the only people who can do anything are the Americans is an abdication of responsibility that's not the approach that one takes on Ukraine or elsewhere where America is going to have a disproportionate influence so I think it is up to every state to ask itself is Israel making conditions impossible for Palestinian statehood is Israel and this was the response by the way of an Israeli Minister foreign minister until recently he said between the river and the Sea and by the way I'm quoting him for batim because I know people sometimes get upset about that expression but it's one the Israelis use from the River to the Sea there is only one state and that is Israel so he is basically saying we have a parthe Palestinians will never have their rights and what is the reaction of those who've recognized and those who haven't recognized to what Israel is doing I would argue that it's not just up to America Israel needs to be held accountable needs to be sanctioned for its actions by a cross-section of countries who claim to uphold international law because number one that is what will have Israelis not saying oh thank you you know now we'll give the Palestinians what they want but it will have Israelis saying is there a cost for this right what is the equation here what's the incentive structure and it of course also creates a different environment in which the Americans operating okay we'll just we'll just pick up on on one of the points you made there when you talk about um uh a par a a term that of course has been contested in the in the Israeli context but I did want to ask you uh about one of the the uh reactions that I think you've you've called us hysterical we have Benjamin Netanyahu describing the announcement as a reward for terrorism it's easy to see what he means don't you think Hamas launches a a terror attack on Israel Israel retaliates and then these European countries from the safety of thousands of miles away choose to recognize Palestinian statehood well I think that what you've seen in the Israeli reaction and of course history didn't begin on October 7th October 7th was a shocking uh violation of international law what Israel does every day prior to that were violations of international law what Israel has done subsequently has led also to arrest warrants being recommended by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court and to provisional measures being called for for the prevention of irreparable harm to Palestinians by the international court of justice considering a genocide case so this does not come in a vacuum now have those countries withdrawn their recognition of Israel as a consequence of its violations of international law no are they therefore rewarding terrorism by going forward with this recognition also no by the way Phil I would prefer that they had recognized and others had recognized long ago and had taken other measures I cannot not prove the counterfactual but I think that had Israel not been indulged and allowed to get away with this for so long it would not have had the hubris to create a situation which doesn't justify October 7th but made it more likely and you wouldn't have the kind of extremists in the Israeli government okay who have been out to provoke from day one and so the longer we wait to take these measures the more likely we are to see more violence and that's why nonviolent measures like this like sanctions are what Palestinians and Israelis need let's talk about the the um the state of Palestine uh so to speak other 139 countries that currently recognize uh Palestine uh plus of course today's three are they all recogniz recognizing the same lines on the map a viewers are now looking at a at a map of the region based on pre-1967 at demarcations are we all talking about the same thing it's such an important question Phil and I'm very I'm very glad that you asked because even the exact wording of the statements coming out of the three uh slightly varied so I think that what one needs to recognize if one's going to recognize two states is either the 1967 lines or indeed the UN partition plan of 1947 I think most are leaning into the 1967 lines that's the map that you shared with us but the Norwegians for instance excuse me the Norwegians for instance kept open the option of land swaps in the context of negotiations right and this comes to the the issue of do we know what we're recognizing and what are we doing subsequent to the recognition the reality today is there is one political space one state in which there are unequal rights to undo that really requires ending the occupation it shouldn't require too much negotiation well nor Minister of Foreign Affairs is Espen Bart AA and he joins us now from Oslo welcome to DW what do you hope this move will achieve well this is a statement from uh three European countries uh very clearly saying that this is the right thing to do but also the right moment the right time uh because we want to contribute to reestablishing a credible faith in and a credible path towards two-state solution and a Palestinian State living in peace beside Israel which has been the dream since the original Oso cords but what we also realized is just sitting idly by waiting for the sides to negotiate this at the time of their own making forever has not worked for 30 years and we need to uh strengthen the position of the Palestinian side but still trying to seek a two-state solution where both peoples can live in peace and we do that together today we hope other European countries will follow and we also do this as a support to the Arab peace vision for a comprehensive solution to the Middle East crisis okay so just I'm I'm clear you you've done this because you think it's the right thing to do and in terms of practical achievements you hope to strengthen the Palestinian uh position and provide um support for for Arab countries and what will you recognize is on May the 28th I think it is borders on a map a political entity what what what will you actually do well remember there there are institutions in place there is a state of Palestine as it's called which is the Palestine Authority based in rala and the West Bank which has uh uh some control over the territory in West Bank and in East Jerusalem unfortunately not so much in Gaza not only because of the war but because Hamas took over control there but there is a Palestinian entity that has a a position also in the UN not as a full member but but as a non-state Observer and this is the entity that we recognize that again is based on the promise of PLO the Palestine Liberation Organization back in the 90s to give up the armed struggle to continue only through peaceful means and and that's a promise that they've actually held and they have systematically these more moderate Palestinian in their Palestinian Administration have been uh true to that premise theyve even collaborated extensively with Israel on security issues in the West Bank but their capacity have been weakened by an Ever growing amount of illegal Israeli settlements for instance and it been really hard to run uh that Proto State and we want to lift their Authority but also to lift their capacity and how much was this decision influenced by Israel current war against Hamas this is a reaction to not only the current war against Hamas but to the situation that we have seen over years I mean we've seen the expansion of settlements we've seen very limited progress or no progress in cooperation towards the settlement we've seen the terror attacks from an extreme group Hamas on Israel we have seen the extreme the very violent response from Israel into Gaza we see the settler violence in the West Bank this is a violence spiral which will continue if we do not break this cycle so we want to break out of this cycle of Eternal violence and reestablish faith in in an alternative which is a peaceful settlement uh with where a Palestinian state is recognized as part of a broader comprehensive plan and we think the time is now and we think that everything is happened is inspired by exactly that so how celebrated your move today Israel recalled its Envoy from Oslo in protest so and the for we have the foreign minister today saying that Ireland and no way intend to send a message today to the Palestinians and the whole world terrorism pays he also said this recognition would impede efforts to return Israel's hostages being held in Gaza and make a ceasefire less likely because you've rewarded the jihadists of Hamas I'd like your your your uh response to those points please well I I I totally and completely disagree with those statements we are doing exactly the opposite we are recognizing the the moderate forces the the pl the Palestinian Authority the people who have renounced violence who and who are the enemies of Hamas this is absolutely an anti- Hamas move it was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority by key Palestinian leaders by key Arab states precisely as a recognition that there are still moderate forces who are willing to look for a peaceful settlement this is not what Hamas wants because they want to their fight is against the existence of the state of Israel the Palestine we recognize is a Palestine that recognizes formally and in practice the existence of Israel and wants to live in peace and cooperate with Israel so this is exactly the opposite of what the Israel for success and I think this will move forward to a situation where at the end of the day it will be better to be both an Israeli and a Palestinian because this endless cycle of violence is broken Israel's foreign minister also said today that your country's Ambassador will be summoned for reprimand talks during which they'll be shown a video of the Abduction of female Israeli soldiers on October the 7th what will your instruction to your Ambassador be you know we have they have said a lot of things about our ambassador they recall their own ambassador we have no intention of doing anything of that sort so of course when he is asked to come to the ministry he will politely come and he will see what they want to show them and I don't think he needs to learn more about the horrible terrorist attacks of 7th of October we have seen these images which are terrible just as we are seeing all the horror that is being uh uh experienced by the civilian population of of of Gaza there is too much violence and some of that violence happened on the 7th of October and was AB absolutely uh reprehensible so I I think that that response he will be there um I will also tell the very nice person who is the U Israeli ambassador to Oso who is actually the Ambassador I have met most frequently as for Minister that when he comes back from his stay in uh in Israel uh he will be invited to a nice cup of coffee in my office and we'll talk about things okay thank you so much for sparing us the time I it must be a very busy day today for you Norwegian foreign minister esman Bart AA thank you thank you very much okay let's get more from DW's Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem and Jack parck who is joining us from Brussels Jack three European countries they're recognizing Palestinian statehood can you tell us what this means exactly well it is a political statement and it's also a very symbolic one obviously the Spanish prime minister uh Pedro Sanchez when he announced made the announcement in Madrid earlier today he said that the recognition serves to tell the Palestinians we are with you Simon Harris the leader in Ireland he said that the recognition of the pal it's a recognition of the Palestinian people to their right to self determination it is a really significant move for the three countries it is symbolic they're not necessarily the biggest diplomatic uh powers of Europe but they have been making uh they've been saying that they're going to do this for some time of them it will come into Force this recognition on May the 28th there were other countries Belgium was perhaps going to be expected to do this alongside them we do know that there are moves here in Belgium to make a similar announcement and indeed potentially in France as well now what although it is symbolic it is also significant because Arab countries have said that they will only be involved in the sort of policing of a reconstruction of a post-war Gaza if Western Nations recognize a state in Palestine so the more countries that do that the more support that there would be from those Arab Nations to fund firstly a post-war uh Palestinian State okay and looking at reactions from Israel Rebecca Israel has now recalled its ambassadors to the three countries what else is Israel doing and saying well this announcement has drawn Fury from Israel probably unsurprisingly to most viewers Israel completely opposes the decision that has been announced this joint decision by Spain uh Ireland and Norway um Benjamin netan who has long said that establishing a Palestinian state would be an existential danger to Israel that and and been standing against it certainly since uh the war that began on October 7 as you mentioned the ambassadors to those three countries have been recalled and they are looking at further measures the finance min bet L smotrich has called for further punitive measures uh and said that he will be withholding tax uh that Israel collects uh and then gives to the Palestinian collects for the Palestinian Authority and then hands over he'll be withholding those taxes and they'll be looking at further punitive measures now um in response to this the foreign minister this morning said that it sends a message to Palestinians and to the world that terrorism pays he also said that it will harm efforts to uh retrieve the remaining hostages inside Gaza so a very strong reaction from Israel on the Palestinian side we've seen a much more positive response obviously uh the Palestinian Authority who have always been fighting for a two-state solution have uh reacted positively and Hamas has also come out to say that they think this is a step in the right direction okay and all of this is happening just a couple of days after the chief prosecutor at the international criminal court of course announced that he's seeking arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister and for for the Israeli defense minister so is all of this pressure Rebecca having any effect on Benjamin Netanyahu well I there's no doubt that pressure is mounting on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government and Israel uh on the international stage there's absolutely no doubt about that this week particularly uh the pressure has been mounting and we are seeing that it's having an effect on the government on Representatives here on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself s we can see that in the way that everyone is responding both to the ICC news on Monday and to today's decision pretty much across the board uh so you know um bipartisan responses to these announcements uh particularly of course the ICC that was uh you know everyone on both sides of government were saying that that was an outrage um so pressure definitely mounting but when we look at how much that might affect Benjamin netanyahu's you know decision and the way that he's planning the this war going forward I think we won't see uh much change we won't see it effect he is really fighting for his political survival H and that really means also continuing this war in Gaza that is something that he's been saying that his government are adamant that they are going to do that they're going to continue with this Rafa offensive that they are uh determined to dismantle Hamas and retrieve the hostages uh and that nothing will stop them so uh he doesn't want to face the day after because that is when he said that they will investigate and look at the the wrongdoings and that led up to October 7 and he knows that that will be very difficult situation for him all right Jack I just wanted to ask you what about other European countries I mean will any more now potentially recognize statehood it's likely that they probably will potentially Belgium potentially France what's really interesting about this well it shows the ever deepening Rift between Israel and some of its traditional Western allies it ALS show also shows the Visions among some EU member states now the European Union's position is has always and long has been to work to a two-state solution many uh of the eu's countries feel that the the recognition of a Palestinian state is the end of the negotiations of that uh that goal of making a two-state solution what we're seeing now is certain countries I mean Ireland uh um Norway and Spain obviously saying that for them this is the starting point now countries like Germany uh for instance wouldn't allow that to to go so so now we're seeing some of those divisions really start to play out in Europe let's bring in Laura Blumenfeld she is a Middle East analyst and New York Times bestselling author who joins us from Washington DC good to speak to you Laura now just looking at this news what changes as a result of these countries recognizing uh Palestinian state well listen recognition doesn't answer any of the hard questions I can tell you that as a former senior policy adviser on the Israeli Palestinian negotiating team for the state department under President Obama I mean we have to determine borders security refugees Jerusalem recognition is symbolic and I guess it was a three for one kind of deal for these countries because they were able to recognize Palestine reprimand Israel and also kind of give a little Ras to the United States for handling or perhaps mishandling on what they see our Middle East negotiations until now and the response from Israel of course uh we've seen Israel recalling its ambassadors but uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says this move the recognition rewards terrorism how would you assess that statement Netanyahu is feeling increasingly isolated and there's a kind of undertone of violence um to his language especially on a day like today where they released the hostage tape of the young 19-year-old female soldiers who were bloodied and and bound by palan gunmen uh the way that Netanyahu has put it is he says we won't let them Ram a Palestinian State down our throats and it's really troubling but again this just feeds his Narrative of isolation and doesn't clear the path forward unfortunately that's why the United States says the best way forward is through direct bilateral negotiations um you know rather than jamming uh and and game on either side so in Ence you're saying netanyahu's further pushed Israel into into further isolation with his response well I think Netanyahu has taken a position of you know with you or without you I'm going into Rafa I'm going to prosecute this battle for total Victory it kind of reinforces his paranoia the Israelis need reassurance after October 7th the Palestinians need respect but real respect means Real Results unfortunately by declaring independence it doesn't really create any kind of path forward any kind of defining way forward to actually establishing that state right now we're looking at a you know a heap of rubble how can we build from the bottom up rather than making declarations the United States is trying to kind of use this to Pivot to create some diplom diplomatic momentum and say look if there is going to be a Palestinian State Israelis why don't you jump on the train and join this Mega deal with Saudi Arabia which we've been pushing ping right which would normalize relations for you with a major Gulf Power we create a power Dynamic a security Packa with Saudi Arabia and we can get going on the on the sort of goal that we were pursuing before October 7th before Hamas spoiled it which is greater Regional integration and economic um you know prosperity for all and on that note what do you expect the US to to to do as a result of these developments well they're doing what they've always been doing which is bance right on the same day that Jake Sullivan pushed back and said this was not productive uh this declaration of independence they also pushed back on the Israelis and said withholding tax revenue as a form of punishment to the Palestinian Authority is also not constructive you saw it in Secretary blinken's uh testimony on the hill where he had the right-wing Senators kind of wagging their finger at him from the podium where behind him they had the left-wing demonstrators waving bloody hands behind him this is the line that Biden has been walking it's a tight rope with no net but I think his conscience is guiding him okay we'll leave it there for now Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld in Washington DC thank you for speaking to us thank you
