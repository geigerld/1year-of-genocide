the Gulf State of Kata is where mediators are trying to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza it's also where some Palestinians are being treated for severe injuries from the war DW special correspondent a Ibrahim was in Doha where she met with Palestinian medical evacuees and saw the toll the fighting has taken on the Gaza strips most vulnerable a warning to viewers her story contains graphic and disturbing images many ways 9-year-old Mahmud is like any child his age he enjoys playing with his father and beating his younger siblings at video games during those moments he is a happy boy I am Palestinian I am patient I can take a lot I can endure everything but sometimes as if out of nowhere what he has gone through overcomes him his mother tells the story Mahmud cannot Mahmud lying face down his head was moving and he was breathing but his right arm was not there and his left arm was completely crushed he told me Mom you take my sister and go I will be murdered I told him no my love I would never leave you he fell from my arms twice I could not carry him at all that was back in December mahmud's mother tells me the family were heating Israeli calls to leave the Northern parts of the Gaza Strip then an Israeli rocket landed near mahm in the days after the strike because of the anesthesia and fever he was coming in and out of Consciousness he was hallucinating when he woke up and he would look at himself and ask me where are my hands why am I like this and he would cry I could not make him stop so I would cry with him after the he became like a baby again he needed help with everything slowly but surely Mahmud is recovering here in Qatar along with more than 2,000 other evacuees from Gaza most of them are women and children many have serious injuries initially built to house football World Cup fans this compound is now a microcosm of human suffering caused by a war Israel says is Justified to protect its people everyone here has a story of loss and tragedy in November Muhammad his wife and two of their children were on their way to a market in Gaza when they were hit by an Israeli air strike he tells me this video he says shows the aftermath of the attack the boy being carried away is his youngest bahat the woman lying in the background is his wife bahat lost his leg his wife died in the life but thank God she left me the children we were civilians walking down the street all our lives all we ever asked for from God was protection his son is getting treatment he misses his mother and his siblings some of whom are still trapped in Gaza getting the family back together is all that Muhammad can think about but so far all his attempts have failed as for little Mahmud in one sense he's the luckiest of the lucky he was able to get out with his siblings and both of his parents it's a big reason why they say he's having having mostly good days but the memories of his home now a pile of rubble are always with him I'm used to being in my country playing with my friends and playing with my cousins what I loved the most was playing with my cousins I love them we would ride bicycles together we would play soccer together we would go swimming we were happy fun mmud wants nothing more than to be able to return home one day but the Gaza of his childhood no longer exists I'm joined Now by our special correspondent a ibraim who filed that report a you traveled to Kat to file your report uh Kat is playing an extraordinary role in events that are unfolding in Gaza it's also where peace negotiations are are taking place or ceasefire negotiations are taking place for for Gaza why is Kata 1 and a half thousand kilometers away from Gaza playing such an important role in events there right I mean for a tiny Gulf State one can say that it has played an outsize role in a conflict that really everyone around the world seems to have an an opinion about and as you mentioned uh Qatar has been one of the main negotiator in the ongoing uh uh um ceasefire talks they were a key protagonist in The successfully negotiated uh um temporary ceasefire agreement late last year which actually saw the return of the majority of hostages that have been able to leave uh uh Gaza they've sort of placed themselves as the mediators of the region they've become host to some very unsavory actors so the Taliban famously and now they are also uh you know the hosts of hamas's uh political leadership since 2012 since that leadership has uh left uh uh Damascus and so they're kind of playing on both sides if you will and they've created a very important uh role for themselves in the region and globally as a result of being sort of that diplomatic go between between the west and some of the world's uh less Savory actors um at the same time including the Taliban that's correct at the same time we've seen as we've seen in that report the the the humanitarian effort that they have done for the most vulnerable in this War uh and it's a logistical feat to try and bring these medical evacuees out of the Gaza Strip the Israelis are involved in approving that the Egyptians because they usually go through the Rafa border and from everything that we've seen I mean they've really taken on cases that countries like Germany have so far for example not been able to to bring here for for various uh for various reasons and and for the people that are there that are getting that treatment that means the world every single one of these individuals is a whole world why did you go to Kata and not to say Israel or the Palestinian territories to interview the medical evacuations well really it's a it's it's a question of access since the beginning of this war and this is really unprecedented um Israel has restricted the axes of external journalists International journalists like ourselves from the Gaza Strip there have been few imbeds with the idea of sort of in the earlier phase of the War uh but these uh you know these these these reporting trips under the opice of the IDF are heavily filtered of course um and this is really um sort of an unprecedented restriction of course we've been relying on the great work of our Palestinian colleagues who are you know fighting for their lives and for their fam's lives as they report but for us to really be able to go there and bear witness to Bear witness firsthand to the stories of survivors that hasn't been possible so far you know my colleagues part of a much bigger team that's been on the story since the Massac of October 7th and the war and we've covered many different aspects of it we've we've spoken to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank we've covered the tensions within Israeli Society the hostage uh tragedy the the agony that their families are going through we've spoken to evacuees from northern Israel but really getting firsthand access to gazans um we haven't been able to really do that so far at you know in that proximity and so it was really important for us to go there and to be able to speak to them and to try and really show the path of uh of possible recovery that's ahead of them and the challenges that faces that population yeah thank you very much that was our special cor correspondent AIA ibraim and we have Casey har on the line with us now she heads up safe the children's team in the Gaza Strip and she jo joins us now from Gaza um Casey we understand no one is immune from the effects of War but why is this conflict having such a disproportionate impact on children first my heart goes out to the families that you just featured uh what they've been through what they're suffering and as you said in a horrible way they are the lucky ones they've gotten out they are somewhere safe over 14,000 children have been killed in air strikes in this conflict as a direct impact of the war um we know that children are seven times more likely to die in these blasts because their bodies are smaller they're thrown farther faster their bones Bend um so they are more susceptible in these strikes we also know that there are an estimated thousand children living still in Gaza that have lost a limb so they are still here at threat of additional attacks there's nowhere safe for them to go um and they're trying to survive in a nearly impossible situation for children that haven't been caught up in the direct attacks they're susceptible to disease we're seeing tens of thousands that have died from the secondary impacts of this war from the collapse in infrastructure from the fact that there are not vaccines there are not clinics um they can't access the most basic Services now beyond the um ceasefire deal what are children in Gaza in need of most right now we need a definitive ceasefire we need the bombs to stop falling we need air strikes to stop even in the so-called safe Zone we're seeing targeted strike so there really is nowhere safe we need a defend ceasefire with that we also need supplies trucks haven't been able to come across the border um at the same volume since before the war we don't have enough basic hygiene supplies there isn't enough soap people can't stay clean they can't uh eat sufficient food nutrition is a significant problem there's not enough fresh food there's not enough meat children are eating diets that consist largely of snacks soda sugary food so we need supplies to be able to come across the border in addition to the definitive Seas spire and we need those uh that have been involved in this war to be held accountable for the actions here do you are you still able is safe the children still able to fulfill its mission in Gaza we are doing everything we can but it is getting harder and harder by the day just in the last week this safe Zone that their so-called safe Zone here decreased by 22% today there were additional evacuation orders so we're squeezed into an even smaller space to try to operate and for our team they are committed to the humanitarian Mission our team here in Gaza we have Palestinians that have been working for us for many years even before the war they're committed to serving their fellow Palestinians but they also have to worry about their families it's getting harder for them to perform their duties because they are constantly evacuating they're moving they're having to be to watch out for their own children in addition to trying to serve others Casey her there from sa the children's in Gaza thank you very much thank you
