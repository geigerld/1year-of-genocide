residents of the West Bank launched a general strike closing their shops and other businesses after Israeli troops raided a refugee camp in the territory the Palestinian red crescent said at least 14 people were killed and dozens injured Israel says it targeted militants during a counterterrorism operation Israel's military raids the new Shams refugee camp in the northern part of the West Bank the aftermath many killed and injured roads bulldozed and homes destroyed my son was sleeping there he had gone to wash himself then he prayed and went home his home is higher up there was a sniper in front of him who shot him I heard the sound of the shooting my other son went up there and found he was blood Palestinians describe the Israeli rate as unprecedented there is indeed complete destruction of homes shops the electricity grid the sewage the water Network and the infrastructure this incursion is unprecedented there are snipers and rooftops death squats and Special Forces deployed it's indeed a real war the Israeli military says it killed militants during the raid the Army also says it has found and destroyed explosives and seized many weapons used in what it calls terrorist activities following the Israeli rate Palestinian residents launched a general strike shops universities Banks and the public transportation were all close to protest the Israeli rate on the refugee camp balik sladin is a journalist based in Tel Aviv and he told me more about the high tensions and the purpose of the idf's raid in the West Bank well uh we are four days into this last raid in N Shams camp in tar and apparently the security forces didn't conclude the operation yet today the Palestinians said that the Israeli soldiers retreated and left the what they call a Siege on the camp uh showing the damage that we've seen also in the report uh some residents uh in the West Bank including ones that I talked to claimed that the main target of the raid the commander of the to Karim Battalion his name is abua is still alive actually contrary to what the shin B the Israeli intelligence has said they're showing videos of him photos of him but it's not clear when those photos and videos were actually taken if that turns out to be true we will definitely see more raids in the camp in the near future because Israel vowed to deal with all the armed groups in the West Bank um just to make it clear since the beginning of the war we've witnessed 60 operations like this and they managed to dismantle actually the battalions in Janine and nabl with to current Battalion is the last one standing if you ask me whether if they actually dismantle the to Karen Battalion the uh attacks will stop they will not because the Lone Wolf attacks that we see over and over again will definitely continue because that's the main challenge for the Israelis now after EU and US sanctions on Israeli settlers there are now media reports that the US is planning to impose sanctions on an IDF Battalion for alleged violations of international law can you tell us more yes well according to the report the US will impose on Battalion now the reason is that the battalions is involved in alleged human rights violations in the West Bank this Battalion is actually known for its question questionable practices to save the least against Palestinians in one incident they left an 80 years old American Palestinian man to die while handcuffed that happened in the beginning of 2022 and something uh of course that triggered lots of backlash from Washington because he is American and because of the incident itself now uh the report was met of course with outrage in Israel but it interesting to hear the difference in the tone between the commment from the Coalition and the opposition while the farri politicians like B like smotrich harshly condemns the possible sanction labor party leader M for example said that the violent nature of Neta has been known for the years and the American move should be considered as a wakeup call for Israel now let's also look at rafar now the latest Israeli air strike there killed more than 20 people that's according to Hamas and Israel still wants to launch a ground offensive what's going to happen to the civilian population then yes well uh we heard nahu uh in a statement today he said in the coming days the Israeli military will intensify its military and diplomatic pressure against Hamas saying that this only way to bring back the hostages since Hamas has refused actually every ceasefire proposal now we know that natany ordered the purchase of 40,000 t for the civilian but it's unclear where they will go the only possible uh humanitarian Zone will be an masasi actually something that of course the Israelis after all accepted that it will take lots of time and it will very complicated the journalist bikine in Tel Aviv thank you
