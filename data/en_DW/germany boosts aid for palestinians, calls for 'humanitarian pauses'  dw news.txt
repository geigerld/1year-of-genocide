and Germany will increase its humanitarian aid for the Palestinian territories by 38 million EUR foreign minister analina barbach made the announcement after talks in rala she later met her Israeli counterpart in Tel Aviv and she told reporters why Germany is calling for humanitarian pauses instead of a ceasefire the impulse of wanting a general ceasefire is absolutely something I can understand but part of the truth is look at how a seire of this kind could happen and how Hamas which attacked Israel on the 7th of October will how they will behave in this situation th with reference to Israel's right to defend itself the question arises as to whether Israel would be able to continue to protect itself against illegitimate attacks because we recognize that Israel has the right to defend itself but at the same time we want to ease the suff in in Gaza and this is why we are so vly calling for these humanitarian pauses and fighting which make it possible to at least end human suffering for that time I'm joined Now by DW's political correspondent Thomas Sparrow for more uh Thomas we just heard there German foreign minister analina bar barbach again um explaining why Germany is calling for humanitarian pauses but not a ceasefire per se why are we seeing her explain herself here well first it's important to stress that Germany is not the only country uh differentiating between a ceasefire and a humanitarian pause indeed that said Germany has indeed been asking for humanitarian poses in plural as a way in which humanitarian Aid could enter Gaza the idea why officials maybe are against a ceasefire right now not necessarily in the future but right now is because they believe that that could strengthen hamas's position in the in the war so there's also this idea that it's urgent to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza and that a way in which that could happen rather quickly and without the need for a formal agreement a formal ceasefire is by implementing these kinds of humanitarian pauses so that's why you're hearing German officials not only an Alena babok but other politicians as well distinguish between a ceasefire which is a formal agreement and a humanitarian pause which would allow Aid to enter Gaza and can you give us a sense of how much politic IC clout Germany actually has in the region and how much they could possibly affect what happens in this conflict on its own probably limited influence but Germany does not necessarily act alone Germany is an important member of the European Union and as such it can have clout when it comes to to trying to find a solution to this and that's also one of the reasons why anena babok has been traveling not only to visit the Palestinians also the Israelis but other uh areas countries in the region as well it's a third trip actually to the region since the War Began for Germany it's important to also have the chance to explain its position because it's a position that for many here in in Germany may be clear and straightforward Germany is very clearly supporting Israel that has to do with Germany's special relationship towards Israel Germany's historical responsibility the fact that Germany believes that it's very important for Germany to guarantee Israel's security that again may be very clear for people here in the country but not necess neily for countries in the region Arab countries in particular so for Germany and for analena babok when she travels to these countries it's important to explain the Germany's position and explain that on the one hand Germany is clearly supporting Israel on the other hand it is also calling for Israel to comply by the rules of law to guarantee that civilians are not attacked to guarantee that Aid can enter Gaza and so on so these are the two sides of Germany's position if you will now and just briefly Before I Let You Go Thomas given that background and given Germany special responsibility toward Israel how is this conflict being discussed in here in German Society it's being discussed a lot you see several protests from both sides from different sides of the conflict you see that it's also something that's being discussed widely in German Society you see that people are concerned about uh the conflict that's something that several polls have revealed you see that people are concerned about the impact that it may have might have here in the country as well when it comes to inreased numbers of of anti-Semitic cases in the country so there is certainly concern people are looking at this conflict in detail and it is something that people are looking at how it can possibly be resolved so all this debate about humanitarian pauses ceasefires and so on is also something that's being played here in the country as well Thomas thank you so much for that analysis that's DW's political correspondent Thomas
