Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning of what he calls a severe response to a rocket strike that killed 12 young people in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights on Saturday Netanyahu visited the site of the deadly attack in the Drew Arab Village of majal Shams today Israel blames the iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the strike on the sports field which killed teenagers and children the Israeli security cabinet has authorized Netanyahu and his defense minister to decide how and when to respond some residents of the village came out to protest against netanyahu's visit accusing him of exploiting their tragedy for political purposes the rocket strike has renewed fears of an allout war between Israel and Hezbollah in a moment I'll be talking to a former head of Israel's intelligence agency the Mossad to gauge How likely an open conflict is but first a look at the military capabilities both sides could drow up Hezbollah Rockets fired from Southern Lebanon intercepted by Israeli air defenses a common occurrence in recent weeks but some of those Rockets make it through and Israel has retaliated with devastating air strikes Hezbollah was founded as an anti-American and anti-israel militia in the 1980s when it carried out deadly car bombings on American forces in Lebanon the group has fought several Wars with Israel since then and has become a major political force backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from Iran the militia prizes secrecy and typically doesn't reveal information on its capabilities so any estimates of its forces are just that but in recent years us intelligence has put its strength at 45,000 soldiers including full-time and reservist Fighters the group's leader referred to having 100,000 fighters in 201 21 if that were true it would have more soldiers than the Lebanese Army last year the US estimated that Hezbollah also has 150,000 rockets and missiles more than enough to overwhelm Israeli air defenses and cause significant damage to infrastructure in a war Israel has one of the world's most modern militaries in addition to 170,000 active duty soldiers there are about 465,000 reservists it also has about 1,400 tanks as well as significant artillery and multiple rocket launching capabilities it also has an Air Force with over 200 jet fighters and almost 150 helicopters and it's widely considered to have nuclear weapons though it's unlikely to use them right across its own border there's also the Iron Dome an advanced anti-missile system that has intercepted thousands of rockets from Hezbollah and Hamas something Hezbollah itself Lacks an allout War would likely cause significant damage to Israeli and Lebanese cities with high civilian casualties after months of fighting Hamas in Gaza Israel's Army is also in danger of being overstretched and there are worries that intense fighting could bring in Iran and the US in a major regional conflict Ephraim halvi is the former director of Israel's intelligence agency Mossad and he joins me now from Tel Aviv Mr Hali welcome to DW I want to start with a question everybody is asking today how close are Israel and Hezbollah to an allout War I think uh we will know uh once Israel uh will uh um take action as uh it has stated that it would be a lot will depend on the scope of the uh uh step we are taking which is on the one hand to be a very firm one and a clear one and on the other hand to allow the other side not to uh um respond uh necessarily you have been involved in this kind of decision- making in the past what would be your advice to prime minister Netanyahu in terms of responding to this attack now that the ball is very much in Israel's Court I think it is impossible for Israel uh to refrain from uh um responding to the attack it was an attack which one cannot ignore and ignoring an attack like this would probably uh have a very very bad effect on Israel's deterrent capabilities and therefore a response is uh absolutely abolutely uh essential but it has to be a response which on the one hand as I said is very clear and also probably painful up to a point but also it allows the other side to refrain from retaliating in a manner which will bring uh the entire region into a regional War this is not in the interest of it's not in the interest ofah today and what is more important I believe it's not in the interest of Iran what would another full-fledged military operation mean for the war in Gaza because from from what I've been Gathering it's also not very much in the interest of Israel right to have another war on their hands no I don't think it's in our interest to have another war in on our hands but at the same time we can not accept a situation in which we have a large section of the country which is under Fire almost daily and uh where over over 880,000 people have left their homes we cannot uh live with this situation indefinitely and I want to bring up a detail that might not be so minor what do you make of the fact that has bad denies being involved in this well well um at first they did not uh respond uh they were very silent it took them a long time to take responsibility I suppose that they also considered what was in their interest but in anyway everybody understood that it was uh they who took this action I'm not sure if they clearly uh were uh uh uh targeting this particular uh football uh Center because uh it's very possible that they had another Target in mind and that they the target which they hit was not the target which they originally intended to uh hit in such a an operation hasah and Hamas of course are both backed by Iran but throughout your time at mad how did you experience the two groups to differ from each other and has as Superior military might asde I think one has to remember that when it comes to Gaza they are the uh sole uh element which makes decisions on what kind of action they should take but in the case ofah they are a lot Al Lo they have others that they have to take into account they have to take into account the government of Lebanon they have to take into account the government of Syria and what is more important they have to take into account Iran now today of all days the new president of Iran has assumed the office of president after he won the election there and it's clear that he is not intending to uh embroil the entire Middle East in war his interests are totally opposed to this and therefore if there is an Iranian influence here which is quite possible this could be the first test in which the Iranians will step in and also have uh something to say as to what kind of the of retaliation or response the uh hisbah will take after Israel carries out the operation that intends to carry out how do you expect Teran to to position itself in this you say this is a war they do not want it is a war Hezbollah doesn't want it is a war that Israel doesn't want couldn't this be a an offramp to diplomacy in the region I think that there is such a possibility I think one has to be patient I don't think this will be done overnight but I think that we have now this new uh uh Iranian government a new president and a president who has a different policy on International Affairs and who has an interest in uh opening up a dialogue of one kind or another with the United States and I think this is a new uh a very important factor which we will see possibly in play in this particular case as well this is the first test there is of the influence the Iran can exert on theah in a situation like this that was Israel's former spy Chief Ephraim Hali thank you so much for your fascinating insights and your time thank you and let's hope for the best our correspondent Tanya Kramer is following developments from Jerusalem and I asked her what this severe response against Hezbollah that Netanyahu announced today might look like yeah that's also what's certainly being discussed here it's somehow a very uh tense uh waiting uh time right now and we've seen over the past days already uh Israel's Air Force carrying out strikes uh sometimes deep inside Lebanon or in Sou Lebanon and also counter strikes from hollah again some Aid Sirens went off in the north but uh you know now the focus is on not so much if there will be uh a response by Israel but when this will happen and also uh you know on the scope uh and and the targets of this response because this will very much Define according to military experts here you know what then will be hezbollah's response uh to all of that so there could be a strike for example Israel has threatened that many times you know in Beirut but there's some sources here saying that there's a lot of uh pressure now on Israel uh not to go overboard with this response we just heard again prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu today visiting the Drews town of mashal Shams in the occupied uh Goen Heights he was hackled there also by some people there but he again wowed a very powerful response and we heard that also from other politicians while at the same time we also hearing from The Diplomatic sources there is a lot of efforts going on uh to uh call for you know for for restraint uh um also by all the mediators that have been uh trying to mediate between Hezbollah Lebanon and Israel in the past month uh already the US uh enroy Amos hulin uh but also uh France there was a phone call with with the French President uh maon and prime minister Netanyahu on Sunday and you know everybody's trying to prevent this to become a wider Regional War it this is the latest escalation in a Tit for Tat that's been going on for months now there have been almost daily clashes between Israel and Hezbollah since October 7th what does that mean for the people living and working near the border area on both sides well yeah if you're talking to people that come from uh Northern Israel they would tell you there is already a war going on some call it a war of attration now this has all started uh on October 8th uh after the attacks on October 7 and then the war in Gaza because this is very much related to what is happening in Gaza Hezbollah then started attacking um uh Israel on a on a limited scope uh at times but this there were periods when it became more and less and of course Israel is also counterattacking uh in uh Lebanon there have been uh casualties on both sides uh of the Border among civilians but also uh hisbah militants and also among uh soldiers uh in uh Israel so what has happened here in the in in in October last year is that over 60,000 people and at times even more were asked to evacuate the the areas very close to the Border up to 5 kilometers from uh the border and most of them are still not uh being able to go home so U there was a lot of pressure here on the government to change that situation uh either through diplomatic means also or militarily and there was always this fear that an incident like what we've seen on Saturday uh in mashal Shams on the occupied goolan Heights where a lot of civilians in this case kids and teenagers uh where kill could trigger actually uh this military response and even a wider uh uh escalation here in the region that was DW correspondent Tanya Kramer thanks so much for the latest
