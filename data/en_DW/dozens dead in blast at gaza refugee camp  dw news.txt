Israel is stepping up its ground and air offensive against Gaza the Israel Defense Forces released video showing what they say are tanks and ground troops operating at unspecified locations inside Gaza the military says it has struck hundreds of militant Targets in the recent days its soldiers are engaged in Fierce hand-to-hand combat including attacking Hamas gunmen in the network of underground tunnels beneath Gaza the IDF also claims it has killed the senior Hamas Commander involved in directing the October 7th terrorist attacks our correspondent Tanya ker is in stot in southern Israel that's close to the G Gaza Strip border we asked her about reports of that Fierce fighting deep in the Gaza Strip well I can tell you what we are seeing and hearing from here um we've been here for the course of the day there has been heavy bombardment air strikes also toly tanks and we also uh have seen rocket Fire coming out uh some of it went towards Central Israel towards uh the Tel Aviv area but also in southern uh uh Israel we had uh some you know the the military seems to be going steadily more deeper inside Gaza uh step by step so to speak uh there was a radio address released um uh audio recording released by the head of the Southern command uh who is responsible here for for the for the Gaza Strip and the area saying that to the Troops that they will fight in allies and in tunnels so this was kind of a hint maybe that they're approaching a denser urban area that they're coming closer maybe to Gaza City but I also have to stress we do not know these details because um you know the the the Army keeps the information very tight and journalists are not in in this area inside at the same time on the same time we hearing uh from Hamas as well uh the the military Wing the Kasam Brigade saying they're engaging the the military the Israeli military that they even Ambush them in some area so that there is uh fighting uh going on um so this is on on on this side what we can see here but we also have heard from the Israeli military that there was an a missile that was intercepted over the Red Sea uh by the aerody defense system that possibly came from uh from Yemen now uh what do we know about the long-term goals of the Israeli government there to take back control of the Gaza Strip well basically uh we we really don't know I mean they have not stated what they will do um uh once this is over they said this is going to be a very long campaign um and uh they the government is saying that they want to as they put it eradicate Hamas they want to eliminate all their C capabilities and they will not let up you know uh the uh ground the the offensive on Gaza and the war on Gaza until it will destroy Hamas so what does that mean is not quite clear because Hamas is also of course a political force uh also uh some of its leaders are in other countries uh in the region uh so there will be uh still also be there uh so there's also the main criticism that nobody talks about really their ideas being floated but nobody really talks about what is going to be and of course the people in Gaza are also potentially not being asked they have been displaced now uh what will happen to them will they be able to go back uh most some of them might not find their house there anymore there's talk about the Palestinian Authority that is uh um governing the occupied West Bank to come back but all these are ideas and of course for Israel uh to stay there for a longer time to basically administer occupy uh the the Gaza Strip so um this is all not clear all what we know from from the government is that they are saying this is a very long campaign uh what they are envisioning our correspondent T there thank you Tanya dozens of people have been killed in a blast at a refugee camp north of Gaza City the Hamas ran Health Ministry says an air strike killed at least 50 people at the jabalia site the densely populated Camp is the largest in the Gaza Strip United Nations has also confirmed that more than 3,000 children have now been killed in the bombardment of Gaza food water and medical supply still desperately short they're growing cause for a humanitarian ceasefire the Gins go through another day of explosions Israeli air strikes have been targeting the strip for weeks they say they're hitting Hamas militants and their infrastructure inside the territory as the death toll mounts the ham Mass run Health Ministry claims that over 8 and a half thousand people have died in Gaza since Israeli bombing began many have lost entire families we don't have anything nothing he was just going out to find gas because we don't have any at home he was also looking for bread for the children and gas then they told me he was martyred this is now a daily reality for the people of Gaza people clawing to get others out from under the rubble many of those stuck are children on Monday the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the Gaza crisis with Aid agencies focusing on the young casualties of this war nearly 70% of those reported killed are children and women save the children reported yesterday that nearly 3,200 children were killed in Gaza in just three weeks this surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world's conflict zones since 2019 this cannot be collateral damage at least there also came this call for children to be better protected on behalf of all the children caught in this nightmare we call on the World to do better whether they are young people attending a music festival or children going about their daily lives in Gaza they all deserve peace children do not start conflicts and they are powerless to stop them to add to the suffering essential supplies are running dangerously low food water fuel and medicines are all hard to find humanitarian workers say the aid reaching Gaza is far too little for residents with one UN agency in Gaza claiming an urgencies fire is now a life or death matter for millions of Palestinians the journalist hen belusa is in Gaza and he updated us earlier on how humanitarian Aid there is being distributed um the distribution mechanism is not clear to everybody um H announced that they are handing some some wheat to the bakeries for um uh to make bread so may that made the prices half um at the bakery so people are are getting the bread with with with a half half a prve but still the cues are very long and and everybody anybody want want to want to get a back of bread needs to wait like between two to three hours at least to get one back um some distribution happen in uh on schools which is uh people are uh Sheltering there but um what other people in in the area who are displaced some of them they are saying at the industry or in their cars in the streets they are not releasing a the mechanism is not clear people are are not aware of the things it's it's very limited plus the type of the the aid that comes to Da we are talking about um um bical supplies food and and water but still like um there is a huge shortage of water with washing water or drinking water that was journalist hen Bala there reporting from Gaza some European countries are reportedly hoping to ship Aid to Gaza now Hiba Tibi the country director for care in the Palestinian territories has bore about efforts to ramp up a deliveries uh thank you so much for this great question um we are in Desperate needs in Gaza for the humanitarian Aid having these hopes and that are coming in a very timely manner is is is very important uh in two days there were announcements on the complete collapse of the uh fuel system in two of the major hospitals in Gaza for instance uh you have seen also in the news and I'm pretty sure through the lenses of media the situation in terms of bread uh food uh Water Medic medical supply all of these uh medical humanitarian supplies are uh required in Gaza as soon as possible in a sustainable Manner and also um in a way that is safe for the teams to distribute them and contribute to saving the lives immediately U now K has warned about the collapsing Health Care system in Gaza how is that affecting people there unfortunately it's uh the situation is really becoming more and more dire um by the hour as as we always say um the lack of medical supplies the lack of fuel and electricity to operate hospitals uh the lack of the uh medical C in general is becoming more and more difficult today we have he that the medical students undergraduates are required to also come to support hospitals doctors are unable to deal with this the huge numbers of wounded people and also on the top of those who are in need of medical treatment including including elderly pregnant women uh cancer patients uh babies in incubators those who are in need of of certain long-term Medical Services like dialysis so the situation is becoming more and more difficult on um by the top of the hour if I can't even say by the by the minute can you give us a sense of what it's like for your colleagues on the ground there my colleagues now are very similar to the rest of the people the internally displaced people from the north to the South most of them are living either in the shelters or with their hosted with their family members in very overcrowded houses just now I received a message from my colleagues saying that they don't have any more any water and unfortunately the very scarse resources that we were able to identify in Gaza for drinking bottled water they we they they are they ran out of the water and we cannot contribute or stend to them water for for their consumption unfortunately some of them have their grandkids babies and or their own babies and they are unable they are asking us only to send water for their uh uh for their milk to to for the babies only so this is the situation unfortunately now the north of Gaza has been hit hard with air strikes um are people still there and why are they still there and is help getting to them unfortunately most of the help is is going towards either the hospitals and I will speak about for instance care and other NOS either through two hospitals where they have sheltered many people and to the UN designated shelters unfortunately there are many people in the north that were not able to evacuate for different reasons on the top of everything they could not afford uh moving or evacuating to the South after two or 10 after two weeks almost in the South many of them came back so most of those who were stried in jabalia now came back from the south to the north they were not able to uh uh to continue living on the over in the overcrowded shelters that are out of resources now and that is is facing huge issues with the outbreak of diseases water born related diseases and viruses and in the same time they could not feel safe in the South they were under constant Shilling so most of them came back so the first this is the first reason why they did not Evacuate the second is that the biggest hospitals who are uh providing Health Services like dialysis there is the biggest one in the north so you will see people staying in the surrounding area so that they can access these Services there are very few people who did not leave because they don't want to leave and these are very very few people but but most of those who stayed in the north either because they were not able to leave or because they came back from the south because they could not bear the unbearable conditions of living therea there from Care thank you very
