00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
try and control it um and that's really
 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.189 align:start position:0%
try and control it um and that's really
I<00:06:58.879><c> guess</c><00:06:59.479><c> reflective</c><00:07:00.000><c> of</c><00:07:00.199><c> the</c><00:07:00.360><c> fact</c><00:07:00.639><c> that</c><00:07:00.960><c> it's</c>

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
I guess reflective of the fact that it's
 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.550 align:start position:0%
I guess reflective of the fact that it's
incredibly<00:07:02.039><c> difficult</c><00:07:02.240><c> to</c><00:07:02.440><c> move</c><00:07:03.240><c> in</c><00:07:03.400><c> the</c>

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to move in the
 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to move in the
Urban<00:07:03.919><c> Terrain</c><00:07:04.560><c> Hamas</c><00:07:04.960><c> is</c><00:07:05.120><c> very</c><00:07:05.319><c> well</c>

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
Urban Terrain Hamas is very well
 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.589 align:start position:0%
Urban Terrain Hamas is very well
prepared<00:07:05.879><c> it's</c><00:07:06.080><c> been</c><00:07:06.199><c> there</c><00:07:06.360><c> for</c><00:07:06.520><c> 30</c><00:07:06.879><c> years</c>

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
prepared it's been there for 30 years
 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.790 align:start position:0%
prepared it's been there for 30 years
there<00:07:07.680><c> are</c><00:07:08.000><c> extensive</c><00:07:08.560><c> tunnel</c><00:07:08.960><c> systems</c><00:07:09.720><c> and</c>

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
there are extensive tunnel systems and
 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.749 align:start position:0%
there are extensive tunnel systems and
so<00:07:09.960><c> I</c><00:07:10.039><c> think</c><00:07:10.240><c> Israel</c><00:07:10.759><c> has</c><00:07:11.080><c> to</c><00:07:12.080><c> will</c><00:07:12.280><c> be</c><00:07:12.479><c> looking</c>

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
so I think Israel has to will be looking
 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:15.629 align:start position:0%
so I think Israel has to will be looking
to<00:07:12.960><c> move</c><00:07:13.199><c> into</c><00:07:13.520><c> small</c><00:07:13.960><c> areas</c><00:07:14.400><c> at</c><00:07:14.560><c> a</c><00:07:14.800><c> time</c><00:07:15.479><c> and</c>

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
to move into small areas at a time and
 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.390 align:start position:0%
to move into small areas at a time and
then<00:07:15.879><c> and</c><00:07:16.000><c> then</c><00:07:16.120><c> move</c><00:07:16.400><c> forward</c><00:07:16.800><c> from</c><00:07:17.400><c> that</c>

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
then and then move forward from that
 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
then and then move forward from that
