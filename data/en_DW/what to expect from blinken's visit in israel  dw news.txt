the US is ramping up pressure on Israel for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza in a turnaround of its position Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is expected in Tel Aviv on Friday to drive home this message to Israeli leaders he's been on a diplomatic Blitz of the Middle East his sixth trip to the region since the War Began with hamas's terror attack on Israel on October 7th he'll arrive just hours before the US submits a draft to the UN Security Council calling for an immediate and sustain ceasefire here's blinkin speaking in Egypt yesterday there's a clear consensus around a number of shared priorities first the need for an immediate sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages uh that would create space to Surge more humanitarian assistance to relieve uh the suffering of many people and to build something more enduring now the ceasefire that we're working on would be the best most immediate way to enable us to Surge humanitarian assistance but it's not the only way uh we agreed today all of the ministers that we would get our experts together in the coming days uh to identify the Urgent practical and concrete steps that Kenan should be taken to increase the flow of assistance Israel needs to do more let's get more on this from the region our correspondent Tony Kramer is in Jerusalem and journalist kareim El guari is in Cairo Kareem to you first the US Secretary of State is plying on to Israel later today how are his efforts to get a ceasefire in Gaza being seen where you are well um the Egyptians and the Karis who are the mediators are pretty tight lipped blink himself said yesterday that uh we're getting closer to a deal the gaps are closing without giving any more details but the fact that they're going to meet today in Doha again in Qatar with the head of the Egyptian of the Israeli mosad intelligence means that there is something on the table that all sides find worth uh negotiating about uh but what is also interesting in this meeting yesterday in Cairo and that was not only with the Egyptian foreign minister but with foreign ministers and officials of six Arab countries yesterday and there is a consensus between the US and the Arab states that first there needs to be an immediately and sustainable ceasefire but also that there needs to be a massive increase of Aid coming in and maybe what's most interesting and consensus about what should happen after the war that there should be uh the Arab states basically offer an integration of Israel into the a region for a Palestinian States and that is something the US is agreeing with that's the old land for peace formula uh but of course it's very difficult to achieve with the current right-wing Israeli government Tanya what kind of Welcome is Anthony blinkin likely to get from Israeli leaders when he arrives there today well I mean he's scheduled to meet with prime minister Benjamin nanyo and other members of the uh smaller War cabinet and this comes of course after a lot of public back and forth between the US Administration and this uh current Israeli government mainly between President Joe Biden and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu but also other American officials being uh you know very critical of Israel's war conduct now of course uh the us remain uh Israel's closest Ally and also their main supporter when it comes to military aid but there have been tensions and that is closely watched here in Israel now these talks will center around as far as we understand you know that the Americans have said we want to see more Aid as we heard coming into Gaza we want to see more protection of civilians they also want to talk about this planned military operation in Rafa where the Americans are saying there must be other ways to defeat Hamas while protecting uh civilians but also of course the talks in Doha that are going on we heard that uh from the Israeli Prime Minister's office they're saying that the head of the mosad is on its way there so there might be some movement that is also very CL closely watched here Kareem the US is trying to assert itself self in dealing with the Middle East now in a way that it hasn't for years it's very trying to be very engaged diplomatically but how much leverage does the United States in the right now in the form of its US Secretary of State there have in the region well give let's give you an example next week the Israeli Minister of Defense Galant is due in Washington with a wish list of more weapons uh they want to get and here is exactly the leverage there is billions of dollars of Financial and military aid from the US uh to uh uh to Israel uh one of the most immediate things would be the ammunition for offensive operations in Gaza but until now Biden is not willing to use this leverage until now we have basically only words uh public words of more criticism towards Israel but no action when it comes to the the aid military and financial aid to Israel and that's the biggest leverage any country has over Israel right now Tanya talk to us about the new UN resolution that's being put forth by the US's Security Council resolution uh this calls for an immediate sustained ceasefire in Gaza a vote could come within hours how is this being seen in Israel yeah once again I think this is also being closely watched because in the past you know month we've seen the US veto uh um un Council resolutions or abstaining and and basically um shielding in a way Israel uh from those resolutions and now this one this draft emphasizes first and foremost you have to say the need for an immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians to allow more Aid and also to alleviate uh suffering as it says but also it aims to secure the ceasefire in connection with the release of hostages now the wording here is uh very important for some it is still not strong enough others said it might pass and of course the international pressure on Israel is uh increasing with this but we have to wait and see how Israel will respond to it it has in the past not always adhered to such resolutions Tanya kareim thank you very much that was our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem and Kareem alui in
