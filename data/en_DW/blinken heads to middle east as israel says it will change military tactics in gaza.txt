US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is heading to the Middle East again for what will be his fourth visit to the region since Hamas launched a largescale terrorist attack on Israel on October the 7th last year since then Israel has taken the war to Hamas in Gaza in response The Fallout from that war continues to threaten a wider conflict in the region Israel said on Monday it was regrouping its forces in Gaza and will change the way it's fighting Hamas which is seen as a terrorist organization by the US the EU and many others in statements toward the end of last year the US called on Israel to do more to prevent civilian casualties in Gaza according to Hamas controlled authorities there the war has now killed more than 22,000 people but the first statement from the White House in the New Year show continued support for Israel's war goals in Gaza the destruction of Hamas mil militarily being high on that list here's National Security Council spokesman John Kirby we have estimates I'm Lo to put the numbers out there right now because they are just estimates uh but uh but Hamas still has a significant Force posture inside Gaza we believe that it is absolutely an attainable goal for the Israeli military forces to uh to degrade and and defeat hamas's ability ities to conduct attacks inside Israel they they can it can be done militarily are you going to eliminate the ideology no um and are you likely going to uh erase the group uh from existence probably not but can you eliminate the threat that Hamas poses to the Israeli people absolutely and joining me now is Shalom lipner he worked for seven consecutive Israeli Prime Ministers between 1990 and 2016 and he's currently with the Atlantic Council and joins us from Jerusalem welcome to the day now the US has questioned Israeli tactics in Gaza but would Israel have been able to use the force it has without the backing of the US in the first place it's good to be with Gart tonight um initially I think that you know the the IDF rebounded after the atrocities of October 7 you know fell back on a much better footing than it had initially when it was caught by surprise but I think later it's um it would have been very difficult close to impossible for Israel to have mounted the effort that we've seen in Gaza without the you know the close assistance of the United States we've seen over 200 planes of Munitions coming to to restock Israeli arsenals we've seen the uh support the United States has provided on the security Council to to push back against resolutions that have called for an immediate ceasefire so I think um you know it's pretty clear right now that uh you know that right now the United States and Israel are closely aligned at least as far as the campaign is concerned and then the goal of defeating kasas which of course the United States and much of Europe which has defined Hamas as a terrorist organization you know would see that as a shared interest of all those parties now Israel says it's changing its tactics now with the reduction of troops uh that are actually in Gaza uh and a shift to tactics which should reduce civilian casualties among Palestinians has that shift come in time to prevent President Biden from rethinking his approach to support for Israel well I mean those those channels of communication are open on a constant basis it would appear so um I think we've seen um you know we've seen comments coming out of Washington suggesting that Israel has been receptive to their concerns as you say the the deployment has moved into a to the next phase as they've defined it now um you know that many of the reservists are being rotated out and um Israel is moving to more Precision um operations within within the Gaza Strip obviously American concerns that were voiced on the issue of um trying to keep non-combatants you know keep them away from the fighting to increase civilian Aid um were heard by Israel as well you know there was some push back about the extent to which you know that could happen in a war zone and obviously you know concerns that if if the eight tap was open too far that could actually help actually sustain Kamas in power but I think that you know those concerns are being are being heard here and I think it's probably safe to say that the United States is should always say relieved that you know that Israel is moving on to this to this next phase of The Campaign which hopefully will be a little more uh yeah yeah let's let's look into the future a bit can and should Israel formulate what kind of deal it wants with the Palestinians after this war is over well we've seen a lot of resistance shall we say to having discussions in Israel and with you know with Israel's Partners about the proverbial day after actually tonight the security cabinet I think and the and the war cabinet both cabinets will be meeting to actually have that an inal discussion or at least one that they've that they've publicized um I mean it would be virtually inconceivable certainly in terms of Israel's planning and and you know its partners that are on side that that conversation would not happen I think that you know there's a there's definitely a need for Israel to start talking about not only what it doesn't want in terms of the future of Gaza but you know what it would countenance on the ground what kind of arrangements it does see moving forward to be able to to maintain stability and Security in that area I think that if they were not doing that it would create a dangerous vacuum that you know that nobody would want to see and you know could end us take us places nobody wants to go I'm sure that those you know those off will take up Factor prominently in Secretary blink's talks when he visits Israel next week now let's take a quick look at personalities here President Biden has been a staunch supporter of Israel as Israel could wish for over the course of his career but can Israel rely on such strong backing from us politicians in the long term president bid remarkable Ally for Israel um you know as you say we were talking earlier but pushing back against calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza right now which have been brought some price to the security Council I mean that would leave over 150 gas hostages Gaza it would leave SAS in power in Gaza you know amid promises that they've made or pledges to repeat the events of October 7th until you know Israel were destroyed so so um you know so that that's been hugely important to Israel I think it's even more extraordinary under the political circumstance given the political circumstances in which we operate I mean President Biden is on the C for in the middle of a 22 a 2024 election campaign um his Israel policy is not all that popular within certain quarters of his party um you know so he had to do this on force of of conscience and on for you know his belief that this is the right thing for the United States um even when there's been push back so you know I don't think that um I don't think Israel can be certain that any successor in his chair would uh you know would maintain the level of support that that Israel has seen from him on a personal level now let's talk about Benjamin Netanyahu he is a divisive figure in Israel to the J judicial reforms are case in point if Israel needs to focus more on National Security in the future than Politics as you have written can it do that with Netanyahu that's a hugely important question um I think that uh you know the unity Unity of purpose that we've seen in Israel during this campaign um is under threat as you say again from sort of partisan winds um judicial reform elements of the reform are back on the table again there were a couple of Supreme Court rulings this week which forced that back into of the frame um we've had disput budgeting priorities with you know sort of patronage issues being fed into the budget at the time when isra was trying to fund an expensive War so you know there are a lot of questions about whether or not Israel is capable of doing that um clearly as long as it does not get a handle on that problem and does not prioritize National Security over these political issues I think that you know it uh it risks undermining the solidarity that will allow for this campaign to continue um I think it would probably also draw into question the sustainability of this government Coalition over time um and you know at a time when you say there's divisiveness in Israel and and you know people will not not be willing to uh to Rally to the flag under circumstances such as those now if we're looking at Israel's uh deep alliance with the US that it still currently has which could of course change depending uh who is at the top there in the US does Israel really have any alternative to this this friendship this support uh with and from the United States sure not really I would argue and and you know the article we referred that I just written last week I think that you know whereas we've seen other parties in the Middle East maybe hedging their Bets with the Russians or with the Chinese I don't I don't think that's really a viable option for Israel um you know Beijing and Moscow have been supportive of Hamas they've been pushing back against you know Israel's priorities in the security Council they certainly would not be delivering the levels of aid which you know Israel has enjoyed has received from the United States that allowed this campaign to continue so I I mean for the time for the time being for the foreseeable future I don't think that you know Israel has another viable option to its alliance with the United States now US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is heading to the Middle East again within the next few hours it's his fourth trip since Hamas launched a large-scale terror attack on Israel DW correspondent Benjamin Alvarez Gruber is in Washington and follows this story for us Benjamin what does blink can hope to achieve this time there will be several stops here but what's more interesting than the countries that he's visiting so he's visiting a lot of allies lot of actors in the region we have Turkey Greece Jordan Qatar United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia of course Israel the West Bank and also Egypt is the fact that he's now going to Lebanon we're just spoking about that the fears that the assassination of the Hamas leader might lead to a broader confrontation so it's interesting that he's not going there today there was a briefing of the state department the spokesperson said that there are several issues on the agenda that they expect also to have tough calls with many of his other counterparts they will speak about how to get more Aid humanitarian Aid into Gaza they will speak about the hostages also what will happen after the war so there will be several talks here on the agenda for because for blinkin also the criticism here in Washington is increasing with more um people saying and more politicians here saying that the US needs to put real red lines and not just putting out statements saying that they are deeply concerned but actually putting more red lines for example for weapons exports for Israel now about the future of the Gaza Strip uh the the state department has harshly criticized the two Israeli ministers uh for calling uh Palestinians to leave Gaza uh do you think that he will reinforce that message that's what the spokesperson said today we had this press release only a few days ago criticizing exactly the statements of the two Israeli ministers that you said the US state department said that there are disagreements between Israel and the United States and also that the US rejected the inflammatory and irresponsible statements from the government so that will be definitely something that they'll talk to with their Israeli counterparts to see how to go further we have to remember that the US is right now bypassing Congress to get weapons to Israel that's something also that is Raising concerns here so he will be sure to press that also with Israel and also with the other partners there but we know that the US is is not happy with the way that this is developing and they will have harsh words with the Israeli counterparts of what the States Department spokesperson said earlier today now blink will also be in the West Bank to talk to the Palestinian Authority what will be his message there he he met Mahmud abas the president of the Palestinian autonomic um of of the Palestinian authorities there he met him in November a they spoke about violence against settlers in the West Bank and also that it's important for them to reassure that the US remains committed to advancing tank double steps for a Palestinian State and that's something that the US has repeatedly said that Gaza is Palestinian will remain Palestinian and that's something that he will need to talk to not only with Israeli politicians but also with Palestinian authorities that you will meet in the West Bank Benjamin Alvar grba there for us in Washington thank you
