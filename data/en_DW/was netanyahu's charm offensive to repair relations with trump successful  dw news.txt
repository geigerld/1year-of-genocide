a very good relationship that is how Donald Trump has described his ties to Benjamin Netanyahu the former president made the remarks after meeting the Israeli Prime Minister at his maralago estate in Florida today Trump has been trying to mend the relationship with Netanyahu which we have to say has soured in recent years he's cast himself as the strongest Ally that Israel could have in the White House ahead of the meeting the former president called for a quick end to the war in Gaza DW's correspondent Janelle Duman has been following developments for us she joins me now from Washington good to see you Janelle so tell me what has come out of this meeting BR so Netanyahu was at maralago for a few hours and since then a readout has been released and in that readout it says that Netanyahu thanked Trump for all that he did for Israel during the Trump Administration including moving the US Embassy to jerus M including ending the Iran nuclear deal and as for Trump's part uh he it said in that readout that he told Netanyahu that he stood in solidarity with Israel following the October 7 attacks and that when he is back in the white house that is how the readout was written when not if when he was back in the white house then he would do all that he could do to bring back peace in the Middle East no word of course on how he's going to do that now Trump really used this occasion to set a contrast between himself and his likely rival camela Harris saying that camela Harris would be so much worse for the Middle East he cannot imagine a Jewish person voting for camela Harris he also said that the vice president's remarks delivered after her own meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu were disrespectful uh now Harris did deliver some forceful remarks saying that Israel had the right to defend itself but it mattered how Israel did that she also condemned the devastation uh raked by the war saying that she would not look away now uh Trump seized upon those remarks to say that he hoped that they would not get in the way of a ceasefire hostage release deal so really what he was trying to do here was to show that the Republican party is the party that is loyal to Israel and the Democratic party and camela Harris are not he wanted to be able to show that he had a good relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu even though in months previous uh he criticized Netanyahu for not anticipating the October 7 attack and we know that the relationship was Rocky even before that he had been angry at Netanyahu ever since Netanyahu called Joe Biden to congratulate him for his 2020 win in the presidential election but all that seems to be in the past now both men ke to show that they can work together now meanwhile Pro Palestine protesters also uh hung around maral Lago they basically followed Netanyahu everywhere he went on on this trip showing just how divisive and uh complicated this issue is for the US ahead of the election and Benjamin Netanyahu he has certainly been making the rounds the last couple of days in the United States what did he get out of his us trip you know I think it would be fair to argue that this uh trip was pretty much a success for Netanyahu he got uh one last photo opportunity with Joe Biden in the Oval Office he got separate meetings with Harris and Trump one of them is likely to become the next president he got standing ovations in Congress and with that he was able to show audiences at home watching in Israel that he still has standing in the US but of course uh he also came to the US with other demands we heard it in his speech to Congress he asked uh the US to FastTrack arms deliveries to Israel saying uh give me the tools and give us the tools and finish the job faster now the White House doesn't look uh inclined to do that or not yet and in that respect he's probably going to have to go home empty-handed uh on that front however uh in terms of what the White House wanted the White House wanted uh some sign that Netanyahu was prepared to fully back the us back ceasefire hostage release deal now the White House has been saying for days that the deal is closer than ever but all n who would say during this visit was that uh he was working on getting the hostages home so that's not really uh the full throated expression of support that the US wanted and in that respect we could say that Netanyahu probably got more out of this visit than the Biden Administration did DW's Janelle Duman with excellent reporting and Analysis tonight from Washington Janelle thank you
