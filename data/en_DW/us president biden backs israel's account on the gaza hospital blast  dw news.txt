his trip is aimed at keeping the conflict from spiraling into a wider regional conflict Biden also reiterated us commitment to Israel after meeting with prime minister n Netanyahu and his War cabinets let's take a listen and I want you to know you're not alone You are not alone as I emphasized earlier we will continue to have Israel's back as you work to defend your people we'll continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is trying to ensure that innocent people are not caught up in the conflict as we proceed on this War Israel will do everything it can to keep civilians out of Harm's Way we have asked them and we'll continue to ask them to move to safer areas we'll continue to work with you Mr President to assure that the minimal requirements are met and we continue to work together to get our hostages out this President the road to Victory will be long and hard but United in purpose and with a deep sense of justice and the unbreakable Spirit of our soldiers and Our People Israel will prevail and the two leaders were speaking after a nighttime blast at a Gaza Hospital gaza's Hamas ran Health Ministry now says 471 people were killed in the explosion which it called an Israeli Massacre Israel says evidence shows a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants is responsible both claims have not been independently confirmed this is where the sick are supposed to be healed instead the Ali Arab Hospital in Gaza City has become the latest casualty in a conflict that's costing so many lives hundreds died in this attack we were just sitting here and suddenly there was an explosion the glass shattered on us many people were killed many of those caught up in the blast were Palestinians who'd been seeking Refuge this place was a safe haven for women and children who fled Israeli shelling near the hospital they saw this place as a refuge for them to feel safe and secure there was no advanced warning before targeting the hospital there were more than 3,000 people here for whom this place was a safe heaven the terrorist group Hamas which rules Gaza blamed Israel for the attack anti-israel protests have been held across the Palestinian territories including in the city of rale in the West Bank no craters these are but the Israeli Army says it has proof the attack was carried out by another Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad and that Israel is being unfairly blamed to it was at the time at 6:59 p.m. when there were reports of an explosion at the alali AL mahani Hospital in Gaza City according to our intelligence Hamas checked the reports and stood it was an Islamic Jihad rocket that had misfired and decided to launch a global media campaign to hide what really happened garans meanwhile are left to pick up the pieces from the night before knowing this conflict is far from over uh the Israeli military says it has confirmed that Islamic Jihad was responsible for the hospital explosion earlier I spoke to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner and asked him how IDF investigators could be so sure so soon after the blast uh well we have uh in launched a extensive highlevel investigation in the immediate aftermath just uh after 7 o'clock yesterday to identify the root causes of this tragedy and it is indeed a human tragedy I can say that we um mobilized intelligence capabilities operational data and aerial footage of Our Own in order to confirm and what we found and what we established was that there first of all was no active IDF airport operations in that area the area of alah Hospital not by air land or sea we identified the the trajectory of the rockets launched from adjacent to the hospital towards Israel many of them crossing over into Israel but one of them ultimately falling inside the Gaza trp on top of the uh uh in in the parking lot of the hospital alah hospital and finally we also our intelligence intercepted a conversation between two Hamas terrorists that were discussing the rocket that Palestinian Islamic Jihad had launched and that it had actually hit the alahi hospital so there are three core compon that we see uh that actually exemplify and and proof that and our proof that uh uh we did not do it you know and also when we're looking in the aftermath of of this um tragedy in the hospital we see that there are no craters um uh the the the damage is very limited not representive of the type of strikes that we are currently conducting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip Lieutenant Colonel Peter lner there from the Israeli Defense Forces speaking to me earlier now Marina Miron is a military expert from the defense studies department at King's College London and she told us who she thinks is most likely responsible for the blast well it is difficult to say who is responsible um honestly I don't know um these things can happen it could have been collateral damage it could have been a misfired rocket and unless we have more evidence and that evidence would include uh examination of the launch site um verification of the evidence provided so far there is no way to tell uh who could have done it it and we have seen that in Ukraine as well where at first it seems very clear and the attribution is very clear but then later on investigations show something else and there needs to be an independent investigation because um this is a catastrophe what has happened and um those responsible need to be identified in terms of strategy um who benefits uh from this incident well in terms of benefits um let's look at uh first at the IDF and definitely for them if if we were to assume it was a premediation strike um it would be very damaging in in political terms and we're seeing the Fallout being right now uh with President Biden visiting the region and now the meeting between um LCC and the Jordanian counterpart and Mahmud abas has been um cancelled due to this so for Israel it would definitely be very very damaging if it was collateral damage then it is a different story and um now looking at the other side for Hamas again um it it might be reasonable for one of the groups operating in Gaza to conduct the strike but then um the question is what effect it has on the civilians and what effect it has on the support of the civilians because at the end of the day also these groups rely on the Civil population in Gaza so in the in in the media space there would be some benefit however in the long term um it would have ramifications for the popularity of these groups in in in that particular area have these groups provided any proof for their claims well as of yet we don't have any proof or any evidence the Palestinian Islamic Jihad um denied the allegations and this is the primary suspect um as we have heard before so we have only um partial evidence disclosed by one side which needs verification um and in order to increase Rel relability of this assessment there needs to be more evidence from multiple sources and of course I can understand that for military reasons it's also um difficult to disclose all the evidence to the Press so that is why I think that an independent investigation should be made and um I think here reason should be taking the driver's seat because right now we're all um emotionally taken by this blast but um you need to get to the core of the problem to see what exactly happened there Marina [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there from the defense studies department at Kings College London thank you very much Marina and Hamas has so far not allowed independent investigators onto the hospital premises I ask DW senior International correspondent funny Fatar in Tel Aviv how difficult it will be to establish an unbiased account of exactly what happened very good question and I really would like to stress that word independent because that's what's really difficult by the way in any war and in any conflict same in this situation to really establish what really has happened in independently for one it's impossible for international journalists or any journalist in fact rather domestically he from Israel International journalist to verify those facts on the ground and the journalists that are inside Gaza Strip are pretty much trapped themselves trying to make sure they they they they protect their families and and get to a safe harbor which is pretty much impossible at this point in Gaza Strip and since there's no access at this point for independent uh organizations or journalists that can would independently verify what happened we basically have two sides of the story one the claim by Israel that it was Islamic Jihad that militant group that cooperates with the Hamas militants that did it and we hear obviously from Gaza Strip their claim that it was Israel in the meantime obviously we have also heard what US President Biden has said he uh was a bit careful in expressing his view by saying it appears he didn't say it is he said it appears for that was the other team hinting by by that that it wasn't Israel but that a lot of people obviously in the region are unsure and this is exactly the Dilemma uh that that also Israel is facing right now as one of the key players here in in this situation that regardless whether their version of the story is true or not and let's assume it may be true who is going to believe them so this level of trust that's being shaken very much in the region is really bringing uh the region to a boiling point right now and it's just completely unclear regardless what the facts are revolving this particular incident what the consequences are going to be from here on now fny just 24 hours ago it looked like a diplomatic window was opening to end the fighting has that window now closed diplomacy is always ongoing in in politics even if it appears that 24 hours later now everything seems to be uh completely uh going out of control one has to underline that even though US President Biden is not going going to meet in person now the head of the Palestinian Authority Mr Abbas or the heads of of of Jordan and Egypt in Aman which was scheduled to take place tomorrow he did uh reiterate that he is in close touch with all leaders here all the stakeholders here making sure that there is no further escalation that the conflict is not widening but this is exactly the question the pure message that may be sent to the World by the fact that President Biden was only be able to talk to Israel's prime minister netan but what's really the message here uh to the region observers do underline however that if there is any possible Breakthrough by the US putting uh uh some influence uh there on on Israel some breakthrough and trying to deliver Aid to uh people in Gaza Strip making sure that that uh closed rougher border crossing reopens and and it can get through that this may uh uh result in some sort of a deescalation also it may be possible that they can somehow influence that this expected ground offensive may not be as big as maybe it has been planned after all it's been delayed now for for many days uh since it was in initially talked about a lot of question marks therefore and it's just unclear how things are going to go on and exactly what the impact of US President Biden's visit is going to have here in Israel and in the region as a whole DW senior International correspondent F in telev for us thank you funny the Carnage at the Gaza Hospital has inflamed emotions in many parts of the world protests erupted across the Middle East and world leaders are calling for accountability there's World Fury over the explosion at the AL early Arab Hospital in gazam protests are taking place in Libya Yemen and Iran among [Music] others our demands are addressed to AR leaders not to the West we don't want half Solutions or half speeches like we condemn we denounce we are asking them to break off relations with the Zionist enemy the Palestinian people did not commit a crime they don't want anything it's their home islamist militant group Hamas claims the hospital was hit by an Israeli air strike Israel says it did not carry out an attack on the hospital it says a rocket it was misfired by another Palestinian group Islamic Jihad a claim that is Now supported by US President Joe Biden he is currently in Israel the point is this that uh um I was deeply saddened and outraged by the U explosion of the hospital in gazi yesterday based on what I've seen in the appear of well it was done by the other team not not you UST solution as the blame game goes on leaders around the world are condemning the blast I am horrified by the hundreds of people killed at alh hospital this same day in Gaza by a strike that I strongly condemned earlier today I call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire there is no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians all facts need to be established and those responsible must be held accountable in this tragic hour we must all redouble our efforts to protect civilians from the fury of this war many people around the world want those civilians to be protected the hospital blast is also spurring demonstrations far from the Middle East including in the United States in Colombia and in the Philippines now let's get more on the reactions to this blast with Amal dib from DW Arabic Amal we we've seen protests around the world after this uh Hospital blast especially of course in Arab countries where would you say their anger is directed since last night we've seen uh popular reactions from across the Arab world multiple uh capitals have witnessed uh an outrage um of people taking on the streets carrying the Palestinian flag so that that should tell us who of course they're supporting and who they're blaming they're blaming Israel for the blast they're holding it responsible not only for the blast but for what's been happening in Gaza for the past um 12 days but also they're taking on um the Western countries in Lebanon we've seen protests in front of the American Embassy and also the French Embassy and that that tells us a lot about how the um um Arab population views the Western support to Israel and the incre as as the violence keeps on increasing in Gaza uh now we have predictably seen a lot of criticism of Israel of course uh was any criticism leveled at Hamas since the beginning um of the latest round of violence we have seen some AR Arab countries condemn the violence against civilians on both sides namely from Egypt from uh UAE from other countries uh they've been vocal about sparing civilians on both sides uh of the conflict uh blame blaming Hamas directly has not been uh the case in the Arab world and that is for various reasons related to uh the Palestinian population that lives in a lot of these uh Arab countries and the support uh they give to that the Palestinian cause and the the many across the Arab world are afraid now about the fate of gazans and the people of Gaza am made this uh blockage and the continued uh routs of violence now you touched upon this Israel Israel's neighbors have um emphatically refused to take in Palestinian refugees why is that two reasons the first reason is a political one Egypt and Jordan the two neighboring countries that could potentially take on U Palestinians Palestinian refugees have a history of Hosting Palestinian refugees uh their political stance is that taking in more refugees from Gaza will mean the end of what they call the Palestinian cause and will kind of liquidate and their own words the Palestinian case and will end the two-state solution that many countries including the US uh have called for the second reason is the security one uh the Egyptian president has been very vocal in talking about how moving uh gazans or any Palestinians toward uh the sa desert will take hamas's problem into Egypt and will create will threaten the relationship between Egypt and Israel and will particularly drag Egypt into the armed conflict now what kind of Aid can the other countries the neighboring countries uh like Jordan and Egypt provide they have been uh sending Aid uh to the to neighboring Egypt uh Egypt has prepared uh lots of Aid uh also Jordan also the UAE uh and Qatar have sent convoys of Aid waiting to enter Gaza uh but as a result of the crossing of the closure of the RAF Crossing which until the moment has there hasn't been any political decision to open it up the aid awaits there and the question remains whether the aid will enter in time to help the people uh of Gaza Amal di there from DW's Arabic service thank you very
