Israel's defense minister has outlined a plan for the Gaza Strip y of Galant says his country has no plans to bring Israeli settlers into Gaza he added that once Hamas is defeated he believes Palestinians would be in charge of the territory Hamas is considered a terrorist group by many countries meanwhile thousands turned out in Beirut for the funeral of the Hamas commander who was assassinated there earlier this week MERS lined the streets of beay rout for the Hamas number two Salah arur killed by an apparent Israeli drone strike Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack but nonetheless aruri is the most senior Hamas leader to be killed since hostilities began on October 7th the assassination has raised fears that the conflict could escalate Israel is even preparing for that possibility staging Army drills in the Golan Heights bordering Lebanon in the North today we had a drill up here up north uh with the armored Core and infantry uh preparing such an event that if we would need to enter such an engagement with kah then we would make sure that uh we would come out on top meanwhile in the West Bank Israeli forces remain in the new Shams refugee camp following overnight raids 29 people were arrested in the operation and the Army says it discovered a large cash of weapons being held at a un run kindergarten inside this loud speaker we found a powerful explosive other cables led to this explosive which was hidden behind a curtain and in Gaza Israel continued its bombardment of the city of Han Yunis the International Red Crescent says its gazen headquarters was damaged by shelling gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry said 16 people were killed in the attacks pushing the number of the Dead up to almost 22 a half thousand since October 7th the Prime Minister told visiting US senator that Israel would stay the course uh we're absolutely committed to achieving our war games that is destroying our war goals destroying Hamas releasing our hostages making sure Gaza doesn't become a threat again and for that we'll apply maximum power with maximum Precision everywhere that's needed US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is about to make another visit to the region in an attempt to lower the temperature it is in no one's interest not Israel's not the regions not the world's for this conflict to spread Beyond Gaza with the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorating the world can only watch and and hope that that doesn't happen let's get more from our correspondent Tanya Kramer who's following events from Jerusalem welcome Tanya uh we'll come to the secretary blinken's visit in a moment first talk us through Israel's post-war plan for Gaza outlined Yesterday by the defense minister yes that's right y galland Israel's defense minister outlined a plan but his office stressed that this is his personal Vision this would have still to be uh passed through uh the smaller War cabinet and through the wider security cabinet to become then an official uh document so y Galan detailed uh what he thinks would be best uh uh to go uh forward uh he said in general that the war will continue until all the Israeli hostages that are remaining in Gaza will be uh released and until uh uh Israel has dismantled all uh governing and military capabilities uh of Hamas but he went also into details saying uh that there will be a phase uh the next stage of the war saying that will be a new uh combat approach uh apparently he means more targeted approach in the north and there he's speaking only about the north because Israel is now focusing also its operations on the south uh in the Gaza Strip mainly and he also talked uh uh without however to say detailing what this new military approach actually entails how it would be different uh from the current approach and he talked about the post-war Gaza plans he said that uh um local Palestinian entities would uh govern the civilian Affairs of Gaza but it's also very uh unspecified who he means uh by that he didn't talk at least about the Palestinian Authority there uh it seems and he also said there would be no civilian presence uh Israelis civilian presence in Gaza yeah let's talk about that no settlers in Gaza after this war ends is that official uh Israeli [Applause] policy no I don't think we can talk about an official Israeli policy yet when it comes to postwar Gaza again uh yuf galad the defense minister outlined that he doesn't see a civilian presence in Gaza uh likely referring uh to uh the possibility uh that Israeli settlers would be resettled there but we have heard from the far uh several far-right ministers in the cabinet mainly the Finance Minister Finance Minister uh betes smich saying that he wants to see uh Israeli settlers uh going back to Gaza Israel had been with settlements in Gaza until up to 2005 and also we heard uh from others uh that they would uh encourage as they put it uh Palestinians to leave basically um to push out Palestinians uh uh from uh Gaza so uh as we looked at this plan from M galland uh it's not a very detailed yet for example we don't see uh whether you know when Palestinians would be allowed to go back to the north where they should go back to many are made homeless and of course there's also the question who will be rebuilt Gaza who will be uh footing the bill for that say okay so and then a brief word then about the visit of the US Secretary of State what can he achieve on this fourth VIs visit to the Middle East since October the 7th well from what we understand uh the US Secretary Anthony blinkin uh for him again also the future of Gaza the postwar Gaza will be certainly also be on the agenda but uh we've seen the US pushing for a less intensive War uh to go into a different phase a more targeted uh approach by the Israeli military and also to call for more Aid going into Gaza and to protect civilians given the high death toll among uh the civilian population and of course the displacement that has been happening there uh in the past three months uh with over 85% of the people having been multiple time displaced according to the United Nations so I think this will be also very high on the agenda thank you for that Tanya Tanya Kramer in
