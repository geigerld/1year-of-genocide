now Israel says Border Police have killed a senior Hamas commander in the occupied West Bank Israeli forces are pressing ahead with a major operation in the Palestinian territory which began 3 days ago as many as 20 people have now been reported dead this is what is left of the city of tulam in the occupied West Bank roads damaged and homes completely destroyed Palestinians are now trying to pick up the pieces is in the wake of destructive Israeli rids the gas canisters and the store exploded and they bombed the whole house including the furniture we started calling the civil defense and people to put out the fire because we didn't want the neighbors and children to get hurt we called people but they all fled the area and many were being arrested Israel says it targeted militants killing a local commander of Islamic Jihad the city of Janine has now become the center of Israeli operations the Israeli police released this footage it claims to show its troops killing a senior leader of Hamas in Janine while he was driving the Israeli military says militant groups in the West Bank have strengthened and conducted roughly 150 attacks against Israeli forces and civilians over the past year in Janine locals say Israeli troops are surrounding the major routs leading into the city the real problems with the children there's no baby milk available and I've got a sick girl at home with a high fever we weren't expecting such things and the ambulance can't even reach us some Palestinians claim civilians are the victims of the Israeli raids Clash is erupted here they hit a young man he was just a young man merely a child what did he do wrong they shot him in the head and his brother is in critical condition in the hospital despite him having done nothing wrong since the October 7 Terror attacks on Israel Israeli rates in the West Bank have increased significantly this is Israel's most intensive and prolonged operation in the West Bank in more than a year nearly 3 million Palestinians live in the occupied territory it's important to remember that the these Israeli raids are taking place in the West Bank rather than Gaza and I asked journalist balik sladin in Tel Aviv why Israel is stepping up these raids well uh over two or even two and a half years isra has been conducting raids against um what they describe as tourist infrastructure in the West Bank but um it all was limited operations only and it didn't reach its goal uh the goal was of course to um try to calm down down any uh Insurgency or any um terrist activities from the West Bank into Israel and of course to stop any possible um attacks against settlers or Israeli military um targets inside the West Bank um something like this apparently wasn't successful and that's what we're seeing right now this uh um different strategy um conducting um total Special Operations uh using thousands of soldiers including uh the special forces that belong to the Israeli police and um try to uh kill as many of these militants as possible they already have finished their operation in t Kim also in the Jordan Valley but the operation in Janine is still continuing even after getting the head of the operations there that uh uh belongs to Hamas they killed him at this morning and uh their again in order to effectively uh try to eliminate any possible front in the West Bank
