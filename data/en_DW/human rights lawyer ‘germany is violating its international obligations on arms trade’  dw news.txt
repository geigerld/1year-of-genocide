Germany is the second most important arm supplier to Israel after the United States the German government distinguishes between classic weapons of war and other defense equipment and it argues that it only supplies defensive weapons to Israel and always checks their use but a human rights organization based in Berlin is calling for a complete stop to the supply of weapons of war to Israel by Germany and has sued the German government in a Berlin Court also in behalf of five Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip Mr Schwartz what exactly do you accuse the federal government of Germany of legally in your lawsuit so we sue the German government to stop the export of German weapons of war to Israel because we have reasonable grounds to believe that with these kind of weapons Israel is committing crimes against civilians in Gaza crimes consisting of war crimes and crimes Against Humanity as recently confirmed by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court and in doing so the German government is violating its International obligations on arms trade and its own National obligations now Nicaragua filed a lawsuit an international lawsuit against Germany earlier this year for supplying arms to Israel and the German representatives there argued that Germany supplies defensive weapons and that their use is being monitored and the icj judges in their decision in May then agreed that military support for Israel by Germany has declined sharply since the beginning of the Gaza war and they also did not order any provisional measures for Germany to stop its weapons exports to Israel so what makes you confident that you will manage to achieve just that so the German representative in the Nicaragua case also mentioned that they delivered anti-tank uh weapons so-called Bazookas and for example these kind of bazookas we have knowledge and we have incidents that these kind of weapons are used in Gaza and as well we have knowledge of ammunition which shall or is being delivered um to Israel which also we have reasonable grounds to believe that this kind of ammunition is used in Gaza actually and therefore is used uh for the commission of war crimes now the Israeli Army leadership of course has repeatedly said that the number of civilians killed in the fight in Gaza is low compared to other battles in urban areas such as the expulsion of the is Islamic State in mosul in Iraq for example and of course international law does also provide for the right of self-defense so what is your objection to Israel that says it is defending itself after the 7th of October terrorist attacks on its territory so we do not challenge Israel right of self-defense Israel has its inherent right of self-defense but the difference we always have to made in international law is the difference between the right to self-defense and to comply with International humanitarian law which are the laws in war finally and we have a lot of incidents that Israel is violating these rules for example and direct attacks on civilian population or the inpr proportional attacks of Civilian objects and civilian population that means we do not challenge self-defense but within self-defense Israel has to respect humanitarian law which from our point of view it does and what kind of evidence do you have that German arms are being used in what you say could be potential war crimes what is the evidence that you're working with so we did and and got a lot of Open Source investigations concerning videos um witness statements photographs um and other documents as well we used um International reports from um the UN from Human Rights Watch and other organizations that really have a huge number of incidents and as well we see online for example on social media we see incidents and evidence um delivered by members of the IDF themselves by showing uh they are um destroying for example um civilian objects and these are acts that presumably can constitute war crims and which German weapons are we talking about here we are talking as already mentioned um of anti-tank uh weapons we are talking of ammunition but we not only talking about these direct weapons of war we are also talking about and deliveries of engines of tanks for example which are delivered from Germany to to Israel okay now your lawsuit refers to the 2% of weapons deliveries that Germany the German government classified as classic weapons of war what about the other 98% yeah the problem really is that German law distinguish between weapons of war and the other parts which means components of weapons of war and so far we only attacked or challenged with our lawsuit this 2% why because we think that these weapons of war are most likely to being used to commit war crimes in Gaza but but now we plan also to file a second lawsuit concerning the other 98% of weapons which um refers to another jurisdiction here in Germany it won't be filed to the federal court in Berlin it will be filed to the administrative Court in Frankfurt and what have you heard from the court in Berlin so far the trial is still pending and we are now awaiting the decision of the Court um and very likely it will be at the beginning um of June we hope um if they will stop these kind of weapons of war there is no other a legal measure required and if they won't stop of course we have to appeal this judgment and we will and what knowledge do you have has Germany continued to supply weapons of War to Israel from our knowledge so far what the German government said during the trial and what they mentioned at the icj um hearings in the Hag from our knowledge so far they do not um deliver any more weapons of war but maybe it's only a question of time until they will do again now should German politicians at some point expect to be held accountable actually it's further a question of international law obligations by the German government by supplying weapons of war to Israel um which are used to commit war crimes this is not a question of international criminal liability of individual persons so what we are doing actually is further relying on International and state responsibility not on individual criminal responsibility this is a question which um refers further to to um direct attacks which are being committed On The Ground by soldiers or by members of the Hamas those persons should be addressed by international criminal law which is also possible to do it in Germany and we've talked about the icj now what about the ICC we know that the chief prosecutor has come forward and um has requested an arrest warrant for Benjamin nany but of course Israel does not recognize the IC so how can potential war crimes in Gaza committed by the netan government be prosecuted under criminal law so it is not required that Israel is a member of the international criminal court for being prosecuted the question is that the crime scene is Gaza and Gaza is part of Palestine and Palestine is a member of the international criminal court and therefore the court has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in the Gaza Strip and that's the reason why it's completely legally and in accordance to the Rome statute that the IC actually can prosecute members of the Israeli government and members of the Hamas organization and now the question is that um every arrest warrants as recently mentioned has to be respected by all the member states of the Rome statute including Germany now but of course the German government has always argued that the security of the Israeli State itself is a very big founding principle essentially of modern-day German foreign politics and there has been a discussion after the chief prosecutor came forward with his request about the question will Germany would Germany then arrest Benyamin Netanyahu if the IC judges actually follow the chief Prosecutor's request what do you think in your experience as a lawyer what will the German government do do you think I would say first of all um as a state being governed by the rule of law of course the legal situation is quite clear Germany is obliged to respect the Rome statute which is is it's member of and therefore it has to really respect every arrest warrant which is filed by the international criminal court I think that does not conflict with the so-called State Doctrine um because State Doctrine is a political concept and here we are talking of legal Concepts and I think the most important is to respect the rule of law and to respect the promise in this law and in our Constitution and we are we have an international law friendly constitution in Germany and this means that we can't override these rules by political Concepts like the state Doctrine I think this is what counts actually Alexander Schwartz thank you very much pleasure
