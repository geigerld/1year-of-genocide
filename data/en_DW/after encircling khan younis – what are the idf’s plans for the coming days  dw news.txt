Israel says Tuesday have seen the fiercest fighting since the war in Gaza began almost two months ago Israeli forces say that they've surrounded the city of Han Yunis in southern Gaza the military says that it is targeting Hamas which is classified as a terrorist group by many countries Israel has told hundreds of thousands of civilians to evacuate the area around hunis and to head towards the Mediterranean Coast or further south towards the border with Egypt the world health organizations says that the situation in Gaza is getting worse by the hour 10 cities are now a common sight in K yunes many Palestinians set up camp in the city after fleeing Israeli air strikes in Northern Gaza but being here hasn't been safe either and it's getting worse it's even difficult for people to speak safely to reporters [Music] mogs oh God all the Arab world is looking on and cannot stop the Bloodshed what have they done why are they being killed what crime did they commit to die this death Israel's military has released footage that it says shows its Fighters pushing deeper into Southern Gaza 60 days since the beginning of the war our forces are surrounding Khan Yunis in southern Gaza we are operating with professionalism clearing the population ahead of time from the combat areas gazin have been told to move further south to Rafa what a wait beats them there is more tense cities and a long queue to get drinking water we're talking about the only desalination plant in Rafa that is providing inhabitants with clean water it's powered by solar energy and we're in winter so if that stops we will not be able to provide people with any water the United Nations says more than 80% of gaza's population have been driven from their homes and space on this small coastal strip is running out many simply don't know where they can find Refuge all right I want to pull in now journalist Sammy CLE he's standing by force in Jerusalem Samy Israeli forces say that they have been engaged in the heaviest fighting that they have seen since the start of this conflict what do we know exactly about the details of this fighting today well we're talking about the two areas both in the south of the Gaza STP but also in the area of the Gaza City Israel has moved to operate in the South but it still doesn't have full control over Gaza City and its area there have been heavy fighting in jabalia which is a refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip on the outskirts of the city of Gaza and there's been heavy fighting in Shia which is just east of the city of Gaza then of course in we have forces that are now inside the city of kanun and on top of the ground troops we have seen again more air strikes again striking both what we call military targets but also residential areas where IDF says there might be Hamas operatives so what do we know then about the the strategy that the IDF has planned for the the near future and I want to ask you about a report that says that the military may be planning to flood the extensive tunnel Network that Hamas has constructed underneath Gaza well prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh was asked precisely this question in a press conference today and he said that he's not going to give details on operative steps and he was also addressed by the same issue while meeting today with families of hostages but also hostages who were released from Gaza and they had a meeting together with the Prime Minister and the war cabinet and there they said that they're hearing that they're going to flood these tunnels and that their relatives and their family members are inside these tunnels and they were very concerned not only about plans to to flood the tunnels but also the bombing in Gaza they some of them were saying that Israel should stop the bombing some were saying that we were bombed when we were in Gaza and we were fearing more of the Israeli bombing than of Hamas in these words it was a very tense meeting I can tell you yeah and speaking of the hostages Hamas has said that there will be no negotiations or exchange of detainees until Israel's military operation in Gaza stops has there been a reaction from Israeli authorities to that it sounds like based on what you're saying is you're getting pressure not only from Hamas but also from the families of hostages all of this on the Israeli military in government there was a very tense meeting members of the families and those who were hostage were saying that any day that passes puts their uh family is in danger they were saying that there's a shortage of food that their men are being treated badly there that there is a fear that there's not good intelligence they were also saying that they also have doubts about the collapse of the ceasefire Nan said that it was hamas's fault but there was one captive who was saying no it's not true so there was a heated debate at the end many were saying that they don't believe that Netanyahu is actually committed to the U release of the hostages others had a different position uh but I can tell you that nany's message was that the first release was not as a result of these talks but rather a result of the military pressure and therefore Israel now has to continue its military pressure on Hamas and then Hamas will surrender and hand over the prisoners or the captives that are held by Hamas in the Gaza straet only time will tell Sammy Soo reporting tonight from Jerusalem Sammy as always thank you I asked Christian Lin Meer of the World Health Organization what the encirclement of the city of hunis what it means for civilians there thanks for having me well this is just another step in their nightmare um as your report already said people have been sometimes two or three times already relocating from the very north of Gaza to the to Gaza City from Gaza City Duan unit always being promised a safe place a safe route um have been bombed on shell on the road um then hunis was the safe space for a while now hunis is surrounded moving or asking people to move further south and where to then but in kanun this means that the last big place with big hospitals uh with with three partially or in total the whole South with 12 partially functioning hospitals and the only big remaining hospitals two of them Al NASA and the European hospital um are now having the same fate coming up as we had for the famous alifa and other hospitals in the north meaning being put out of service um either by being shelled and bombed or by not having access to any material anymore that means the people who are already distressed and wounded and displaced and in fear have no single spot to go to anymore to find any support any relief or any help one of your colleagues in Rafa says that the situation in the Gaza Strip is approaching Humanities and I'm quoting here Darkest Hour um what more can you tell us about that I mean can you can you say that's true look we have 2.4 million people in Gaza uh about two-thirds of them are descendants from the from the refugees that were pushed out of Israel already what now 70 years ago um so they are being displaced and displaced and displaced and they're being told find a safe spot they're even told where they can find the safe spot um and then they're being bombed in shelters in schools in hospitals uh that's already more than you can imagine and something you have to that scale seen anywhere around now they're being pushed to another sa so-called safe area with with a diseas is looming because in a cramped uh situation with no hygiene anymore completely pressed together people wounded people with regular diseases um not having any support anymore not no no possibility to go anymore anywhere anymore because the southern border is the Egyptian border where they can't apart from a few evacuations can't really cross the other part is the is the seaside and the eastern part is is Israel no places to go to so how how densely do you want to press them together you want to press them on the sides of a football field somebody compared the size they should locate to now to to the size double the size of to the size of uh Heathrow Airport London heo Airport just imagine 2.4 million people in the size of uh Heath airport yes that is a humanitarian catastrophe to the scale which I think all of us that work in humanitarian area have have barely seen and and can we say they they are being told to go to these safe zones after that though there is nowhere else to go I mean the pressure will be on then what for Egypt to open its Gates right well this is ex exactly the point I mean we're very soon now having the the second anniversary the month anniversary the second month anniversary of this of the disaster of the first of course the cruel attacks and the absolute crazy horrific attacks by by Hamas onto Israel but already for the first anniversary on 7 November we warned uh that the attacks of of uh of Israel in Gaza leave no safe space it's an attack not only against Hamas it's a attack against the population there is no space and safe space in G Gaza and the last four weeks have just proven exactly that there is not a single safe space in Gaza people have been bombed in places and areas that were literally designated as safe spots colleagues have been have been killed on the ground colleagues have been killed in schools um everywhere ambulances attacked so yes there is no place to go unless they would all push them into the sea or across Israel or across to Egypt none of this really seems to be an option although I'm I'm not the military strategist here Christian linm with the World Health Organization we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank
