the fighting and the suffering goes on in the Gaza Strip with intensifying gun battles reported in the city of hunas in the past few hours this comes after Israel launched missile strikes against the southern baffa area where hundreds of thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks Israel launched its offensive against Hamas after it committed Terror attacks on October 7 entire buildings reduced to Rubble in Rafa many civilians were killed in the strike despite the city's designation as a safe Zone by Israel a Survivor pulled from the rubble Mourns her younger sister and says she narrowly escaped death herself a wall collapsed towards me there was maybe just an inch left between me and the wall I held it there it was so heavy I started screaming for help hoping someone anyone could hear me after being freed from the rubble another Palestinian woman is taken to al- NASA hospital where she consoles surviving family members wrapped in white are the bodies of her two grandchildren we were sleeping safely in our home those are kids kids in us women there was no one else my two grandkids were killed Amir here she was just 2 weeks old her birth wasn't even registered yet she doesn't even have a birth certificate Palestinians here say they are left to deal with the insufferable pain of loss alone and we can now talk to Ahmed bam of the Norwegian Refugee Council he joins us from the Jordan Capital Aman I'd like to start by getting your reaction to the reports that both Israel and Hamas are open to another humanitarian pause in Gaza good morning thanks for having me um I mean in simple words it's not good enough it doesn't it doesn't really the sustainable ceasefire we have we're not saying we're opposed to this we're saying we're opposed to shortterm um pauses that would only go U you know bring people back uh to a wave of violence and what we are seeing on the ground tells us that we need a ceasefire that lasts not days but really forever what you know the the I mean I was watching your report and this this baby that will you know these babies that have to be registered as dead before they are registered as born I mean it's heartbreaking what's happening and and and as if suffering hasn't um hasn't you know um taken enough toll on on the people what we need is a very serious negotiation for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza uh according to the UN roughly 2 million gazans have been displaced by the fighting and much of the strip produced to Rubble the infrastructures in Ruins water food fuel are scarce how are Garin going to get through winter without a pause in the fighting because it doesn't look like we're going to get long term one at the moment yeah that's a good question winter that that you know no one is talking about and obviously there's little space to to be worrying about cold weather when you have you know um bullets and and shelling from from the air from the sea from the land the clashes that are intensifying grafa which you reported on is the southern most area it's not exempt from uh from the air strikes and from the attacks people are spending their days and nights on the streets my colleagues even have now installed tents and um you know they have lost their homes they have had to relocate their families some of them three or four times one of my colleagues has had you know his brother was killed in one of the air strikes he didn't have even time to mourn because to mourn his brother because he all he can worry about is taking his children to safety giving them a safe shelter if that is even you know a word that that means anything in Gaza anymore and bring them get them the bread get them the the food one of my colleagues say if you can find some tinned food that you know that is luck that is an achievement winter is going to simply be probably one of the worst seasons and now probably one of the worst really one of the worst Winters that Gaza even you know with its standards and you know all the history that it has seen this is by miles is going to to be the worst winter on record in Gaza the US has increased pressure on Israel to scale back its War there have you or your team seen any signs that that's in fact happening not really I mean f first of all we we're hardly getting um a word in from from our teams because communication has been lost for six or seven days now and all we do is is get a check in that you know everyone is is alive really and everyone has woken up this morning morning um you know they they are all intact and you know um you know their tent is intact their um shelter is intact all we hear about is is making sure um that everyone is is safe we're not seeing scaling back I wouldn't say we haven't um observed much of that um again as you reported Rafa which is designated as a safe area has been sheld hunas very overcrowded there um is also um you you know under under bombardment um I think if we are going to be taken this seriously in any way we need um all powers that are behind and and the allies of both sides and powers that are backing all sides to come together and put the pressure switch the pressure on and you know avert a probably an a humanitarian catastrophe that the people of G will never recover from if we let them go through what they are going through this winter um what we need again is everyone to get back to the negotiating table and exert every pressure they can so that um Israel and the AR armed groups in uh in Gaza can AG to ceasefire release all hostages left the siege and of course open uh corridors and open the eight Crossings for eight to come in the details there from Ahmed bam of the Norwegian refugee Council thanks for being on DW news thank you the head of Hamas is hania will be in Egypt today to discuss the possibility of another ceasefire in Gaza to allow humanitarian Aid to enter the strip Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by several countries this comes as Israel's president says his country would consider a pause in the fighting in exchange for the release of more hostages large scale protests have been held daily in Israel calling on the government to secure the release of the 129 citizens they say are being held by hummus there is also growing International pressure on Israel to Halt its attacks in Gaza as the humanitarian situation there worsts I asked DW correspondent Rebeca RS if a new ceasefire is really likely well that's right and that you know may be surprising because both sides were staunchly saying that they weren't going to come back to the negotiating table we are hearing as you just reported president Herzog uh Israel's president saying that that Israel is willing and ready to come back to the negotiating table uh we've seen Benjamin Netanyahu meet with some of the families of the hostages and again reiterating that it is a priority uh to get those hostages out that they are taking heed they are listening and that they are working as hard as they can to make moves towards that he's under immense pressure to see some movement on the hostages uh but it's the other side have been saying Hamas have been saying that they're not willing to come to the negotiating table but we're also seeing movement on that isma hania the the political head Qatar based political head of Hamas is is reportedly going to uh Egypt today now Egypt and Qatar have both played a very big role in the negotiations and he'll be meeting with negotiators there uh and and other people members um from the Egyptian team to discuss coming back to the negotiating table we have been hearing that Israel would be willing to perhaps uh stop hostilities for up to 2 weeks to see the release of some you know we're rumored to hear about 30 hostages of course all of these details are kept very very secret very under wraps so we've seen in the past before the last deal that that saw more than a 100 hostages release that they went up and down up and down they broke down uh they came back to the table it took it took a number of weeks to get a deal and so we could certainly seeing signs in the right direction Ben but it could be sometime yet before we see a deal come to pass and Rebecca all the while you've got the UN Security Council wrangling over a resolution uh calling for a truce even if it were to pass would Israel listen yeah well as you just reported that vote has been delayed we are expecting it today it was expected on Monday then Tuesday then Wednesday in order to try to get the language to some somewhere where the US would not use its veto power where it might be able to at least abstain from that vote uh remains to be seen whether or not that will happen today but whether or not Israel will heed that warning it's certainly not looking likely they're under pressure Israel has been under pressure even from the US who've uh sent many dignitaries here and and politicians here to to try to persuade Israel to move to it the next phase as they call it of fighting a less intense more targeted phase to try to bring down those civilian casualties but that's not something we're seeing in fact defense minister yav Galant saying that they're going to expand the ground operations so even if that vote is successful today in the UN Security Council we may not see any moves from Israel in that that direction Rebecca ridders for us in
