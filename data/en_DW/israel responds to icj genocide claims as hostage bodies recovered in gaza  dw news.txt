Israel's military says that it has found the bodies of three Israeli hostages in Gaza among them the German Israeli Shaunie luk her body was seen in the back of a pickup truck in videos from the October 7th terrorist attack she was later declared dead after skull fragments were found a military spokesman said that the three hostages that they were killed by Hamas at the Nova music festival and then their body were taken across the border into Gaza here's more now from the Israeli spokesman earlier today they were celebrating life in the Nova music festival and they were murdered by Kamas their bodies were transferred to Medical Professional for forensic examination and identification after the procedure was completed we notified their families our hearts go out to them tww special correspondent Aya Ibrahim in Jerusalem has more so we know that uh their remains were recovered in an overnight operation that's according to the Israeli uh military spokesperson Daniel hagari who we've also just heard uh uh from Shany Luke as you mentioned a dual Israeli uh German uh National um she had been presumed dead for a while now uh as as as the Israeli military had previously found a part of her skull that was identified uh but the other two a young woman in her late 20s and a a man in his early 50s there hadn't really been any signs of life from them since they were taken on October 7th so of course there was some hope that they might be exchanged uh in a deal with Hamas that they might be released or might be found it's a devastating devastating news news for the families of the hostages of course but really for the entire uh country this news coming uh this uh uh uh Shabbat afternoon as every as as life here in Israel winds down for the day of rest we've also heard for the from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu I'm just going to read to you the statement that they just put out he said this terrible loss is heartbreaking and that him and his wife Sarah are grieving um he also said that they that we will return all of our hostages the living and the deceased alike this is likely to cause more anger tomorrow uh in the weekly protests that have been taking place calling on the Israeli government to reach a deal uh to return the hostages alive to their loved ones and with this news this is likely uh to cause a lot of anger uh tomorrow here in Israel yeah definitely the news that people in Israel did not want to hear this Friday our special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem tonight ya thank you Israel has rejected accusations that it is committing genocide in Gaza it wrapped up its defense today at the international court of justice in the hay South Africa has asked the top un Court to order Israel to stop its offensive in Rafa now this hearing this week is part of a broader case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza which Israel has repeatedly denied Israel calls the case a distortion of reality lawyers representing South Africa made a series of allegations on Thursday including accusing Israel of withholding humanitarian Aid Israel has denied doing that as well would not delayed well for more I'm joined Now by Michael link he is the former un special reporter on human rights in the Palestinian territory he's also an associate professor of law at the University of Western Ontario in London Ontario Canada Professor it's good to see you again I I know you've been following what's going on in in the Court South Africa and Israel they've now presented their signs in your professional opinion which side delivered the most convincing argument well well uh probably a a good answer to uh to your question is who which side presented more independent expert um uh evidence with respect to what they were claiming South Africa and on Thursday made arguments uh that Israel's uh genocide was continuing that more stronger provisional measures were needed and it relied upon um I guess statements made by un uh leaders and by um International Aid organizations that were that have been involved in trying to get Aid into Gaza and their pronouncements have been that there's a famine that's already broken out in the north of Gaza where there is somewhere between three and 400,000 Palestinians and that Aid was very difficult to get Aid into the south of G of where 1.7 or 1.8 million Palestinians are are huddled um Israel in its arguments today uh asserted that it was making remarkable efforts to improve Aid delivery into Gaza but it couldn't site and didn't site any of the UN statements or any of the international organization statements and that's the kind of evidence that the court wants to hear that there are reliable sources or coming from particularly at the icj coming from the United Nations uh to be able to make a finding with respect to that uh South Africa had that kind of evidence Israel did not so let's take this into the next step the the judges will now deliberate on the request from South Africa they're expected to issue a decision in the next few weeks um let's assume they rule in favor of South Africa that they Grant this request um Can the icj really prevent any further Israeli military action in Gaza I mean is there any teeth to what the Court decides well yes and no yes the the um provisional measures that the court would wind up ordering um are legally binding on on all parties um uh to the issue in front of them at the court but you're absolutely right um the the icj has no police it has no Army it has no ability to issue warrants it would be Reliant upon the um un Security Council and we know that Israel has a strong alliance with the United States which has already issued five vetos uh since the War Began in October um in defense of uh of Israel and even the one resolution which at the security Council which the United States allowed to go through calling for a ceasefire during the weeks of Ramadan um Israel did not obey that uh that resolution and the United States and the security Council took no steps to to enforce it um but I should say that uh if the court does issue and a provisional order demanding an immediate uh ceasefire mean that would be a tremendous symbolic uh loss to uh to Israel it would further sink I think it's it's already faltering International reputation um in the International Community uh regarding how it's conducted this war so it has a certain symbolic importance even if it can't be enforced militarily or politically and is that the power of of the court especially in this case because Israel has made it clear it is it's not planning to stop it's offensive in Rafa anytime soon so is it the symbolic meaning here that the world will be remembering well I think it will be I mean I'm when I think this war is finally over and we begin to look at who are the winners and losers even if Israel is U victoriously victorious militarily in terms of decapitating Hamas politic or militarily its reputation will have taken a significant blow I think given the utter destruction that's occurred in uh in Gaza and the huge loss of of uh of human life remember Israel had an enormous amount of sympathy on its side in the first days and weeks after the uh terror attack on October 7th but that all that has dissipated and more and it can really um it is very hard to think of that those few handful of countries who are still standing beside Israel after s months of this war Professor Michael link we appreciate your time and your valuable analysis tonight thank you thank you very much for having me
