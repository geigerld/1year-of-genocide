well Hamas militants abducted nearly 200 people after they carried out their Massacre last week the mother of one French Israeli hostage has pleaded for her daughter's release I didn't know if she's dead or alive until yesterday all I knew is that she's May might be kidnapped um I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home she only went to a party to a festival party to have some fun and now she's in Gaza well our correspondent Rebeca rers is near the Israeli city of the rod not far from the border with Gaza Rebecca how can Israel ensure the safety of these hostages in Gaza while bombing the territory Ben I think the short answer to that is that they simply can't they can't Ensure sure that the civilians are going to be okay as they continue on this campaign uh but they you know definitely are giving every indication they're telling us that that is one of their main priorities is to try to ensure uh that those hostages will be able to be brought out alive the ones who are alive Hamas has said that some a couple of dozen around about 20 have been killed so far in strikes there's simply no way to confirm that we did see the first host video yesterday as you just mentioned we just heard from the mother there of a young woman who has been taken now in the video she is alive she's uh being been uh medically treated by somebody who we cannot see in the video and she pleased to be uh let go to be able to to re be reunited with her family uh so if that's any indication you know we we think that Hamas going from previous hostage taking taking that the hostages for them are are more worthwhile alive rather than dead so perhaps they will be trying to keep the hostages alive as of as when in terms of the military the Israeli military as they continue on their attack they are trying to get of course Cate as much information as they can on the whereabouts of the hostages but indiscriminate or targeted even targeted attacks cannot guarantee their safety and what about all the gazen Ians who are on the move at the moment um can we expect any sort of message from Biden when he arrives in Israel tomorrow I think most certainly that will be uh a very high priority on his agenda when he's here making sure that uh at least juel Nationals that that border that rafha Crossing will be able to be opened up I think that's something that he'll be working very hard towards to try and get at least some people who have managed to get on some lists through that cross uh of course the in going the other way trying to get humanitarian relief inside of Gaza is another top priority but another huge priority of his visit will of course be trying to deescalate this from spilling into a wider regional conflict a show of support with Israel and a warning to other actors uh in the region uh namely Hezbollah and Iran to the northern border in Lebanon where hezb have been conducting some cross fire uh some cross some tit fortat attacks with the Israeli military in the north Biden is going to be trying to prevent that from escalating as best he can uh while he's here and urging the Israelis uh restraint on that side as well uh so definitely a very important visit from the US president and uh you know a very very big agenda okay we'll have to leave it there Rebecca R's reporting from the Garen border
