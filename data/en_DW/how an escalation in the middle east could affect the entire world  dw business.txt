before Russia's invasion of Ukraine there was relatively little public awareness of how much the world relied on Ukraine for the supply of grain or how much Europe depended on Russia for its energy Supply now as the devastating conflict continues to unfold in the Middle East some are beginning to wonder what the bigger economic ramifications might be especially when it comes to the global supply of oil which could be affected if Iran were to become more embroiled in the conflict the region is also a key shift route with disruption to key waterways like the sez canal and the straight of hermus potentially causing delays in deliveries and earlier I spoke to CM jety Chief Economist at ING I asked him what a possible escalation involving Iran could mean for the global supply of oil indeed I think this is where this conflict will have bigger repercussions for the rest of the world so just looking at trade is is very naive um but oil is an extremely important one we saw already when when the uh the terroristic attacks on Israel started that the oil prices started to search um if Iran one way or the other was to be involved in this conflict Iran being an important producer of oil if the entire Middle East would somehow or one way or the other be involved in this conflict with as a result um maybe even sanctions coming from the US on Iran on other countries this would then clearly have a big impact on on oil producing countries therefore we would see oil prices going up if this is this conflict was to escalate we could really see oil prices going above $100 per barrel very easily yeah and this region is also a key passageway for shipping what would a disruption to those routes mean for the global economy indeed we see especially the the street of homeless which is a very important one not only for oil Transportation but in general for for transportation um this would then have an impact again especially on oil prices adding to the upward pressure on oil prices and I think that is the bottom line here so one is we we don't know anything I think that's also what all the other conflicts geopolitical tensions over the last couple of years have shown us it is impossible to really tell anyone what the direct impact or the explicit impant on growth will be but what we do know is um that there will be especially when the the entire region would be involved in this conflict there would be a big impact on oil prices there would be an impact on um at least transportation and that um this idea that that oil prices could go back to 70 or $80 per barrel uh would be something of the past and that we then would have to be prepared for another oil price crisis How likely do you think such a scenario is in all honesty I wouldn't dare currently making predictions of How likely such a scenario is I think what what is important is that we know now from whether whether the pandemic the war in Ukraine that also these unexpected events can have huge repercussions can have a huge impact on on the global economy I think it's Al that we're now in this in this era of of overlapping emergencies um also makes that uncertainty economic sentiment uh could could weaken further and um so therefore I would not come up with a prediction How likely such a scenari is but the last years have really clearly taught us that it's always good to come up with scenarios the base case scenario is one in which the conflict will not further escalate and we will not get the entire region being involved in this conflict but clearly um one of the the risk scenarios is one with a further escalation and also then as a consequence much higher oil prices you mentioned the geopolitical ramifications because of course this conflict isn't only affecting relations between countries in the Middle East it could also shape public opinion ahead of next year's us elections what is your take on the potential long-term consequences I think one consequence is something we're already witnessing in in Europe um that this conflict could be imported to Continental Europe maybe also to the US why because we will see that this conflict um could lead to some terrorist attacks as we saw already in Brussels as we saw in other European countries so that there will be more this conflict um coming to Europe coming to the US what this means is clearly more uncertainty um more uncertainty which will wa way on on economic sentiment but also uncertainty that could make it easier for for for populist parties for for populist politicians to come up with with easy answers so it's hard to tell what this now really will mean for the presidential election in the US um I think what it will mean is we will have even more polarized um debates not only in the US but also in Europe and and I hope that we will clearly see also more support now for the Western World still coming out of the US coming out of Europe um because the risk clearly is that um such a conflict that we're currently seeing will have bigger repercussions um if it is exported to Europe and to the US do you think governments should be taking any specific measures to prepare for potential economic turmoil I think government governs have been of course in this emergency fighting mode already for a couple of years right now it is very hard to prepare what government should be prepared to do this um that they should not be hesitant to use fiscal stimulus to use any kind of support measures to cushion a potential downfall of of the economy I think that is something that every government should have learned over the last couple of years be prepared uh that there will be more yeah more fluctuation we are living in a more volatile environment so which will also mean more at hoc more prompter um fiscal policy action in order to to cushion the impact from these geop potential geopolitical events on the economies all this volatility of course leads to a whole lot of anxiety we've recently seen a rise in the price of gold as people seek safe places for their money tell me about the role that fear plays here fear plays an enormous important fear plays an enormously important role uh it is that that that all people we all of us you and me included so we're now coming out of a period of of pandemic of supply chain frictions of war in Ukraine which is still going on now we have another conflict in the Middle East with potentially um an impact and and repercussions on on the rest of the world so this is clearly now you know adding to all the fears that that that people are having and uh and it is more as a human reaction to try to find some kind of Safe Haven I even forgot to add the entire discussion about climate change that we're having so this is um really an enormous uncertain environment for all people for all governments for all policy makers and it's a normal reaction then to you know go into safe havens like gold like um government bonds we also know and I think that is the the horrible thing about financial markets that financial markets love to then move on and and forgot forget about the the ongoing conflicts um which could mean that in a couple of weeks in a couple of months from now we will see again more risk-taking behavior um but um in in in general I think we will have to accept that we're living in a more volatile not only political but also economic environment kasm sheski Chief Economist at in thank you very much you're
