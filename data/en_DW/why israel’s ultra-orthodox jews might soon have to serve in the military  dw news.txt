ever since the founding of Israel in 1948 Ultra Orthodox Jews have been exempt from the military draft so they can devote themselves to religious study when first introduced the policy only applied to 400 students today that number has swelled to 66,000 young men a fighting age who the Army couldn't call on for its war in Gaza but last month Israel's Top Court effectively lifted that exemption triggering huge protests from the Orthodox Community now the government under Benjamin Netanyahu has until the end of April to agree a new conscription plan but the negotiations are especially fraught as his Coalition includes two ultra Orthodox parties DW's amian aif reports on the political uproar that is the latest threat to Israel's wartime government the ultra Orthodox life is a deeply religious one their calling is to pray and to study the Torah many of the men brought their holy books with them to this protest picket signs here say they'd rather die than abandon their Traditions those Traditions have so far spared them from serving in the Israeli Armed Forces all other Israeli Jewish men are supposed to serve at least 32 months and women 24 and most think the ultra Orthodox should do the same now but the men here who call themselves heredi or fromma people don't even see themselves as Israeli nobody here is going to go to army they want to go to jail and they're not going to go to the Army are you against uh the war in Gaza right now it's not it's not the issue here no it's not the issue it's not no not not the issue so you don't have a you don't have an opinion on it's not it's not it's not it's not the issue they want us for years to make the Israelis they want us to they see that the former people want they getting growing and they want us to be like them and we want to be live like our life that we lived for many years for hundreds and years and we're not going to be going to the Army heri Jews see Israel as a secular country which they say is in violation of the Torah and therefore has no authority over them the Jew is not allowed to enter Israel and make a state until the Messiah comes which we waiting for him and and that's what they did 80 years ago we're stuck with it with all the problems that come with it the protest began with prayers but soon the younger men marched toward the nearby military recruitment office a somewhat mismatch standoff ensues the ultra Orthodox are not [Music] pacifists things are heating up here at the protest in front of the IDF recruiting headquarters uh things were peaceful at the beginning but especially the young people have come out uh to show their anger that they might have to be drafted and might have to join the IDF to fight in Gaza prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu relies on Ultra Orthodox parties to keep his ruling Coalition together opposition parties like yesha say they should no longer get special treatment the ultra Orthodox Community only makes up 133% of the population and they're reluctant to fight and a reluctant Soldier is not always a good soldier so is it really in Israel's National interest um to draft them into the military of course now that we are at War and the situation is very complex we we've seen this week what happened with Iran we need more soldiers this is a necessity it's not you know something that is nice to have it's a necessity we need people to serve in the Army and it's the right and moral thing to do so I'm sure if we sit down at the table we can reach some sort of understandings in how to enlist these people because it's very very important and it's also a part of being an Israeli despite the regional conflict developing around them life here in the ultra Orthodox neighborhood of Jerusalem seems to go on undisturbed they're determined to keep it that way now Rebecca these protests add to the domestic pressure Weighing on prime minister Netanyahu give us a sense of the headwinds he's facing within Israel right now well that's right Nicole I mean he's really coming under a lot of pressure the Coalition is under a lot of pressure from so many sides you've got you know the hostage families who are criticizing his handling of the ceasefire talks uh you've got plummeting of popularity ratings uh and then this is another really um important issue domestically and something that could really threaten uh the makeup of his Coalition you've got more Centrist secular certainly uh Centrist or Cent right parties and politicians saying that they won't stand by um a continuation of allowing the herid men the ultra Orthodox to be Exempted from the military this has really come of course to aead at a time when the Gaza war is Raging and Israel is calling up more reservists and therefore putting more pressure on the fact that the ultra Orthodox you know in the minds of of critics you know are not pulling their weight when it comes to the military but then of course you have the other side uh in the Coalition that's the ultra Orthodox parties and those members saying that they just will not stay in a coalition that allows this uh to allows Ultra orthodox to um go pushes them into the military I should say so definitely something that could uh threaten Benjamin netanyahu's Coalition that adds to International pressure Netanyahu has been meeting with European diplomats whove urged restraint in the response to Iran's weekend attacks how's you responded to the Diplomatic push there briefly if you can yeah we are seeing uh some diplomatic pressure going through we've been hearing reports that strong diplomatic pressure from the the US actually shelved plans that the Israelis had in place to uh conduct another Counterattack uh on Iran and that has been they have pulled back and they are now waiting to see exactly how they'll proceed so we are seeing that that pressure from the US and from other allies is taking an effect though Israel Still Standing its ground saying it will make the decision when it will attack that it definitely will and of course the nature of when and just how it will happen is still uh unknown to pretty much everyone that was our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem always great speaking to you thank you so much
