the UN agency helping refugees in Gaza says it will have to Halt its operations there unless more fuel is delivered it says its supplies will run out later today Israel's military is refusing to allow fuel into Gaza accusing the militant group Hamas which runs the territory of hoarding supplies Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza after hamas's terrorist attack on October 7th only limited supplies of food water and Medicine have been allowed in the fuel shortage is hindering emergency services that are already stretched to the Limit The Blood Stained wreckage of an ambulance in Gaza it was destroyed by the blast for an Israeli air strike but it will serve one last purpose we're running out of fuel so we have been taking petrol and Diesel from the damaged ambulances and using it to fuel the ones that are working but without fuel many fear Emergency Services could grind to a [Music] halt more important than anything else is fuel so far fuel has not been allowed into the strip fuel is extremely urgent because without fuel the trucks themselves cannot uh move without fuel the generators cannot produce electricity for hospitals for bakeries and for the water desalination plants only a trickle of Aid has been allowed into Gaza with Israel consistently barring fuel concerned that it will be used in hamas's operations aside from the air strikes Israel has imposed a complete blockade on the Strip following hamas's terrorist attacks on October the 7th but Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is seeking international support for a ceasefire and the opening of a humanitarian Corridor we demand a complete ceasefire and the opening of permanent corridors for humanitarian relief the entry of medicine and food and the provision of water electricity Fuel and other basic needs with more and more ambulances destroyed and fuel running out gaz's Emergency Services could soon be forced to shut down at a time when their work is more important than ever let's bring in DW's Tanya Kramer here she's in Jerusalem Tanya the lack of fuel in Gaza is making an already desperate humanitarian situation even worse has anyone suggested ideas on how fuel could be allowed in exclusively for humanitarian use without it falling into the hands of Hamas militants um not so far because the Israeli government has refused to allow fuel in they're saying as you said in the as we heard in this report also that um they don't out of the concern that it would end up in the hands of Hamas they also claim that Hamas still has reserves of fuel in uh Gaza now it's hard to tell also what's going on behind uh the scenes when it comes to the uh hostage talks that are held in Gaza because there were some indication that that might be also related what is going in and out uh of Gaza these mediations are done indirectly by Qatar in Egypt now um the Rafa crossing the so Crossing that works um might be then you know used also as a tool what comes in and out that has been heavily criticized of course by human rights and humanitarian Aid organizations there's also pressure in Israel by the far right and also by some of the hostage families not all that no humanitarian Aid uh should go in but uh un uh agencies and uh uh other human uh humanitarian agencies say that there are mechanisms to allow fuel in so this is still at a dispute right now there's huge International pressure on the Israeli government Tanya to ease the humanitarian situation in Gaza what impact is that pressure having on Israel well so far we don't see uh anything changing because what we're seeing is that Aid is slowly trickling in there only uh dozens of trucks that have entered uh the Gaza Strip which has been totally uh closed off from any Aid entering since the beginning uh of the war like almost now uh three weeks ago we saw some trucks going in on Saturday and Sunday and humanitarian organizations say this is far from being enough for the over 2.2 million uh population the civilian population that is actually um suffering you know from from all of this so the UN Refugee agency unra has said they will run out of fuel and other supplies if nothing comes in on Wednesday and they have pressured uh that you know supplies that there will more trucks coming in of course we also have to take into consideration there's a war going on air strikes have been intensified there are also some rocket fires still coming out of Gaza but it's also very difficult for this Aid them to be distributed to people in the Gaza Strip and only now we are hearing also maybe some change also in the US position but also others saying there might have to be a need for a humanitarian pause we're not talking here about a ceasefire but a pause so that some more Aid could be going in and that could also actually then reach uh the people the civilian population that is suffering here at the moment the most Tanya thank you very much that was our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem United Nations Secretary General Antonio gutterz is facing heavy criticism after comments he made at a un security council meeting in New York the UN Chief criticized Israel's bombardment of Gaza and urged an end to what he described as the collective punishment of the Palestinian people his remarks drew a sharp response from Israel there were heated exchanges at the UN security council meeting in New York as the war in Gaza rages on un Secretary General Antonio guz warned that the situation was growing more dire by the hour he repeated his condemnation of the Hamas Terror attacks and reiterated his call for humanitarian ceasefire it is important to also recognize the attacks by amas did not happen in a vacuum the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation but the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by amas and those appalling attacks can cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people the Relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces the level of Civilian casualties and the whale destruction of neighborhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen responded angrily to the comments Secretary General in what world do you live definitely this is not I will W he later cancelled his meeting with guz Israel's ambassador to the UN went a step further the UN is failing and you Mr Secretary General have lost all morality and impartiality I think that the Secretary General must resign outside unhq relatives of some of the hostages held a rally they laid pairs of shoes to show solidarity with the hostages later US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin asked the security Council to back a new us-led resolution which calls for humanitarian pauses but not a ceasefire however Russia said it would veto anything short of a full ceasefire so with the UN now in deadlock a diplomatic solution to the crisis seems a very distant Prospect
