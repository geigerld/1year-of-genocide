fighting between Israel and Hamas is Raging on in the last 48 hours the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 400 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza City Israel's Army is engaged in Street to Street combat with Hamas which is designated a terrorist organization by the European Union and United States the latest violence follows a un Security Council resolution that fell short of calling for a ceasefire another day brings more death and destruction to the Gaza Strip Israeli strikes hitting residential areas like here in the southern city of K Yunis relatives burying the victims of the latest attacks on Friday Gaza Hamas run Health Ministry said more than 20,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive so far about 1% of the territory's population these people are supposed to to be safe in their homes and protected by the law but as a man of the law I declare that international law has collapsed we're not allowed to have faith in any international law it merely represents the Law of the weak if Israel were in the Palestinians position the world would not stand still and would act the strikes on Saturday came just hours after the UN Security Council approved a water down resolution it avoids calling for a ceasefire instead the creation of conditions for a sustainable truth but the UN Chief and the Palestinian representative want a halt to the fighting this resolution is a step in the right direction it must be implemented and must be accompanied by Massive pressure for an immediate ceasefire I repeat immediate ceasefire despite growing International pressure Israel says any ceasefire would only help Hamas if this Council seeks to end hostilities it should start by supporting Israel's mission of returning the hostages and eliminating the Hamas threat and at the very least it must prevent hamas's empowerment just as this council is committed to increasing Aid it should also be committed to blocking the smuggling of arms and transfer weapons to the Hamas terrorists the UN resolution calls for life-saving Aid be rushed to Gaza at scale with Gaza Under full Israeli bombardment it's unclear if and when this demand can be fulfilled Martin rench from the un's world food program gave us an update on the humanitarian situation in Gaza good afternoon Ben yeah I mean it's really difficult um people in Gaza are living through hell as we speak they have nothing to eat nothing to drink no home anymore um they're prone to diseases nowhere safe not for them but also not for our humanitarians on the ground I mean eight trickles in we still reach people especially in the South but more or less on an adhoc basis so Aid is not flowing inside Gaza as it needs to be and we don't reach people across the strip although needs are massive and actually Aid is needed everywhere what do you make of the UN Security Council resolution it's definitely a welcome step um but as the Secretary General outlined it's not enough we need a ceasefire now but because only when guns fall silent we can rebuild the humanitarian system that is basically on the brink of collapse inside of Gaza you cannot as un we cannot do our job when bombs are falling and fighting is continuing that's why we need these guns to fall silent to actually help those people wherever they are um and especially vulnerable people like you know pregnant women children um because they need it need the the most so how does this all fit together with the the council's call on organizations like yours to get significantly more Aid into Gaza while uh there there's no chance of a ceasefire not even a temporary truce well I mean our call is we need all Crossings open we need much more Aid because it's only trickling in and as the Secretary General said I mean we can't we we there's no there's no use in counting drugs because the needs are massive our latest figures actually show that um there is a loomin famine um in Gaza and basically everyone is is going hungry in Gaza um families do not have enough to eat and more people in Gaza are facing catastrophic hunger than in the rest of the world combined I mean that that number is staggering and that you know says basically says it all we need much more Aid and actually to distribute that Aid efficiently effectively inside of Gaza we need a ceasefire because you cannot you cannot build up humanitarian system when bombs are falling I I find it interesting that Israel is not on the same page as your organization and other humanitarian groups when it comes to the assessment of a lack of Aid um why do those views differ so greatly that that is a difficult question I mean we are humanitarian organization we have people on the ground we have eyewitnesses every day we see what is going on and now there is this famine food security report um that is basically Beyond politics it's you know black on white that the situation is so terrible and not comparable to any other place in the world and that is a that is an independent assessment and again we need a ceasefire and we need much more Aid that's the situation we see every day with our own eyes in Gaza you heard it from the world food program spokesperson Martin wrench in Berlin thanks for joining us today
