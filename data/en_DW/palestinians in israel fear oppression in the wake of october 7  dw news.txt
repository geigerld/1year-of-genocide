when Bayan kti posted an Instagram story on October 8th she claims she intended no connection to the Hamas Terror attacks the day before this post visible to around 20 of her close friends turned her life upside down it showed a bubbling Skillet of shakshuka with the caption we will soon be eating the victory shakshuka and a Palestinian flag Emoji can vict it's my victory but what she says she thought was Private wasn't a classmate saw bayan's post claimed it meant she supported Hamas and passed it on 17 days later the police arrested her for incitement her University suspended her from classes and threw her out of her dorm other students sent her hostile messages Hass jabarin runs Adela an advocacy group for Israel's Arab minority he tells me they've seen cases like Bayan surge dramatically since October 7th jabarin says the vast majority of people involved have not broken the law rather that the way of arrests is deliberate repression aimed at silencing Palestinian citizens of Israel the Israeli police told us it is committed to the fundamental right of freedom of speech but that it is also imperative to address those who exploit this right to incite violence especially during times of war against a cruel terrorist organization to many Palestinian citizens of Israel the Crackdown is not only an issue of fundamental rights in many of Israel's mixed towns and cities like the one I'm at right now Palestinian and Jewish citizens have been living side by side for decades but since the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel Palestinians here tell me they feel their loyalties are being called into question in a way that they have never experienced before abir beer is a Palestinian Israeli civil rights she represents Abu a well-known Palestinian folk singer Abu Amna was arrested after posting a Palestinian flag emoji with the Arabic motto there's no Victor but God abier gave this account of what happened when she went to the police station on behalf of her to the arrest of such a prominent figure in Israel's Palestinian Community sent a after her release Abu Amna wrote they tried to strip me of my Humanity silence my voice and humiliate me in every way it didn't stop there abir tells us the singer is now plagued by right-wingers demonstrating outside her [Music] home she's just one of many Palestinian Israelis whose Brief Encounters with Israeli police on minor matters have had far-reaching consequences this is Yuki's humus shop in Nazareth he put a Palestinian flag with a fist onto his WhatsApp status police officers arrested him and he spent a night in jail student Bayan KB's future is on hold she was never indicted by prosecutors but her University's disciplinary committee found her in violation of its code of conduct and she's now waiting to see if she'll be expelled I ask her what she fears the fore she's one of many Palestinian citizens of Israel who feel their rights are being restricted in the broader aftermath of the October 7th attacks and let's bring in special correspondent Aya Ibrahim who filed that report Aya how widespread are these arrests for posts on social media well we did try to get some numbers from the Israeli police uh they didn't provide us any numbers but did provide us with that statement that we just mentioned in uh the report according to rights groups there are varying numbers the numbers are the arrests connected to social media posts are uh thought to be in uh the hundreds um but according to Adela the NGO uh that I interviewed the director of for for the piece the phenomenon is particularly sort of um observable in University campuses the Adel alone is rep Adel alone represents around 90 students at 34 colleges and universities who in the direct aftermath of October 7th were arrested uh in connection to similar social media posts but what people have been telling me throughout reporting this it's it's not so much uh the number or the or the the the the quantity it's more of the the sort of the the mood and the and the message that these arrests send and what people have been telling me is that this is very chilling and terrifying for uh the Palestinian Israeli Community because as we saw in this report it may be a post that you know rightfully offends some people but the consequences for uh for the people who've posted them even if they've been found not to have broken any laws can be dire I mean this students is is now waiting to see if she will lose her place of study she's almost done with uh studying data science at one of the country's most prestigious universities and so it's the chilling effect of it uh that I think is disturbing for many in the community it's also important to mention that it's not just AR Palestinian Israelis that have been arrested there have been a handful of um of of cases of Jewish Israelis as well who have had to face arrest interrogation in connection with posts that particularly sympathize with uh people in in in in Gaza authorities see see it differently but these are U much uh much less in really a handful of cases that have been reported about in the media okay and and can you tell us how um you know more broadly speaking the Israeli Arab Community um how it has been reacting to the October 7th Terror attacks and the war on Gaza I think as we try to sort of show in this report is that you know we're talking about a community that has been part of Israel for Generations uh the Palestinian Arab Community these are descendants of Palestinians who were uh living here uh but did not flee sort of in in the war fought over uh Israel independ Israel's independence so they are part of this country they speak the language they have jobs they're fully integrated they do according to interviews that I've done face discrimination um daily discrimination but legally they are citizens and so of course there's a measure of loyalty to Israel but at the same time they are uh Palestinian in their identity and they you know relate to the larger Palestinian uh Community globally if you will be that in the West Bank in Gaza or even across the world and so they do feel like their loyalties are often being questioned and any slight expression of that identity may be misinterpreted and so it's a difficult and chilling time for that Community as well in what is an extremely tense and difficult time for Israeli Society remember this is absolutely the most violent terror attack in the history of this country and it's a country that has been through uh you know many phases of violence so it's a tense um uh mood uh everywhere even more than three months into the war but particularly for that uh uh minority they are at times as they have told me seen as the Enemy Within when they've been here for Generations special correspondent AA Ibrahim in Jerusalem thank
