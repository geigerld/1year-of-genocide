we begin with the accusation aiding in genocide hearings began today at the international court of justice in the heag where Nicaragua is claiming that Germany is and I'm quoting here facilitating the commission of genocide in the Gaza Strip naranga is arguing that Germany is breaching international law by supplying weapons to Israel for its military campaign against Hamas Germany has rejected Nicaragua's accusations Israel has also repeatedly denied committing genocide four war crimes in its response to hamas's October 7th terrorist attacks Nicaragua's case against Germany has two main goals to Halt Berlin's military exports to Israel and to restart German funding for the un's Palestinian refugee agency their argument that Germany's actions are in breach of the genocide convention Germany is failing to honor its own obligation to prevent genocide or to ensure respect of international humanitarian law Germany's supply of arms to Israel is a central pillar of Nicaragua's case Germany is Israel's second largest armed supplier behind the United States accounting for about 30% of all Israel's weapon Imports Nicaragua argues that by continuing to provide these weapons Germany is enabling Israel to commit acts of genocide in Gaza the international court of justice is currently examining whether Israel has committed genocide in a separate case launched by South Africa in bringing this case before the court Nicaragua says it is acting on behalf of the Palestinian people I mean this is a very important case obviously for our Palestinian Brothers but also for the people of Nicaragua as you may have heard in our expression in nicara we have enormous sympathy with the Palestinians with the S and the Palestinian people are going through and that's why we felt that we had to do something obviously the only thing Niara can do is use the few recourses it has and one of the few things that nicara had is some experience with the international court of justice close ties between Nicaragua and Palestinian organizations date back to 1979 when Palestinian groups supported the Sandinista Guerilla forces that overthrew Nicaragua's dictatorship Germany's staunch support of Israel goes back to just after the second world war the German government sees supporting Israel's security as a historical responsibility for Germany's actions in the Holocaust Berlin categorically rejects Nicaragua's accusations Germany does not and never did violate the genocide convention nor International humanitarian law NE directly nor indirectly will get its chance to make its case in court on Tuesday my first guest tonight brings a wealth of experience in international criminal justice in 2001 he led the prosecution of the former president of Serbia sadan mosovich in front of the international criminal court I'm happy to welcome tonight Mr Jeffrey nice he joins me from London Mr Nice it's good to have you with us this case before the court now Nicaragua aiming at Germany in connection with Israel the Palestinians in Gaza the accusation of genocide to the outside Observer this may not seem intuitive at all what is the reasoning behind this lawsuit in your opinion um it is actually quite intuitive I think if for example you know that your neighbors about to do something to the neighbor's partner and you provide the neighbor with a gun and the neighbor uses it then of course you're responsible for the crime that in part for the crime that the neighbor commits so it's quite easy to understand what's being said here and it's not just in respect of your country but also extensively in respect of the United Kingdom as well as in America is that if the time has come and many people think it has when uh Israel's conduct of the war can no longer be justified in War of law terms then if you provide weapons to such a country you're becoming a partner in Breaking the Law of War further if uh there's any evidence of genocide by Israel and you know that there may be genocide going on then obviously you can't be complicit in genocide but more than that as the ambassador of Nicaragua to the he explained in his address to camera the genocide Convention of which many countries are um parties State parties such as our own country and your country um article one says as soon as genocide happens you have to do something about it now depends on the circumstances if genocide is happening in a neighboring country and it is something like the horrors of the holoc course then maybe you have to take very strong physical action but would it make more sense Mr would it make sense for Nicaragua to to aim at the United States since you're talking about your neighbor we know that that's not possible in this case right though well that's a matter for Nicaragua uh but they've chosen to go against Germany on the basis that Germany is a very substantial supplier of arms and that's open to them as a political decision I can't help with why they didn't make the the the other decision that's the one that they've made I think it's very important for people to understand and it's been lost for 70 years since the genocide convention came to being in 1952 that those who exceed or R to or ratify the convention owe this absolutely Hing Duty the minute genocide may be convicted and you can understand why it's all apart from the fact that people who drafted the genocide convention knew exactly what they spoke about they'd been in one war probably in two and they'd seen the horrors of the uh concentration camps in within the last 12 months so they knew exactly what was going on but it's all based if you if you think about it on the concept that humanity is single and if humanity is single then the mental state required to prove genocide which is that you intend to destroy another bit of humanity simply because of who they are whether it's Jewish people or whether it's people in Rwanda or Armenians and so on if you intend to do that doing something utterly Dreadful because you're destroying yourselves but but Mr Nice not all of humanity is is is a member of the international criminal court the United States doesn't recognize this court for example and I I'm wondering since Germany does is Germany being targeted by Nicaragua simply because it's the next best thing that can be targeted could easily be I'm afraid you'll have to ask ask your political experts about that because it's outside my sphere of expertise but there've been plenty plenty of examples over recent years tragic examples of how powerful countries have stood in the way of Justice uh or attempts to deliver Justice and I think if you were to go out and ask the citizen on the streets of Germany or Britain or anywhere else at the moment most of them would say for goodness sake let stop the fighting and for goodness sake let's have this matter properly ad UC ated by an independent tribunal and if it happens to be Hamas only who are culpable so be it because obviously Hamas are culpable what they did is without doubt criminal but equally if there's evidence that Israel may be criminal then that has to be tested and what you're not hearing from the political leaders of the big countries is that they agree that there should be a trial criminal or uh in the icj which is not a criminal court as you know it's a different kind of the the prote in survival of the state of Israel it is part of Germany's reason of State part of the the DNA if you will of the German body politic has this commitment has it made Berlin especially vulnerable to Legal challenges like what we're seeing right now I'm not sure that it's made Germany especially vulnerable the creation of the state of Israel which started at the beginning of the 19th century with the ball declaration made by an English Minister um and then has been supported by many countries notably the United States of America but other countries since is a is a response to the terrible things that happened to the Jewish people not just in World War II but for centuries or indeed Millennia because of rampant anti-Semitism which has existed all around the globe that's one development as soon as it was happening all those involved who weren't either Palestinians or uh Jewish Jewish State people themselves surely should have recognized that this was an inevitable problem that was coming and the Zionist founders of Israel saw that and I think it's more important perhaps but again I'm straying outside my expertise it's more important in fact to look at what the big and powerful countries in the United Nations itself have not done over the last several decades to enforce either a two-state solution or a one-state solution and to resolve this problem and so you've got two problems in parallel how we must honor what we've always tried to honor in respect to the Jewish people and the Jewish state but how there's this parallel problem not of their own initial creation of the Palestinian people but which citizens around the world feel very strongly I want to ask you before we run out of time you have chaired two tribunals at the court the the weager and the the China tribunal in the weager tribunal the conclusion was that China had committed genocide under Article 2 of the 1949 Geno genocide convention you've been quoted as saying at the time that there was no other way of bringing the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party collectively or individually to judgment does that also apply today to Israel and or its allies in the claim of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza no slightly different uh the what I was saying there was that China is probably at at most vulnerable to the international court of justice and that's why our one of the five we only F made we made a finding of one out of five possible forms of genocide but we did make it and we made it with absolute Clarity Beyond Reasonable Doubt so uh that's different from the position so far as Israel is concerned Israel Hammer always remember both sides and always remember that hamus has no defense to what it did on the 7th of October the international criminal court a world Court sought of except that a large part of the world has not signed up to it but it does have jurisdiction over isra and therefore it is in a position and it has said as much although America and Great Britain I dare say Germany doesn't wanted to say this it has jurisdiction over what's happening involving both concerning both Hamas and um the Israeli Defense Force and the Israeli political leadership but also quite possibly if any other countries get involved on the ground because the the basis for jurisdiction of the international criminal court in Gaza is the submission to jurisdiction by the Palestinian Authority in 19 in 2015 immediately after or shortly after the end of the last major war operation protective Edge right and it submitted Juris to the ICC for both the West Bank territories and for Gaza Mr n unfortunately we're out of time but we certainly appreciate you taking the time to help um give us a critical analysis of what's going on thank you you're welcome let's bring in Dr Lawrence Hill coron he's an associate professor in law and co-director at the center for international law at the University of Bristol in the UK uh now what is the reason behind this lawsuit in your opinion hi there well so so the lawsuit Alle alleges Germany's responsibility for for several violation of international law um both in respect of its failure to prevent violations within Gaza including its failure to prevent genocide its failure to prevent violations of the laws of armed conflict and in its actual support its Aid and assistance particularly in the form of weapons transfers to Israel and much of this arises much of the the case in a way arises from an earlier case instituted in in January brought by South Africa against isra Israel in relation to the assault on Gaza in which uh South Africa alleges that genocide is is being committed in Gaza itself and in legal terms does Nicaragua have a case here well yes it does and and certainly nicaragu is not the the first state or or or or entity to allege these kinds of violations being committed in Gaza uh we have had the the UN Secretary General um make these points the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination um a number of un special rurs have have all argue that there is a a risk of genocide being committed in Gaza the international court of justice stated in January that there's a risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights of Palestinians to be protected from genocide and even domestic courts have have started intervening the Netherlands Dutch court of appeal um for example ordered the suspension of arms sales to Israel on the basis of uh a clear risk that they'd be used to commit violations of the law of armed conflict so there's quite a lot of uh clear evidence o o of serious risks of violations of international law being committed in Gaza now why do you think it is Nicaragua of all countries filing this case yeah it's a very good question nicaragu is actually a common litigant before the international court of justice so so so it's appeared quite fre quently before the court um many of those cases concern its neighbors in in Central and South America but some have concerned other states and in particular 40 years ago uh Nicaragua brought a case against the United States for the US's um intervention and support of of uh Rebel groups within Nicaragua itself and that was alluded to by Nicaragua's agent this morning in the court it's also the case that this is an example of of what we might think of as public interest litigation where an applicant state is bringing a case against another state not as such on the basis of harm being committed to the applicant state but rather in order to protect particular interests of the entire International Community and that's something we've seen increasingly in the last last 10 to 15 years U Germany says that this case is quote grossly biased what do you say well I as I said before I think there's a considerable amount of publicly available evidence from very authoritative sources that serious violations of international law are being committed in Gaza and those violations are such that they not only entail the responsibility of Israel but they can also entail the responsibility of every other state in the world for failing to prevent those violations and for aiding and assisting in those violations so I actually think the argument on the merits is quite a strong one uh is with this lawsuit Germany serving as a scapegoat for the United States well of course there'll be implications for other states and the US is is the principal arms exporter to to Israel uh so an order from the icj to suspend weapons transfers to Israel um would therefore be be an important consideration for the us as well but Germany is the second principle exporter of arms to Israel accounting for something like 30% of arms exports to Israel and the obligations being invoked by Nick rager in this case uh clearly relate to the to the actual acts and responsibilities of Germany itself so I I think I don't think this is a such using Germany as a scapegoat for the us it's about Germany's independent responsibility thank you very much Lawrence hilor from the center of international law at Bristol
