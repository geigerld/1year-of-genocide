two weeks after South Africa's presentation in front of the international court of justice against Israel for a presumptive violation on the convention for the prevention of genocide today finally the court has actually issued a preliminary ruling to discuss it with us is Lu Moren oampo former prosecutor of the IC thank you for being with to uh Mr oampo could you basically just walk us through the ruling what is that happened today what did the court say today the summary could be the judges were tough on Israel that a genocide is a serious imminent the risk of genocide for all the people in Gaza that were very clear and strong but they were in some way gave Israel time to adjust they they gave Israel the time to come back to measures to transform situation in Gaza and they had to report in one month so that why it's a mixed combination that shows that the 15 judges who made the majority made compromise between them particularly the president of the Court no the US judge she she came from a state department experience so the fact that she vote for the majority saying is a r of genocide very clear it's really important and also the the the the the measures giving space to Israel is also I think part of her power it does fall far short from what South Africa actually did request which was essentially the cessation of Israeli uh operations in the territory of Gaza right well well well maybe it's not exactly what South Africa requested but I think South Africa deserve recognition and gratitude because South Africa is just one of 153 countries including Germany and us who are State parties of the genocide convention all of them have an obligation era HS as to say say the court so an obligation not just to behave themselves all the state party chai convention have the obligation to prevent other states to commit the crimes and that was South Africa dit South Africa we need to be gr to be thankful for South Africa MOVE because trigger a different dimension no more Wars law Lo legal discussions that is the opportunity that South Africa is giving us transform a war in yeah critics would say that I mean the possibility of this having actually direct effect on the ground I mean we had been seeing uh the death of civilians on a daily basis are actually very limited uh do you see it the same way no I think no I think people don't understand the how the international legal system works because if you see the core decision is wrong but it also quote article three of the genocide convention and talking about complicity and that's the message the US cannot support a similar campaign now because could be a complice of genocide so that why what I expect is now NYU yes is rejecting the coration but Biden has no the same space President Biden has to one months transform the game so you think that to some degree this actually will also exert very powerful force on Israel allies who up until this point have given Israel more or less a free pass in terms of conducting its military operations well first point for me and I was pleased and for me it was a pleasure to listen a formal legal language talking about the genocide and and there are they say there are 1.7 million people this place mean in in a in a population of 2.2 million people so imagine like a 60 more than 60 million people in Germany it's it's huge the majority of the people this place and 93% of them starving so that is what the court describ quoting different sources so that is very compelling and his idea this could not happen yes no one like Hamas attacking Israelis no one condemned that everyone accept Israel had the right to defend itself but this could not happen this attack on civilian population could not happen and that is for me the most important part or very important part of the decision giving us sense of order we live in a in a 21st century civilization not in in in in in the Roman Empire time when Barbarian could be killed no so then the the second part if I may the the decision the call was is a compromise obviously it's a compromise I was expecting something much bigger but it's a compromise and but it's interesting compromise because it give it give us a space to political leaders to find a solution and that the moment of Germany us stopping Israel Israel has a right-wing government Israel Netanyahu is fighting with this with the Supreme Court in Israel and now fighting with the international court of justice okay if we believe low we have to stop it how adverse do you think that this uh this ruling uh this preliminary ruling is for Israel what do you think the effect direct perhaps uh effect on Israel will be well the court is saying to Israel what you are doing is a very imminent risk of genocide for these people in Gaza what else could be good or imagine Israel State built to avoid the 194 the Nazi Genocide is now committing a genocide that is what they saying and that's why right now the judge were very careful they say it's an imminent reason they are not saying it did it they say it's an imminent risk that the victim suffer genocide that what they say imminent risk and that why to protect them measure have to be taken that what the court is saying that's hug it's a l it's a very careful language but it's hug so Israel have to adjust now this this is not a court of Palestinian this is Court of people from all over the world and that's why it's so important the US judge rule in favor of the majority the um application enforcement of the ruling will much depend uh essentially on the International Community correct there is no actual mechanism for enforcement of the rulings even though this is now essentially becomes becomes International Juris Prudence right well that why is interesting because the court did not say stop the blockade stop the bombing did not give this type of specific infraction that I expected the court did something different that could be smarter the cour say Israel had to decide how to stop it came to us in a month and to tell her what you are doing so Israel now is on notice whatever you are saying if you continue doing that is a genocide and to tell us you are doing something different you have to give us a report and the court will decide so in this sense the court keep enforcement ability because it's forcing Israel to do it and come back to the court the court is also asking Israel to essentially prevent and prosecute uh potential violations to the convention including uh the promotion or incitement and it did essentially quote uh in the preliminary ruling uh no fewer than for uh essentially high ranking Israeli politicians do you expect the Israeli judicial system to turn its attention to uh essentially its ruling Coalition Well normally states don't like to prosecute their own people what I expect is the court will start proceedings but there was no real I will see we'll see how the convention go because basically the court is quoting the president of Isel and the court is is quoting the meid of the fence two key characters no but would it be would it be part of the duty of the Israeli judicial system at this point in order to essentially act in accordance with the ruling to actually look into those cases that were actually on record named during the proceedings today well yes it will be and in fact Israel is already conducting they say some investigation instigation and in fact that specific part of the ruling was voted in favor by the Israeli judge but judge Barack so judge Barack was against the other part but on this part on investiga instigation he was in agreement so I that part is feasible but the problem is not to punish people here the priority is to prevent genocide and that's why the issue is how Israel will adjust this the the siege of Gaza how is will adjust its tactic to bomb people to bomb buildings what do you expect Israel to do over the next couple of days leading to the one month Benchmark that the that the court has established well net report thoric immediately was very tough against the court and I think now we we'll see what's happening with the US the US now I think this this decision is really much is pretty much something that us wanted because it's giving a space to us to man maneuver I think now us is sent the CIA director to qatal to negotiate a new hostage release and that could be Next Step a um pause in the conflict based on freeing free the hostages that could be a political maneuver to stop the conflict for different reasons and that could happen the this is not the end of the process now the the the the case will move uh to the Merit phase can you explain a little bit what that's about when should be expected no no but this is the most important decision this and the decision in a month when Israel came with the measures the final conclusion will be 8 years 10 years nine years will be important because the way the court build presedent we are now discussing something similar than the decision on Bosnia taken in 2007 so that's the court system working so the the final decision will important but not to protect the Palestinians to protect the Palestinian is now and you think that this will have an immediate impact on protecting Palestinian lives meaning in the next couple of days I mean you know we follow obviously the new cycle and we are seeing these things daily do you think that this would have an immediate impact on the ground I I I will mention the next two weeks not two days I believe now the ball this the core gave the ball back to Israel and us has a meaningful role because us is supporting Israel politically Israel us veto exu resolution and us is supporting Israel military Israel Fleet is there protecting Israel from Lebanon Hezbollah and Iran the problem now is US support to Israel could be complicity on genocide that's a new limit now and that why the US had to adjust drastically and the would be would be a very difficult time for us to adjust Netanyahu because Netanyahu is fighting for survival and he's a survival he's a big survival but now he's fighting to stay in power it's not more about Israel it's about himself so and then he is running he has no he cannot go back that why the next weeks are about Palestinian but also about the relation between us and and Israel government Mr that's all we have time for but we're very very grateful uh for joining us at do TR and hope to talk to you again soon very grateful for the
