Hamas says its militants have shot and killed one male hostage being held in Gaza and wounded two more both of them women in Tel Aviv relatives and supporters gather weekly demanding an immediate deal to secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages Palestinian militants kidnapped 251 people in the crossb raids on October 7th over a 100 have been freed but it is not clear how many are still being held alive Hamas considered a terror group by many countries posted its statement on telegram it is the first time the group has made such a declaration it usually attributes hostage deaths to Israeli bombardments on Gaza let's get more on this developing story from our correspondent Tanya Kramer she joins me now from Jerusalem Tanya what is the latest you can tell us here well for the moment we have this statement uh from the spokesperson of the Kasam brigades as you said it's a bit of an unusual statement announcing earlier tonight that in two separate incidents militants guarding hostages shot and killed one hostage and also injured two female hostages seriously the statement also said that they are currently being uh treated to save their lives the statement did not identify the hostages and said that they are looking into it and that they will give more information at a later stage now the Israeli military has reacted Reed to that and said they do not have more intelligence currently they cannot either refute or confirm these claims and they also will try to verify those claims giving more information now of course this highlights you know the absolute need what host the families of the hostages that are still uh held in Gaza belied to be 115 and as you said we don't know how many of them are still alive so um it it really underlines the necessity uh that there will be a ceasefire and hostage deal that would see those hostages release and this is you know what we've seen again people going out on the streets uh demonstrating and calling on the government to get such a deal done and this of course has happened just days before we are expected fresh ceasefire talks to begin they are expected to start on Thursday do you think this could have an effect well I think it's a bit too early to speculate what imp this particular uh incident has and there already a lot of doubts about these talks they were scheduled late last week uh by the mediators Egypt uh Qatar and the United States so that they would meet for a new round of talks on Thursday and Israel has also said that they will send a delegation now Hamas on Sunday night they have said that they don't want to see a new round of uh talks but rather would go to uh agreements that were made in previous talks based on the uh plan that was um presented by US President Joe Biden late in May and that they agreed upon on certain issues that's according uh to Hamas uh in July so this is seen here more as a maybe tactical step it doesn't mean necessarily that they're not part of the negotiations but they put more doubts of course uh on these talks and of course all of this comes when the region is really on edge right now there are more and more warnings here been heard today again assessment that an attack by retaliatory attack by Iran or Hezbollah might be imminent we've been in that situation already a week ago but we've just heard tonight the military spokesperson saying that Israel is prepared at Peak Readiness in offense and defense and of course if something like that happens uh then that could also derail such ceasefire talks Tanya thank you as always for your reporting that is our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem
