Israel's military says it has taken full control of the strip of land that serves as a buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt Israel says Hamas uses tunnels in the 14 kilometer long Philadelphia Corridor to smuggle weapons from Egypt into Gaza the Israeli military has stepped up its operations meanwhile in southern Gaza despite International criticism over mounting civilian casualties in the city of Rafa Israel's National Security advisor says the offense in Gaza is expected to go on at least until the end of the year here's Israeli Army spokesman Daniel hagari addressing the latest developments in Gaza in recent days IDF forces have taken operational control of the Philadelphia Corridor along the border between Egypt and Rafa the Philadelphia Corridor served as an oxygen pipe for Hamas through which it regularly transits weapons to the Gaza Strip kav and our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca ritters joins me now Rebecca Israel says it has taken control of the buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt what does that mean for the situation on the ground well that's right you just heard it there from the senior military spokesman Daniel hagari saying that they had indeed taken control of that border region area known as the Philadelphia Corridor uh that they had found some 20 tunnels they say along that border area and they also found rocket launchers placed very close to the Border some just 10 to 40 m they say from that border area hagari saying that they would that Hamas are T were taking advantage of the proximity to the Border uh in the knowledge that or hope I suppose that Israel wouldn't bomb that region because it is just so close to the Egyptian border now as you just heard there Daniel hagari saying that that they this had served as a Hamas oxygen Pipeline and that by securing this are they have cut off the weapon Supply uh that Hamas was still potentially maintaining and able to use now um the they say that the egyp the Israeli military say that they have been updating Egypt on the developments and we haven't heard a huge amount of reaction from from Egypt yet but certainly uh One Source telling Egyptian Media One senior Source we're hearing that there are no Truth uh in the statement about these tunnels it's certainly going to be interesting to see how the Egyptians react to the news uh on this border region given the the the peace agreement that is held between the two countries yeah how could this impact Israel's relationship with Egypt you think well it's difficult to say at this stage Nicole you know Israel has been saying for some time that it wants to that has wanted to take control of this border region it's something that Egypt hasn't been uh very keen to uh to promote they Egypt has long been worried that there would be that a raer incursion and that that more military bombardment in that area would cause uh an influx of Palestinian refugees into Egypt that's something that they were saying that they they wouldn't do in fact on several occasions Egypt has threatened to rip up the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt now that area along the border uh has been a demilitarized zone since the the Camp David Accords of 1978 and since 2005 has been under Egyptian control um before this Rafa Invasion though we do know that an Israeli delegation uh went in went to Egypt went to Cairo to discuss the operation with the Egyptian officials so we don't know the details of those discussions but it could be assumed that this operation and what the Israelis were planning was conferred to the Egyptians so it's going to be interesting to see how Egypt balances uh domestic pressures there's a lot of support for Palestinians within Egypt so it's going to have a lot of domestic pressure from its populace there uh and it balances also a peace treaty which it benefits from by way of of us uh uh Aid so you know it's certainly going to be interesting to see just how Egypt react to this latest development but at at this stage it's still too early to say you keep us updated on all the developments there that was Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem thank you so much Michael CLK Clark is a defense analyst and a visiting professor at King's College London he joins us now Michael let's start with the latest Israel claims to have taken full control of the Philadelphia Corridor that buffer zone between Egypt and Gaza what does that mean for the situation on the ground well it means they've achieved one of their tactical objectives I mean the corridor is about 11 kilometers long from the Israeli border up up to the Mediterranean coast and they always knew that they would have to take control of this Corridor because lots of smuggling goes on there it's it's full of tunnels the Egyptians claim that they've they've prevented all the tunnels from working that they blocked them or they've intercepted them but nobody believes that lot of lot of tunnels still exist and so it was always the case that Israelis from a tactical point of view had to drive their own forces all the way along the southern Gaza Border in order to seal the the Border themselves and that will create a certain amount of tension with the Egyptians just on the other side of the Border but it means from their military point of view they can now try to work through their policy in Rafa um in that they've now reached the center of Rafer and will push on towards I think alasi um on the coast which is designated as a safe area Israel and the US are still calling the Rafa offensive limited what would an allout offensive look like then I think in all that offensive would look pretty much like what they're doing to be honest um it's hard to see in what way this offensive is limited because they moved um five brigades they they created two divisions the 162nd and the 98th Airborne Division for this phase of the operation then they put the 998th division to the north and they mobilized out of 13 brigades they both they were two big divisions out of 13 brigades they mobilized 10 of them five brigades have gone to the north five brigades are working in the South and they're pushing us as fast as they can and so they moved into the Eastern out skirts then into the center of Rafer and now they'll move to the West u i mean this and they're bombing as they go whenever they see targets so um I mean they were bombing yesterday at the talal a couple of days ago at the um talal Sultan um area the tented area because they felt that they had two particular um uh terrorists I mean two Hamas people yazin Rabia and Khaled Naga they think they thought they had them so they went after them regardless of the civilian casualties that that caused so to be honest I can't see any difference between what they're doing now and an allout offensive yeah I want to talk about that attack a little later but first I want to bring up something that Israeli officials announced today they said that the war in Gaza will go on at least until the end of the year why so long and what shape could that take um I can't tell you what shape it will take because the whole thing has become incoherent from a military point of view I'm a military analyst I cannot tell you what the what the strategy is I cannot see a coherent strategy in what the IDF are doing all that they know is that they have to say it will take some more time because they don't know what to do next the strategy in effect is going around in circles they were told to destroy Hamas which they cannot do they can dismantle hamas's physical presence and they can kill quite a lot of Hamas people but they're probably creating more Hamas people than they are killing just by their actions and the the the policy seems to lack any coherence so for instance at Christmas in December they had 20 brigades across Gaza 20 brigades they rapidly reduce that down to five brigades then one Brigade now they've gone back to 10 brigades within a month and I cannot give you a sensible rationale as to why they did that because they've cleared the area say from Khan Yunis they cleared it they withdrew now they've gone back into KH Unis because Hamas keep popping up there the same with jabalia they've twice they've cleared the jabalia refugee camp and now they're going back in for a third time because Hamas keep popping up so there is no military coherence to this strategy and the IDF yov Galant the defense minister basically said that last week he said unless we are given a proper political construct from the government meaning Netanyahu unless you tell us what the day after is supposed to look like we cannot P pursue a sensible strategy which delivers that that's the problem that they've got yeah now that you mentioned the lack of a plan for for the day after I want to bring up something the US Secretary of State said because he talked about that again which has been a big point of contention let's listen into what he had to say in the absence of a plan for the day after there won't be a day after a plan for the day after that does not leave Israel responsible for Gaza which it says it does not want to be uh but if it is it will simply have an enduring Insurgency on its hands for as far as one can see into the future or not if not Hamas will be left in charge which is unacceptable or if not we'll have chaos lawlessness and a vacuum that eventually will be filled Again by Hamas or maybe something if it's possible to imagine even worse Michael you say the military operation at this point looks incoherent to you uh do you have any idea what Israel's long-term strategy could be no um I mean most people who have looked at this say look the day after and Anthony blinkin there was expressing I think his his exasperation and frustration at all of this we we know that to to move forward somehow we've got to start to think about the Palestinian people as a whole not just in Gaza but in the West Bank there has to be a new deal for the Palestinians we know that the two-state solution is dead but we all have to go and revisit the corpse and pretend that it isn't dead in order to try to create something out of the fact that two groups of people about 10 million each both want to live in the same part of the world so that suggests that something like a two-state solution will have to emerge even whatever we whatever we turn out to call it and we can't get get even to the beginning of that conversation until the military operation is at an end and Hamas is replaced by something else so at the moment we all know what the ingredients are and those ingredients are waiting for us at Square One let's say but we can't even get to square one because the Israeli government won't anticipate or won't won't talk about what the day after might look like but they have to and the reason they won't talk about it of course is because a lot of this crisis is concerned with the political survival of Benjamin Netanyahu and because he's he's got the ultra right wing on one side and he's got people like Benny Gans and yov Galant on the other who are pragmatists and I wouldn't have called them pragmatists a few months ago but they are now um and he is struggling to stay in power uh at almost any cost and so he will not make a decision um on the what the day after looks like and so so while he refuses to make a decision this this whole crisis just keeps going around in circles and we can't even get started on what the political process might look like and there's any number of people trying to work it out the Americans are putting a lot of effort in the qataris are the Saudis are the Europeans are everyone is trying to think about what the next stage might look like but we can't even get to the starting point yeah and it looks like right now we are stuck with a dramatic situation in Rafa huge International outcry after that attack on a tent camp over the weekend still the US insists the current operation is not crossing any red lines do you think there is a red line for the Biden Administration well there may not be I what understands Joe Biden's problems uh because I mean he needs this whole crisis like a hole in the head during an election year this is the worst possible thing that could have happened to him when he's fighting uh an election in November and so he has to be very careful he's trying to bring pressure on Netanyahu by all means he can without cutting off final support to Israel if he cuts off that support then he will do himself a great deal of political damage in the United States but he's he's tried everything he can and Netanyahu keeps telling him that that Israel will be restrained and then just ignoring what he said and um I think that you know the relationship between Netanyahu and Biden is about as low as it could possibly be in real you know we thought relations between Netanyahu and Obama couldn't get any worse but I think that that that President Biden must be so angry with Netanyahu because Netanyahu will not stick to any any deal he makes over the telephone as to what he will or won't do because he's fighting for his political life and the first slip that Netanyahu makes he will be out of power there'll be an election he will lose the election and be back in court on corruption charges those defense analyst Michael Clark excellent speaking to you thank you so so much for making the time pleasure
