Israel's war against Hamas is now in its 11th week many of the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th have yet to be release the leadership of Hamas is still alive and still in charge of the terror group Israeli forces have bombed much of Gaza and Hamas claims 20,000 people have been killed and the violence it shows no sign of letting up Hamas says that it will not release any more hostages until the attacks on Gaza stop a condition that is a non-starter with Israel and against all of this what difference would a resolution from the UN Security Council calling for a halt to the fighting what difference would it really make I'm Brink G in Berlin this is the [Music] day we continue the war until the end it will continue until Hamas is eliminated what what we need is a sustainable ceas file those who think we will stop and not connected to reality W calls again for a humanitarian ceasefire to stop the Bloodshed and death all Hamas terrorists from the first to the last are dead men they only have two options surrender or die but to our viewers watching on PBS in the United States and to all of you around the world welcome we begin the day with another attempt by the UN security Council to bring an end to the fighting in Gaza there have been numerous attempts by the council to turn down the volume of violence in Gaza since the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks in Israel the US has vetoed two resolutions each time siding with Israel and its right to defend itself with the war almost 3 months old and with Hamas claiming that 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza the UN Security Council is once again considering a resolution aimed at allowing humanitarian Aid into the territory what we need is a sustainable ceasefire where Hamas is no longer able to threaten Israel with with rockets and with terrorism and where the fighting can stop and the talks about how we have a long-term solution and peace and stability where we have Israel secure in its borders and a Palestine secure in its borders that is the long-term answer that's what we want to see all right my colleague DW's Middle East shaie rosan if she's here in the big table with me in the studio sha it's good to see you you know what we heard there from David Cameron that all sounds good but at the end of the day I ask you what I asked at the beginning of the show what difference would a security Council resolution make when it comes to Israel's strategy inside Gaza well very little if you talk about operation on the ground on the long-term strategy it's clear that Israel is depending on International support mostly American but not only uh the the mounting pressure does have an effect uh I don't think think it's going to have any immediate effect but Israel knows it has very limited time how much time that depends on the International Community what or who has the most leverage here and um who who's not the member of the security Council well I think a key country to bring in is the Egyptians you know Egypt has the border with Gaza other than Israel um and we've seen it very instrumental in bringing in Aid so far um it's also been very helpful with for Israel along the years to fight Hamas extremism and other uh things going through this border um is this trust in Israel there's a great trust in Egypt is that trust strong enough to allow Egypt to be the one facilitating the needs that the UN wants you know to have direct Aid coming into Gaza without Israel monitoring that that is it to be seen this is part of the negotiations the back and forth that we're seeing now it's a Egypt is an important Ally with great trust from Americans and Israelis not clear if that trust is big enough to hold this whole operation and the UN is also pushing for bringing in Aid through all possible routes including air and of course SE there's there's a big Coastline in in Gaza so far we haven't seen that too active uh in that um in that uh in the last days of the war maybe that would be a solution um the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said this week that at the UN he hears a lot of Demands being made on the victims Israel but none being made on the perpetrator ERS Hamas yeah and that's something to keep in mind also when you talk about how how much teeth do this resolution has because the UN also demands an immediate releas of all the hostages as part of this resolution uh that's being negotiated will that affect Hamas I doubt um and this is part of the problem we have been dealing in this completely asymmetric uh conflict however if you talk to the Americans for example they say Israel um is part of the of the of the nations of the world has taken upon itself agreeing to International laws inter AAL conventions and being part of the UN which Hamas is not Hamas is not but there is a responsibility and some of these common values that we share are the ground to this relationship to this Alliance once Israel steps back of it then you know this Alliance get weaker and what do mean what does this mean then to attempts or or calls to rehabilitate the PLO or the Palestinian Authority in some form that would make it at least appear to have the authority of a governing power correct I mean the the Palestinian Authority is is recognized as the official uh representation of the Palestinians and and the the Americans is pushing strong to bring it forth um Israel are pushing back but the problem is that as long as Israel keeps pushing back uh without bringing any alternatives uh it it remains in control of what happens in Gaza and by in the world's eyes it also remains in control of what happens to the population in Gaza to the civilians in Gaza who need not just aid but would need to have recovery we need to have you know at the end of the day their life rebuilt Israel on the one hand says I don't want to deal with Gaza I don't want this to be my problem anymore but then on the other hand it's finding it very hard to let go of this control to any other body in the world because the Arab countries are not so quickly to jump in the Saudis for example say we're not going to budge as long as Israel is not promising to solve the Palestinian problem if there's a some Prospect for a long-term Solution please we're in but this is back and forth between Israel the Americans and other moderate forces in in the region I'm wondering what Benjamin Netanyahu um and his government what they must be thinking at at this stage seeing that the Americans um may be willing to let a resolution pass you know forward this time and not you know not veto it and also you saw um the US defense secretary in Israel earlier this week and pushing for yeah a a a turnd down if you will in the military action in Gaza Netanyahu is he pulling his hair out actually not because he benefits from this clash with Hamas he knows he's been weakened in the polls in the last weeks extremely and his only way in his mind to regain popularity is actually to show himself as to be very tough that means tough on Hamas and tough on the Palestinian Authority and also tough with the Americans saying to the Israelis I'm the only one who can save you and protect uh Israel's uh needs um and the Americans are calculating that also in their uh push for Israel they know this is part of the political game eventually however there's Gaza there's 2.3 million people they need help they need support somebody needs to put an end to that Israel is aware of it the International Community is doing its best so far it's going to be hard you know as we've seen in last week it's hard to find a breakthrough yeah it seems like time is on no one's side in this conflict correct sh rosanis our Middle East analyst shn is always good to have you here at the big table thank you for your analysis thanks the United Nations Security Council is negotiating for a third day on a new resolution aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza US President Biden has signaled that the US May back this initiative which was put forward by Arab countries a vote has been repeatedly delayed as diplomats haggle over the wording of the resolution this ladi's draft calls for a suspension of hostilities between Israel and Hamas which many countries as you may know classify as a terrorist group the UK France and Germany have joined Global calls for a cease fire I DW's enus poll why it is taking so long to reach a consensus right Bren I think it's fair to me mention that member states of the UN always have their own national interests to consider when voting on a a ceasefire but in this particular situation the United States and Israel actually have been relatively isolated in their decision to oppose uh a ceasefire in a word of the UN General Assembly some days ago 153 member states out of the 193 total membership uh backed this resolution uh uh the US is apparently rejecting um uh the current resolution uh because of the UN monitoring mechanisms uh for Aid to Gaza because Israel does not want uh less control over monitoring everything which comes into Gaza uh because they're apparently afraid of arms and maybe concrete for tunnels being smuggled alongside with Aid deliveries so the Baseline is Brent Israel is not trusting other countries to keep them safe and the US has a deep commitment to support Israel yeah and you said the US has not been on board with the resolution on Gaza in the past but that seems to be shifting what is behind this change of heart well you know the situation is not only challenging but actually really risky for President Biden uh uh we are all facing an election year next year as we know and he's not only losing support from Arab Arab Americans uh due to his unwavering commitment to Israel but Paul's also show that a majority of firsttime voters might not support Biden in the next presidential election so he really puts in everything he can to find a compromise to find a wording which he can agree on and is Israel to also not lose the support of the millions of Americans who strongly support Israel and would punish Biden if he were to vote against Israel's take all right Enis pop with the ladies from Washington enus as always thank you Israel has vowed to press on with its operation in Gaza until Hamas is eliminated the Israeli military has released pictures which it says show a network of Hamas tunnels Israel claims the network is using or is used by the group's commanders including those accused of planning the October 7th Terror attacks Israeli soldiers inspect buildings said to be in Gaza City they say they've uncovered entrances to what they allege are secret rooms used by Hamas commanders at several locations a complex with books of the kurran that you can see there is this area I see graffiti and there are carpets on the floor maybe some kind of prayer area round metal pipe the military says its soldiers also discovered shafts to a quote vast network of tunnels there is an electricity box here this opens it was closed this is actually a door not the back of a box which reaches a space that leads to the tunnel shaft below perhaps the most important Discovery this they believe was used by the Hamas leader in Gaza himself Yahya sinir pictured here in an old video he's alleged to be one of the chief planners of the October 7 Terror attacks and sino's elimination is among Israel's top objectives in Gaza while Israel's ground troops advance and bombardment continues Israel has now issued new evacuation orders for Kan yunas in the South where it claims senoir is hiding out the plight of Palestinians has led to Growing International pressure for a pause in the fighting but Israel is standing firm we continue the war until the end it will continue until Hamas is elimin ated until Victory those who think we will stop are not connected to reality and despite holding talks in Egypt Hamas is also refusing to budge in a statement it said it will reject any talks about prisoner and hostage swaps until quote Israeli aggression is
