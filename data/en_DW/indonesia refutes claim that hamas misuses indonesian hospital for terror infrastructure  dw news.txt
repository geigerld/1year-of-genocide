the Indonesian government has denied an Israeli claim that a hospital in Gaza built using Indonesian funds sits on a site where Hamas has built underground tunnels the Israeli military claimed Hamas had built the Indonesian Hospital court on top of their Terror infrastructures and that Hamas had used a nearby area to launch rockets into Israel the foreign Ministry in Jakarta responded that the hospital in Northern Gaza was caught entirely for humanitarian purposes the statement comes amid growing public condemnation in Indonesia of Israel's actions in Gaza over the weekend thousands protested in the capital Jakarta holding both Indonesian and Palestinian Flags participants were clear why they were there many are enthusiastic in their support for Palestine hopefully Palestine will be peaceful soon and their conflict will subside quickly the issue in Palestine is not just a matter for the Muslim Community or Indonesia alone but for all people and religious communities thus we indeed need to unite to pressure Israel for a ceasefire in Palestine let's get more from DW correspondent Sharon suong in our Jakarta Bureau Sharon just hearing what the protesters there were saying it it looks like Indonesians are firmly in one Camp yes P so that was exactly what I'm saying for the protesters when I went um to see the rally as well so Indonesia has been very high in support of the Palestinian cause not only in words but also in massive amounts of donations collected uh for the Palestinians to help them and series of rally and protests uh actually have been breaking out in the streets for the last couple of weeks joining many other protests that I believe also took place in many other parts of the world but the one uh last Sunday was very particular to me because uh it was very huge tens of thousands people are joining and what was interesting for me was uh the Interfaith solidarity that was shown during the rally so um on that rally there were six representatives from uh six uh recognized religions in Indonesia uh and they made a joint declaration in support of the Palestinians um and so speaking about uh the support we know that three ministers were also present including the foreign minister Her Excellency um rno marsudi during the rally and we know that she has been very vocal in speaking out uh in support of the Palestinians in the international foreign for example bash uh during the UN General Assembly uh emergency session last week where she called for immediate secession and also when she had a uh bilateral call with the foreign minister of uh Malaysia uh about the urgency to save lives not only from the foreign minister we also know from president Joo Doo he also uh asked for uh the root of the conflict uh namely the occupation of territory to be immediately be resolved um with the parameters agreed upon by the United Nations and during the meeting with head of the Gulf States for example president Joo Doo is also inviting for a global solidarity uh for Palestine strong words uh there uh from the government especially as to what Indonesia considers to be the the the the potential root of the problem but has the government backed up its words with actions yeah so uh just last weekend Indonesia has dispatched the first batch of humanitarian aid for Palestinians uh more than 50 tones of Food Supplies medical equipments tent blankets has been delivered and the second batch will be delivered in the next three weeks comprom uh comprising medical equipment uh Indonesia's uh Minister of Defense uh proo subbiano has also offered Hospital shipped um but still in coordination uh with the Egyptian authorities uh just to go go back to the point that you were making something that you saw at this rally in jata it being an Interfaith rally and also the strong words uh from the government I mean this is what we are seeing now and what you saw but support for the Palestinian cause has always been high in Indonesia hasn't it we know that Indonesia um is a country with the biggest um Muslim population in the world so there's a sense of Muslim Brotherhood uh that is very thick there so we know that we can see there's a collective empathy on the independent struggle and the religious aspect as well until now Indonesia still doesn't have any diplomatic ties with uh Israel because Indonesia has long uh opposed uh Israeli um occupation of the territory and we often heard from the uh Indonesian leaders uh from the foreign ministers from president Joo Doo as well that in every breath of Indonesian diplomacy Indonesia's foreign policy uh the issue of Palestine recites uh Sharon how does all of this what we're seeing in Indonesia right now play into an election that Indonesia is heading into next year yeah by now most politicians and also uh presidential uh candidates for next year election have shown support uh for pal for Palestinians like for example I just checked Instagram um Pronto the presidential candidate just changed his Instagram profile picture into watermelon picture which is a symbol of resistance in Palestine also ganja pranovo another candidate before his candidacy uh has rejected Israel's uh participation on the u20 World Cup which was controversial at that time and another candidate uh Anis basan was also present uh during the rally uh we have to figure out uh uh later if it if it's going to like boost their votes or not but we know that uh the issue of Israel Palestine has been the key foreign policy in Indonesia we'll leave it there for the time being thanks so much for joining us today DW correspondent Sharon sumal along in Jakarta thanks so
