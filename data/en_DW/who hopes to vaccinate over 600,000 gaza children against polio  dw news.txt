the World Health Organization says Israel has agreed to a series of limited pauses in fighting in the Gaza Strip to allow a polio vaccination campaign to go ahead the militant group Hamas has also agreed to the plan who officials say that more than a million doses of the vaccine have already been delivered to Gaza and more are on the way health workers hope to treat more than 600,000 children are starting on Sunday the war in Gaza disrupted routine vaccinations and destroyed medical facilities allowing polio to return I'm joined Now by Sam Rose he is in Gaza he's deputy director of the agency for Palestinians known as unra unra is also in charge of the polio vaccination campaign Sam it's good to have you with us the goal of course beginning Sunday is to vaccinate more than what half a million children under the age of of 10 talk to me about the logistics here I mean how is it even possible in a place where next to no one is living in a place that they call home absolutely thanks for having me on look it's very very difficult in the same way that doing anything right now in Gaza is difficult it's been difficult to get the vaccines in they are now in it's difficult to to move them around we've only just uh heard last night that the pauses that we've been calling for for so long have now been agreed to we welcome them and we've got to go through detailed detailed planning and unra will be administering about half of those vaccines to half of the children we'll be doing it in our health clinics that's what we would normally do in in any given year and last year we vaccinated 99% of of children but most people now aren't where they were when we were doing those vaccinations which is why the outbreak has broken out or one reason for it so we'll be vaccinating some people in our clinics but otherwise in Mobile Health points that we've set up in tens of of schools that are functioning as shelters and then we'll be going tent to tent with our monitors with our vaccinators with our registration clerks to to to to vaccinate the the children like you said all children under 10 need to receive two doses of the vaccine Sam talk to me about how this was even able to happen the fact that we've seen polio um emerge in Gaza I mean most people watching would assume that polio has has been eradicated completely absolutely and it was eradicated from Gaza there have been no cases of polio in Gaza for the past 25 years and this outbreak is a direct result of the conflict and the the the the kind of multiple interrelated elements of the conflict uh in terms of the decimation of the health sector hospitals health clinics that have affected our ability to provide vaccine coverage as we would normally do it's a consequence of the bombardments of the destruction of homes of infrastructure the fact that so many people are on the move and and and now living next to you know piles of sewage on on one side and mountains of of rubble on the other it's a consequence of the malnutrition as your your report said and it's a consequence of of of immune systems being so suppressed by what people and in this case children have had to go through on a daily daily basis in fear of their lives for the last nearly 11 months now I know in some places around the world there is this reticence among parents to have their children um vaccinated for for anything Ian do you expect to see any of that there in Gaza I mean untrusting parents I mean misinformation is a is a feature of our lives uh the these days but look what I can say is that vaccination coverage in Gaza has always been excellent like I said the eradication of communicable diseases until until now largely because of the uh the the solid health system that we have in place including unra which is the largest primary health care provider in the Gaza Street we as unra are very much accepted embedded within those communities so there's a high degree of trust in health workers there's a high degree of trust in UNR staff and in the vaccinators from our other partners who will be working on it so we are working closely with Community leaders through mosques through social media to get the message out we're confident that any misinformation that that exists will we'll be able to counter Sam rose with the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees Sam we appreciate you taking the time to talk with this you're doing some valuable work beginning this weekend thank you
