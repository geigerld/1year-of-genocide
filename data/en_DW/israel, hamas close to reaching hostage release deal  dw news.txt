Israel and Hamas appear to be on the verge of an agreement to release some of the hostages being held in Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has summoned his War cabinet to address what he called developments in the matter of the release of our hostages the political leader of the Palestinian militants ISM Han has said that negotiators are quote close to reaching a deal it's thought the agreement would see a swap of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails for a significant number of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th a temporary truce of several days is also said to be part of the deal as is the movement of humanitarian Aid into Gaza US President Joe Biden told reporters that he is very hopeful the hostages will be free soon we working on this intensively for weeks as you all know I've spoken recently about it with both the Prime Minister Netanyahu and the uh M cutter and my team has been in the region shuttering shuttling uh between capitals we uh we're now very close very close uh we could bring some of these hostages home very soon but I don't want to get into into the details of things because nothing is done until it's done and uh when we have more to say we will but things are looking good at the moment now several families of Israel hostages have voiced concern that the country's War cabinet isn't doing enough to bring their loved ones home relatives met with lawmakers to urge them not to pursue legislation that would allow the death penalty for captured Palestinian militants relatives of hostages protesting in Tel Aviv as Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned his War cabinet admit growing signs that a deal to release hostages taken by Hamas could be emminent our second goal is the return of the hostages we're making progress I don't think it's worth saying too much not at even this moment but I hope there will be good news soon we are now at the closest point we ever have been uh in in reaching and an agreement we are very optimistic we are very hopeful but uh we are also very keen for this uh mediation to to succeed in reaching a humanitarian truth the tentative deal could see the release of over 50 hostages sources say the progress comes after some families accused a knesset's national security Committee of endangering the lives of their missing loved ones now there's some optimism I think the only thing that I could call Justice is bring everyone back home but I do understand that it's difficult and I hope this deal will help us bring everybody back home as well and I'm really hopeful that they'll come back soon many here don't want to risk anything now that a return of at least some of the captives could be just around the corner let's take you live to Tel Aviv now where relatives of hostages are protesting demanding the release of their loved ones and more action from the government Benjamin Netanyahu is currently meeting with members of his cabinet to hammer out the last details of the possible release of 50 Israeli hostages as it's being reported earlier a Us official quoted by the Reuters news agency said any hostages released would mostly be women and children with 150 Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel in exchange for them and we can now get more from DW correspondent Ben fulin who joins us from Jerusalem Ben what are you you hearing about this hostage deal and how it might play out a military spokesperson has just uh front of the media and said that progress is being made uh that's what we're being told from all sides uh from the Americans from the Qatari side the mediators or the main mediators in this Hamas as well saying that the ball is in Israel's court and uh we've had tonight uh extraordinary meetings by the war cabinet followed by the SEC security cabinet a wider cabinet and also uh the government now uh a deal is on the cusp according to all sources but we're yet to have been told what's going on uh whether or not a deal is made tonight it would take another full day for Israel to go through the legal procedures that are uh related to releasing any Palestinian prisoners that's what Hamas wants here it wants uh the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for these hostages of course uh we're not going to get all hostages released and Hamas is not going to get all the Palestinian prisoners released that it wants when you take a look at the figures that are being thrown around at the moment uh this would be though the first sustained pause in the fighting in 45 days of war the first deescalation it would be a major breakthrough um it's yet to be seen of course but sources also say the government would be prepared to extend any such deal to get all of the hostages eventually out of the Gaza Strip would be major news now Ben these talks have been going on for quite some time what led to what now appears to be a breakthrough well it's been a very hard line that Netanyahu and his government have been uh following all hostages equals a ceasefire now we're hearing for the first time okay maybe some hostages women and children for example and in phases so possibly uh 50 hostages over a time period of 5 days 10 a day while surveillance drones are taken down by the Israeli side so that Hamas Fighters can release the hostages and won't reveal their hideouts or the tunnels where they're possibly holding these hostages uh it would be a more realistic approach to this operation considering that some 236 hostages are said to be held uh over 35 of those children 62 of them women and eight aged over 80 one of them being uh 85 years old the youngest being only 9 months old it's a very tricky situation considering as well that we're not sure if Hamas is holding all of these hostages they could be held by private individuals and other militant groups within the Gaza Strip uh what's changing now though is the far right right opposition uh to this deal so far uh two of the parties in this Coalition of netanyahu's have said they would not allow such a deal to go through this is what's being discussed right now at this hour and that could be the Breakthrough DWS Ben for zolan in Jerusalem thanks Aban is an American Israeli in Tel Aviv and two members of her family were killed in the October 7th Terror attacks three others are believed to be Hamas hostages earlier we asked her what she makes of these negotiations I try not to pay a ton of attention to it until I think it's real we've gotten our hopes up we know that things are fragile um and we are just waiting for something to be concrete the fact that four hostages have been released and one has been rescued is amazing it's better than nothing at this point but it also feels very challenging that we have to fight to continue to make sure the hostage issue doesn't get lost and that people move on this you know yesterday was the International Day of children and we didn't hear word from UNICEF we haven't heard word from any un or Global health organizations regarding sign of life or medical status of anyone and right now we feel like we're we're unsure how the world isn't screaming on behalf of the hostages as an American and an Israeli and a human we are sad about every loss of life but it feels like the world is not screaming hard enough for these innocent civilians that are being held hostage that was Abby on an American Israeli relative of Gaza hostages who spoke to D earlier today now for more on this proposed deal that looks like it's on the table I'm joined by DW's shaie rosanes shaie what more can you tell us about these possibly 50 hostages that are set to be released and and what time line we're looking at for them to be set free well first of all um Abby was just mentioning you know some of the kids that we need to keep in mind out of the 50 we're discussing only about 30 of them will be kids eight of them will be their mothers but uh Israel reports of 40 kids and 13 mothers so they're going to be around probably 10 kids and five more mothers that are staying in the Gaza Street the other 12 hostages to be released are probably elderly women uh some of them also with some health conditions um it still Le a lot more hostages in the hands of Hamas most of them soldiers men some of them elderly over 80 uh with health condition and hopefully Israel is hoping that what they have set now is a formula with the Hamas that allows for every day of ceasefire to tend up to 10 to 12 people to be released and hopefully in Israel it will not end with 50 but can maybe rise up to 80 hostages for about a week of ceasefire which is what Hamas is very much interested in and it's probably the key to this breakthrough Israel claims that its hard pressure on Gaza on the northern part of Gaza is the determining factor that leads Hamas finally to agree to a deal because they need the time of the ceasefire in order to regroup in order to replenish their resourcs and obviously most of all they need the fuel that Israel is promising to deliver as part of this deal now not everybody in netanyahu's governing Coalition is on board with this proposed deal could they still block it no they don't have the numbers um it's also part of the political game they're playing this is the more extreme right uh wings of the party that um the Americans know of that Israelis know of um and that's also partly why Netanyahu extended his government and brought more moderate forces into the government because he knew he would need more uh you know voices to be grounding um his decisions when it comes to this uh operation in Gaza let's keep in mind what we're talking about uh Israel cabinet is now voting on this deal they will be up opposition but it will get the majority of votes then there are 24 hours for appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court if there are any people among Israelis maybe families of those who are not supposed to be released maybe people connected to some of the prisoners Israel has uh Palestinian prisons are going to be release is part of these deals um if their victims families of their victims are interested in appealing to the court they can do that for the 24 hours and Israel is hoping to see the first release sometimes around Friday maybe Saturday um at the latest so this is the timeline we're looking at and this is uh there's still some time also for the Israeli IDF forces to get ready for the ceasefire that going to put him a bit more vulnerable so they need to be protecting themselves better that's going to be happening also in the next 48 hours exactly because it is very much an Israel's interest to get as many hostages out of Gaza as possible but how dangerous can it be for the IDF and for the operation in Gaza to allow Hamas to regroup refuel kind of gather themselves in those five days that we're well I do have claims this is actually a great timing because so far they've been operating in a northern part of the Gaza strep and they were planning to go into the South so this is exactly the Half Point uh for them also we need to keep in mind when you look at Israeli politician statements they are talking about a long fight against Hamas they're talking in in matter of months maybe up to a year so in the greater scheme of events this these few days this week or two weeks of of the expected ceasefire they don't see it to be such a crucial element in the overall you know scheme to annihilate hamas's rule in Gaza this is the way Israeli see it and this is also partially why Hamas is looking into this deal they want to stall as much as possible if they can use the hostages in order to deter Israel from fighting they hope that you know by the time you know the longer it takes for Israel to restart later uh is an advantage for them and also they hope the International Community will say after two weeks or three weeks of ceasefire okay let's move on the fighting phase have have you know is behind us let's try to find other Solutions this is partly the assumption why Hamas is going for this deal yeah Hamas and Israel the Waring parties they don't talk directly there's great hostilities and lots of mistrust correct so how did this deal come about well the key uh player throughout you know the last 45 47 days of of this uh what we're seeing is Qatar you know this very tiny Golf Country who managed to become a critical player uh being great Ally for the us but also for Hamas this is where also Hamas leaders are based and sponsored by uh Qatar throughout the years they are the cheap negotiators but Egypt uh the neighbor of Gaza and Israel is also a key partner there helping the uh technicalities because they're the one sharing the Border direct border with Gaza and doing the back and forth they have a lot of experience with Hamas and its leaders throughout the years so um many ways not to directly speak but it seemed to be finally working this is also why there's a lot of hesitation a lot of carefulness in is Israel many of them of the politicians still saying nothing is over till it's done even if Hamas agrees we do not trust Hamas will deliver uh because there are no direct negotiations and there's always the fear of what's going to be happening um until this is done until the first israelies are back at home uh no one's going to believe that this is actually happening in Israel yeah we just saw before we started talking in Tel Aviv people are out on the streets demanding netanyahu's government do more to release all hostage now the pressure is very very high is this potential deal going to do much to ease that pressure because as you mentioned at the beginning there will still be some 190 people in the hands of Hamas there's no doubt that the softest spot is the kids and the and the mothers the young kids you know youngest of them was 9 months old when he was kidnapped now he's already almost 11 months old yeah um they're the softest spot and so in that aspect there will be some pressure taken off but at the same time it's it's a split country there are still uh voices they are against this deal as we are speaking and there's a lot of families torn knowing that if you have a soldier a man you know men and women that were soldiers that were still left in hamas's hands hands you know Israel in the last 47 days is grappling what would be the victory what would be the moment in which Israel can say we have now the upper hand for many people it's the release of all of these 200 almost 240 people home um and this is not going to change it's a part of Israeli ethic and what have been driving the Israeli society and its values throughout history um the pressure will be on question is will Israel be able to um still have some leeway in the military aspect while uh trying to you know find progress that's yet to be seen it's going to be very hard for Israel to manage to balance these two fighting Hamas but at the same time negotiating for more releases shie rosanes thank you so much always great we're joined Now by Bob kitchen he's the International Rescue committee's vice president for emergencies and the organization spokesperson on Gaza Mr kitchen welcome to the day what would a ceasefire mean for the civilians in Gaza well first and foremost it would mean uh an end to the violence that has caused um the occupied Palestinian territories Gaza to be the most deadly place on Earth over the last 6 weeks the fourth most deadly Justice for the whole year so first and foremost it would offer protection for civilians then second it would offer humanitarian organizations like the IRC the option of being able to actually deliver Aid to relieve suffering on the ground that's really urgent right now you have been calling for a meaningful humanitarian ceasefire for weeks is this it it's a good start uh as the fighting the violence has continued the uh the impact on humanitarian uh conditions the lives of people on the ground has gotten much much worse so as that's gone on the the length of the ceasefire has to get longer and longer and we're at the point now where we need a permanent ceasefire for the violence to be over to stop the dying and to enable Aid to relieve some of the suffering M now a big concern is for a to be delivered to Gaza and then falling into the hands of Hamas how can that be avoided and and procure help for innocent civilians without then Hamas seizing the goods that are being brought into into the strip well organizations like the IRC and the partners we work with on the ground operate in other high-risk environments whether are non State armed actors around us we have sophisticated methods of both delivering Aid registering clients to make sure we know who we're we're providing assistance to and then following up to make sure that the aid is not diverted so this is something that we we do in Northwest Syria in Somalia uh in Northeastern Nigeria so we we feel confident that we will be able to get Aid to those that need it the most at this point there is basically nothing that's not lacking in Gaza is there but what is most urgently needed now as far as you concerned well surprisingly one of the most urgent things is actually fuel there are there is a trickle of Aid getting in across the border from Egypt but it's being compromised because it's stuck there's no fuel in Gaza to enable the trucks that you're showing now they cross the border and then have to stop CU there's there's no fuel to to enable onwards Transportation there's no fuel for generators to power hospitals there's no fuel to power the generators that people require to to produce food so one fundamental thing that we need to to make a change on is that fuel be allowed in specifically for humanitarian purposes that will Empower switching the lights back on the machines back on in hospitals get food flowing again and get Aid into the hands of of people most desperately in need now that you mentioned the hospitals the who says critical trauma care is not um possible in any of gaza's hospital right now is there any way of fixing a collapsed system within a couple of days we're looking at four or five days of ceasefire right now well that goes back to my initial answer that four or five days isn't sufficient given the level of Destruction and humanitarian need that we're facing but we can make progress if we can get fuel in yet yes we can get the hospitals back up and running light switch back on Machines working surgeries happening we can get uh Pharmaceuticals uh anesthetics back into the hands of doctors we can make a difference very rapidly but four or five days is not enough given the scale of Destruction the the scale of damage and and suffering that we see on the ground so the ceasefire we're talking about is limited in scope and this is not the end of the war hardly the end of gin's plight what needs to be done to alleviate the suffering of those caught in the middle of the fighting with nowhere to go well we've discussed getting Aid across first is I think opening additional border crossing so not all of it has to go in through Egypt that's difficult but is necessary to to provide basic supplies food and water medicines um non food items as the weather grows colder people need warm clothes again so that's one thing the second is that we need people to have a space that is that is safe so I mentioned earlier that Gaza as a whole is the most dangerous place in the world right now but if you just look at Southern Gaza where it's supposedly safe where people have been told to evacuate to that is the second most deadly place in the world so yes the ceasefire is only short term we need to be pushing for it to become long term so people aren't afraid from bombings fall bombs falling from the sky every night now your organization was was founded to help people survive recover and rebuild the gazin who survived this war how can they begin to recover and can they ever rebuild I certainly hope so it's one of the most complex uh crisis in the world with we're dealing with 2 million civilians who have been displaced 1.5 displaced right now but over the years the suffering that the Palestinians have faced is significant um the path towards peace is is not open right now member states uh around the world need to push forward this um humanitarian ceasefire resolution of the UN to to stop the fighting and then there needs to be serious conversations about what's next um so both sides of the conflict live in peace but principally right now no more lives are lost on the Palestinian side that we can start the process of reopening hospitals um finding ways to get the people who have been displaced back into to appropriate housing before the winter turns too cold there's things that we can do immediately the long term is going to require some some negotiations and commitment towards peace who should be at the table there talking for the Palestinian people especially I think the lesson has been learned a number of times in conflicts around the world that it takes everyone it takes representatives from um the Palestinians uh from across the society Civil Society political actors um that are going to have to be around the table to represent the views of the the 7 million people across the occupied Palestinian territories it's take everyone's voice being represented to make to move forward do you think with the current leadership as it as it is in place in on both sides of the conflict that this is a realistic scenario I'm a humanitarian and I'm focused on saving lives within the midst of War I'm not a specialist on peace negotiations um but I I fear at this stage the distrust is significant that the world is going to have to come around and join hands with um both parties to the conflict and and help them forward towards peace for the future this is Bob kitchen of the International Rescue committee thank you so
