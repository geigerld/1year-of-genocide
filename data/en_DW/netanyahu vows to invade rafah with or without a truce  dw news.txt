talks have resumed on Sunday in Cairo between negotiators trying to strike a Gaza ceasefire deal a Hamas delegation has been meeting with us Egyptian and Qatari mediators a key stumbling block is whether a truce would be temporary or permanent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to launch a ground offensive into the southern city of Rafa whether there's a truce or not Palestinians in that City tensely wait for what might happen next as these gazans watch the destruction of their neighborhood negotiations that will determine their future are taking place a few hundred kilometers away in Cairo the resumption of talks for a ceasefire deal has ignited for many the longing to return home there's a great sense of hope and anticipation as we have longed for months for the negotiations to succeed so we and all the displaced people can go back home we yearn for stability and bringing an end to the war and the destruction we have witnessed we are very hopeful God willing we will rejoice when we return home even if we remain in a tend like this one but what matters is that we return to our homes many hope a ceasefire would end the bombing and allowing food medicines and other supplies that can save lives nahit al-masri a grandfather has found a cooked meal for his family of 16 the food distributed by the charity World Central Kitchen is helping them survive sometimes we have lunch but we don't have dinner and sometimes we have breakfast but we don't have lunch we must manage whatever food we get from outside is enough we share it among ourselves and say thank [Music] God there used to be trucks but now there are no trucks we haven't had vegetables for a month and a half the UN says parts of the Gaza Strip are experiencing famine the almost 7 months of War has made the delivery and the distribution of eight extremely challenging but now a possibility of a halt in fighting seems real to many gazans who for ons have been living through death and destruction still have hope for better days for more on this let's bring in journalist kareim El goari in Cairo thanks for joining us uh what are you hearing from this second day of talks yeah talks ongoing since yesterday they are still continuing today they are talking as uh we speak it is a Hamas delegation together with with the Egyptian and Ki negotiators and the head of the CIA William Burns who is not present is the Israeli delegation who is saying they only will come to Cairo if there is a written statement from Hamas that they're accepting the Israeli conditions what is on the table is basically a suggestion for a several faced exchange of hostages and um Palestinians and Israeli prisons and uh uh what is under debate is uh how long the ceasefire will be or what kind of guarantees will be that the ceasefire is going to hold Hamas came in uh quite positively said there are positive steps but uh in the last hours we heard a few negative comments from Hamas sites saying that it is Netanyahu personally who hindering uh the talks in Cairo so you have Hamas saying that there won't be a truce that doesn't end the war in Gaza and then it doesn't sound like something that Israel would agree to that is the absolute sticking point and it's a contradiction basically Hamas is asking for some kind of guarantees for permanent ceasefire and they want to have these guarantees from the negotiators from the Egyptians from the cies but also from the Americans who have to get this guarantees themselves from the Israelis uh um of course that contradicts the primary or stated War objective of Nan saying he wants to destroy Hamas and he wants to continue or he wants to move into the ongoing into a military offensive in Rafa that of course doesn't fit together so that how to overcome that is difficult also the other sticking point is that Hamas is asking for the Israeli Army to withdraw from the Kaz Gaza Strip so that the people can return back home from the south where many of them are fled to and displaced and uh to go back to their houses so difficult to see how this can be really bridged and and as you said Netanyahu threatening to invade Rafa with or without a deal it doesn't sound like a viable negotiating position um is there any leverage from saying that can you talk a little bit about that sticking point well Hamas made it very clear that when there will be an offensive in Rafa it will be over with uh it will be over with the ceasefire negotiations there will be no more exchanges of of of hostages so but the same time of course netan is announcing this offensive no matter what if there is negotiations or if even is there there's an agreement so that's of course it's also Al contradictions probably maybe also a way how the Israeli side is trying to put more pressure on Hamas in order to accept their proposals there's a lot of things that are said and addied to the media which are basically designed to create pressure on the other side and uh to make some strategic interventions in order to get some advantages in Within These negotiations and maybe some of the words that said publicly are also or some of the things that are leaked are also basically the intention is uh to make some strategic intervention for to get some advantage in the negotiations Karim El goari in Kyro thank you so much for joining us you're welcome and now Benjamin netanyahu's government has just voted to stop the Qatari broadcaster Al jazer from operating with within Israel the decision follows a law passed by the Israeli nesset that allows the closure of foreign broadcasters considered to pose a security threat amid the war in Gaza Israeli media say the block can last for 45 days Al jazer has covered the ongoing war from both Gaza and Israel
