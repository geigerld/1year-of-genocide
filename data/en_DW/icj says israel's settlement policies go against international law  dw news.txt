the United Nations top court has ruled that Israel settlements in the Palestinian territories do break international law and must be abandoned now the court found that Israel's occupation amounted to annexation and that Palestinians were systematically discriminated against in the occupied territories The Advisory opinion is not binding but comes as pressure grows on Israel over its war in Gaza the UN General Assembly asked the international court of justice in 2022 to assess Israel's occupation settlement and annexation of Palestinian lands opion so let's get more from our correspondent at Lucia Schon at the icg in the ha welcome Lucia tell us more about what the judge has been saying yes hi so the judges have just ended their readout of this advisory opinion and they have said that the continued presence of the state of Israel in the Palestinian occupied territories is UN law ful also that all settlement activities must be seized immediately new settlement activities are not allowed to take place and also settlers should be evacuated um we have also heard from the court that uh other states should do nothing to help the situation and should not recognize this situation um as as helping it to continue and then finally the court has also asked the United Nations General Assembly who who has asked for the for this advisory opinion uh to take steps to um end um the the presence of Israel in these areas um and also the security Council okay so given that this ruling is is nonbinding will it have any consequences yeah so even though the court has addressed people especially the United National General Assembly this does not mean that this is is binding so that means it is not saying Israel is bound by the court to do X or Y uh nevertheless it does have an impact and you can already see it now because there are the First Reactions uh coming from the Palestinian sides that hailed this as a great day uh for them and also the Prime Minister the israelian Prime Minister Netanyahu has taken uh to X and said that the country isra cannot be an occupier in its own land so it does play a role on the political level but it might also play a role on the legal level so we have heard that countries should not do anything to kind of give a green light for the existing situation and this could be for example in areas such as trade treaties or tariff treaties illegal expert told me that this will put um other countries in a situation where they have to carefully uh think about how they do it to be in compliance with international law and of course this does put pressure on Israel okay thank you for that Lucia Lucia Shulton in the ha as we've been hearing the un's request to the court to assess Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories dates back to 2022 war in Gaza has brought an added attention to the proceedings more than 50 countries submitted arguments in the case the aftermath of an Israeli raid in the West Bank earlier this month such raids have become an almost daily occurrence in what Israel says is an operation to root out militants armed with bulldozers they destroy Palestinian homes the West Bank is considered occupied under international law others have their homes destroyed because they were built without an Israeli permit DW talked to a family in East Jerusalem last month who had received an evacuation notice their home slated for Destruction it was one of 13 demolition orders issued by the Israeli authorities just that Day in 1967 during The Six Day War Israel seized control of the West Bank along with other territories and annexed East Jerusalem in 2022 the UN General Assembly asked the world Court to look at Israel's occupation of these two areas the illegal building of Israeli settlements was one factor raised by many of the governments that delivered arguments in the casee even the United States admitted that the settlements are inconsistent with international law settlements are strewn across the West Bank housing over half a million is Ry settlers an additional 220,000 settlers live in East Jerusalem which has changed the demographics of the area Israel views the whole of Jerusalem as its capital but under internation law Israel's takeover of East Jerusalem with its holy sites is illegal it's especially contentious as the Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of their future State as for the West Bank it's partly controlled by the Palestinian Authority but Israel maintains overall control including the territory's borders different zones are separated by walls and checkpoints limiting movement for Palestinians Palestinian Farmers have complained that this Patchwork of zones creates unfair access to resources like water meanwhile Jewish settlers are accused of attacking crops property and people most of the 52 governments that delivered arguments in the case urge the judges to declare Israel's occupation illegal
