00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.059
This is not just a pipeline.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.820
It connects two Israeli cities.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.310
But what’s so interesting about
it, is that it used to be known as

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.310
the 'Israeli-Iranian Pipeline'
in the 1970s.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.750
Because the two states worked on
it together to transport crude oil

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.220
through Israel to Europe.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.220
But that is a thing of the past.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:23.230
This cancerous tumor referring to
Israel has grown step by step from

00:00:27.643 --> 00:00:32.400
He [Khamenei]
pledged: "there will be no Israel

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.030
in 25 years."

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.440
The October 2023 terror attack
on Israel by Islamist terror group

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.600
Hamas has put this
conflict on a whole new level.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.909
Because Hamas is backed by Iran.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.960
Iran and Israel are among
the biggest military powers

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.030
in the Middle East.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.900
But they are very different.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.990
The Islamic Iranian regime denies
Israel’s right to exist – the only

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.020
majority-Jewish state in the world.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.150
But the conflict is about
much more than Jews and Muslims.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.670
It’s also about influence in
the region – and about Israel’s

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.940
number one ally, the US.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.670
Let’s unravel what’s
behind it – and what the dispute

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.330
is really about.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.390
After Israel declared independence
in 1948, Iran was actually among

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.190
the first Muslim-majority countries
that recognized the new state.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.209
So, what happened then?

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.550
The Iranian revolution in 1979
turned everything upside down

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.020
when the Western-backed Shah
regime was toppled.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.880
Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of
the Islamic revolution, believed

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.300
that it should be exported
throughout the Middle East

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.500
and the world.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.750
He saw Israel as part of
the so-called West in the middle of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.250
the majority-Muslim world
as a problem.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.790
And ever since, the Iranian
regime doesn’t recognize Israel

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.690
as a state.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.090
And leaders don’t
even mention its name.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.450
This is one of
Tehran’s oldest squares.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.590
In 2017, this clock was unveiled
here - counting down to 2040

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.800
to the “destruction of Israel.”
Because that is part of the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.660
propaganda of the
religious regime in Iran.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.080
The square is often the scene of
protests like these: Transporting

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.320
the antisemitic, anti-Israel
rhetoric of the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.620
Iranian authoritarian government.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.150
Iran has been using this
rhetoric of destroying Israel.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.660
But I think we need to be a
bit careful distinguishing between

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.500
rhetoric and reality.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.220
That was Mehrzad Boroujerdi.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.510
He has written numerous books on
Iranian society and politics - both

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.500
in English and Farsi.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.330
So he really knows
what he’s talking about.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.350
The square we mentioned
earlier: Guess what, it's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.950
called Palestine Square.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.150
For a reason.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.000
After Hamas’ October attack on
Israel, people in Iran protested

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
here in support of
the Palestinians, some even in

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300
support of terrorist group Hamas.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.550
But remember: Iran is
an authoritarian state.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.350
So these protests might not reflect
what people actually think.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.660
Because we’ve seen in the
past that protests have been

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.570
orchestrated by the regime.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.900
It’s important to understand
that ever since the Iranian

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.389
revolution, the Iranian
regime presented itself as a vocal

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.380
supporter of the Palestinians.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.500
So why is that?

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.770
We asked Abed Kanaaneh, an
expert on Arab-Israeli relations.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.320
They are using this issue in order
to get a recognition as a regional

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.670
power in the Middle East.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.910
And what he’s saying
is backed up by political

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.700
scientist Mehrzad Boroujerdi.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.590
The way to understand Iranian
foreign policy is that they claim

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.590
right to be, quote unquote,
the leader of the Muslim world.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.030
They try to formulate this sort of rhetorical campaign

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.870
that can resonate with the average
citizen in the streets of the Arab

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.310
Muslim world where they say we are
the defender of the weak,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.380
we are the defender
of the Palestinians.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.870
We can’t go much into detail on
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.770
If you want to know more,
check out our video about it.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.870
So, now you know why Iran
sees Israel as its enemy.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.630
But its influence
literally spills over its borders.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.950
This is what Iran calls
the "axis of resistance."

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.580
You have already heard of
the Palestinian militant group

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:31.950
Hamas, which attacked
Israel on October 7, 2023.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.390
And is deemed a terrorist
organization by the US and the EU.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.550
Hamas is not the only group in
the region that gets funding and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.000
arms from Iran.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.040
These so-called proxy armies
include Islamic Jihad in Gaza and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.320
the West Bank, Hezbollah in
Lebanon, the Syrian armed forces,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.160
Popular Mobilization Force
in Iraq, and Houthis in Yemen.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.950
Backing Hamas gave Iran
the opportunity to position itself

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.630
as the leading supporter
of the Palestinian cause in

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.820
the Arab world.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.140
Just a reminder: Most Muslims
in the world are Sunni, including

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.100
most Palestinian Muslims.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.710
So are most Muslims in Saudi
Arabia, a big player in the region

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.720
– and the
Iranian regime’s archenemy.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.350
Saudia Arabia and Iran
actually compete for influence in

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.300
the Middle East.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.190
Iran has a Shia majority, which
is a different branch of Islam.

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.870
Same goes for most Iranian proxies
in the region, such as Hezbollah.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.630
So, let’s travel
a bit further to the north,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.820
to the Lebanon-Israel border region.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.680
This area in southern Lebanon
is under the control of Islamist

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.680
militant group Hezbollah which
is — like Hamas — backed by Iran.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.310
And then there are the Houthis,
which operate mainly in Yemen.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.810
Just take a look at their slogan.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.230
It says here in red: "Death to
America, death to Israel, curse

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.100
on the Jews."

00:05:53.677 --> 00:05:58.120
Basically, the same
chants that we hear some 3,000 km

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.660
away in Tehran.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.440
The hatred against Israel often
goes hand in hand with hatred

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.300
against the United States.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.029
So, there is definitely a common
ideology with the Iranian regime

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.650
and political support
for the Houthis.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.730
But Iran denies
sending the group weapons.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.710
Ok, so there are several militias
outside of Iran’s borders that are

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.850
backed by the Iranian regime.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.710
And some of them have played a role
in the aftermath

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.770
of the October 2023 attack on Israel.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.540
In an escalation of
the decades-long hostilities

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.150
between Hezbollah and Israel,
Hezbollah fired missiles into

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.670
Israel after the Hamas
attacks, and Israel retaliated with

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.570
airstrikes in Lebanon.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.790
And the Yemen-based Houthis have
targeted Israeli-linked ships

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.850
in the Red Sea.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.510
This puts Iran in proxy
confrontation with Israel.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.710
But does that also mean the Iranian
regime itself could act against

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.210
Israel directly at one point?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.610
Let’s keep that
question in mind for later.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.630
So, we have taken a
closer look at the Iranian side.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.570
But Israel did not
just sit back and wait.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.980
Take these two areas
in Sudan and in Syria.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.640
Both were hit by airstrikes
– one in 2009 and 2013.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.120
Israel is believed to be behind
these strikes and hundreds more in

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.040
Syria targeting weapons to prevent
them from reaching Iran’s proxy

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.080
armies Hamas in Gaza and
Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.107
And there’s another big
– and potentially deadly – topic:

00:07:33.107 --> 00:07:34.860
nuclear weapons.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.930
The Iranian regime has repeatedly
said its nuclear program is only

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.670
to produce energy.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.800
It’s just that world powers such as
the US, China, UK, and the EU

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.020
don't believe them...

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.700
And Israel doesn’t
believe them either.

00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:59.620
Iran lied about never
having a nuclear weapons program.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.280
And, just so you know, Israel
was one the biggest critics of

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.830
the Iran nuclear deal.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.380
But that’s a story
for another video.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.950
So: For Iran its nuclear program is
a way to put itself in a position

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.860
of power in the Middle East.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:21.470
The Iranian nuclear program is also
part of their geopolitical plans

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:27.990
and part of a way to put
pressure on the United States and

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.210
on the West.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.950
And Israel sees the Iranian
nuclear program as threatening

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.440
to its existence.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.350
And by the way: Israel is believed
to possess nuclear weapons as well,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.260
but it doesn’t acknowledge this.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.720
Back to Iran, here are
the country's key nuclear facilities.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.929
Over the years, there have
been many sabotage attacks.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.880
Take this nuclear facility
in Natanz, where experts say

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.960
an explosion in 2020 set back
Iran’s nuclear program

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.660
by up to two years.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.330
Iran has blamed Israel for them.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.600
And Israeli officials have
implicitly threatened to attack

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.470
Iran’s nuclear facilities.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.760
Israel’s intelligence agency
Mossad is also believed to have

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.900
targeted Iranian nationals.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.350
Including a series of
assassinations of high-profile

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.910
nuclear scientists, such as
the father of Iran’s nuclear

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.700
program in 2020.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.070
Israel, however, has never
officially admitted to it.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.710
Remember the oil pipeline
we mentioned at the beginning?

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.870
Well, today there’s no
Iranian oil flowing through it.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.950
Enter Azerbaijan.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.270
Yes, another country that
plays a role in this conflict.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.410
Since the '90s, Israel has had
good relations with Azerbaijan,

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.150
a Muslim-majority country
with an authoritarian regime.

00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:48.290
Azerbaijan has become one
of Israel’s key suppliers

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:49.220
of crude oil.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.660
And a close military partner.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.830
One detail is important here: Look
at Azerbaijan's south – the country

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.510
shares a more than
700-km-long border with Iran.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.910
And this location could potentially
help Israel perform a long-range

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.370
strike on Iran.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.350
So now we have a better
understanding why there’s

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.790
a conflict between Iran and Israel:
Iran is using anti-Israel rhetoric

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.170
to gain more power
in the Middle East.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.540
And Israel is pushing back
against Iran’s proxies and

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.160
the country’s influence.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.350
And we already know: Both
countries are regional powers.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.150
But how come a
country as small as Israel is such

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.700
a big military player?

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.750
Well, that’s partly because Israel
is not alone in seeing Iran as

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.500
its enemy – and it
has a powerful friend.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.113
The US is Israel’s number one
ally

00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:43.913
— militarily and financially.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.790
That support is based on strategic
interests in the Middle East.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.350
And, as you know,
a common enemy: Iran.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.230
This map shows countries that have
recently normalized diplomatic

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.010
relations with Israel.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.980
The Abraham Accords
were a US initiative.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.670
They were signed in 2020
by Morocco, Sudan, and more

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.563
importantly, two Gulf States,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates,

00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:09.200
with Israel.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.390
So, supporting this coalition of
Sunni Muslim countries with Israel

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.270
was one way the US has been
trying to contain Iran’s influence

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.410
in the region.

00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:21.590
Remember: Iran is
officially a Shia country.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.580
And the authoritarian government
didn’t really seem to like

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.540
Israel improving relations
with majority-Muslim countries

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.420
in the region.

00:11:35.197 --> 00:11:37.040
But one big regional player

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.840
and Sunni-majority
country was missing: Saudi Arabia.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.640
Israel and Saudi Arabia didn’t
used to have official relations.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.000
Since the beginning of 2023, the
US tried to broker a deal between

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.970
Israel and Saudi Arabia.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.830
And they were supposed to be really
close to a historic agreement.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:01.370
Something Iran – Saudi Arabia’s
archenemy – would not have liked –

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.540
to put it mildly.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.890
And we all know what happened next.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:09.190
The October 2023 terrorist
attack on Israel by Hamas.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.380
And how Israel then
declared war on Hamas.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.750
The deadly Israeli strikes on Gaza
sparked outrage in the Arab world.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.820
And they have put on hold
the relations between Israel

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.290
and its neighbors.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.710
As you know, Iran’s proxy
armies are attacking Israel.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.670
At the same time the United States
has moved warships to the region.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.059
But we still owe you an answer to
one question we haven’t answered yet:

00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:38.620
Would the Iranian regime
actually enter the conflict itself?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.360
Iran will not be involved because
if Iran involved in this war,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:53.660
it will become a regional and
even worse than regional war.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.240
My argument will be they know
that getting involved in a war with

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.440
Israel when Iran really doesn't
have any Air Force to speak of.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.200
They are no match for
sophisticated Israeli planes.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.200
So, it seems Iran wants to
avoid getting involved directly.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.710
But the Iranian-Israeli conflict
is very far from solved right now.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.890
As are many other
conflicts around the world.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.750
If you liked our video, tell us
which other geopolitical conflict

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.990
you want us to map out next.
