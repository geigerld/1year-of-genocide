several countries are demanding answers from Israel after an air strike killed seven Aid workers in Gaza the food charity World Central Kitchen says one of its convoys was hit after leaving a warehouse it says citizens from several countries were killed Israel has promised an independent investigation as it continues its operation in Gaza in response to the Hamas Terror attacks a warning that some viewers may find the images in our next report distressing another day in Gaza another set of bodies seven members of the food Aid charity World Central Kitchen were killed in an apparent Israeli attack on an aid Convoy footage taken after the attack shows two burnt out armored vehicles featuring the ngo's logo as well as a softskin vehicle in a statement published online World Central Kitchen CEO Erin Gore said she was heartbroken adding that using food as a weapon of war was unforgivable the NGO says the vehicles were traveling through a deconflict Zone and had coordinated their movements beforehand with the authorities among those killed was 44-year-old zie francom from Melbourne seen on the left here at a food tent in Gaza last month Australia's prime minister Anthony albanesi described her death as tragic and reiterated his call for a sustainable ceasefire this is someone who is volunteering overseas to provide Aid through this charity for people who are suffering uh tremendous deprivation in Gaza and uh this is just uh completely uh unacceptable uh we want full accountability for this because this is a tragedy that should never have occurred the Israeli Army said it would conduct a review of what happened as a professional military commit to international law we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently we will be opening a probe to examine this serious incident further this will help us reduce the risk of such an event from occurring again World Central Kitchen has announced it's pausing its operations in the region until further notice for more let's speak now to sah Ali the global media manager for Save the Children International who is joining us today from Rafa in Gaza first of all thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us on what I'm sure is a very busy time I'd like to begin with your reaction to what has happened here we've heard the CEO of world Central Kitchen calling this an attack on all humanitarian organizations uh who do show up in dire situations do you feel the same I think everybody here in Rafa in vaza today is heartbroken the news is absolutely devastating and I think it speaks to the gravity of the situation on the ground we know that humanitarian Aid workers health workers law enforcement protecting humanitarian operations have been attacked by Israeli air strikes and this needs to stop we need all parties to adhere to International humanitarian law we know that humanitarian Aid workers should never be targeted and the situation on the ground here in Gaza is continuing to deteriorate Israel has stopped short of claiming responsibility for this attack but they have promised an independent investigation I'm wondering what what this means for your organizations plans to continue providing Aid in Gaza does it does it give you pause are you rethinking security well the news has just broken of course and I think everybody now is looking at what we can really achieve I think the difficulty is we know how great the need is right now just today we were in a hospital we've got pediatric doctors and nurses here we saw I saw a six-year-old boy who's missing an arm we know that more than a thousand children since the beginning of this war have lost either one or both of their limbs the need is so great children are already dying of malnutrition and dehydration disease is rampant in Gaza and it's really difficult for humanitarian Aid workers because we're here to do our job and our job is becoming increasingly harder and this is something that should never happen and as you were working uh with these children in just dire circumstances does save the children then also get reassurances from Israel about its ability to operate safely and provide this kind of assistance we have security mechanisms in place of course uh the situation is fluid and you know I can't comment on that right now but what I can say is that we we know that right now nowhere is safe in Gaza humanitarian Aid workers journalists health workers have been attacked we lost one of our colleagues here in December um and we we just hope more than anything that all parties in this conflict can adhere to International humanitarian law to ensure the protection but we know right now that the only thing really that will protect civilians families and children here in Gaza is a definitive ceasefire we need a ceasefire as quickly as possible it's been six months of this brutal war and children here in Gaza cannot wait any longer we need to see action from the International Community I'd like to ask you a little bit more about what you've seen in your work uh in the field there yesterday the the destruction of alifa Hospital became clear after Israel's withdrawal uh what what does the lack of a facility like that mean for children's access to Healthcare in Gaza children's Act access to healthcare has been decimated we've seen attacks on hospitals and we know that the entire population is facing a famine and of course that's a technical classification but we're already seeing children dying as a result of malnutrition and dehydration on the streets here there's complete overcrowding you know Rafa was home to around 275,000 people before the War Began and now an estimated 1.5 million people are cramped in this tiny patch of land and overwhelmingly there are children everywhere I've seen children on the streets with no shoes bloody feet uh covered in rashes and you know we met one family a mother who'd lost a child in an air strike and she's now Sheltering in a tent with 30 other people and she is sharing a bathroom with 200 other people the conditions are dire here in Rafa and they will continue to get worse until a ceasefire is agreed to because we know the B BS are continuing to drop and if the bombs don't kill the children we know that disease dehydration and malnutrition will thank you so much for joining us on DW news that is sah Ali with save the children [Applause] International I asked DW correspondent Rebecca rers in Jerusalem to tell us more about the incident well Terry it's been confirmed that this team of workers as you mentioned had been working in this Warehouse they had been been unloading about 100 tons of Aid that had just arrived on a shipment from through the maritime corridor from Cyprus uh the world Central Kitchen saying that they were at their near their warehouse in De albala as you mentioned in central Gaza and that they had been traveling in a convoy um two of the vehicles in that Convoy were armored one was what's known as a soft skin a regular vehicle and that they were uh marked very clearly with the world Central Kitchen logo on the roof pictures that we're in fact seeing are show just where the impact hole went right through that signage on on the roof of one of those vehicles um so they were clearly marked now the the world Central Kitchen has released a very strong statement in in the aftermath of this incident saying this is not only an attack against World Central Kitchen this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of War very strong words there they have since supended their operations in the area and till they take stock and and and figure out what their next move is now as you mentioned the IDF uh has released a statement this is fairly standard in the aftermath of these events the statement says that it's conducting a thorough review at the highest levels it didn't deny nor confirm and it hasn't yet we are expecting uh to to potentially get further statements throughout the day from the Israeli military though they did confirm that they had been working closely with the world Central Kitchen um as I said now World Central Kitchen has decided to suspend its operations and they were expecting a further shipment of Aid through that Maritime Corridor that has reportedly also been halted so you say the world Central Kitchen has suspended its operations in Gaza other Aid organizations of course are watching this closely as well could this end up having an impact on the provision of humanitarian Aid in Gaza at such a desperate time I think most certainly Terry I mean if this is confirmed to have been an Israeli strike I think it points to a real problem with the process of what's known as deconfliction now that is the process where organizations individuals and people trying to distribute a discuss with the military uh and are assured their safe passage basically now NOS have been saying for some time that there has been a huge problem with this process in fact that it's completely broken and we know that this isn't the first attack that has uh that that you know that has killed for uh killed NGO workers the unra the organization the UN organization task with assisting Palestinian refugees certainly one of the biggest operating in Gaza at the moment says that more than 170 of its employees have been killed uh throughout these operations so certainly when we're looking when the US is looking at particularly in upping the amount of Aid that may come through that Maritime uh border trying to build a jetty a temporary Jetty to allow for more Aid to come in Via sea certainly wondering who will Who will be willing uh to distribute that Aid I if they fear if organizations fear that they will be putting their NGO workers at huge risk uh of being uh you know targeted or caught up in these in these air strikes Rebecca thank you very much that was our correspondent Rebecca ritters in
