Egypt Qatar and the US have released a joint statement after two days of talks in Doha on the Gaza War they're backing what they call a bridging proposal which they hope will bring Hamas and Israel closer to a ceasefire deal Hamas refused to take part in the talks accusing Israel of negotiating in bad faith International negotiators are seeking to avert a regional conflict end the 10mon long war in Gaza and secure the release of Israeli hostages taken in the October 7th Terror attacks negotiations are ongoing with senior officials set to convene again in Cairo next week speaking to reporters in Washington US President Joe Biden expressed optimism about the new deal I'll say one thing about one of the reason why I was late for you all was I was dealing with the ceasefire effort in the Middle East and uh we are closer than we've ever been I don't want to jinx anything may have something but we're not there yet but it's much much closer than it was 3 days ago so keep your fingers thank you journalist kri mahori joins us from Cairo Biden is optimistic not the first time we've heard that how much ground is there for optimism well clearly the US is spreading optimism without talking really about the substance of the negotiations we hear less from Qatar and Egypt it is really about the substance not so much about for example that Hamas was not present in the negotiations I think that's a bit of an overstated fact because they have also an office in in Qatar in Doha they were informed they were also probably indirectly involved in this it's a bit of an irony that the US is trying to nearly bully all sides now into this ceasefire and it's a bit of an irony that the because the US has always in the last months since the war breakout uh me any ceasefire demands in the UN several times um now it cannot come fast enough for the US and I think the reasons are there are several reasons for that one is of course the big fear in the US that this might regionally SP spiral out of control we've seen uh that there's still the threat of R territory of strikes from Iran and from hisbah and from the hes in Yemen after the killing of uh the head of Hamas is Han in Iran and the killing of a big a high military commander fuad shuker of hisa in um in Beirut so that's one of the big fears and that's one reasons why the US is in a rush to get a ceasefire deal done because that is the key for deescalation in the whole region the second of course is the upcoming elections and then not to forget uh sending weapons and keeping the US Fleet on Alert in the Mediterranean costs also quite a lot of money us officials are trying to convince Israel that it achieved everything it can achieve militarily saying to them they will never be able to eliminate Hamas and but Netanyahu is still speaking about a total victory over Hamas and Karim this new amended plan is considered a bridging proposal what are the bridging points it's called a bridging proposal that closes most of the remaining gaps um and the biggest Gap here is that netan refuses to commit to a permanent ceasefire a key Demand by Hamas that also Demands a full withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the Gaza Strip and this is not a detail but sometimes is mirrored in details let me give you some examples what for example happens with the Raa Crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip who is going to control it Israeli Army and if not the Israeli Army who is going to control this border the same thing counts for the Philadelphia Corridor that is the border between Egypt and Israel there it's a narim corridor that cuts where the Israeli Army is positioned in the Gaza Strip that cuts basically the Gaza Strip into a northern and southern part and people cannot cross this Corridor so these are the details that I think all this discussed what to do uh with this issue so uh the devil is in the detail but the big big picture is really the difference between permanent ceasefire and Netanyahu is still talking about destroying Hamas kareim alori in Cairo thanks for the update you're welcome for more on this let's now speak to Brian catulus he's the senior fellow for US foreign policy at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC wel welc to DW Brian I want to start by asking you do we know what is making Biden so optimistic about this long delay deal I think one thing that's making him optimistic is that the war that many people feared that Iran and Hezbollah might launch in reaction to Israeli strikes a couple of weeks ago has not yet happened and the simp simple fact of the matter is that there's an Impulse to try to double down on diplomacy to end the Gaza war in part to try to prevent a wider Regional war that would drag the United States Iran Hezbollah Israel into a wider conflagration so I think maybe that's one thing that gives him a little bit of Hope the second thing is he he actually may be doing this to to try to P push things along across the Finish Line because it's been a very difficult negotiation it's been essentially two and a half months since he Biden released his his own plan for a ceasefire and it's been hard to get to this point so I think some of this may be a bit of Wishful Thinking given the in compatibility of the the views of Hamas and Israel's current leadership as well I want you to elaborate on that wishful thinking as well do you share that optimism or do you think it's misplaced I think it's slightly misplaced because if you look at the the fundamental um positions of his the current Israeli government and the leaders of Hamas uh they're they're just at odds um essentially Israel is negotiating uh through qar and Egypt in the United States uh with leader that it says it wants to kill and it's negotiating that because they want to gain the release of some hostages Hamas is negotiating in part to survive um its leaders have been targeted in a series of strikes Israel has vowed to kill a lot of its leaders so you may get to the first part of Biden's plan which was released in late May which was a release of certain um hostages women that are held by Hamas and Gaza but not the military um IDF soldiers and other things like this you may get to a temporary ceasefire like we saw at the end of November early December but the longer term plan the the phase two and phase three of the Biden plan released in May it seems pretty hard to get there just because the two main combatants Israel and Hamas don't recognize each other's legitimacy and both want to wipe each other off the map so that's what makes it difficult I think in the long run so you describe some of the ways in which these compromises may be re may be reached is this the gaps that that mediators are saying that they're hoping to close and that this new deal will close or are there is there more that we're missing I think so this negotiation is not just about when do the hostilities end right now or how many hostages or Palestinian prisoners are released in a matter of a few weeks like we saw November December it's essentially trying to negotiate the terms for what um a sustainable ceasefire might look like and there are questions that are quite thorny like does Israel have the right to go in with its military to go after what it sees as Hamas threats inside of Gaza inside of Gaza territory as we see in the West Bank which is another occupied territory um that Israel maintains a presence in it goes in uh at will to actually defeat threats and that's one thing I think they're negotiating right now is what is the status of Israeli forces are they out of Gaza if so who will actually maintain Law and Order and those sorts of things aren't about the immediate ceasefire they're about that interim period and that's what makes it so difficult and even if they get to this first phase as I said an exchange of prisoners and hostages and a cessation of hostilities for a period of time it's much harder to actually conceive of that sustainable piece I I hope it happens because 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza Israelis are threatened every day with rocket attacks uh from across many of its borders so we need stability in the Middle East we don't need a wider War which I think again that's another benefit of what this diplomacy has offered is that it's prevented uh what many had feared which is Iran and Hezbollah retaliating for Israel's attacks on on its uh some of its leaders a few weeks ago Brian culis in Washington DC thank you so much for explaining that so clearly to us thank you
