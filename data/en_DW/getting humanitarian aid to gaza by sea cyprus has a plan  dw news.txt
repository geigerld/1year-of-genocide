Cyprus is preparing to become a hub for a humanitarian Aid operation for Gaza the government of Cyprus has told DW that preparations have now taken a big step forward Cypress says it's now working on technical not political issues currently the only way to get Aid into Gaza is from Egypt via the Raffa Crossing but that is often closed Cypress plans to use its Port of larica to gather International Aid and send it on to Gaza at it as it is one of the place is closest in the EU to the strip DW's Jack Paris sent us this report this is the heart of a plan by the cypriot government to send International Aid to Gaza lanica Port here is just under 400 km away the cypriot government says Israel will not oppose the plan as long as its officials can check what's loaded onto ships Bound for Gaza now we've proceeded from the political to the technical uh part of it so we've seen that they support politically the implementation the realization of the corridor and now where the part technical issues are being resolved getting the aid ships out to sea should be simple enough the biggest issue would be how to unload them in Gaza the port there has not been fully functional since Israel's blockade from 2007 and Israel has bombed the area since the October 7th terror attack the cypriots plan could build a temporary floating port just off the coast they say this could dramatically speed up the delivery of Aid one ship can carry 500 times what a truck can in nicasia the cypriot Red Cross says it's in communication with the government and can move Aid like this quickly we are ready at any time uh and we have such uh warehouses smaller in all the districts so uh we're ready at any time within the hour this command center next to lanica airport coordinates between 21 countries when it comes to evacuations from crisis zones it's been operational since 2016 it's set to play a major role in the humanitarian Aid Corridor plans certain precondition is to have a different security environment uh to be able to proceed with the implementation of this idea but of course we are in contact parallel to those preparations with all stakeholders involved France Greece and the Netherlands are all Keen to get Aid moving here quick let's talk now to the reporter who prepared that DW's Brussels correspondent Jack perck uh Jack Cypress says it's close to agreeing this Aid Corridor with uh Israel to Gaza what what else can you tell us yeah it was really interesting being in Cyprus and speaking to the cypriate government who appear to feel that they are very confident that this humanitarian Maritime Aid Corridor uh plan will get agreement with the Israelis the foreign minister of of Cyprus constantinus combos was in Israel at the end of the week speaking with the president Isaac Herzog and they said the Israeli side said that there are serious negotiations on this essentially the cypriots believe that because it's going to be predominantly European Aid that comes into the port of lanica that they are proposing to is allow the Israeli authorities to check exactly what is in that Aid uh check what's going on to ships and check what will eventually go to Gaza that that seems to be uh a feasible and a reasonable option for the the Israelis as we heard uh the presidency are saying that they now believe that they have political agreement but it's about technical agreement and one of the big issues there is about Gaza not having a port right now and what would this help actually look like in in practice on a daily basis yeah well it would be things like medical supplies things like food water fuel tents for people that are displaced so little of that has been able to go through the Raffa Crossing since uh the October the 7th attacks and Israel Israel's response in Gaza to that um it's it's been you know we're hearing widespread reports of a deteriorating humanitarian situation and as the as the cypriot say you can get 500 times the sort of tonnage on a ship than you can on an individual truck that has to pass through the Raffa Crossing which is frequently closing there's also an idea swirling around and the the the the cypriots weren't too Keen to be drawn on this that potentially some ships could be Hospital ships we know individual countries have been sending them into the Eastern Mediterranean but there some as part of this humanitarian Corridor there could be some additional Hospital ships that would be able to take casualties and injured people from Gaza and look after them out to seea uh whether that will actually come to fruition we'll have to wait and see it's they're not being drawn too clearly on exactly whether that would be within the plan and just really quickly Gaza doesn't have a large Port as you said how do you fix that yeah so the idea is a floating structure a floating dock that's been done a number of times it would be possible the Israelis may not be willing for that to happen there's also a segment in the plan to build a firm Port but obviously as the war is continuing probably European partners are not going to want to build any firm structure for now but they're going to need to off that load that Aid that's the big sticking point at the moment Nick okay Jack peric from Brussels thanks so much for that
