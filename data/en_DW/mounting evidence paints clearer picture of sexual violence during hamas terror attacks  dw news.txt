now two months after militant islamist groups terror attack on Israel there's mounting evidence of extensive rape and sexual violence on that day police are still combing through extensive video footage like this filmed at the Nova desert Rave by Hamas militants as well as social media and security camera footage but it has been difficult to collect evidence because most victims were murdered by their attackers doctors and rights groups who were at the scene on the day of the attack say what they saw leaves no room for interpretation and that the Invaders raped and killed multiple women and girls we saw things there that is they were shocking to us women that was raped brutally raped and then killed with gun something else with with guns you and they were burned alive and I I tell you this the things we saw we will never forget them let's speak now to Y Sherer she's the head and founder of the Survivor of sexual violence advocacy group and joins me now from Jerusalem welcome to DW thanks for making the time now you are involved in collecting testimonials from Witnesses and First Responders what have you learned about the scale of sexual violence that was committed on the 7th of October I work with other organizations and all branches of government and this investigation has just started we have a police investigation this police investigation is um towards um having court cases against people who were caught alive on that day terrorists Hamas operatives and and the testimonies that were collected were quite shocking we have now both Hamas footage and our own footage of First Responders that shows crime scenes where people both men and women were raped and sexually abused the bodies came in such a horrible horrific condition um and we do have have eyewitnesses accounts people who saw other people being raped and abused and also a small number of survivors both genders how hard is it uh to uh to collect and collate this proof and present it in a court of law and be uh sure that this will stand uh scrutiny in a court of law simply because most of the victims did not survive the acts of sexual assault that we talking about well it's quite clear now that we will never know the full extent of the sexual violence that Hamas perpetrated here on the 7th of October we can't collect evidence from people who are burned and are dead now our most eyewitnesses are also killed and this is going to be a very hard investigation but what we already have is shocking and there's no question that this happened on the 7th of October on multiple occasions and we have multiple crime scenes and I'm sure Justice is going to Prevail now Hamas which is considered a terror group by many countries of course is denying all of this it is saying that rape is against the Islamic beliefs they have said something to the effect that and I quote we categorically reject the false allegations of rape propagated by the occupation particularly the recent false allegation insinuating that members of the resistant engaged in sexual violence in recent weeks based on everything that you're saying see that I don't see the point of denying it don't see the point of denying it when Hamas themselves took pictures and videos of it and we have live terrorists being held here in Israel being interrogated they admit it they say it was planned they say it bluntly they've uploaded onto social media footage of it we have eyewitnesses that saw it it was wide spread they absolutely did it here and I don't see the point of denying it so it was pre-planned I think it was pre-planned they said it was pre-planned in their investigations and and I think this is a foreign influence we never saw um this kind of uh behavior before the 7th of October so you did mention that Sina was heavily influenced by Iran I I never saw anything like this in this conflict before I think this is foreign influenced by other terrorist organizations and groups like Al-Qaeda like Isis this is a foreign influence on this conflict it was brought in this never never happened in such a widespread um way before it's new to us and was absolutely documented and verified right why plan this what is the purpose behind committing crimes like these well this was not an ordinary conflict this was not only a matter of uh raping people it was a matter of humiliating people people were shocked in the genitals genitals were cut off I mean people were beheaded there was a lot of unnecessary violence because this is a terrorist organization and their aim is to scare people and spread horror this was psychotic and disgusting things that they did to the bodies they performed acts that I don't think Were Meant to this is not part of a normal conflict what was done to the bodies was meant to spread fear right it was sadistic disgusting do you think it'll be possible to bring the perpetrators to Justice we'll see the police investigation is it just started I mean of course this is going to be brought to a court of law in front of the judge and right people are going to get defense lawyers and prosecutors and we'll see what happens and what comes of it a lot has yet to be published yeah you're also working with survivors of these brutal crimes people who witnessed the horror that you speak about but this horror that was committed against their friends against relatives how are these survivors coping now I've not spoken to any anybody in general I've just been advising and working with the government on the care that they deserve they are all um very traumatized by these events um which is understandable not only were they victims of this brutal ACT people that they know were killed and murdered or kidnapped they're not living at home their homes were burnt down they can't return so they're going to have a difficult time in front of them and I I know that we as a state as a country as a society we're going to support them we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us and speaking to us today y Shera head and founder of the Survivor of sexual violence advocacy group thank you so much Al thank you well Israel has accused the UN and many women's rights groups of ignoring or playing down sexual violence committed against Israelis on the 7th of October me too unless you're a Jew was one of the J one of the chance of protests outside the UN headquarters in New York and on social media campaigns like this music festival we heard gunfire and everyone was running I started running and then he grabbed me he yelled something in Arabic and then he replied sorry to interrupt you you said he was yelling in Arabic yes so he he ripped my pants and then he just I'm just sorry I I just need a bit of background here are you Israeli yes and your rapist was Palestinian he was a Hamas terrorist okay just um this is a bit awkward but we can't help you but I was rap do you have any proof yes he filmed it yes Hough local police don't take it personally management decided that all violence against Israeli is is legitimate resistance well Alona hag fry is a research fellow of the Jewish people policy Institute an author of the book sex and gender crimes in the new international law she told DW how she views the international reaction to October the 7th this is such an important issue ER it must be addressed by the media it must be addressed by the entire International Community the world must wake up the you human rights organization must wake up and First of and foremost The Women rights organization must wake up so maybe it's a answer your question H the reaction was silent complete silent it was devastating because the promise of the the human rights organization and especially the women rights organization is to protect all women and the silent was a terrible betrayal only after six weeks after we shove all the evidence in the face as you can see the evidence it all is all all are all over the place we can see the videos we can see the testimonies H even though the the reaction was very weak they were very sorry and they must investigate I don't know what happened to We Believe all women we protect all women something is very very wrong and it must be addressed well let's take a closer look with Seline Bard who's a war crimes expert and founder of the NGO we are not weapons of war she joins us from Paris welcome to DW so we we've heard there the criticisms of many Israelis of the UN and rights groups for apparently playing down the sexual violence committed on the 7th of October do you think that criticism is Justified well I think it's a little bit complicated but what is the reality because you know I was in Israel uh I came back yesterday and you can feel that they are very angry they are very shocked about that because they feel that they were not heard and the reality is that it took uh a long time and I think the reason why uh the reason for that is you know this uh conflict that arise and and and the debate and everything and it's not normal because if you take other cases like Ukraine or other in Africa I mean reaction are more quicker so yes there is a legitim question to ask why there were no reaction more stronger reaction let's it like this might that be because that well first of all of course the the the attack took everyone uh uh by surprise and then of course there was the shutdown of the area and no journalists have been allowed to get in so the world only gets to know about it when Israel releases the images yeah actually yeah that's what I wanted to add so thank you for that I think the the thing is let's not forget that they have themselves a little bit you know be silence because for many reason there is a context there is the issue of hostages there is everything and uh the police itself the israelian police opened an investigation only two weeks ago so I think what it shows is that every time sexual violence is always you know the last thing that we are looking into and I think this is the bottom line of the problem glob yeah well let's let let's look at that sort of expanded view because of course there was International condemnation of the crimes committed by Hamas on the 7th of October do you believe it's important to specifically acknowledge the sexual violence yeah I I I think it is and I you know my NGO every every moment there is C crisis or conflict or you know extreme violence somewhere first of all we do know that every time something like that happen sexual violence you know comes in you know very rapidly we know that by experience in many conflict the fact is that for Israel it didn't happen before like that so that might be um an issue but of course it is important we should know now by experience that when you have a mass crime or something like that you need to look at sexual violence and you need to ask for investigation on that and this was not done and I think also you know Civil Society even at the time Israeli in Civil Society was talking about that and it's true what was said before there were video we could you know everybody saw this woman naked you know and and the people parading with them and and spitting on her with her sorry and spitting on her I mean all of this we have seen it we reacted very quickly so why the other did not I mean that that's a question right so now that this evidence is out there and these images out there um what's the process how do perpetrators get brought to Justice well that's you know that's the one million question because indeed if we talk about international criminal law you know we need perpetrators and so we need to identify these people we need to have them alive if we want to process them to justice and we need to relate these people to the crime that have been committed um now to just uh jump a bit on what you just just said yes there is evidence there are lots of element but all of this has to be documented and analyzed and everything when you see a video as it's not an Evidence by itself you know you need to authenticate this video you need to understand the source you need to understand who is in it and Etc but um yes the question of justice is very complicated but you know there's not only a question of justice for people and especially women who go through sexual violence as I see you know in many conflict need to feel supported it's very important so there is you know there are steps uh between something happened uh and Justice all along and maybe never happen but then there is there are steps between there is documentation there is you know talking about it we need to say it happened because it did happen and that's very important for them and for all of the world to understand that thank you for outlining that so clearly for us Seline B from the NGO we are not weapons of war thank
