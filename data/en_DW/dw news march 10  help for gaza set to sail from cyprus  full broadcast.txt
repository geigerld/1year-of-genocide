this is DW news live from Berlin a new sea Corridor to bring desperately needed Aid to Gaza the Open Arms supply vessel is cleared to sail carrying humanitarian supplies from Cyprus our correspondent reports from inside the control room at the Port of lanica voting closes in Portugal with the far right set to make election gains corruption scandals have dented support for mainstream parties [Music] [Applause] hello I'm Tomy alad welcome to the program a ship loaded with humanitarian Aid has been given the all clear to set sail from Cyprus to Gaza the Open Arms supply vessel is expected to leave the port of lanaka any moment now carrying 200 tons of rice flour and proteins to Gaza The Chariot World Central Kitchen is providing the assistance it'll take the vessel an estimated 60 hours to reach Gaza once it set sale using a newly established Maritime Aid Corridor our correspondent Rosie berad is in lanica Cyprus where that shipment of Aid is expected to depart anytime now we at a special operations Hub in the city of larica where cypriate officials are able to track and look at this new Maritime Corridor which is now really starting from here in the city of larica so that Aid boats can reach Gaza safely and that much needed maiden voyage we understand should be setting off very soon so in this room around me you'll see there are cameras where officials can monitor what's happening at the Port we also see for example lots of maps that shows the area where cypriate officials could deploy for example search and rescue vessels if this ship were to get into distress now I've been speaking with seprate officials I've got the very latest from them take a listen to what they had to say we have uh finished the inspection and loading of the vessel of the Open Arms vessel uh and the platform they are using so uh the most important part is that everything is uh ready uh permissions have been granted and now it's uh scheduling um issue for uh the NGO that uh is handling this issue Rosie um just talking about the scheduling issue there do we have an idea of the exact time uh when this is uh going to get the all clear in the coming hours what I understand is that the NGO which is preparing to receive this Aid on the gazan side is still busy building its temporary peer in order order to actually receive this now this is a first ofit kind delivery it's a delivery of tons hundreds of tons I've been told of things like flour of rice of protein like canned tuna and of course we know that is much needed in Gaza where there really is a humanitarian disaster and officials here are hoping they can ramp up this Corridor over the next few weeks to see to this Voyage really seen as a test for trying to get this done the idea is that cypriate officials check the goods here in Cyprus o overseen by Israeli officials before it departs so that they can go directly to Gaza now we are however hearing from United Nations officials saying this Maritime Corridor while it's welcome news is no replacement for land access and so those calls to increase access into Gaza via traditional land Crossings are still mounting particularly from the United Nations and Ros we just uh looking there um earlier as you were speaking to live looking at live images of of the vessel there we have the images of the vessel um how long is it likely to take to get to its destination and deliver what uh these desperately needed Aid so Cyprus is the point in the European Union which is the closest to Gaza but it's still some 400 km so make no mistake this is not an easy journey and generally this should take about 15 hours so at least a full day of sailing but given the fact that this boat is tugging a a heavy cargo it could be that takes much longer certainly into a couple of days so this is no mean feat and certainly something as you can see the eyes of cpri officials bearing down on this to try and make sure this works because of course as we know really the lives are at stake here the United Nations has been warning of famine in Gaza I should say that Israel says it facilitates the access of Aid Israel has welcomed this initiative although Israel has also faced criticism particularly for ngos for what they say really is that lack of humanitarian access and how difficult it has been to get life-saving Aid into the besieged territory as DW correspondent Rosie Bard in lanica Cyprus now efforts to secure ceasefire in Gaza before the start of Ramadan have stalled war and hunger are overshadowing the eve of the Muslim holy month Aid agencies say International efforts to ramp up deliveries of humanitarian supplies by air and now by sea are not effective enough in parts of Gaza Ramadan decorations and food are still available but not at prices most people can afford there are no jobs left no water and no electricity people are selling their belongings to live and Ramadan is very hard on us for most Palestinians food to break ramadan's daily fasting will be hard to come by we rarely eat whether it is Ramadan or not and we always remain hungry in Rafa parents are getting creative to help children celebrate Ramadan is Ramadan is very different this year we're not in our homes we're intense but we insisted on putting up decorations and cele we just pray that by the end of Ramadan we'll be in our homes others find the fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces too much to bear children reportedly injured in an Israeli bombing are rushed to the hospital in this Central Gaza Strip ongoing Israeli air strikes are also taking a psychological tool we are tired I swear where please feel for us please we want a ceasefire and an end to this what do we have to say we'd thank God for anything without a ceasefire in time for Ramadan and an Israeli ground assault into Rafa still a possibility the suffering of ordinary Palestinians continues without relief in sight let's check in on some other stories making headlines around the world NATO has begun biggest exercise and say the cold war in the fields of Northern Norway the alliance wants to send a message to Russia that me member states are ready to defend each other more than 20,000 troops from 13 nations are taking part in the drills Germany's GLD gdl train drivers Union has announced another 24-hour strike on Tuesday talks with Railway operator Deutsche Bank man uh deutche band management remain Deadlock the sixth workout walkout in current negotiations is set to start at 2:00 a.m. local time for passenger Services voting has closed in elections in Portugal exit poles show a shift to the right as in other European nations in recent polls Portugal's had eight years of socialist rule but the far right party shager is picking up significant support confidence in mainstream politicians has been dented by corruption scandals DW's Yan Philip Schultz is in Lisbon for us Yan Philip the polling stations closing just minutes ago do we have early results yes according to first uh exit polls uh it is a tight race between the ruling socialists and the center right opposition but it looks as if the center right democratic iance the main opposition block is a few percentage points ahead and could maybe form the next government also the farri right populist uh party the chga party they have gained uh um quite considerably they are at around 16 to 19% uh this was predicted but it's still a very strong um result for the far right um there are uh also some good news the participation of the voters the voter turnout seems to be uh quite high but I have to stress again those are just first exit pole projections here uh in that case what do we expect uh this do do we see a kind of trend that could shape up for the new government well it will certainly be difficult to form a new government and Portugal none of the major parties seem to have the necessary majority uh so at the end uh the far right populist chga party could become something like a king maker for the center right block even though a lot of politicians from the moderate center right parties uh have stressed that they uh don't want to have a deal with chga but this could be um the only o option maybe at the moment if uh if the country is not going to have fresh elections in a few months all right we'll be waiting to see how that develops Yan Philip Schultz in Lisbon thank you very much finally Earthbound stars of the Oscars may have some competition new images from the James web Space Telescope show the star forming region called NGC 604 it's
