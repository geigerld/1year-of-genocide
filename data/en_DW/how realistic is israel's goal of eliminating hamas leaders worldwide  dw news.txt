Israel has said that one of its goals in this campaign in Gaza is to destroy Hamas well now the head of Israel's domestic intelligence service has stated that it will eliminate Hamas leaders around the world here's a look at what Israel has done so far and how difficult its stated goal might be fighting raging in southern Gaza Israel has expanded its campaign against Hamas while operations continue in the north even after Israel claimed nearly a month ago that Hamas had lost control there before the truce in Northern Gaza we dismantled two Hamas brigades not completely yet we are still working inside to secure our accomplishments and to strike more Battalion Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas Fighters but Hamas was estimated to have about 30,000 Fighters before the war started and many of them are still around Israel also says it has destroyed hundreds of Hamas tunnels as seen in this video released by the IDF but Hamas has had 16 years in Gaza to build an extensive network that runs the entire length of the territory which will make it extremely difficult to eliminate them all Israel has targeted many Hamas commanders Israeli newspaper yed yot published images of a deck of playing cards showing top leaders including F sinow and Military head Muhammad de distributed amongst Israeli soldiers but the senior leadership is thought to still be alive and commanding the group from can Yunis that's also where the most hostages are believed to be kept as human Shields Hamas also has officials far beyond Gaza in the West Bank and in Lebanon where they are increasingly allied with other jihadist movements the political leadership lives in Qatar and there are fundraising officials in Turkey as well the campaign in Gaza has also cost an estimated 15,000 Palestinians their lives so far worldwide support for the Palestinian cause has spread far beyond the region the growing number of Civilian casualties and the dire humanitarian crisis will very likely play into hamas's hands making the group's Resurgence even more likely possibly dragging the war out for years beyond all these challenges it's far from Clear what Israel would do if it did defeat Hamas Israel hasn't presented a plan for how it or anyone else would run Gaza so Israel trying to reach mission accomplished to talk about that I'm joined Now by GTO Steinberg he's a senior fellow with the German Institute for international and security Affairs GTO it's good to see you again do you think fully eliminating Hamas with military means is that realistic is it possible well I think it is possible to eliminate Hamas um and that means um catching or killing most of the leadership in the Gaza Strip and killing or catching most of the fighters of Hamas in the Gaza Strip but fully eliminating it uh to the extent that it can't uh fight the Israelis once the war is over I think that's impossible simply because Hamas is not only a militant organization of some 20 to 30,000 Fighters it is also a social movement with a mass following in the Gaza Strip and that will be the problem the day this war stops yeah if even if you take out all of the fighters what about people who are sympathizers with Hamas people who may not be willing to pick up a gun but who would not be sad to see others pick up a gun I mean is is there any way to quantify those people and those mindsets well uh there has been WID widespread support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip in recent years um most likely the number of supporters is between 20 and 30% of the population uh that means somewhere between 400 and 600,000 persons and the problem the problem is Even If you eliminate most of the uh the the Hamas militant organization the organization will be able to recruit among its support base in the years to come so what is needed is a fighting force that is able to control the situation in the Gaza Strip for months and years to come and of course a polit political solution in order to win at least parts of this social base over and as it seems the Israeli government has no clue what might happen to the Gaza Strip after the war uh against Hamas is one the French President Emanuel macron says that the complete elimination of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas would take a decade what kind of time frame do you think we are looking at here I mean are we talking about decades instead of years or months no no I think uh the French president said this for political reasons it is of course um possible to eliminate the organization but if impossible to eliminate uh all the Hamas fighters to eliminate the organization uh will take another couple of weeks perhaps a couple of months but then the big problem as I already said is uh how to win the peace uh and Israel see doesn't seem to have any clue what might happen afterwards as it seems uh Israel is ready to reoccupy the Gaza Strip that but that will mean that remaining Hamas Fighters and new recruits will fight the Israelis um out of the Gaza underground it will be very hard to control the situation in the Gaza Strip against the will of the population there you know if we compare um the situation to to other countries in the region or to to other conflicts has such a massive military campaign including the effect that it has on civilians ever led to less extremism less radicalization well um some of these uh some similar campaigns were successful for example against uh the Islamic State organization in mosul in 2017 or in raqa in 20 20099 the destruction in the in the in both of these cities was comparable to what is happening right now uh in Gaza I think one of the main differ differences was that Isis or is was not a social movement it was a militant organization of some 20 30 40,000 Fighters and that was it Hamas is a social movement with mass support in the Gaza Strip and that is the problem in the long run that's not the problem for the coming months milit the Israel might might clearly win this war against Hamas but it's it will be very hard to win the peace afterwards it won't be any peace yeah that's right win the peace and win the hearts and minds of a lot of people Kido Steinberg from the German Institute for international and security Affairs G as always we appreciate your time and your analysis thank you and for more on Israel's offensive I'm very pleased to welcome Harel horf head of the Middle Eastern network analysis desk at Tel Aviv University Welcome to DW thank you for your time today Israel says that it wants to eliminate Hamas is that a realistic objective in your opinion I think it is realistic objective uh and I'll give you several reasons for that first and foremost we need to remember the Gaza Strip is only 364 square kilometers namely it's almost an island uh it's not Lebanon it's not Iraq it's not Afghanistan and any comparisons of that sort just doesn't fit second uh we need to understand how Hamas is built it's not a an ordinary hierarchy of uh let's say an army okay you have the chief of staff and then you have the other commanders beneath you no Hamas is what we call a network organization namely it is comprised by uh several even many uh Power centers or hubs if you'd like uh that are surrounded by by all sorts of power sources uh that can be men that can be areas that can be all sorts of of of power sources that each each Power Center like that can work almost autonomously in other words or to make it even more clearer I would say you have H leaders such as sinir but you also have Maran Isa and Muhammad de and other prominent leaders including by the way outside of of the Gaza Strip like is Ania each of them has a a role in Kamas and each of them is a power center now once you remove enough or I would say a critical mass of these power centers either by anything that any measure that Israel can take that will eventually make the whole network collapse so on the good side it could I just interrupt you there because you've done a very good job there of of describing Hamas you've called it a network organization you know it it as you say it's not just an army but but you know the fact that it is so complicated that it's an ideology as well it's a set of ideas you know obviously including the refusal to accept a Jewish state so you know how can this be eliminated from Gaza how can it be easily done well we we we know that any idea first of all we need to differentiate between an idea and an organization any organization can be eliminated even the most fearful one and we can think about several examples from the history second I would say even this even an idea can be rooted out ER whether it is the the the militant idea of Japan after the second war or of course Nazi Germany today we have the most two peaceful countries in the world and and pacifist any idea can be rooted out in the Middle East we saw that with the nasserism for example the idea sank after it was proven as failed so we need to differentiate between the two what we are interested is in of course eradicating the organization and as I explain this is possible as well we just need to get to a m a critical mass and and and and to root out the idea will take of course years but I think it worth it for the sake of the two H people both Israelis and Palestinians eventually because Hamas is really the most the most negative player uh that this area saw in the past 30 years and if Israel is successful in getting rid of this organization it says Israel says Hamas will not rule Gaza after this war if that is the case can you tell us who will then be in charge first of all uh I must say it's an excellent uh question because uh to to be critical Visa the Israeli government I don't think they talk about a lot about it and it's not that they're not planning I know for a fact they are but I don't know maybe for political reasons internal political reasons they don't mention it enough but it is a critical question and what I see and what I hear from uh planning the day after is first and foremost forget about an Israeli governing of the area a civil one it won't happen nobody in Israel planed it what we will see is an an Israeli military not even control but ability to penetrate the the Gaza Strip whenever it's necessary more or less like what is happening today in the West Bank uh to take care of immediate H threats and in terms of civil civilian matters I see uh uh an independent Palestinian Administration assisted by International of course International the international Arena and you know what I have a reason to be optimistic about it as well I since 2014 I was talking to many fundraisers okay for the Gaza Strip and they told me you know many good willing countries since 2014 namely protective Edge don't want to invest money in the Gaza Strip so what I think is that after Hamas will be eradicated and eliminated people will or people donor donor country like Japan like Germany like the US will come back and invest money in the Gaza Strip which hopefully will be peaceful you know in the long run har from Tel Aviv University thanks so much for your time today thank you very
