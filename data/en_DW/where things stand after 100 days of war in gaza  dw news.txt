in Israel people are calling on the government to do more for the release of the hostages according to Israeli authorities during the October 7th attacked by Hamas 257 people were abducted in total 110 have been released alive and 11 bodies retrieved Israel believes 136 hostages are still held in Gaza though it suspects some of them are dead tens of thousands of Israelis have gathered in protest in Tel Aviv demanding the release of hostages held by Hamas the protesters are marking 100 days since Hamas took the hostages during the October 7th attacks Israelis are calling on their government to do more for the release of the hostages who include civilians and Israeli soldiers Israel's military campaign has damaged or destroyed around half of gaza's buildings and displaced almost 2 million people some Israelis have doubts about the way the war is being carried out but Israel has vowed to press on with its military campaign to eliminate Hamas for the people of Gaza the last 100 days have been nothing short of a disaster many have lost not just their homes livelihoods and loved ones but also any hope that life can ever return to normal a tragic catastrophic Indescribable situation everyone saw thousands of Martyrs and wounded those who were not martyred were wounded who wasn't wounded had their home destroyed those who didn't lose their homes were displaced no one in Gaza has been Untouched by the conflict this family say they used to be wealthy but like thousands of other garans they've been forced to flee and now they're making pastries to survive just 100 days ago we were living in Paradise on Earth we had buildings houses and possessions we enjoyed a wonderful luxurious life since the start of the war we've lost everything our homes our possessions everything in Israel too the pain is real despite efforts to chase it away at this Rave in Tel Aviv it's one of a number of events taking place to Mark the 100th day since the terrorist attack and to plead for the return of the more than 100 hostage still being held in Gaza including one of the youngest abductees is it possible to make something to free them from the Hamas to bring him in his family back to Israel to celebrate the birthday with his family is it possible Israel's government says it will push ahead with its campaign until the hostages have been returned and its other War aims have been achieved including the elimination of Hamas and the threat it poses to the Jewish state with no end in sight it seems a suffering is set to [Music] continue all right let's uh speak now to DW correspondent Tanya Kramer who joins us from Jerusalem Tanya great to see you so it's been a 100 days since the war between Israel and Hamas began thousands of people have died in that time tell us what the atmosphere is like in Israel at this Grim Milestone well I think it really depends who you ask here and I talked to some people here uh this morning in Israel there's really a somber mood a sad mood as well um people are having you know they said to me mixed feelings about uh still uh people are saying you know what happened on October 7 took away their sense of safety uh and security a lot of question s being asked about how that could happen but also of course now about the war there's a lot of focus of course in Israel what's happening uh uh in in the fighting every morning uh there news of soldiers that have been killed uh in uh Gaza and the fighting there's a bit less focus on what's happening on the civilian population side in Gaza here in the reporting and of course a lot of focus is still as you said uh on the hostages uh it's believed that 136 hostages are uh still in Gaza and people are really asking uh what is being done to bring them home Tanya Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will continue its war against Hamas until they are victorious and they won't be stopped by anyone is this a stance that has wide support in Israel I think it still does have uh Brad support at least when you're looking at polls and surveys that people do uh support support uh the war efforts but of course there also uh other people are saying you know Israel needs to look at what what will happen next and of course there's also the sense that this uh war in Gaza while it is continuing there are other threats especially also when you look at the northern border uh uh the uh crossb fire that has been intensifying or appeared to have been intensifying in the past weeks between Israel uh and Hezbollah but at the same people at the same time you know there are also a lot of people that are still displaced uh in in in the South alongside the Gaza uh border area but also in the north and these people are still also in hos in in in in hotels here and they have not been uh able to go home but also what we are seeing there's of course more question asked where this will going and also the question about responsibility um because prime minister Benjamin netan has not taken responsibility what happened on October 7th and according to pause a lot of people I would like to see elections once this war will end thanks Tanya tww
