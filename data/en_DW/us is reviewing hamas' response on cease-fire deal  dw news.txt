US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is pressing ahead with a diplomatic tour of the Middle East in the hope of securing a ceasefire in Gaza blinkin is in Doha where he has held talks with the qari Prime Minister lean said negotiators have received a response from Hamas on a framework for a potential hostage deal lean says he plans to discuss this with Israeli leaders tomorrow Wednesday here is US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin when I was last in the region a few weeks ago uh I said then that there's a very powerful path uh that we can see before us to actually get to Lasting peace and security and it's coming ever more sharply into Focus an Israel that is integrated into the region with security guarantees from its neighbors and partners alongside a practical time-bound irreversible path to a Palestinian State living side by side in peace Israel with the necessary security arrangements for both peoples uh but there are those who want to move the region in a different direction and take a different path and who are actively working to sabotage every effort to move toward lasting peace and security all right let's take this story now to Jerusalem my colleague Ben fulan is on the story for us Ben talk to me what is Anthony blinkin going to be bringing to Israel tomorrow that he has received in Qatar he'll be bringing a response from the hus leadership that's according uh to well according to the Qatari PM a positive response uh he also wants to bring lasting and fair and just TR uh peace to the region uh he's talking about saving civilian lives not just uh Palestinian lives but Israeli lives as well the lives of the hostages in the balance at the moment some 136 of them believe to be dead or alive in Gaza and then we're talking about a million Palestinian civilians crowded into the rougher border crossing region where Israel is talking about launching military operations a ground offensive uh in the coming hours or days we don't know uh we've been held in the dark on so much of this Brent and we still don't know what this hostage deal exactly entails just that Hamas wants a ceasefire a lasting ceasefire and then a release of the hostages Israel demanding the release of the hostages and the possibility then of some sort of ceasefire yeah and I'm talking about the hostages tonight Israel have said that 31 of the remaining hostages in Gaza 31 hostages have died what more do we know there' had been reports earlier in the day an IDF uh spokesperson uh from the Israeli military confirming that 31 of the hostages are dead and that the families have been informed this has been uh one of the biggest problems Brent where into day23 and uh so many of these uh relatives of hostages just haven't known the fate of the captives um some of these are believed to have died on October 7 there are suggest that some of them died while in captivity we just don't know um Hamas had been threatening to kill them Hamas had also been saying all along that some of these hostages had died in Israeli air strikes perhaps under other circumstances we just don't know uh hamus also hasn't been able to confirm at times their whereabouts and their whereabouts are so crucial to this hostage deal actually taking place and going ahead yeah it'll be interesting to see if what or if this plays any role tomorrow when Anthony blinkin is in Israel Ben fulan with the latest in Jerusalem Ben thank you thanks Bren let's get across to Cairo where journalist kareim El goari standing by for us a this is of course far from blinken's first attempt at shuttle diplomacy here but it is his first visit to the region since the US brokered an offer for what could be the first extended ceasefire can you remind us what exactly is on the table with this proposal well what's on the table is what was negotiated already in Paris between the Israelis the Americans q and the Egyptians uh it's some kind of temporary ceasefire and then a phased exchange of hostages uh and prisoners uh of course the there's one big sticking point and we don't have yet an official answer uh from Hamas to this proposal we know that Hamas is extremely critically because their demand is an end of the war and then the exchange of prisoners so um they want some kind of guarantee that there is not a temporary ceasefire but there is the final end of the war and then the exchange of prisoners that is the main sticking point and as you could hear in your report Israel prime minister benam nanahu is saying he will move on until H the victory against Hamas until Hamas is destroyed difficult to see how Hamas is giving up its hostage it's the only leverage they have right now uh towards Israel while while benam is announcing that he is out there to destroy the very same people he's negotiating with right now indirectly and kareim meanwhile Israel's defense minister has said said that the Israeli offensive will eventually reach Rafa that is that southernmost town in Gaza right on the Egyptian border um you know we know that more than half of gazin are now displaced and living in miserable conditions uh packed there in Rafa can you tell us a little bit what an Israeli assault on Rafa would mean uh for its neighbor Egypt well it's as you already mentioned it's a very desperate situation in uh in Rafa people are there a million people there escaped from other areas in the Gaza Strip with basically their back to the Egyptian border the big fear of course on the Egyptian side is that there will be some kind of displacement scheme a bigger displacement scheme of Palestinians coming over to the Egyptian side that is a Palestinian and also an Arab trauma that whenever Palestinians left their areas they were never able to come back and that's the big fear in Egypt that it's for sure sure also part of the discussions with blinkin blinkin already mentioned several times in the last days that he would be against some permanent displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip towards Egypt but that really Remains the biggest fear in Cairo well thank you so much for bringing us up to speed there as always that is journalist Kareem El goari in Cairo for us and I'd like to get some more analysis from Christina kou a deputy managing director at the German Marshall fund South think tank thank you so much for speaking with us on DW news I think many have been asking why we have not seen the United States putting more pressure on Israel uh to end its campaign and the fighting in Gaza and I'm curious to get your take there uh why do you think we haven't seen stronger pressure from someone like Anthony blinkin well good morning well there is a public pressure there's there's pressure behind the scenes and the letter I'm sure is to be surely taking place um we have reports that secretary blink that the US government is increasingly frustrated obviously with Benjamin Netanyahu um we are an in electoral year for the United States the United States public opinion well the the the the political uh elites on both sides of the political Spectrum are um are are very Pro Israeli it's the Israeli security is one of the main interests of the United States in the Middle East so this is a very difficult situation for the US government a very high ti What kind of support to show publicly what kind of pressures uh to articulate publicly um I think that we have seen uh a great pressure increasing not necessarily probably had pressure increasing over the last uh few weeks as compared to the the immediate reaction to the sth October attacks um but again I think it's mainly due to domestic uh domestic concerns that we don't do this and I'm curious if you could tell us a little bit more about about which domestic influences are at play here because it's always interesting when you look at us foreign policy what is going on at home and how that affects what is happening abroad why do you think we see such strong support for Israel um from both sides of the island the US well again well first of all you know it's the the the security of Israel is a has a long tradition and you US foreign policy this is one of the few items where you have by uh bipartisan support if you compare for example the discussions that have been taking place in Congress on adopting um um aid for Ukraine versus support to Israel in security terms you know that these both things have been discussed in parallel the ones on Ukraine were highly travia whereas the the the the the ones on Israel were easy so uh there is really a strong pressure in General on the on any US government to take care of of Israeli security and make this a high priority and of course in a situation like this where Israel is attacked uh um out of the blue for the isra government in such a horrendous fashion uh the first reaction for any US government has to be to fully throw their weight behind the Israeli government and again uh so I don't think they have a choice in an electoral year this is this this pressure gets even worse and the United States is of course such a powerful partner um for Israel I'm curious whether they're powerful enough to make Benjamin nanaho change his mind uh or whether there are also other International partners and allies uh that might have influence on him um I think it would be mistake to assume that it's mainly International allies or Partners externals who are the ones the players that going to turn the tide here on Nan I think both with regard to netan and his government and regard to Hamas we have a situation here where um they would only agree to a change of the current status quo if that benefits them and if it doesn't mean their own political the end of their political careers and as the situation stands now right now um Netanyahu has all is to continue the current situation because all of the current options for ending this the current the current the War uh would most likely result in his out in the end of his own political career in the same way Hamas has no interest in giving up as the previous speaker mentioned has no interest in giving up up the hostage has no interest in in in ending the situation it is now so the there the US can pressure as much as as it wants um if the if diplomacy doesn't produce uh an offer or a solution that would incentivize any of these actors to uh to move and right now clearly we don't have we don't have that situation where Netanyahu sees that it is in his interest to stop the fighting and I think that is a process that is the process that um that blinkin is trying to bring forward in all this shuttle diplomacy currently well thank you so much for your analysis today that is Christina kou from the German Marshall funds sou we very much appreciate your
