now militants are still holding more than half the hostages in Secret locations across Gaza the uncertainty of getting more family members out alive is nerve-wracking for relatives in Israel talks for another ceasefire are ongoing giving a glimmer of hope but the ordeal is far from over DW's Ben fulan met a 27-year-old film student in Tel Aviv Shir havron for whom so much is at stake it's really hard killed or kidnapped the unimaginable fate that befell 12 of Shira harron's relatives it's been uh hell on Earth for our family um since October 7th obviously we um lived that day every day when Hamas classified a terror organization by multiple countries attacked Israel including the kabut they killed her aunt two uncles and one of their caregivers they then took nine of her family members hostage feeling abandoned by the Israeli government Shir havron turned to Germany where she also holds citizenship to raise awareness of her family's ordeal and we expect Germany to do whatever it can in every channel of it she also traveled to Brussels to ask the European Parliament to help put pressure on Israel to reach a deal the fact that we are here is a desperate act to ask for more help eight of shir's family the women and children were released during the Poor's infighting deal of late November it was a miracle to see the people coming back from like hell you know almost it was amazing it was exciting it was moving it was unbelievable it was surreal because it was seeing them on screen on television with the rest of you know the people of Israel and maybe the world you know so it was a moment a very private moment that became very public but Taj sham father of two of the released children is still in Gaza I think the message now or our goal now is to keep going and even though a lot of people are back there is still a lot of people that haven't got back and my family got a gift seeing some of my family back but a lot of families didn't they're still sitting and waiting and crying and shouting and fighting for their loved ones what's it like being at the mercy of the world you mentioned public opinion um having that that pressure on you basically I come from a very complicated uh politically I mean a region and and we as a family we are and this is the the hard part we are people of Peace obviously there's an occupation in this country and it needs to end but you know war is not an answer people are surprised when I'm saying that I still believe in peace and I want it because of what happened to my family but I think it's the only solution and that my family should be the last people that are dying and murdered over this you know crazy political situation and so are the people in Gaza I identify with a pain you know I see big families with so many names like uh erased and crossed and and it reminds me of my family because we have so many victims as well DW Middle East analyst shaie ranus joins me here in the studio good to see you shaie um we know that 138 hostages are still being held by Hamas does the Israeli government have a plan to get them back well if you ask Israeli officials it's clear to them that only through pressure on the uh on Hamas via military operation they managed to get the previous deal and that's a plan for getting more hostages out they feel that they need to push strong in Gaza mostly now in hanus in the south of Gaza where uh the leaders of hamas's families are from we're not sure they're still in in the Gaza Strip themselves but they're from so the symbol behind that uh is for them Pro that's what they assume will be the only way to get um you know a better deal or a new deal um to get the hostages out if if at all you know we will see serious STS resumed but Israel feels that military operation is the only way forward and this military operation is obviously uh continuing now now on the southern Gaza Strip is there a sense amongst Israelis that this strategy is putting the lives of the hostages in danger and even more danger yes there's there's growing concern for the self well-being of those hostages we we hear now after the release of of over a hundred over several hundred dozens uh we hear horrible stories the conditions they were held in the danger that they that they were exposed to due to Israel operation in the Gaza Street many of them tell about hearing the bombs being exposed to first of all they had to move constantly on the Run trying to save their lives uh from the bombings but also D just that are occurring you know when you sitting in a in a tunnel and a and a the building above you is collapsing on your head of course that also might have an effect on on those hostages so there is a growing concern of how the Israeli operation is affecting the the hostages held in Gaza uh very much yes and and the family members of the hostages are saying that the you know the military is absolutely prioritizing fighting over bringing the hostages home so what does the government say is priority trying to to to if you hear officials Israel politicians they say constantly they have two goals they want to eradicate Hamas in Gaza in and they want also to bring back all the hostages what we're seeing uh that the families are saying especially now after we hear more and more testimonies of people who were in Gaza held hostages they're saying these two do not work hand inand we either bring back the hostages right now because these people have very limited time the conditions are very dire um and then we take care of Hamas later um there's a lot of anger we've seen the meeting yesterday of the n with the families over 2 hours they sit together we've we've heard them uh lash at the politicians with a lot of frustration and Madness basically saying you've had years and years to take care of Hamas now you need to take care of our loved ones and bring them home um if you hear netan speak the and other ministers in the war cabinet they keep trying to convince the families these two things do go hand inand fing Hamas and bringing the hostages goes hand in hand but we slowly see a rift going you know uh growing in among Israeli population between those who feel like we need to fight Hamas no matter what and those say we need to bring back the hostages and then you know stall a bit with the fighting because that's the top priority you mentioned the the intense anger that is being directed towards uh the Israeli Prime Minister um from the families of the hostages mounting political pressure as well how tenuous is his position right now well weirdly enough he's he's his he is a very you know Israel was in a on a brink of of of internal Civil War as this happened and N himself is is still dealing with uh you know he's his trial is going to be resumed because he's on trial for you know uh bravery and so on so he is still in a very precarious political position and he is hoping to Galvanize uh the success in war to get stronger support but then at the same times as we're talking about this Rift we are also seeing very clear division between those who support Netanyahu and and the cause of fighting Kamas above all and the more Lefty Camp also now connected to the hostages saying let's wait with that let's bring hostages first uh Nan is gonna have to gonna have to pay a political price no matter what he decides here shaie rosanas our Middle East analyst thanks so much for that welcome
