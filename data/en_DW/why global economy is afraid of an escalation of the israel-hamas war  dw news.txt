well the conflict in the Middle East isn't just causing Global concern in the political and diplomatic Arena there's also increasing apprehension about the effect it could have on the global economy if history is any guide the conflict has the potential to send Financial shock waves far beyond the Middle East empty highways stretching for miles across Germany and other Western European countries that was in 1973 during the oil crisis during the yam kapor war between Israel on one side and Egypt and Syria on the other Arab states had stopped supplying the West with crude oil after the Hamas terror attack on Israel and the Israeli retaliatory strikes in the Gaza Strip many wonder will the world once again face a scenario of oil scarcity the price of oil Rose after the Hamas attack however it has since normalized and unlike 50 years ago experts today do not see a united front of the Arab oil producing countries against the West cartel today we do not have a cartel instead we have highly diverging interests even within the camp of the Gulf States especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran and this conflict did not exist in the past that is to say we are not currently expecting a situation like we had in 1973 another reason a more globally interconnected economy Arab state are shareholders with considerable interest in corporations in Europe and the us including in non- oil related firms like Volkswagen Daimler or Seamans however an escalation of the conflict could fundamentally change the situation for example in the straight of horutz this narrow straight just over 30 mies wide is controlled by Iran considered to be the main supporter of Hamas and Hezbollah 20% of the entire Global oil production must pass through here in the past Iran has repeatedly threatened to block the straight and has impeded the passage of tankers from Western countries a military escalation could trigger Iran to step in again and cause the global economy to collapse the risk of a recession in the Euro Zone cannot be ruled out due to an escalating conflict not at all simply because the Euro Zone with its high energy demand is primarily dependent on the Gulf States in the Middle East as a whole cuz I'm tanked countries with energy intensive and processing Industries like Germany would be particularly affected right let's discuss this further with Rob wats from DW business good to see you mate um why is it so important to the global economy that this Israel Hamas War doesn't escalate further because it's as simple as the further the conflict spreads the bigger the impact for the global economy and we know what that impact can be because we can look at past conflicts but but also because economists have been working their way through all of these various scenarios and looking at the potential impact that it could have and what they're treating as I suppose the worst realistic scenario is that we not only have it spreading beyond the existing territory of Israel and Gaza but into the wider region and then ultimately a direct war between Israel and Iran and that puts various factors into play but most crucially oil and global shpping Iran has control of the straight of formus through which a fifth of global oil and all manner of other non-oil products passes but also Iranian oil is one of the few things that's keeping oil prices at a reasonable level at the moment so disruption to that would be a big problem and actually economists at Bloomberg have been crunching the numbers on this they believe that in the worst case scenario a trillion dollars could be wiped off the global economy in one year if that were to happen we could see oil at $150 a barrel at the moment it's around $90 a barrel it's never been that high so you paint a a picture of a pretty big problem but it's not the only problem because many parts of the world are still dealing with the Fallout from the Ukraine war and the pandemic does this war in the Middle East now affect those economic recoveries that are just underway again it all depends on the degree of escalation but we know that those recoveries are very fragile here in the Euro zone for example and in the United States they're walking a tight rope between getting inflation down and not sending their own economies into a recession and it would only really take a Tremor to knock them off that tight rope and something like oil prices surging and global Shipping being disrupted are exactly the sort of tremor that could do that because both of those things are inflationary it becomes more expensive to produce things but it also becomes more expensive to send those things around the world and then even if you look at you know much po poorer countries emerging economies are much more vulnerable to fluctuations in Energy prices so really it's the last thing that recovering economies need right now in political terms we're seeing countries having to pick sides in the conflict I guess economically as well what does that mean in how these countries will then trade with each other this is quite a familiar story from the past couple of years isn't it and we've seen how this Dynamic plays out as countries have been falling in behind Ukraine and behind Russia they've become reluctant to trade with other nations with whom they have ideological differences this brings in one of the big buzzwords of the global economy at the moment de globalization for a long time the ethos was trade with whoever you want get yourself the best deal it doesn't matter if you're buying stuff from you know an oppressive regime on the other side of the world but that's really flipped on its head in the last couple of years most noticeably with the US trading less with China and doing more trade with Canada and Mexico you know its neighbors and people that it's got better relations with you can expect what's happening in the Middle East to accelerate that splintering as countries just try to avoid doing trade with other nations who they fear might use that trade as its own kind of weapon it's a complicated story Robert thanks for clearing it up for us Roberts from DW
