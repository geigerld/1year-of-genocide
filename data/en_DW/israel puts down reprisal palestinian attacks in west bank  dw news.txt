Israel's military says it has killed two people attempting to mount attacks in separate locations in the West Bank following its dayslong operation inside the occupied Palestinian territory several car bombs exploded in different locations including near a Israeli settlement the militant group Hamas praised the attempted attacks as a message of resistance Israeli forces have killed at least 20 people in the West Bank in recent days including a senior Hamas Commander Palestinian children wait patiently by the side of the road as their families try to decide on a safe place to flee to following Israel's raid on the West Bank City of Janine we left everything behind I have around 10 to 12 children in my house and all I wanted was to get them to a safe place the house can be replaced there are snipers on top of every building in the Eastern neighborhood shooting at anyone who passes by the street if a curtain moves they shoot as for social media there's no internet no mobile connection nothing my child here wears diapers and they've been out of stock for the past two days the city of Janine has now become the center of Israeli operations the Israeli police released this footage it claims to show its troops killing a senior leader of Hamas and Jan while he was driving the Israeli military says militant groups in the West Bank have strengthened and conducted roughly 150 attacks against Israeli forces and civilians over the past year in Janine locals say Israeli troops are surrounding the major routs leading into the city the real problems with the children there's no baby milk available and I've got a sick girl at home with a high fever we weren't expecting such things and the ambulance can't even reach us some Palestinians claim civilians are the victims of the Israeli rates clashes erupted here they hit a young man he was just a young man merely a child what did he do wrong they shot him in the head and his brother is in critical condition in the hospital despite him having done nothing wrong since the October 7 Terror attacks on Israel Israeli raids in the West Bank have increased significantly this is Israel's most intensive and prolonged operation in the West Bank in more than a year nearly 3 million Palestinians leave in the occupied territory let now talk to journalist balik sladin who's covering the events uh from Tel Aviv for us um what's the latest on the situation in the West Bank yes so yesterday apparently two Palestinians that came from a hibron area south of the West Bank went North to the giton area where one settlement that um apparently a car has exploded just outside of it in the patrol station um aiming for the or actually to pull the Israeli forces toward that explosion the attacker in that car tried also to attack the um forces there and he was shot and killed uh in the same time another Palestinian that came from the same place um did try to enter the ketur settlement um the same settlement and he tried to run over the security guard there unsuccessfully and after that he entered the settlement the security guard um shoot him or shoot toward the car and apparently because of the explosive inside that car it exploded as well at least 10 kilograms of explosive was in that car um we can imagine what would have happened if that car exploded inside the settlements among um or between other civilians or settlers right there in that settlements and that's why we're seeing that the operation that Israel is conducting right now in Janine and also has finished in places like tarim and the Jordan Valley is the um direct results of these threats from um some Palestinian militants although that they're still not named and also it's not clear whether they are affiliated with the Islamic Jihad or Hamas or any other militant group but um that's exactly the reason why we're seeing the operation in the west now in a separate development bik Israel has confirmed it has hit a medical Convoy in Gaza tell us more about that yes apparently an age group that has been operating since the beginning of the war in Gaza um wanted to supply um um Fuel and also Medical Aid for an IM morati Hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip specifically in Rafa at some point after the aid group or the Convoy itself has actually coordinated with the Israeli Army other Palestinians armed according to the is military has joined the Convoy and led the Convoy now these are the facts that we know but the ad group itself says that these Palestinians came to protect the Convoy from any looting by other Palestinians or other armed groups but the Israeli military says that they are armed or they were armed and that's why they have been targeted because of the possibility that they steal this fuel we've seen that happening over and over again now this represent the complexity in the Gaza strip and the whole situation especially because of the lack of the alternative for Hamas or for any other ruling um um party in the Gaza Strip as long as the Israeli government doesn't decide on that and also as long as it's not possible actually to replace Hamas as long as of course it still has the um authoritarian capabilities military capabilities then unfortunately we're going to see such events happening over and over again thank you very much journalist B SL their reporting from Tel Aviv thank you
