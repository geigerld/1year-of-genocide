Aid has just started arriving in Gaza via a us-built temporary floating Pier the structure is anchored to a beach in Gaza and has been designed to increase the flow of Aid into the strip however the UN has warned that the piia is no substitute for Aid deliveries via land which have been severely disrupted at the Rafa border crossing the un's food program says the threat of famine has never loomed larger for gaza's 2.2 million people explosions and gunshots ring out in the deserted streets of Rafa the southern city is the latest focus of operations of the Israeli military Israel says hamas's last remaining Fighters are based in Rafa along with the group's leaders responsible for the October 7 terror attack so it needs to send more troops there our troops have destroyed several tunnels and will destroy even more soon this activity will intensify Hamas is not an organization that can reorganize it does not have the reserve troops it does not have the ability to produce Munitions it has no supplies the result is we are cutting it off we are wearing it down Israeli tanks have already advanced deep into Rafa's Eastern outskirts pushing into residential areas un says almost 600,000 people taking refuge in Rafa have now left after Israel took control of the Gaza side of the Rafa border crossing supplies and Medical Services have been dwindling so food in which in place already uh in southern Gaza are running out um I think we're we're talking about the almost none left food in the market very soon uh there'll be none left U medical supplies in the hospitals that remain in the south a couple two or three weeks I think to go perhaps a month eight agencies say a temporary peer anchored by US troops and regular airdrops are no substitute for ground deliveries Palestinians too have been calling for the border crossing to reopen we don't want ships we want the border crossings to open we want safety we want official borders those planes as well with the parachutes they threw food at us like dogs like Beggars that doesn't work it falls on people it brings his problems with most Aid operations disrupted due to the Rua offensive and the humanitarian situation already dire agencies warned gazin are now facing an immediate risk of famine right let's get more from our correspondent Tanya ker in Jerusalem Tanya Aid has now started arriving in Gaza via the US built Pier what difference will this make to the people of Gaza well I think eight agencies is uh here would say it depends on how much Aid is arriving through that route and how it will be uh distributed uh we already heard us officials saying this is certainly not a substitute for uh getting more Aid through the lens Crossings and also uh you know this is a very complex procedure just to explain it a bit um so the the aid and the goods will arrive in Cyprus they will be screened uh over there then loaded onto commercial or military vessels that bring them to a floating uh dock or platform and there the pallets will be brought onto uh uh trucks onto that are then going onto smaller vessels and we understand that uh per per truck it could be uh you know could be five to 15 trucks on one of those smaller vessels those vessels then will uh shuttle so to speak uh this Aid and the goods uh to the a floating Pier uh where they will then drive over it and then drop it and there it will be distributed uh by uh the UN agencies mainly by the world food program and this is all happening south of Gaza City now this is of course also prone to you know weather issues high seas but also safety issues but again the pressure remains on Israel as we've been hearing here from Aid agencies to let in more Aid through the land Crossings now Israel says it has no limits uh on the aid it's letting and it has opened in the north another crossing the Western a is crossing the a is crossing but of course due to the fighting in the South now the main Crossing with Egypt is close rafar there's also the bottleneck between the North and the South and the UN has said they have always been accused that they can't really distribute they're not fast enough by Israel but un has said you know they don't have enough fuel at the moment they don't it's it's unsafe also to bring the aid uh to people so all of these factors will play and to see how this will play out given that most Aid operations have been disrupted because of the Rafa offensive what kind of food is available in Gaza and how do people get hold of it well uh we've been talking to people in the north of Gaza lately and they say the situation is extremely fluid what available sometimes uh most of the time they say canned food is uh available but it also is at a high price you know and fresh food is sometimes available but uh a father said to me on the phone that he doesn't have any income anymore so he doesn't know how uh to pay for this so and then you have the Commodities um also you know you need cooking gas you need electricity there's also an issue with the water as eight agencies have pointed out so all of this of course makes it very difficult the internal food chain in Gaza has broken down and of course there's heavy fighting going on people don't simply feel safe you know to get the food so all of this comes together we'll leave it there for the moment but thanks for joining us today DW's Tanya ker in Jerusalem
