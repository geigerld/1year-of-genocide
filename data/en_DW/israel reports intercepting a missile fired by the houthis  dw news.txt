Iran backed houthis in Yemen say they fired multiple missiles at Israel's Resort city of Viet that pronouncement came just hours after Israel's military said it had shut down a missile from Yemen before it crossed into Israeli territory the latest breast of violence between the distant enemies has led to deaths in both countries and fears of escalation in Tel Aviv Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu oversees air strike on the hoofy stronghold of Heda sometime later fighter jets bomb oil depos and a power plant in the strategically important port city on the Red Sea the Ministry of Health in sah says dozens were wounded in Raging fires triggered by the air strikes many of them admitted to hospital with severe burns we were sitting and suddenly the air strike happened there were several strikes the recent escalation comes against the backdrop of a severe humanitarian crisis in Yemen that has left around eight out of 10 people dependent on humanitarian Aid according to the UN about 80% of that Aid and 70% of All Imports enter through Huda this Israeli assault has further depleted our fuel and essential supplies needed by the citizens and the People Israel says it hit the port because the areas used to deliver AR Iran arms to Yemen and in response to months of aggression against Israel including a deadly drone attack on a residential building in Tel Aviv on [Music] Friday I have a message for Israel's enemies make no mistake we will defend ourselves by all means on all fronts anyone who harms us will pay a very heavy price for their aggression and race recent months Iran boui militants have repeatedly attacked ships passing through the Red Sea in a stated attempt to force an end to Israel's military campaign in Gaza they have also launched missiles and drones directly at Israel but most of those projectiles were intercepted until Friday in Yemen's capital A houthi spokesman said his forces wouldn't be deterred by Israel's threat the yemeni Armed Forces also affirm that the response to the Israeli aggression on our country is inevitable and will be great and mighty Allah willing no empty words on Sunday the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile fire towards the resort town of elat one of multiple drones and ballistic missiles hthi militants declared they fired at Israeli Targets in and along the Red Sea special correspondent EA Ibrahim has been following events from Jerusalem they're certainly concerning for uh the region uh I mean this we're now seeing a sort of tit fortat strike uh um countering another strike between Israel and the houthis in in Yemen and this adds another layer of tension and escalation to the situation in the country N9 months of the war in Gaza and of course the ongoing clashes between Israel and Hezbollah the Israeli Northern uh border so this just adds another layer of uh instability uncertainty although it is too early to tell uh what the end of these strikes uh could be if it will lead to more escalation or if in fact the huis may be deterred by uh the most recent Israeli strike on that port in in Yemen right there's a lot happening today Israel's military is starting to draft Ultra Orthodox men this is because of a landmark supreme court order it's a very sensitive issue in Israel how much of a threat is this for prime minister bamin Netanyahu and his government it could be quite threatening for his governing Coalition uh his Coalition Partners uh come from the ultra Orthodox uh uh political parties in Israel and they of course the uh Benjamin netanyahu's uh Partners vehemently reject this uh Court uh uh ruling so if they bolt out of that Coalition that could lead to the collapse of uh his government at a time where his popularity is already at an alltime uh low because of uh the war and the fact that there are still hostages held uh uh in in in Gaza uh and so this could you know spell trouble for Benjamin netanyahu's governing Coalition although we'll have to wait and see uh how this plays out in the coming days right um more on that Netanyahu is also Al facing additional pressure inside Israel protesters filled the street in Tel Aviv again demanding a deal to return the remaining hostages how's all this playing out ahead of a trip to the US next week well the United States is Israel's biggest Ally and the protesters that hit the streets in Tel elsewhere every uh week they're acutely aware of that so uh they are often in these protests calling directly on the US government to apply more pressure on Hamas and Israel to reach a deal and so even though these protests happen on a weekly basis since the War Began uh PE families of hostages but also uh Israelis from all walks of life taken to the streets demanding a deal we can expect that they will have a heightened tone as uh the Prime Minister visits uh the United States because it's been 9 months and there are many many families that are still waiting for for their loved ones to come back alive or dead right special correspondent AI ibraim in Jerusalem thank you
