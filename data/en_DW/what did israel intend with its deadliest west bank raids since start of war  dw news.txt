to Israel now which says its troops have killed a Palestinian militant commander in the raid in the occupied West Bank at least 16 Palestinians have been killed in the operation that began late on Tuesday Israel says the raid is aimed at destroying terrorist infrastructure the UN Secretary General has called for the operation to end Antonio gutes said it was fueling an already explosive situation in the West Bank the operation is currently focused on refugee camps in tuas Janine and taram here in the shattered streets of taram Israel says it has already achieved significant success this is the largest military operation in the occupied West Bank in years it says local Islamic Jihad leader Muhammad jabber seen here in file footage was killed in gunfight at a mosque Israeli troops had tried and failed before to eliminate jabber he's accused of carrying out numerous attacks on Israelis Palestinian civilians are once again paying the cost of the Israeli raids we were asleep and woke up to the gunshots at around 3:30 a.m. I started waking my wife up telling her the Army are shooting at the house I was barely able to wake her up and they hit the house with a rocket we ran my wife and I to the other room they fired another rocket my son and his wife are on the second floor they hit them with a rocket his family was able to escape their home with their lives While others are afraid to go outside watching the chaos unfold around them the situation is difficult the Army comes and goes their movements are not normal it's quiet here but when the bulldozers come they destroy everything we're afraid we hear the bulldozers the shooting now there is bombing in Gaza now there is bombing in the refugee camp Israeli forces roaming the streets in search of militants have also created serious problems for the Health Care system in the areas being raided medical workers say troops are blocking access to ambulances the Israeli Army refuses entirely to allow ambulances to enter whether uncoordinated or coordinated even if we are allowed to enter as you see the ambulances cannot access the camps or even reach humanitarian cases and people with diseases the UN is urging Israel to ensure injured people can obtain medical care it's also calling for a halt to the operation in the West Bank saying the campaign is fueling an already explosive situation and for more on that we can I'll speak to DW correspondent Tanya ker who joins me from Jerusalem Tanya you were in tarem just yesterday give us a sense of the situation there well what we could see and we couldn't go into shamas the one of the refugee camps there in Karim that was you know is the main place where the Israeli Army uh is uh was operating uh uh yesterday uh we could see the large destruction that was left behind there by uh the bulldozers they're going in we could see the Army vehicles coming in and out also hearing uh some explosions and uh shootings uh there and seeing the ambulances actually waiting outside uh on one of the main roads uh um then to to go in uh from uh time uh to time but uh we could also see the impact mainly on on tarum the city of tarum itself where I was able to talk to some people saying you know they they have experienced of course military raids many many times this is a daily occurrence in the occupied West Bank but they're saying this is very intense and most have been staying in the safety uh of their homes uh uh trying not to be uh too much uh in the streets uh as the Army also of course uses now drones and air strikes uh in uh the West Bank now we are hearing from the Israeli military this morning that they had targeted uh Palestinian gunmen in a drone strike in the city uh of Janine uh the military said it will provide further information later on so uh according to Palestinian reports there a car was targeted and there are also reports of other uh raids and other uh cities in the occupied West Bank so this operation is ongoing uh T we'll come back to you in a moment to talk about another issue Israel and the World Health Organization have agreed to begin a polio vaccination campaign for children in the Gaza Strip on Sunday it involves apparently a series of three-day pauses in fighting to allow health workers to administer the vaccine Hamas says it's supporting the plan gaza's hospital system has been devastated by fighting since last October leading to a General Health crisis there one and a half-year-old elen bker is too weak to move she lie still on this hospital bed with her mom and grandmother by her dehydrated and it has caused serious complications she's limp has low potassium acid in her blood and infections in both lungs these complications make Contracting poo potentially fatal for Ilan now with a 3-day truce agreed her family hopes she can safely receive the much needed vaccine the truth begins on September 1st with over 64,000 children under 10 years old expected to be vaccinated it's critical that we reach 90% vaccination that we get 90% n 9090 vaccination coverage during each round there will be two rounds and with a split of four weeks uh that is needed actually you need 90% plus to stop the outbreak uh the transmission within Gaza and prevent International spread polio and while the truce May save hundreds of thousands from polio it's only temporary after the truce ends the lives of those children in Gaza and their families remain at risk as the polar outbreak is just one part of a larger Public Health catastrophe let's go back to T in Jerusalem uh T three days of U limited pauses in fighting uh can you explain what more do we know there well it's not entirely clear yet how this will play out or the all the details of this vaccination campaign as we just heard now the World Health Organization said they have agreed with the Israeli military or that they are supportive of this vaccination uh campaign uh that would allow uh the uh teams in Gaza to actually reach out to the people there uh to vaccinate uh those children that has become really necessary after a case of polio was detected in a toddler in Gaza that is said to be the first case in in 25 years now we've heard from the uh government from officials from the Israeli government they remained much more vague there was actually a statement uh by the prime minister's office uh uh published on Wednesday they refuted the idea of pauses in fighting they were talking about allocating certain places in the Gaza Strip to allow this uh vaccination to take place now this would happen according to the World Health Organization in three different zones that could last two three days in certain time zones now eight agencies have said it's absolutely necessary to be able to plan that they get some you know clarity about this because it's so difficult as so many Garin have been under evacuation order and displaced again in recent days time and time again and it's very very difficult to reach out to all these people that they also feel safe to come uh to these vaccination points if this will all play out as they have planned the correspondent Tanya ker there reporting from Jerusalem thank you
