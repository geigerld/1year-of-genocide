Egypt is set to host talks in the latest Push by us and Arab diplomats to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and gain the release of Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza Israeli media are reporting that a government delegation will attend the summit despite the security situation in Northern Israel Hamas says its representatives in Cairo will meet with Egyptian delegates but not take part in direct talks which have been stalled for months so let's get more on this from Naf altani he is the former Qatar defense intelligence director and a lecturer in the fields of international relations and defense in Doha very good to have you with us naav the negotiations come amid what has been described as one of the biggest attacks by Hezbollah on Israel since October 7th terror attack by Hamas so what impact is the situation having on these talks now well thank you for having me um obviously every uh kinetic operation uh will have the threat of impacting negotiations uh negatively however as it seems uh as of tonight uh that uh negotiations and mediation continue and they are not affected by the operations that happened uh earli of this morning local time and hopefully this will continue it is a good thing that negoti ations are going on because the window is closing for a positive outcome so what exactly do the nego negotiations stand at this point well the mediators have put clearly three main points that they want to focus the attention of the negotiating parties the three main points is a cessation of violence and end of operation or a a long-term ceasefire as as some would would uh you know determin we see how that goes but a cessation of violence second return of hostages obviously through a regimented uh program agreed between the two parties and third uh the humanitarian Aid which Gaza is is really in need of right now and the situation is going forward unfortunately in in a in a negative sense when it comes to humanitarian Aid unfortunately the negotiating parties have also added different elements other than the three main focused elements uh the Israelis for instance uh as just one example brought in the Philadelphia cor Corridor as another element of securing that and having the Israeli forces there the Egyptians obviously are against that for many reasons least of which is that would need to uh remend uh the um uh the peace uh Accord between Egypt and Israel that was done back in the 70s and that's just taking everything back to a different direction and a much more complicated direction is this a a sticking point the one you just mentioned uh is this one that could uh um destroy the negotiations basically ruin them because you said the window is very very short now very close the window is closing very fast uh I don't personally think that that is a sticking point but it does depend on negotiating parties obviously opening up negotiations for other elements that were not in the original uh Biden plan that was proposed by the Biden Administration May and then fortified by the un's security council's uh decision I think that deviation or any deviation would just make things much more complicated the mediator's role now is to focus and refocus the attention of negotiating parties no one will get everything they want today or when the negotiations hopefully succeed that's something that both parties must understand but this should be also understood as a stepping stone towards further um you know discussions and negotiations but getting something good is much better than getting everything perfect and I think the mediators are focusing on that and that is the biggest challenge and has been the biggest challenge especially in the past week yeah you've been mentioning the two sides uh negotiating Hamas however will not directly participate in the talks it will instead be briefed on the statos uh your view on that please well two things on that first of all this is not new this is what's been going on in the past it will be it will continue to go on I think uh moving forward uh it's change a bit uh obviously that shouldn't come as a surprise um the assassination of is Han the leader of the political Wing who headed the negotiating team on his end obviously he did not participate but he over saw the negotiation as the head of the political uh Wing uh removing him from the equation doesn't make negotiations easy when you assassinate the the side that you're trying to negotiate with however uh Hamas has committed at least until this point to be back briefed and to cooperate and they've agreed as they said principle to the Biden's plan now the uh technical teams uh from the mediators working with the negotiation negotiating parties have a lot on their shoulders to bridge the gaps through what is now being famously known as the bridging proposals to make sure that you can come as close as possible to the initial Biden administrations plan and move forward na Alani the former Qatar defense intelligence director joining us in Doha thank you so very much for sharing your insights with us thank you for having me
