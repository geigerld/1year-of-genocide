the un's top court is due to rule on South Africa's demand that Israel immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza let's have a closer look at what's happened with the case so far it's a hugely divisive and emotive trial home please be seated South Africa's case at the un's top Court states that Israel's acts and omissions in Gaza are genocidal in character South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza and the deliberate restriction of food water medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza demonstrates that the government of Israel not Jewish people or Israeli citizens the government of Israel Israel and its military is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group South Africa has filed more than 80 pages of evidence to support its claim that Israel has breached us obligations under the genocide convention a document from 1948 which both Israel and South Africa have signed reputation of this court Israel rejects the allegation its legal team says the entire case is invalid the simple reality is that the events which are the subject of these proceedings are occurring in the framework of a war instigated by Hamas governed by the legal framework of international humanitarian law they do not fall within the remit of the genocide convention in Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had stronger words for South Africa's move no one will stop us not the hag not the Access of Evil and no one else the hypocritical Onslaught at the ha on the Jewish state that arose From the Ashes of the Holocaust at the behest of those who came to commit another Holocaust against the Jews is a moral low point in the history of Nations the Netanyahu government its lawyers and the military say Israel is exercising its right to self-defense in response to the Hamas Terror attacks on October 7th last year and that they are doing everything possible to protect civilians in Gaza but well-respected International bodies including the UN have cast doubt over whether the huge civilian death toll in Gaza can be justified in the name of self-defense according to the health Ministry and Hamas R Gaza more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign most of them women and children those who have survived thus far are largely displaced and living in conditions the UN has described as a humanitarian nightmare to make a legal decision on whether Israel's conduct amounts to genocide could take years in court in the meantime South Africa has asked the judges in the hake to order an immediate stop to Israel campaign in Gaza drawing praise from the Palestinian un Ambassador the lesson of the Holocaust is not that you should defend Israel when it is committing atrocities but rather that one should stand against atrocities regardless of who commit them and who endure them a court order for Israel to stop its war in Gaza would be final and legally binding but the international court of justice has some history of being ignored and standing by for us at the international court of justice in the he is DW correspondent Lucia Schon Lucia today the judges there will not rule on the genocide allegations that might take years so what kind of ruling are we expecting today yeah good morning we have expecting an order on so-called preliminary measures or provisional measures these uh provisional measures are an emergency relief that is thought uh to not make the case which is at core worse so to say so South Africa when it launched its application uh it has asked for these provisional measures and it has been asking for a number of provisional measures among them uh that Israel should be ordered to stop all military action but they have also asked for allowing more humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip or also um that Israel should be ordered to collect evidence for the law case later so there's a range of these measures and the court is free uh to decide whether it will follow South Africa and Grant some of these provisional measures or whether it will um have its own provisional measures or also to dismiss them at all and do not order any provisional measures well see if the UN judges do rule that Israel has to stop its military action in Gaza what would that mean for Israel yeah so as I said this would be one option of all of the provisional measures um what I for which we still have to wait but what I can say in general is that orders of the uh International court of justice are legally binding um at the same time the court has no enforcement mechanism so it can't really force uh any state to follow it um nevertheless yes what you have to keep in mind this court behind me is the United Nations top World court so to say so the International Community is watching this case very carefully which you can also see with a lot of states have come out on the one side or the other having spoken out uh that they'll follow it and that means that a judgment comes with a certain political pressure and with a certain symbolism and that is something that legal experts say should not be underestimated even though there is no like hard enforcement behind it um but as I said we will have to stay AIT tuned whether there are any legal consequences for Israel at this stage and how they look like Lucia thank you very much that was DW's Lucia Shulton in the
