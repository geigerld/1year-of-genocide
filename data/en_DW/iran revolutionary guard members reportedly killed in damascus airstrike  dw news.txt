high-ranking members of Iran's paramilitary revolutionary guard have reportedly been killed in a suspected Israeli air strike in Syria Iranian and Syrian State media say a commander and one of his deputies died in the strike as well as two more members of the force it hit a building in the capital Damascus Rescuers are still searching for people trapped inside the rubble Regional tensions are escalating as Israel continues its war on Hamas in response to the October 7th Terror attacks let's get more on this now from DW special correspondent AIA Ibrahim in Jerusalem a can you confirm this was an Israeli attack no we can't confirm that because there has not yet been any comment from Israel regarding uh that uh air strike um that's not unusual for strikes believed to be um believed to have Israel behind them uh in the region earlier uh this month um an an alleged Israeli drone strike killed a senior Hamas advisor uh in Beirut the Israelis uh never confirmed nor denied or taken any responsibility for it although it is widely believed that it was an Israeli uh uh attack so it's not unusual not to have comment so soon after a strike or to never get comment at all this information is um you about the strike has been announced on Iranian uh State uh uh media that's according to the Reuters news agency and what do you know about the people who were targeted we know again according to uh Iranian State media that these were for um revolutionary guard advisers military advisers that were in Damascus advising uh the government of um president Bashar al-assad who is closely Allied uh with Iran one of the few strong backers of the Syrian regime uh internationally um and there's there also reports that a fifth person has been killed although the nationality and the details of that fifth person are unclear and I understand all the caveats about Israel uh acknowledging or denying the strikes but is it unusual for Israel to actually strike Targets in Syria no this is a long uh followed Israeli uh strategy uh bombing uh Iranian Targets in Syria and these strikes have become deadlier since the October uh 7th uh Terror attacks in uh in December of last year two guard uh members were killed by an Israeli strike uh in Damascus okay DW special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem thanks so much and for more on this we're joined Now by Middle East analyst Daniel gerlock who is with the magazine Zenith of which he is the editor and Chief and it's specialized on the Arab and Islamic world uh what were Iran's revolutionary guards doing in Syria in the first place well Iran's uh revolutionary God core is present in Syria since the onset of the Syrian Civil War um more visible since 2012 2013 so uh the uh irgc are advising uh the Syrian government which means in fact that have troops on the ground they're uh they're conducting operations they're having militias which are Guided by Iran but not necessarily composed of Iranian Nationals so Iran is very present as a what comes close to military ally of Syria um these strikes are not new yeah Israel has attacked Iran constantly in Syria however uh the magnitude of the strike the violence of the strike in the city of Damascus the number of of of casualties is something extraordinary and I think this is another level of escalation we have gotten newed to these strikes but this is something a bit more violent at this level taking out a spy Chief it appears has has has Israel struck this high before in Syria this big go yes multiple occasions and on the first day of Christmas 25th of December uh Israel uh assassinated a high ranking uh irgc commander in Syria uh his name was razi musawi and this was so far like according to intelligence information he was one of the key coordinators of operations of Iran in Syria with uh Iranian militias the Syrian government and at the same time Hezbollah uh I wonder to what extent Iran is going to respond to this because Iran Iran has been taking many of those strikes of course there is a shadow war going on between Israel and Iran but this happens in in a interesting geopolitical context because there have been a number of Iranian operations in the neighborhood which the Iranians brand as anti-terror operations using drones and and and also missiles but at the same time there is a very interesting sec reshuffle of the security apparatus in Damascus itself which happened yesterday so maybe it's coincidence but maybe it also uh uh there is an there is a connection between these events and to what extent is this linked to the war Israel is is waging on Hamas and Gaza it is connected because of course Iran considers Hamas a member a part of its so-called axis of resistance against Israel and the US how the Iranians have made it quite clear that the uh what happened on 7th of October was a Hamas affair a Palestinian uh attack and they had no hand in this and I think we've have we've heard a number of uh measured by its own standards not very bellicose statements of the Iranian government in particular the foreign minister who seem to want to deescalate not be dragged into this war any further uh the same of course applies to the US um but what we see on the ground is something different and I I wonder to what extent the Iranians are going to perceive this as a provocation uh the Iranians have struck a Target in Iran a few days ago in Iraq in neighboring Iraq for the first time in a a few days ago and they said they had hit a mad cell like a cell of the Israeli intelligence service that was illegally operating out of Iraq against Iranian security interest so in a way the Iranians might take this as an official as an inofficial response by the Israelis but that would at the same time mean that the Israelis admit they were hit by the strike in Iraq they were pres this at least this is how the Iranians are going to interpret it a TI for Tat that I don't know when when when it ends right well it's been taken to a different level now and I think I we should be really really worried about this because this Shadow War has been going on for some time but it seems that both sides want to show we're not afraid of entering a direct confrontation and it seems that the netan government in particular is really pushing towards it I mean this is a gesture to the Iranians to say we Israelis we're ready for everything but of course nobody in the region would be delighted about a major escalation escalation let alone the Americans or the Gulf States or anyone who would suffer from it in the region that's the last thing people need uh Middle East Anis Daniel gck thank you so much thank you Nick
