for more on this I'm very pleased to welcome harell corv a Middle East Analyst at Tel Aviv University joining us today from Jerusalem welcome just to start us off what reaction have you seen uh to this killing from from within the Israeli government are there politicians who are claiming responsibility for this attack yeah there are already several ones who are claiming responsibility or at least Jo expressing their Joy about this killing I think nobody has real doubts regarding uh the fact that it Israel responsible for it however I believe Israel is refraining from taking a full responsibility as to leave a way for for Iran to avoid the from reaction now I'd like to ask you a little bit about how the killing of Hano is going to impact the the organization of Hamas its internal structures if at all do you think this will make a big differ I do actually I mean he was a very important figure since actually the early days of Kamas he he was one of the disciples if you if you wish of ahmedin the founder of Kamas and he is a very important figure however Kamas we need to understand is not a centralized uh uh organization it is what we call the network organization or decentralized organization with many strong figures however since the the beginning of this war Israel removed H some of the main hubs if you like or main figures out of the picture uh such as salaki who was extremely instrumental of course hania and many of many key commanders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip so I think that the the organization at the moment is is really a very very severe situation and how would you say hania compares to those other figures in terms of his power and influence within Hamas well um I as a political figure he's important he is if you wish the president of of the Kamas State and his election is a is a very long is an outcome of a very long process namely if we will now need to wait for someone else that will take his his place as the head of the the political chamber we will need to usually takes month on an ordinary day these days it's just impossible to replace him because the whole voting system is based on you know connection between the Gaza Strip the West Bank and other areas and at the moment everything is disconnected so it is a crisis by itself who will take his place and who will represent Kamas case on the international Arena and and so it sounds like you're saying that this will be almost these will be almost impossible shoes to fill when you look at the Diplomatic role he he filled uh for example in carrying out uh ceasefire talks is there somebody who is a obvious successor to him well they can always put khed mashal instead of him khad Mash already fulfilled this position of the the head of the political Bureau but you know he has his own limits so I'm not sure he will do it although he's as I said experienced maybe KH the only person I can think OFA is the Deputy of Y he he lives in Qatar but he is the Deputy of V he left the Gaza trip shortly before the the the VIS attack of October 7 and he's probably the only one who can who can do this beside khed Mas with all its its limitations of course now qatar's prime minister has said uh and I'll quote here how can mediation succeed referring of course to the war in Gaza when when one party assassinates The Negotiator on the other side do you do you think that this killing on of hania is going to have serious ramifications for ceasefire discussions well I must say that logically he has a point there but having said that I think that Israel uh would not remove him would not kill him if he had such a instrumental role within the the the hostages deal it might be that in Israel he's considered as one of the barriers otherwise I don't see the logic in it but I do think that Israel has a different strategy at the moment regarding the whole issue of the deal I think it it sees what is going on in the Gaza Strip where Hamas is totally dismantle and maybe Israel is adopting a different way to to approach the the whole thing and I would again I wouldn't see a scenario they will kill a good mediator if he was such I think they probably took him as as a uh as something as a player who is more negative than positive from an Israeli perspective of course I'm curious if you could tell me a little bit more about that what do you think this different way um that you've suggested Israel could be pursuing what it looks like what what is this strategy well it's been few more than a few days okay maybe even a few weeks that we see that the connection between the Gaza Strip and the the outside world is is very shaky uh and and moreover we're not sure regarding the the Hamas possibility in the Gaza Strip to to have a let's say a viable strong communication between the different parts so I wouldn't exclude the option that Israel at the moment sees this all infrastructure military infrastructure of Hamas in the Gaza Strip as something that might be even further divided and and therefore to tackle each area where the hostages are being kept uh you know solely or or differently namely to approach to the local leaders who are holding hostages to offer them all all sorts of things and and H to try to resolve it this way um at the moment this is something which is first connected to the Hamas situation in the Gaza Strip even before we we are considering what happened between the the Gaza Strip and the outside or Hamas on on abroad uh thank you so much for sharing your insights with us on DW news that is uh Tel Aviv University analyst harl corov we very much appreciate your time today thank you very much and for the very latest we can bring in now our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem Rebecca has has there been any statement at all from the Israeli government about hanah's death no Ana there hasn't been and that's not uh uncommon that is in fact the usual way when it comes to assassinations Israel do not generally comment on them uh so we haven't had any official confirmation from them of course Iran is definitely accusing uh Israel for being responsible for this assassination but let's not forget there have been two assassinations in fact one of hezb leader Fu shukur in Beirut and the Israeli military coming out very very quickly after that assassination saying that they were indeed uh the perpetrators that They carried out that attack and that is unusual in fact for them to comment on such such an event and in fact that is likely or potentially a way of signaling not just to Hezbollah but also to people back at home to uh other people in the region and of course the US that that was the retaliatory strike that they uh that everyone was expecting to come in the wake of this uh this uh strike that we saw over the weekend killing 12 children in the Israeli occupied goolan Heights and Israel said they were going to retaliate for that but when it comes to the Han strike there has been no official word from Israel we have heard from some ministers though it's uh we we're hearing that if the prime minister's office have actually asked cabinet ministers not to say anything but we have been hearing them take to social media or seeing them take to social media uh hailing the the assassination of honey and have we heard anything at all from the families of the hostages who are still being held by Hamas well the hostages are of course you know a very huge topic here in Israel the entire country really rallying behind them and really hoping for a hostage deal of course the families themselves uh desperately wanting to see their loved ones brought home and this killing o of this assassination of Ismael hania certainly brings about fears of the hostage negotiations just where uh they will be headed now they've been stalled for a long time as we've been reporting uh and this certainly doesn't bode well for those negotiations isma Hana was one of the key uh part of the key negotiating team for the Hamas side he was considered by many as more moderate than some other of Hamas leaders namely yaha Sina in Gaza uh and he was seen going on these delegations going on these talks talking to the Israelis or not directly but through mediators talking with the Taris the Egyptians and the Americans about a potential deal and of course the family is particularly worried but the entire country worried about what this will mean now for those negotiations DW correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca RS Rebecca thank you so much for that and we can get some analysis now from our Middle East analyst shanie rosanas who joins me now in the studio shannie welcome um let's talk about the timing of this attack first of all well it you know Han usually lived in Qatar this is where he spent most of his life he's out of the Gaza area for quite some time also partially because he in sinir the leader of the military uh part of Hamas they're not on best terms um he's been mostly uh in Qatar and sometimes in in Istanbul in Turkey it's quite a rare chance to find him anywhere else and especially in tan so Israel has the way Israel sees it had to seize that very rare moment um he's been in in Qatar uh in sorry in tran only a few days so you know just to think about the operation you would need on the ground uh gather intelligence to be able to actually execute such a precise operation in such in such short time just to tell you about if it is assumingly as assumingly is Israel what kind of of operatives Israel has on the ground in tan and that for itself is a message Israel is very happy to send um to Tran saying we can make it to even you know the holiest places for you which is this compound of the re revolutionary guards where he's believed to be staying o was staying overnight so definitely that timing and everything that connected to that made helped Israel make even a bigger symbolic message uh sending there to Iran so as you say we know it was an extremely precise um uh operation but are there any other details that you can tell us about this attack well we've been learning throughout the day I mean the Iranians open an official investigation it probably it seems like it was a an Israeli missile called Spike that was shot from not too far a few buildings away from the secured compound where Hano was staying theight just he was there just shortly after he met himself with the supreme leader ran K overnight just to tell you you know the importance of hania for the Iranians and you know they tried to give him the best conditions and they felt and he also felt that he is at the most safe place he can be in the in the world and I'm sure he did not expect that so this is more of the uh what we know for now we also know some of the Iranians are suggesting maybe the bodyguards um that were surrounding him Were Somehow involved in maybe tipping off Israel I think for now Iran you know the confusion the anger the frustration all of that you know might be uh leading them to point in all different directions it's a bit too early to you know drill down all the exact details of what happened overnight and what would you say can we expect from Teran now well there's no doubt there will be a response that we've been hearing many people in Iran saying that I don't think this is the first priority that the the new president wanted to deal with he wanted to you know bring more uh relief on sanctions and focus more on the economy uh but you know the Middle East and Iran specifically you know you can never uh really just stick to that um however I think we need to see the different possibilities for Iranian response uh either through the proxies whom we've seen acting against Israel the last months like the hooes from the south in Yemen or hisbah in Lebanon which also because of the assassination last night before Han also have their own agenda you know clearing their uh you know showing their grievances to Israel so maybe something joint along with hasbalah that could be one option and other option would be a direct attack on Israel this barrier this red line that was inconceivable for many years was already crossed in April uh but then I think they would try to be very strategic in the in the Target that they're choosing it would have to be Central enough but then at the same time not too damaging in order to prevent a wider escalation which I think is still the presumption you know Iran would want you know want to respond but not lose control over U over a greater war and a third Pro possible scenario is for Iran to respond somewhere outside of Israel or maybe on European ground maybe the Olympic Games now happening in Paris this is something where many Israelis are pointing their fingers at we know there's going to be tightened security for the Israeli delegates there that's some of what we're seeing happening and it could also be taking some weeks we've seen it in the past you know Iran will take time to consider and see what would be the most strategically uh you know occasion for for a response uh we need to be on high alert for the next the foreseeable future let's put it that way from Israel's perspective I what is Israel's end game here because you know working towards the ceasefire doesn't seem to be the priority right now I think you're right in that aspect I mean this does not seem like a move of somebody who's trying to wind things down you know netan was in the Congress the US Congress last week asking for more support for more weapon but more political support basically asking for permission to go on on and what we're seeing him do is that he's doubling down his efforts not only in Gaza but also expanding into other what Israel is called the exis of evil uh that is operating against Israel and going all the way in but if has this you know this is quite when we talk about the tactics about the the ability to execute such an operation and the message it sends I think it's quite impressive you know but then has it really fundamentally changed things on the ground has it brought the hostages closer to coming home has it brought Israeli citizens that had to be evacuated from the houses closer to coming back home or are we actually taking one step further into even more instability even more Bloodshed even more um you know a much wider escalation I think this is the bigger question we need to ask today which begs the question also can the Israeli Prime Minister sustain this stance with the Israeli people well I think momentarily there's a lot of national pride uh aside from the hostages and their families we see a lot of of anger a lot of frustration and sadness there today uh but among the public there's a feeling yes we're finally getting the lead we're not just being you know dragged to response and we we can still show that Israel has its military and intelligence might uh that we've been so used to relying on up until October 7th so in that aspect it is working but I think you know netan is is a figure today in Israel that is so divisive those who are supporting him will support anything he does those who are against him oppose everything he does I I I think it's a bit too soon to tell if this will actually lead to any meaningful political game or political change in Israel DW's Middle East analyst sh rosan sh thank you so much now the Iranian government says that a funeral service for Ismael hania will be held in tan before his body is then taken to cat for a burial he was seen as a relative moderate in amongst hamas's leaders Ismael Han greets Iran's new president in what would be one of his last meetings just hours after attending the president's inauguration he and his bodyguard were killed in a strike on his residence in tan at the time of his death Han was the political face of Hamas the militant islamist group that carried out the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel Hamas Fighters killed around 1200 people and took more than 250 others hostage near half of whom are still held in Gaza Hana had not lived in Gaza for several years but ran Hamas from qat where he lived in Exile born near a Gaza City refugee camp the 62-year-old was the child of Palestinian refugees from the village of Alura near Ashkelon he joined Hamas when it was founded in 1987 and was arrested and jailed by Israel during the first intifada the uprise ing against Israeli occupation Han was exiled to Lebanon but he returned to Gaza following the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords he became the Palestinian prime minister in 2006 and continued to rise through hamas's ranks eventually becoming its political Chief in 2017 while hamas's Gaza leader Yahya sinoa is believed to have been The Mastermind of the October 7th attacks Han was seen as a more moderate force in Hamas he has lost several of his own family members in Israeli attacks on Gaza which have killed nearly 40,000 people since then three of hania's sons and four of his grandchildren were killed in April at the time hania insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks hania represented Hamas internationally and moved around the region for diplomatic meetings he was a key player in negotiations to stop the fighting in Gaza some fear his killing will be a major setback in achieving peace in the region we're going to bring in ham belala now he's a journalist who reported for us from inside Gaza now he's in Cairo and Egypt um good to see you Hasam can you tell us what people in Gaza are telling you about this how are they reacting to hania's assassination people in Gaza are um uh divided into groups mainly uh uh I I've talked to uh many people on the ground in the morning and the most essential and important part for them is to end the war um there are some people who were shocked uh and as they didn't expect um to happen and Han would be killed um especially he was um in the Exile um but still some others were shocked especially those who are in favor of um fighting Israel and what about reactions from Hamas what are you hearing there well hamas's was um statements were very calm very stable um they mourned the the leader uh of course they promised for Revenge um still not how that would work um they are in in in deep fighting with Israel in Gaza uh but I mean how farther would they go would they go outside Gaza or not um they would wait for the Iranian uh response or or or any diplomatic Mission so Hamas wasn't clear and reachable on uh what they are going to doing next is there any suggestion of how this killing might change uh the internal structure of Hamas I mean who might replace him [Music] well Hanah he got three depues um um who were uh who are um the leaders or the top uh leaders of uh the three main regions Gaza stb uh West Bank and um abroad over the Exile um the one in Gaza isir the one in in the West Bank who was Umi who was assassinated in Beirut before uh and M who was the former top leader of Hamas and now he's the top leader of the political Bureau in abroad so who's most likely according to the structure um who would be uh the replacement but it's not definite yet it's not announced um how that would affect it's not clear Hanah is a a symbolic leader um for long time he was a prime minister um he's in in and there are many people uh would be um you know how to say that that that they they wouldn't they would think he was not uh replaceable um but um officials and Hamas people I talk to earlier today they said that the structure of Hamas is is designed to be smooth of replacing anybody who was who was killed or or or or or left the the movement from a Palestinian perspective how might this assassination impact the war in Gaza I mean you said earlier for the people in Gaza the biggest priority is to end this war but H how might this impact uh its uh progression well it's it's a bit early to to judge and and to measure how that would impact uh the situation in Gaza on the Practical level in the fighting uh I don't think that would make any change because Hamas is using their maximum capacity of fighting on the ground and they will keep going I'm not sure but I mean uh reading the the the the the N9 months before that Hamas used the maximum that they could use um um definitely um um that would affect the situation especially on the ceasefire talks but um on the on the fighting and the war U it's not clear uh it's not the decision that made by Hanah himself as a leader whether to go for a ceasefire or not Hamas is a structure they have the military Wing who's in power and more powerful than the political leadership who's like mostly in in abroad has can I ask you um I understand that political groups are calling for strikes in the West Bank and I believe strikes are happening in protest against the killing of isma hania um how important are these strikes what effect will they have I believe it's more symbolic um strikes uh this is like Hanya is is a public figure as I mentioned that he was a prime minister Hamas um has its own people on the ground in the West Bank they they um there were some calls made by the Palestinian Authority official especially and and most notably the Palestinian president mm Abbas called KH Mash morning uh uh Hamas for for their loss so this is more like a symbolic um um step that taken by the factions on the ground I don't think that would make any change on the fabric or the situation in the West Bank it might but I mean this strike is not going to make a big difference ham Bela reporting from Cairo ham thank you so much for your insights I'd like to get some analysis now with maam Raba a lecturer at the American University Beirut he's joining me now from Lebanon thank you so much for taking the time good evening newly elected uh Iranian president mud pesin recently had warned that an attack on uh uh on that would have serious consequences for Israel do you think that that is now something that we can expect uh both from from Iran or from Hezbollah in Lebanon well at least a country that cannot protect its so-called gests cannot actually wage an open war against one of the the most sophisticated military technological entities in the region more so while people claim that this new president is a reformer he is just taking the words of the talking points of the Revolutionary guard in reality what happened in the last two days be it the killing of one or the top Hezbollah military commander and the killing of hania is just another message that if Iran decides to continue this so-called fist fight it will be not only damaged physically but also morally this is a huge blow to have someone assassinated when he is staying at the Iranian rushi guard hotel in a way so saying that the retaliation of hisbah or any of the Iranian proxies would have a kind of a major change on the escalation of violence is not really anywhere to be found on the ground this is just fighting words and this is something which Iran has done before I need to remind you that when their military commanders were hit in the Consulate in Iranian Consulate in Damascus what was what was used by hisbah and by Iran are just a kind of theatrical Jihadi moves which only ended up making Iran and all of its proxies the ridicule of the International Community so do you think we'll see something similar a very a a limited response perhaps or has the needle here really moved closer to a broader Regional war in the mid East well the killing of fukar yesterday in the sub of Beirut was in a way expected the hit was expected but no one was aware who the target is however while the killing of Hanah might sound as a big thing in reality he is a soft target and he is not really the one who is leading Hamas on the ground one has to remind everyone that mammad de is presumably killed by Israel this is something which has not yet been confirmed but there's indications that say he is he is dead in the same sense that SM Hanah is just a talking head in a way for Hamas and has no real uh influence on the ground so I think the killing of hania and any of the public figures of Hamas is expected and I think that Iran and its proxies will just take this blow and look for another time to hit back how they will hit back I don't think that they have the capabilities especially that the Americans will prevent Iran from uh from doing this and ultimately I think everyone is and Afraid what will happen if Trump is elected in the US yeah how would that let's talk about that a little bit more because we could be on the brink of a very seismic shift in US politics how do you think a change in US Administration would affect what we are seeing in these relations in the Middle East while while Netanyahu and the Israeli government were very hesitant or let's say calculating when they went for the hisbah commander yesterday I need to remind you here that Trump didn't think twice when he went after kasani and I don't think that Iranians are willing to suffer such a major blow identical to the killing of sumani and while Hanah was killed on Iranian soil he was not really Iranian in the sense that he did not belong to the guard proper so I think that having Trump in the white house will change the whole ball game because uh Trump will go after purely Iranian targets and this is something that would Force Iran to publicly and openly uh challenge the us and this is something that they have avoided through using their proxies because using proxies such as theis orah gives them the option of deniability this is something that they cannot do if they decide to use the proper Iranian tools for this or the official Iranian tools to retaliate now you've hinted at this a couple of times but I just want to pick up on this point again um today's killing uh in Iran you've said you know he's he's not Iranian but still to have a foreign person there in a in a diplomatic role um killed on Iranian soil do you think that that has caused tan to lose face with some of its Regional allies well I think that Iran has lost face even before the killing of Han because at the beginning of the October 7 they claimed that they will come to the aid of the Palestinians and equally hassanah the leader of hisbah has said once the land invasion starts in Gaza we will come to the aid of our Brethren ultimately what what the events have proven be it the killing of hania or the killing of the Palestinians or the Lebanese that Iran doesn't really care about Arab blood as long as the killing is not directed directly to its own entity they simply are okay with this so I think while they care about the Optics and this is something very important in the psychology of the Iranian regime I think there are so little options that they can res to to try to regain and reinstate this so-called Imperial facade which is weaker than people assume well thank you so much for joining us today on DW with your insights that is maam Raba from Beirut we very much appreciate your time today let's take a broader look at the Middle East with Simon Maan a professor of international politics at Lancaster University in the UK good to see you again Simon what have you heard what are you expecting to hear in the region today I think it's all been pretty predictable it's the sort of uh statement that we were expecting from from Iranian officials from the houis from hisbah from all The Usual Suspects there's been vocal condemnation but there's also been condemnation of the The Killing uh in tan by turkey by Qatar and by others across the region with the suggestion that this poses a significant challenge to actually working towards peace in Gaza all of this was to be expected I think we know that there is a great deal of worry about escalation but there's also worry that this type of attack these types of tit fortat escalations can get out of hand so it's it's entirely predictable that there would be these robust condemnations so would you say an escalation is now more likely in the Middle East I've been answering this question for the past 10 years I think uh will there be an escalation what about all the different moving parts of the various actors that are involved in various conflicts and I think it's really worth stressing that conflict is is devastating conflict will decimate the lives of people and that few States few actors actually want there to be a conflict because of the the costs involved the the humanitarian costs the political costs the economic costs and the costs to legitimacy of various actors being embroiled in war so that being said of course history has shown us that even when when various States or actors don't necessarily want to go to war the events have of a way of sort of capturing them and dragging them into conflict so this is why it's such a precarious moment because even though hisbah Iran and and others don't necessarily want to go to war with Israel the situation is so precarious that they may be drawn into it if the situation remains unchecked Israel has not yet taken responsibility uh for the killing of hania is the fact that Israel isn't saying we did it is that part of the uh choreography required to avoid massive escalation yeah I think so because the The Narrative would very quickly be that Israel has struck within Iranian Sovereign territory that could very easily be construed by those who wanted to as an act of War so I think doing it in a way that is to some extent deniable although you read between the lines and it's pretty clear who is who is responsible allows for the situation to be read and framed in such a way that can avoid escalation now I'm not saying that that is exactly what is happening here but I think this this reach for some form of plausible deniability is is is part of a broader strategy that can allow people to read into this in different ways MH just want to talk about the United States for a moment US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin today said the US wasn't involved was not aware of the hania killing he focused on the need for a ceasefire in Gaza is that by Design would you say I think so but I think it it could also be emblematic of the broader tensions that have been emerging between the US and Israel and I think we we've seen a lot of those tensions starting to emerge we know that Kamala Harris has been speaking incredibly strongly about the need for a ceasefire and so perhaps Mr Netanyahu is realizing that he doesn't quite have the same level of support in Washington that he once did at least uh in in its current form so I think right now there are there are definitely tensions between the two but if the US was serious about actually achieving a ceasefire it could be doing a a great deal more and putting a great deal more pressure on Mr Netanyahu and and Israel more broadly to achieve the ceasefire which is absolutely essential in working towards a deescalation of the region getting that ceasefire is Paramount and absolutely essential thinking again about uh the possibility of escalation would anyone benefit from a greater conflict or War well war is devastating brutal catastrophic as the people of Gaza have endured over these past few months as Israelis have endured in in other times as well of course war is brutal in that respect no one thrives no one benefits in terms of who might benefit politically of course there are those who might derive some form of political Capital political legitimacy out of being seen to be embroiled in a conflict either defending Palestinian rights defending uh Iranian territorial Integrity or standing up as part of a quote unquote axis of resistance so there are of course people who could benefit on the Israeli side of course the continuation of the conflict allows Mr Netanyahu to retain his his political position some say that his political career will be over once this war ends so there are of course people who would benefit but I would just remind everyone that it's the Ordinary People of the region the people of Gaza the people of Lebanon the people of Iran the people of Syria the people of Iraq the people of Yemen the people of Jordan who have been enduring this violent instability for decades now and who are at the risk of a wider escalation they are the ones who would be paying the most devastating price absolutely Simon Mayon Iran and Middle East experts Simon thank you so much for your insights and your time
