now officials in Cyprus say a ship loaded with humanitarian aid for Gaza has been given clearance to set sail the Open Arms relief vessel is expected to leave the port of lanica any time now to use a new Maritime Corridor to deliver the supplies to Gaza a temporary dock will be set up to receive the aid as well as a distribution Network now the US has separately sent a ship to build a larger Pier for a wider relief effort DW correspondent Rosie Berard at lanica Port in Cyprus joins us now Rosie you just attended a briefing with uh Superior officials what have you been hearing we're at a special operations Hub in the city of larica where cypriate officials are able to track and look at this new maritime Corridor which is now really starting from here in the city of larica so that Aid boats can reach Gaza safely and that much needed Maiden void we understand should be setting off very soon so in this room around me you'll see there are cameras where officials can monitor what's happening at the Port we also see for example lots of maps that shows the area where cypriate officials could deploy for example search and rescue vessels if this ship were to get into distress now I've been speaking with C officials I've got the very latest from them take listen to what they had to say we have uh finished the inspection and loading of the vessel of the Open Arms vessel uh and the platform they are using so uh the most important part is that everything is uh ready uh permissions have been granted and now it's uh a scheduling um issue for uh the NGO that uh is handling this issue Rosie um just talking about the schling issue there do we have an idea of the exact time uh when this is uh going to get the all clear in the coming hours what I understand is that the NGO which is preparing to receive this Aid on the gazen side is still busy building its temporary peer in order to actually receive this now this is a first of its kind delivery it's a delivery of tons hundreds of tons I've been told of things like flour of rice of protein like canned tuna and of course we know that is much needed in Gaza where there really is a humanitarian disaster and officials here are hoping they can ramp up this Corridor over the next few weeks to see to this Voyage really seen as a test for trying to get this done the idea is that cypriate officials check the goods here in Cyprus o overseen by Israeli officials before it depart so that they can go directly to Gaza now we are however hearing from United Nations officials saying this Maritime Corridor while it's welcome news is no replacement for land access and so those calls to increase access into Gaza via traditional land Crossings are still mounting particularly from the United Nations and Rosie we're just uh looking there um earlier as you were speaking to live looking at live images of the vessel there we have the images of the vessel um how long is it likely to take to get to its destination and deliver what uh these desperately needed Aid so Cypress is the point in the European Union which is the closest to Gaza but it's still some 400 km so make no mistake this is not an easy journey and generally this should take about 15 hours so at least a full day of sailing but given the fact that this boat is tugging a a heavy cargo it could be that that takes much longer certainly into a couple of days so this is is no mean feet and certainly something as you can see the eyes of cypriate officials bearing down on this to try and make sure this works because of course as we know really lives are at stake here the United Nations has been warning of famine in Gaza I should say that Israel says it facilitates the access of Aid Israel has welcomed this initiative although Israel has also faced criticism particularly for ngos for what they say really is that lack of humanitarian access and how difficult it has been to get life-saving Aid into the besiege territory okay we have to leave it there Rosie DW correspondent Rosie Bard thank you for bringing us up to
