the fighting has intensified in and around gaza's main city of Han yunus in recent days as the Israeli military say they have now breached the defensive lines of Hamas which is designated as a terror group by multiple countries the IDF released footage of its troops operating in various parts of the city which they believe to be a stronghold of the islamist militant group as Israel expands its offensive into the south of Gaza Palestinians are being forced to flee the fighting and ongoing bombardment thousands are heading daily to shelters in the South where there's still no guarantee of safety in a rare move un Secretary General Antonio gutterz has invoked article 99 of the UN Charter to warn the security Council of an impending humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza he urged the members to demand a ceasefire in a letter to the security Council he wrote without shelter or the essentials to survive I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have been told to relocate to so-called safe zones but the UN says nowhere and Gaza is safe survivors sift through the rubble of a destroyed home struck by Israeli missiles in the early hours of the morning there were 30 people inside the house 20 of them were children we don't know what happened to us the fire hit and all of it collapsed on top of us none of us made it out completely okay everyone is hurt the United Nations says almost 1.9 million gazans have fled their homes since the War Began many wound up here in Kan Yunis now gaza's second largest city is a Battleground Israel says it's operating against Kamas strongholds in the South and both sides report that the fighting is fierce leaving civilians with nowhere to go all my senior colleagues have been very clear including the Secretary General saying there is no there is no there are no safe places in Gaza speaking to DW news the Israel Defense Forces explained why they fire on safe zones now if Hamas uses a what has previously been defined as a safe Zone in order to fight and to fire Rockets or missiles at Israeli civilians or to conduct combat activities towards our troops from that area then there may be a case where we will retaliate fire but that is a very an extremely small percentage the main hospital in Kan yunes is overwhelmed the UN says delivering vital aid supplies is impossible amid the fighting and still the injured keep coming as do the bodies the devastation in Khan yunes has left many Palestinians with a sense that the world has abandoned them we need someone to stand by our side we need someone to find us a solution we are devastated but despite a brief ceasefire between Israel and Hamas the renewed fighting is as intense as ever let's pick this up with journalist Samy sakol in Jerusalem welcome back Sammy um let's start with a claim from the Israeli military that they found what they say is one of the largest weapons that depos in Gaza yeah indeed the uh Hamas as we know already has a produced weapons of various kinds uh in underground there underground factories inside the Gaza Strip in in fact in the 7th of October Israel was surprised with the scope of the equipment the military equipment that Hamas has and what we see in what the idef was showing is both from the Kalashnikov the AK-47 machine guns and all the way through RPG anti-tank and the long long range missiles that are aimed at Tel Aviv so this is definitely one of the achievements of the IDF in this operation and they were stating that this U this Depot in the north of the Gaza Strip was in a residential area and was not far from some schools and a clinic right now meanwhile the UN Secretary General Antonio gues has said that the humanit Arian situation in Gaza is now at risk of total collapse he's called for a ceasefire it doesn't look like Israel is ready to comply no indeed Israel is now talking about ER accelerating the campaign in the Gaza Strip uh Ben Gant who is in the war cabinet he was saying we're listening to our friends uh but we're doing what's good for Israel and the what the leadership in Israel believes is that continuing the military campaign is what's good and you have Gant the Minister of Defense said the other day that by doing it it will also make the Hamas surrender and release the prisoners that are kept by Hamas right of course at the the the center of this are the hostages taken by Hamas on the uh in October um and we've had today these leaked audio recordings of a meeting between the Prime Minister and freed hostages which appeared to reveal criticism from those hostages of how the Situation's been handled just talk us through their criticism Sammy indeed very harsh criticism and we heard it both from those who were held kidnapped and also their family members who participated in this very big meeting and the what the hostages were saying is that when they were held hostage by Hamas they were scared not from Hamas they were scared of the bombings they were they were terrified by these bombings and they said that one one of the hostages was saying where is your intelligence you bombarded right next to us and they they described a situation of big fear another thing they said is that they demanded the release of all the hostages and they say that Israel has missed an opportunity to release the hostages by refusing to release the elderly and the men and they were saying that the men that are kept hostage there are suffering more than the women H they described a very difficult situation there and they said that they have to be released now and one cannot wait any anymore okay thanks for that Samy Sammy S in Jerusalem DW's senior International correspondent Fanny fad joins me from Jerusalem now no un Chief has taken this action in half a century funny gues urges that the maintenance of International Peace and security is at stake here how has this been perceived in Israel a lot of people here in Israel will agree that there must be an end to this cycle of violence there must be an end to suffering and some a way out of it but if they uh look at the remarks made there by the head of United Nations they're also very skeptical really whether a resolution can be even achieved and once it's being voted on really what the result is because one has to understand that there are five permanent members in that Security Council and those permanent members include the United States the closest Ally of isra that has made it clear over and over again that they are not supporting a ceasefire right what they do call for is is rather a humanitarian PA so uh the United Nations wanting to bring this issue once again to the Voting floow is of course something really important and it comes down here among a lot of Israelis who really wants to see an end a way out of it as as a positive situation but on the other hand there's a lot of skepticism revolving around this because because while we are talking about it that war is Raging on in Gaza Strip and it's really just unclear how long and how intense uh this is going to continue F you're also monitoring developments in Gaza specifically what can you tell us about the situation in the southern city of Han Unice we're hearing from the Israeli government from the idea of the Israeli Israeli forces that apparently that house of yaka Sinar the presumed Mastermind beond the October 7th attack that his house is encircled now it is unclear whether he's in that house in in uh uh in the city and whether his family is in there it's completely unclear what is known that there's Fierce fighting in hunis going on between Hamas militants and the IDF and while that is happening uh thousands of people are forced basically to leave a city that was deemed safe just a few weeks ago at least that's what Israel said meanwhile people people here that are missing their relatives that remain abducted there in Gaza Strip are hoping to find out any sign of live any sign of about the whereabouts and the state of uh their relatives and in fact there was an exhibition in Tel Aviv yesterday again recalling what's been happening there that really doesn't mean a lot of recalling what happened in October 7th at that Nova Festival but once again drawing the world's attention to uh what's what happened there on the ground on October and uh where hundreds of people have been killed with shoes and other remains lined up there at exhibition let's have a look at the report handbags shoes and toys many of the people who owned these belongings were killed an early morning of trans music turned into Nightmare Hamas Fighters stormed the festival just kilometers away from the Gaza border and Gunn down as many people as they could the organizers of the festival have recreated the venue in Tel Aviv for them each item displayed here is a reminder of the terrorists brutality we built this exhibition and in memory for all our friends we lost all the people from the community that have died uh on the 7th um um our Purpose with this exhibition is not only for our country to see it for the whole world to see it in Israel a strong sense of Sorrow is visible everywhere more than 130 hostages are still in Gaza and Israelis want all of them back the feeling is the hostages must be released that's the number one cause and for the whole situation there shouldn't be one more day of hostages being held there not women not elderly no children no men they all have to come back all of them one by one I'm feeling frightened scared aggravated angry angry with my government useless government and uh I'm hoping that this this situation will be resolved quickly and peacefully as much as possible as the fighting continues Israel has also been losing troops this family is mourning the loss of a young Soldier killed in Gaza I hope that this is my last friend and the last Soldier but I know it's not going to H happen and we have to not we have to but we're going to pay a lot of prices of soldiers and these soldiers the first of all they son of someone the friend of someone the the the human being and this war is the price of this war it's really really high for everyone it's really really high many families in Israel as well as Gaza are overwhelmed by grief and with no signs of Peace the war is likely to bring more suffering to both sides funny as we've seen in that report people in Israel are sad and angry two months since the Hamas attacks on Israel what do people feel their government should be doing right now a lot of people that I'm speaking here to here in Israel are saying that actually this government is not the right government to uh find a solution to this in fact a lot of people say that prime minister netan is responsible to what happened in o on October 7th underestimating actually Hamas and uh h M militants which is classified a terrorist organization by multiple countries that they were able to carry out this terrorist attack to begin with on October 7 but you will also hear voices of people saying that Netanyahu is doing what he has to do and that is to take revenge on what happened on October 7th and and and wipe out from their perspective Hamas once and for all what a lot of people here underestimate I think is uh the fact that Hamas is not only seen as a described and classified as a terrorist organization but it is also a social movement in uh Gaza Strip but also within uh the occupied West Bank there are people who do support Hamas because they see the Hamas militants as their way their only alternative in fact and also other militant group groups to voice their frustration over the uh decades long conflict with Israel having said that there have really mixed reactions in terms of what's the way out of it and a lot of people what they're telling me is that they're missing a vision really a vision both for the security of Palestinians and here Israelis a vision for peace and security for all DW's senior International correspondent funny fasha reporting from Jerusalem thank you well AIA and N Weinberg are two sisters whose cousin IAI was taken hostage by Hamas on the 7th of October they're here in Germany for a meeting with Chancellor Schultz tomorrow uh thanks for coming in welcome uh both um let's start with what happened to itai back in October so itai was visiting his parents and our grandmother for the holiday he doesn't live in kibuts beri he lives in Tel Aviv and on that morning we were witnessing um we're witnessing the attack through WhatsApp group our family chat uh it started by orit's Mom saying asking us to pray for them uh um saying that they hear bombings and shootings in the street after a while it Tai's father he was in a different house he told us they're inside the house please call for help and that was the last message we got from him right and since then you have you have heard nothing you've heard and seen nothing of so since then actually just a few days ago we got a sign of life from itai for the first time after more than 50 days and what was that um we got it from one of the hostages that were released and was held with him the whole time um and it was that he's alive which was you know a big a big release for us cuz we didn't know even if he's alive until now the Red Cross didn't see him didn't meet him nonone humanitarian organization met any of the hostages so we really didn't know but we also understood from them that he is in a very bad mental state he is suffering from Deep anxiety he witnessed his mother being murdered before he was taken away he was with her at her house and he saw Kamas terrorist shooting her and then they took him away we know that he thinks he assumes that his father was also murdered because of that text message and he thinks that his whole family that lives in kib are all murder met dead he he he knows that his sister was the only one that was Far Away on October 7th so he thinks she's the only one that survived besides that we know that Kamas terrorists are doing psychological tear on the hostages that are being held they are telling telling them there is no Israel country anymore they're telling them they have nowhere to go back to no one cares about them no one is doing nothing in order to get them out no one is talking on them and from what he knows that he saw his mother being murdered and he assumes that it happened to his dad as well and he knows that the whole family lives in the same area so and then in all the suffering that he's in right now he thinks that's the truth right right and and tell me when the the we've had we had seven days of this ceasefire and uh I think three or four sets of hostages uh released in that time so were you watching those hostages to see if I was amongst them or or were list published previously no the list was um the families had uh like they got the list before and we all knew that it will only include children and women because no no men were right yeah so we already knew that itti will not be released during that Sea Fire during that deal okay so where does that leave you as a family because we we heard um uh just now in a report of uh families um taking the Israeli government to task saying they're not doing enough to get there uh to get their um their loved ones out where are you on on that what do you think of the way um the the government has handled this in some way we're also disappointed cuz it's been 61 days today and they're still not home and is still held hostage by Kamas terrorist and we know that every day that goes by is a danger for their life their life is in danger they're barely getting food they're getting one PL uh slice of bread a day uh or just a bit of rice we know they they haven't got any Medical Treatments any medications and we know that their life is limited in time so what should the government have done then should should the Israeli government have um agreed to another ceasefire because as the way Hamas tells it it was Israel that was blocking this I mean you know you don't know that we weren't in the room but that's the Hamas story I I expect the Israeli government to put the hostages in first on first priority so does that mean then um keep having ceasefires until they are all out or as the the government would say we've got some out and we got them out because we kept hammering away at Hamas and this is how we expect to get more outs well I know that there was no deal on the table and if there is a deal on the table that could bring it Tai back I expect Israel to take it even if it includes SE fire I think that the hostages must come first right you're meeting Chancellor Schultz uh tomorrow for for what reason what do you want from him itai is a German citizen um we've been here it's our second time right now in Germany we've met um councelor Schultz in the past and many other politicians before and our expectation from Germany is to treat and handle this case as German citizens that are taken that were taken hostage and to treat it in you know in the same way they would have treated if it would happen on Germany's land so what do you believe they haven't done that they should have done I think right now that the the whole world um needs to level up the pressure that they're putting on the the countries that are playing a mediator act in this situation it's like Qatar like yes like Qatar like Egypt like turkey the countries that are feeding Kamas that are hosting them that are housing the the Kamas leaders and I know that if the pressure would be you know hard enough or big enough it would happen and the hostages would be released so a fe what what what do you want to hear from the chancellor tomorrow you go and have your meeting and he will nod and listen but what do you want in an Ideal World what do you want him to say that will that will go some way to putting uh putting you at ease of course in an ideal way I would want him to tell me that the Tai is coming back today tomorrow but I know he can't say it um but so I would like to hear I would like to have his promise that he is treating itai as it was happening on Berlin in Berlin and that he is putting the hostages life in first priority okay thank you both uh for coming in and and talking to us we wish you well with your your meetings um AIA and Nama Weinberg thank you thank you
