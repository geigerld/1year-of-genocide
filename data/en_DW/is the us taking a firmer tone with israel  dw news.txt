I'm Ben fulan welcome more than two months of war between Israel and Hamas have passed and the death toll continues to rise Health officials in the Hamas rang Gaza Strip say over 177,000 people have died in the fighting mainly civilians that's stoking international calls for a ceasefire US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has called on Israel to prioritize the protection of civilian life again underscoring Washington's position on the war as we stand here almost a week into this campaign in the the south after the end of the humanitarian uh pause it is imperative it remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection and there does remain a gap between exactly what what I said when I was there the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we're seeing uh on the ground and let's go over to Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem blink's strongest public criticism of Israel's conduct of the war on Hamas the reaction there well we've heard over the past weeks there more more pressure by the United States and more push back you know to do more uh to protect uh Palestinians uh by the civilian population in Gaza now Israel has said uh for many weeks uh as well that they're claiming basically Hamas that they are using civilians as a human shield and they are saying the military here that they doing uh a lot to protect civilians to tell them to evacuate uh certain areas to give them corridors to move they also published a map you know detailing uh putting splitting up Gaza in in hundreds of little districts but I talk to people in Gaza on the phone as we as journalists cannot go there uh they're telling me this is very confusing uh we we have to understand that over an estimated number of 1.8 million uh people out of the the 2.2 million residents uh in Gaza they have been displaced they all moved many of them moved to the South and of course now the ground operation also being expended to the South people simply have no place to go anymore to to be safe there's no safe area that's what they are telling me and even if there are evacuation calls to go to certain areas there's still also air strikes on other areas so people are saying if there's no call for full ceasefire there's no safety and sec security for uh for them in Gaza at the moment ananya on the humanitarian front we've heard that Israel is setting up a second checkpoint for trucks bringing Aid to Gaza how is that going to help well there's talk about the opening or at least the partially opening of the Kum Shalom Crossing now the beginning of the war uh Israel had close both of its crossings that are going into Gaza so one is in the north that's the Aris cross Crossing this is only for uh people uh to cross in and out this one is closed and there is also the uh Kum Shalom Crossing in the South which has also been closed this is where uh before the war usually Goods uh were going in and out right now eight is only coming in through the Rafa Crossing uh with Egypt so there has been talk there's no time frame given if this will actually happen that the crossing uh the km Shalom Crossing could uh help with the screening and you know the security mechanism that Israel wants to see in place but uh the other problem actually is not just the crossings what we're hearing from uh humanitarian organizations from the United Nations is actually right now the distribution of uh humanitarian Aid coming into Gaza because as there's heavy fighting reported also in the South so most of the trucks that are coming in and they're not that many coming in but those are coming in you know they cannot reach the middle areas or the northern part or even in the the South it's quite limited what we are hearing uh from the United Nations and we had the uh under General Secretary Martin C saying that we don't we do not have a humanitarian operation in southern G that you can call a humanitarian operation I'm paraph phrasing here uh anymore because you know this is uh very difficult now to get the humanitarian Aid two people there an you mentioned the fighting in the South what is the military situation right now for Israel well Israel is pushing ahead with its ground operation there's still fighting going on also of course uh in the northern area of the Gaza Strip but there's a lot of uh Focus now on the souths especially on the city uh of Khan Yunis uh where Israel is saying that they assume part of the uh Hamas leadership might be in that area it's also the hometown of yah Sina the Hamas leader who is seen by Israel as as the main architect of the October 7th uh terrorist attacks so most of the uh a lot of focus is on the southern area at the moment with you know bombardment air bombardment and and uh ground operations focusing also now on the whole of of the Gaza Strip Tanya thank you very much for the update our correspondent in Jerusalem our correspondent Tanya ker in Jerusalem and we'll talk to the Red Cross in a moment in Gaza first Israel says it will not let up in its strive to eliminate Hamas considered a terrorist group by numerous countries here's more on the fighting in the south of the territory and the dire humanitarian situation physical and emotional trauma continue to rain down on the Palestinian people of Gaza and despite Israel declaring some areas to be safe zones air strikes are a constant threat we are with children old people and women I beg you not to bomb us she and her family are among the 1.8 million people who are internally displaced that's 80% of the population places to seek shelter are ever shrinking those who are able to escape bombings with their lives are barely living at all food water and other Basics are scarce we came here and as you see there is no shelter no tent nothing and even water there are no toilets look at our children how they look there is no place to shower them today there were fights with people because of a small place we cannot set up tents nor can we cover our children this is the masasi camp in southern Gaza the Israeli military has designated it as a safe Zone but there's no Aid it's undeveloped land where already desperate people are living in squalid conditions and Strikes in Rafa near the Egyptian border have swn fear in those who have fled their homes to seek safety in the city's Camp despite international calls for a ceasefire heavy Urban combat intensifies [Applause] we're in the midst of persistent fighting along the entire strip we're advancing in stages of combat eliminating terrorists including senior commanders hiding in underground tunnels and also destroying terrorist infrastructure the UN has warned that Gaza is teetering on a humanitarian catastrophe with hospitals unable to care for the injured and the growing threat of disease sweeping through refugee camps Stephen Ryan is a rapid deployment coordinator at the international committee for the Red Cross and joins us from Southern Gaza how dire is the situation for civilians as the focus of fighting extends to the entire strip well thank you for having me on this morning firstly and as your listeners will have just seen and heard the situation in Gaza is Indescribable the conditions that civilians are facing the loss of life that continues to happen and the the extreme challenges that organizations such as the international Committee of the Red Cross the IC orc are facing and bringing Aid in to Gaza and being able to distribute it safely under the current conditions we've reached the limit of humanitarian action in the environment like this Stephen with 1.8 million people displaced how many people does that mean you can actually reach if you've already reached your limits well in these sorts of conditions one of the things that we need absolutely is a greater degree of agid to be able to enter the gasa strip right now people are without many people are without food water as you've seen people are without shelter people are without sanitation facilities and these conditions are absolutely inhumane but along with additional Aid coming in while some Aid is trickling in there's a need for more but there's also the need to be able to distribute it safely and to make sure that we're able to do this in an organized way in these current conditions while people are moving fleeing fighting from wherever they can go to wherever they can at least imagine that they might be safe this makes humanitarian operations extremely difficult certainly we have uh great challenges in the getting the relief into Gaza but the security conditions on the ground are not conducive to being able to provide humanitarian assistance and this is utterly unacceptable H how are you managing to stay safe and keep your own people safe while trying to help uh the people of gas well certainly the ICC is continuing its activities on the ground with the limited resources that we have uh in particular our activities are focused on health we're supporting hospitals here and we have a medical surgical team who are providing assistance and uh operations and surgeries to people that have been wounded by the fighting but these hospitals are overwhelmed in recent days I was visiting one of these hospitals and they're they're full of people jam-packed I don't think that you can possibly imagine that these places of safety and refuge uh are also places where uh uh hundreds of people are treated each day uh due to wounds that are caused by the ongoing fighting in addition people are struggling because many diseases are at uh at risk of breaking out people are very simple things like uh simple you know illnesses related to the cooling weather related to the unsanitary conditions and this is making it very difficult for them to access medical care because the number of people affected by the fighting continues to be extremely large our teams are doing their best that they can right now here in Gaza but it's not going to be enough we need much much more access and we need much more safety to be able to do our work and what about another truce I mean that helped the humanitarian situation somewhat recently do you expect any help from the UN Security Council when it votes later today on a push for a ceasefire well certainly our view is uh that this recent pause in the fighting was a moment of respite for people who have been uh been devastated over the past more than two months uh anything that brings restes the civilians who are affected by this conflict is a welcome step but it's up to the it's up to the people who are at the security Council these leaders to recognize that now we have reached a point where civilians continue to suffer to an unacceptable agree we the International Community of the Red Cross will remain here in Gaza providing assistance regardless of the outcome of any of these discussions but right now what's needed is a recognition that civilians have are continuing to suffer deeply you're doing an amazing job stepen Ryan from the ICC in southern Gaza thank you for being on DW
