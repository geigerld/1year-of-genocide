Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended himself against accusations he's blocking a hostage deal with Hamas this comes as protesters in Israel took to the streets for a second consecutive night the latest Mass demonstration sparked by the killing of six hostages in Gaza who were shot by their captives as Israeli forces approached protesters are demanding their government make a deal to free the captives still held by Hamas Netanyahu apologized to the families of the six captives is found dead but he insisted he would press on with Israel's military campaign in Gaza and keep control of strategic territory a Middle East analyst shannie ranus has more on this so Netanyahu says he's sorry but it doesn't sound like he's budging on anything well correct I mean it did you know seem like yesterday was him just trying to find more justifications and basically explain to the Israelis where he stands and why he stands where he is and in that aspect why he's refusing um to go ahead with the deal as much as you know the pressure on the street is is going um netan is very clearly not aiming to wind this down or to go to any sucession of hostilities or the fire anytime soon and he's trying to explain why that's the case and so anybody who was hoping that the pressure uh of the public would be the one bringing Neno to shift his position saw yesterday a very defiant prime minister trying to actually uh gain support for an action that is quite the opposite of what we see from the streets demand and one of those sticking points is this 14 km buffer zone along the Egyptian gazen border the Philadelphia Corridor which the Israelis want to hold on to in order to have some sort of control over the Gaza Strip is this one of his aims or one of Israel's aims well that border we're talking about the Philadelphia Corridor that's exactly uh the only way for Gaza outside you know the only border that is not with Israel but rather with Egypt netan claims and he we saww a whole presentation last night that this is the only way to make sure that Hamas does not regain power get more ammunition through you know smuggle through the Border but then a lot of if you talk to the defense minister or any other you know members leading members of the defense mechanism in Israel they say this is not the case Israel can always take Philadelphia Corridor again if needed and also they point to the fact that it takeen Israel about eight months deep into the war in Gaza before it even reached that part so they say if this is such a vital part of the war how come it wasn't one of our first targets sort of trying to talk about nany's uh attempt to use the Philadelphia Corridor as an excuse not to go on with a deal rather than actually a sticking point that is that meaningful and this is the Deep Rift we are seeing between netan and you know the more professional uh you know uh leaders of the war in the in the end in the military uh and this deep Rift is you know is is such that they cannot do anything that Nano does not want to do you see the the public hearing them and this is where you see the big distrust you know on the streets people do not trust n because they hear so many other people say this not have to be the case and time is running out for the remaining hostages just how desperate are those people in the streets the Israelis when it when it comes to getting some sort of deal finishing this war in comparison to the the desperation among Palestinians to see some sort of end if you look at polling numbers most of Israeli support a deal including everything that it will take like giving up the control over Philadelphia Corridor you like releasing lots of mass murders you know that have been you know captured by Israeli kept in Israeli prisoners do support that but not netanyahu's base and this is exactly what we're seeing he's catering to his base he still has very strong support in his Coalition and that's what drives his decisions right now he as long as he doesn't have any threat from his Coalition I doubt we will see netan changing um his t on this and if you talk about Palestinians you know I also talk to colleagues and friends there that did the desperation the the frustration the sadness you know I mean it's it's endless I mean it's the I was talking to some of them in the last days they were hoping that what's happening on the streets in Israel will bring to a change but obviously uh always hard to break their hearts saying we are not there yet and what we're seeing the Americans focusing more and more on the campaign there um you know the election campaign of you know Biden trying to support Harris AA you know Gaza becomes a more minor topic for the world's uh arena for international attention and they feel being left behind maybe rightfully so and and you know unfortunately we don't see where any of the sides you know we need to keep in mind we also have Kamas here and they don't seem to be too eager on going for a deal as well um the people you know on both sides in Palestine and Israel might be somewhere else and where the leaders are and we don't see any you know any solution coming in the next you know couple of months weeks ahead of us unfortunately it doesn't sound good at all I find it interesting that you say that Netanyahu is pandering to his base but you know is that going to secure him a future well it does so far it does he doesn't have any threat to his uh to his Reign I mean there's nothing right now uh that makes you know net feel that he needs to go to election anytime before the set date in three years so far he's holding Stone wow shaie thank you very much for the analysis interesting stuff you're welcome
