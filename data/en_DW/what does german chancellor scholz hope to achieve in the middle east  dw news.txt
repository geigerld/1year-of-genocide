German Chancellor Olaf Schultz is making a two-day trip to the Middle East where he's due to hold talks with the leaders of Jordan and Israel his trip comes as International efforts to get Aid into Gaza are expanding Germany has joined an emergency airlift dropping food over the strip for the first time a new Maritime Aid Corridor between Cypress and Gaza is also taking shape but relief groups and the people of Gaza say it's nowhere near enough the US Air Force parachuting Aid into Gaza they're dropping food supplied by Jordan to help hundreds of thousands of people facing starvation The Situation's awful we can't eat or drink and Aid is very scarce Israel has imposed a long running blockade on Gaza and has been accused by eight agencies of delaying the entry of trucks Israel says it is carrying out necessary security measures to ensure no weapons are snuck in and while trucks wait for inspection the price of food in the territory is skyrocketing amid all the shortages many can no longer afford to shop for groceries everything's expensive in the markets the prices are very high I've been checking the market for an hour I have 10 shekels and I can't buy anything in recent days more donor countries have turned to the air and sea to overcome Israeli restrictions a ship carrying 200 tons of food reached Gaza and the first such delivery made via a new Maritime Aid Corridor and more are on the way but Gins say the measures are only a temporary fix we keep waiting for Aid this is not a solution whether by ship or by plane we saw planes dropping Aid and people fighting over it there are some children who drowned in the sea trying to get the aid a group of 25 leading human rights organizations have also criticized the air and sea deliveries they say a permanent ceasefire and unhindered access to Aid through land Crossings are the only way to alleviate unfolding humanitarian crisis before the German Chancellor left for the Middle East he repeated his call for a swift ceasefire and he also outlined the overarching agenda for his journey let's have a listen we have a difficult situation it's necessary for Aid to reach Gaza on a larger scale now that will be an issue that I also have to talk about we're also concerned about the further progress of military [Music] developments in particular there is a danger that a full-scale offensive in Rafa will result in a great many civilian casualties which must be avoided at all costs and following the German Chancellor's trip to Jordan in Israel is our correspondent Tanya Kramer who joins us now from Jerusalem Tanya good to see you so tell us a bit more about what Chancellor Schultz is hoping to achieve through these talks in Jordan and Israel well I think you have to say this is his second visit to the region since uh October 7 and uh the war he came shortly after October 7 to Israel and showing and um uh his full support for Israel also in its uh War efforts but now of course we're in a different phase of this war going into the six month with 31,000 over 31,000 people killed in Gaza according to the local Health authorities there and the end warning of hunger and starvation a humanitarian crisis uh in Gaza so uh this is of course also when we're hearing more of the other world leaders also being more critical of Israel's war conduct including uh US President Joe Biden Israel's closest Ally so of course it will be watched what Chancellor Olaf Schulz is saying here to his Israeli counterparts one of the main concerns is and we heard it there is are Israel's preparations for a potential military offensive in Rafa where over 1 million Palestinians have sheltered while the war is going on while there are also air strikes in the area uh another concern is the return of the remaining Israeli hostages uh in Gaza uh we understand that the chancellor will also meet some relatives uh of those families and also of course more humanitarian Aid that needs to go into Gaza this is a demand by many in the international uh community and that is also why Germany uh is now taking part in those Aid drops uh and that is part of course of the discussions in in Jordan This is the first leg of his very very short DP he arrived last night in Jordan and will meet uh King abdalah uh during the morning hours yeah an you me these plans for a military operation in Rafa the focus of much International concern but as you reported uh Israel's war cabinet approved these plans and yet we are still hearing at the same time that there are preparations to resume ceasefire talks on a possible hostage deal with Hamas what's the latest you can tell us about this yeah there are many conflicting reports here also in the Israeli media we understand that Hamas had submitted submitted its proposal uh on Thursday uh last week uh then we had prime minister Benjamin netan calling those demands by Hamas unrealistic nevertheless uh the uh cabinet there decided to send an Israeli delegation to doar toq to continue those talks and there reports now that this delegation uh should be leaving anytime soon it will be headed by uh the head of the Mad David Bara uh there's also another cabinet meeting uh scheduled for some time today to outline the uh Israeli position so we understand that of course this is going on uh uh um so the talks have not completely broken down it would be also the first time in weeks that an Israeli delegation will take part in those indirect uh talks now of course uh this proposal was seen in in several phases releasing first about 40 of the hostages that are still in the women elderly children also hostages that are ill for in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails but I mean the main sticking points were always the demands by Hamas the full withdrawal of Israeli forces also the return of residents uh uh to Northern Gaza as well as a full uh Seas ceasefire so we have to wait and see there's a lot of of course pressure also by the Israeli public to come to such an agreement but we have to wait and see you know how this will unfold and to understand how wide the gaps are or how narrow the gaps are between the two sides that was DW's
