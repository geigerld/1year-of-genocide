well Benjamin Netanyahu has been Israeli Prime Minister for a combined 15 years over the last three decades he's by far the country's longest serving Premier but also controversial and polarizing he's presided over a series of Coalition governments that have drifted further and further to the right and in addition comes indictments for corruption so how has he stayed in power and what will his legacy be citizens of Israel we are at War not in an operation or rounds but at War Benjamin Netanyahu as a wartime leader a player on the world stage at a moment of utmost seriousness but it wasn't always this way earlier this year these were the scenes on the streets of Tel Aviv some of the country's biggest ever demonstrations against proposed reforms to the Judiciary seen as a threat to Israel's democracy now those reforms are on hold as are the protests Netanyahu has made a career of surviving upheavals and Scandals that would have doomed many politicians part of an identity split between seeking to make history and making deals to survive from day to day after serving as Israel's youngest ever prime minister in the 1990s he returned to office in 2009 and quickly found himself butting heads with US President Barack Obama Netanyahu had formed a coalition with parties that supported illegal settlements in the West Bank he Allied himself with Republicans in the US not only on settlements but in opposing the Obama administration's sponsoring of a deal with Israel's Archen enemy Iran his government's increasing right-wing Direction seemed to pay dividends When Donald Trump came to the White House within a year Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's Capital to the dismay of Palestinians our greatest Ally the United States of America today its Embassy opened here a big win for Netanyahu the Trump Administration also spearheaded agreements between Israel and Middle Eastern countries normalizing relations meanwhile netanyahu's problems at home were growing in 2019 he was formally charged in three separate cases he lost an election but after 18 months in opposition he was back in office to achieve a parliamentary majority entered the most right-wing Coalition Israel had ever seen efforts continued led by the US to improve relations with Saudi Arabia and others but it's now unclear when if ever a Saudi deal will be formalized an offensive in Gaza that results in Mass Palestinian casualties could undo years of diplomacy through it all BB has survived but his hopes for a legacy as an international Statesman have dimmed after the Hamas attacks he formed a union government but it's not a long-term solution to Israel's problems the government also faces an imminent decision on how to respond to the hostage crisis in Gaza a miscalculation could have tragic consequences the question hanging over Netanyahu now is whether the attacks of October 7th will be his end or will he manage yet again to hold on to power and we can now speak to Audi citz he is a political analyst and a journalist who joins us from Southern Israel welcome to DW so netanyahu's popularity among the Israeli public seems to be decreasing why do you think that is well I think we've seen during the last two weeks or so a completely incompetent government in Israel even if you put aside the great crisis that was caused by the surprise attack the government has not been functioning properly ever since the war has started and I think a lot of people in the Israeli public are looking up to netan waiting to to see his reactions as prime minister and are quite disappointed now that goes all through the political Arc it goes from the left who wasn't expecting a lot from netan to begin with but I think it also goes all the way to right-wing voters even those who used to vote to nany and are now looking at him seeing he's not functioning it took him too long to form a Unity government is the general public opinion right now in Israel and he is just not very present in Israeli public spaces since the war has begun I think one other thing that is very significant right now is that the Israeli public is expecting a very strong strike against the Gaza Strip personally I have never seen the Israeli public holding such right-wing Hawk opinions regarding a military operation and nanyu sticks to his old character being very pragmatic very careful about striking in the Gaza Strip not yet giving the Israeli public what has become a pretty popular demand of going into Gaza full force now that may change in days to come but at least for now most Israelis look at nanyo and think that he is not functioning properly as prime minister and is not running this war properly from the side of Israel so what are the expectations that the Israeli public has from this new Israeli government this Unity government that was formed uh in response to the war I think one of the biggest expectations Israeli public has from this Unity government is that it would help to put political divisions a not to see political clashes between the different parties definitely not between Coalition and opposition but also to know that there are people with a lot of military experience in the war cabinet at least two former Chiefs of Staff and Deputy of the head of mad have joined the Coalition or the government right now that is Benny Gans Gaden and RAM Barak three very significant men who have a lot of experience and are entering a war cabinet running Israel's worst military crisis in its history that up until now most of its members didn't even serve in the Israeli military so I think for a lot of the Israeli public there's something very reassuring knowing that people with such significant uh uh history and experience in the security industry and in the military are now Taken part in running this operation and are taking decisions that may be a little more responsible than people who have never served in the security system well this war of course comes after nearly a year of mass protests in Israel against Plans by netanyahu's government to reform the judicial system and many considered Israel to be a starkly split country have the current circumstances changed that well ever since the war has begun we're seeing unprecedented unity in Israeli Society left and Wing are uniting together there is a huge civil effort to help the country function it also happens again because the government is just not involved not running the situation uh and is not taking part in helping Civil Society so volunteers from all over Israel have United people who spent the last year protesting against netanyahu's government have channeled all of their resources into trying to help soldiers volunteers and evacuated survivors from the kibuts this Unity might not last after the war and things may change after that but one thing is for sure I think Israeli Society has learned that when it comes to the hour of need it can unite and I also think that the general public of has diversed to a new direction that will not easily be changed back that was journalist ad citz uh speaking to us from Southern Israel many thanks indeed for your time thank
