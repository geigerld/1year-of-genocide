more foreign Nationals are preparing to leave Gaza through the Rafa Crossing today at least 320 foreign passport holders were evacuated on Wednesday alongside dozens of severely injured Palestinians around 7 and a half thousand foreigners are expected to leave over the next two weeks under a deal broken by Qatar these were some of the first foreign passport holders to reach the safety of Egyptian soil on the other side hundreds were hoping for their chance to cross but only those on a list agreed by Israel and Egypt would be allowed to do so after more than 3 weeks under Israeli bombardment and blockade people here were desperate to escape we are relying on God and hoping we'll get out it's still our country and we feel sad for it for its Destruction for our friends and loved ones entire family am were destroyed and erased all martyred and if it weren't for what happened we wouldn't leave as well as those allowed to leave for good Egyptian authorities have agreed to a small number of medical evacuations with ambulances crossing the border to retrieve the severely injured once in Egypt they were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment gaza's own medical facilities are desperately short of even basic suppli eyes and are overflowing with the injured and while more Aid trucks were allowed through once again on Wednesday Aid groups say it's only a tiny fraction of what entered daily before the Hamas terrorist attacks the head of the un's relief agency in Gaza stressed that residents were in urgent need after he crossed into Rafa for a visit and I was Chuck by the fact that everyone there was asking for food was asking for water we I saw almost every children trying to express their way that they need to eat they need to have water um I never ever have seen something similar in Gaza when I came before after conflict Egyptian officials say more people will be able to leave over the coming days but it's unclear just how long the Border will remain open to foreign passport holders what is certain is that unless Egypt's government lets Palestinians cross to for the vast majority of those trapped in Gaza Escape will remain impossible well for more on the situation on the ground let's now speak to journalist ham belusa he's reporting from Gaza there how more people are preparing to leave Gaza today tell us more yes 400 um Internationals or Palestinian holding for forign passports along with the 60 um with Palestinians would leave through Rafa to Egypt and maybe to other destination later on um yesterday there was another 400 or a bit less along with the 54 uh Palestinian wounded um with their escorts left to to Egyptian Hospitals now has any Aid reached Gaza today today no no not yet but expected some trucks to come in um over 250 or a bit more um arrived in in the previous days um and more expected to to be received today um including uh frood uh water and medical supply is this Aid you spoke about the 250 so far 250 trucks is this Aid beginning to make a difference for civilians well in some places some areas H one schools like um that people displaced people are taking as a shilter they're receiving more Aid some some organizations are distributed but making use or a concrete difference it's not I mean still we are talking about a huge number of displaced people with are from the north GAA City or even those people who are in this area from the border areas or other places po people they are still struggling of of getting the aid the distribution mechanism is not clear to everybody when when when I'm asking coordinator people about that they don't know sometimes they get some aid from here and there but um it's uh still uh it's it's not easy because there is no cooking gas so people are not cooking in their homes no water for with for washing or even uh for a drink H Bela they're reporting from Gaza thank you very much hin thank you and joining me now is hadil kazaz she is the regional gender justice coordinator for Oxfam International based in rala welcome could you please tell us about your organization's work in Gaza right now and where you are seeing the biggest gaps in humanitarian assistance unfortunately our organization cannot move in on the ground we have 33 staff members and their families are Under Fire uh there is very very difficult situation for our partners we have a large network of Partners who cannot do anything basically because of the continuous bombardment across Gaza Strip in the South as well as in the north uh therefore we depend only on the uh numbers that come from un uh and these are alarming they are basically on in the minute situation humanitarian situation is deteriorating very quickly uh We've we have estimates that food in Gaza is not will not last more than S days uh the number of trucks that entered 227 is half of what would have been entering Gaza on a daily basis now we are on the 27th day of the war and this is only half a day worth of supplies not all of them is food we hear from families and friends including mine that the cues to water drinking water and is getting longer uh if you want to get a um like a back of bread you have to queue at least five six hours and if you if you find it if you are lucky enough my sister was telling me that she queued for 6 hours yesterday and then she had to go back without bread because the bakery ran out of it uh basically we are seeing a humanitarian situation that we have never witnessed in all of our interventions globally uh where people are starved they people are lacking access to water medication uh basic necessities and these these are one of the mostly highest dense places across the world basically uh so yeah it's it's very alarming very concerning honestly now now your work at Oxfam normally focuses on gender justice when you look at the situation unfolding in Gaza are there special considerations that need to be made for women's safety and well-being yeah a huge consideration a huge consideration on all aspects the basic needs of women uh feminine hygiene and the need for dignity kits is alarming we are hearing stories about women giving birth in very in in very infected and uh not very uh clean conditions uh if there's any complication for a birth and there are 5,500 00 women who are expected to give birth this month only in the Gaza stb uh we hear about uh young girls taking hormonal uh medications to prevent their period from coming because there are not enough uh toilets or bathrooms around evacuation centers uh we are hearing devastating stories about last yesterday I was in a call where uh someone from Gaza was describing how women 11 women arrived to the shelter they walked from from the Gaza Strip from jabalia where the bombardment happened toal and they arrived in very very bad condition they told him we were 20 by the way the by the time we crossed our own Street we became 11 they came without anything without any food any clothes uh any already they were in their homes in bad conditions but can you imagine the also the psychological stress of running almost 20 kilometers to go to a safe space and then there's no food to be offered for them in this shelter there's no place this guy said we don't have any place to host them even because it's overcrowded they they have at least 20 to 30 people in a small room 2 by3 uh square meters so it's it's uh alarming terrible conditions that you're describing there it's terrible conditions yeah well thank you so much for joining us on DW um with that update that is kazaz with Oxfam International we really appreciate your time Mike noise is with action a UK that's an international charity that works with women and girls living in poverty we asked him how medical staff are coping with the humanitarian crisis in gasa and for more on this uh let's speak to Mike noise he's the head of humanitarian response at action a UK who uh joins us now from London Mike according to the organization doctors with our bord there are around 20,000 injured people in Gaza at the moment how is medical staff there coping yeah thank you for having us on today uh it's a very very difficult situation in Gaza at the moment for for everyone including for medical staff as I'm sure you know we've been working with a number of hospitals for for a long time in Gaza well before this conflict started uh well before this upsurging violence started and what we're hearing from them at the moment is just the sheer impossibility of working uh not well overwhelmed by the numbers of injured but also continued to try and deliver on on their case workk we work particularly with a maternity hospital that is still trying to deliver cesarians still trying to look after babies and incubators in this situation they've had enormous problems with supplies of materials but especially with the need to keep the generators going so that they've got electricity to power uh incubators and ventilators and to to keep the lights on so that they can do their surgery it's an almost impossible situation for them we know some hospitals have already ceased functioning others are on the verge of it now the Raa border crossing is now open for injured people as we've heard earlier in in our program um how are they being prioritized I think that's in the hands of organizations like the the red Cresent society and and the UN it's not something that our hospitals are involved involved with so I'm sorry I can't really help you on that but I think the key thing to say is these are still very small numbers of people getting out of Gaza compared to the the numbers of injured to the to the numbers needing medical treatment and and to the impact that this war has had so far on the hospitals Who Who Are You Know in danger of no longer functioning there really is no longer an effective medical service in Gaza for for the two and a half million people who are who are yet under constant bombardment now there is still though the Palestinian Ministry of Health which is run by Hamas um are they in any way involved in Aid distribution are you talking to them working with them our hospitals are independent hospitals that that that are not part of the Ministry of Health structures in G Gaza that uh we've always worked with that continue to try and deliver services to the population that's the most important thing at this time it's it's about working with and for the Ordinary People of Gaza they're the people who are at the receiving end of all this they're the ones that are suffering most now we've heard reports also that the water in Gaza is contaminated U so where are people getting water from they get they're getting it from wherever they can and it it's a real real struggle more than anything else this is the message we're we're hearing from our colleagues and and and collaborators in Gaza it yeah there are so many challenges that people are facing right now but um the biggest of all is is water uh yeah there's almost no clean water many many people are drinking dirty water we've had multiple reports of people feeling yeah resorting to drinking sea water uh or salt water from from from Wells close to the Sea as it's the the only option available to them and as as anyone will know that is not something people can sustain in the long term we've had you we know people are trying to do yeah local desalination which is effectively means boiling up seaw waterer and catching the condensation but you can't do that without fuel Mike no them the head of humanitarian response at action Aid UK thank you very much thank you very much andw correspondent Rebecca rtis joins us now from stot in southern Israel Rebecca can you give us an update on Israel's offenses yeah well it's very difficult we're standing here in SRO you can see the Gaza bordered behind us it's about 2 kilomet away we can hear all the bombing uh but we know from the Israeli military that they have said that they've actually broken through hamas's first line of defense and that they are pushing through toward Gaza City we believe the plan is that they're trying to encircle the city we know of course that they've been carrying out uh very heavy air bombardments and they're also attacking as I said on the on the ground we've got ground combat and also Naval forces bombing from the sea so very much pushing on with their plan uh there's been an update of the amount of uh IDF soldiers that have been killed since the ground Invasion began uh almost a week ago now uh and that number has risen to 17 We Believe 16 actually inside Gaza and one uh that has died subsequently from his wounds out from from fighting outside in the early days uh after the attack so we're seeing the death toll on the Israeli side the soldiers uh Rising we've had words from the military Chiefs and also from Benjamin nyaho saying for telling Israelis to expect a long road ahead that this is going to be a very tough battle and that's certainly what we're seeing play out now Gaza being of course at the center of attention right now the military activities but we're also hearing of clashes in the West Bank what do you know about that yeah violence has been pretty I mean we know that clashes have been happening of course sporadic and ongoing always and in the last 18 months or so there's been an uptick of Israeli raids military raids on many areas in the West Bank as they try and quash what they say is militant activity um but we've seen that really pick up since October 7 uh since October 7 there's been more than 120 deaths of Palestinians killings either in IDF raids uh or by settler violence which is also peaked quite a lot spiked quite a lot I should say since October 7 we've even had uh ministers calling for gun licenses to be eased and more guns to be handed out promising that they wouldn't in fact Supply people with weapons so that they could you know quote unquote protect themselves or carry out attacks on Palestinians this morning though we also saw an Israeli settler was killed by Palestinian or thought to be Palestinian gunfire in the West Bank and the IDF are conducting a hunt for the shooter so definitely a very tense situation there uh and Palestinians being displaced from their homes as well and Roads cut off lots of uh um uh checkpoints extra checkpoints set up making movement for Palestinians in between cities not only lengthy and uh you know timec consuming difficult but also many tell me that they they're fearful that they're just scared to travel around for the the uptick in settler violence thew correspondent Rebecca R Us there reporting thank you very much
