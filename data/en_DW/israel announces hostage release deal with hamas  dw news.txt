we start with a major breakthrough in the Middle East nearly two months after their worst nightmare began a sigh of relief for the families of 50 women and children held hostage by Hamas in the early hours of Wednesday Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced a hard fought deal that will see the release of 50 hostages in return for a 4-day truce as well as the release of 150 Palestinian Prisoners the pause in fighting will also allow for humanitarian Aid and fuel to enter the Gaza Strip now Qatar which helped broker the agreement said the starting time of the truce would be announced within the next 24 hours now under the agreement Hamas is set to Free 50 of the hostages it took in the October 7th terror attack uh on Israel in exchange around 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel will also be set free and as part of the deal there will be a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas for 4 days and access to humanitarian Aid Israel has also said it would extend the truce if additional hostages are released and we're going to go straight to our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem Rebecca what what more can you tell us uh about this hostage deal and uh ceasefire well it was a much a way to deal as you mentioned you you talked about a lot of the details there we're talking about 50 hostages uh women and children the breakdown we think appears to be 30 children uh 12 mothers and eight women and priority of course being given to the elderly and INF firm we know that this is in exchange for what looks to be 4-day a 4-day ceasefire uh in hostilities for human itarian Aid to be allowed in to the strip and also for the coordination of the release of these hostages uh we know that also uh Israel has agreed to release 150 that's a 3:1 ratio for the hostages three Palestinian prisoners for every one hostage released so we're looking at about 150 also women and children Palestinian prisoners uh that will be released as a part of this deal and as you mentioned of course uh a large of Aid will then be able to be transported into the Gaza Strip where it is sorely needed for the civilians who are suffering dire humanitarian uh situation there that's been unfolding for weeks now and of course much needed fuel fuel to be able to help run the hospitals to help run telecommunication systems uh and many other things of course generators to to create power so this Landmark deal the first cessation in hostilities hopefully as you mentioned uh soon to begin within the next 24 hours let's talk about timing is it clear yet when the first hostages will be released has there been any time suggested yet more specifically nothing more specific than that 24-hour window at this stage uh a list of some 300 potential Palestinian Prisoners has been released and the the there is an idea that that now Israeli citizens who may have been affected by something that the the Palestinian prisoners were arrested for would be able to uh make a petition to the high court so that's there's a legal procedure legal process 24 hours being given for people to to file a petition now if of course there are no delays there then we'll start hearing a more concrete timing we do know that they're going to be releasing potentially 12 to 13 prisoners per day to allow for the truth to keep ongoing a sort of peaca uh part of the processes it's also incredibly difficult uh process to organize the release of these hostages as you can imagine being coordinated also with the Red Cross Red Cross will we've been hearing able to access uh the hostages prior to them being released and be able to administer some Medical Care there but it is going to be a dayslong process and as you mentioned something that may be extended should more uh more hostages be negotiated to be released for every 10 hostages there will be one more day of ceasefire is there anything more uh specific you can tell us about the Palestinian uh prisoners due to be released as part of this agreement well the idea is that they will also be women and children Ana uh there are boys on the list but no men um there have been 300 names as I just mentioned that have been potentially released now that's Al that's of course to find 150 that they'll that no one will take issue with with their release but also to allow for wiggle room for more prisoners to be released should more hostages be released as I just mentioned there is a sort of second phase of the deal kind of tied into this one where we could see potentially more hostages released in exchange for more prisoners and more ceasefire uh up to a maximum of 10 days is what has been published in the cabinet agreement so far so uh in terms of more details on those Prisoners the list has been uh published the names are out there uh but most people I sort of slowly looking through the list uh before coming on air and you see a lot of people um who uh are listed for for quite Petty crimes I think it's unlikely that we'll see anybody who who has um you know perpetrated any serious crimes being released and we know also I should add that nobody on a murder charge will be released now uh some members of uh prime minister netanyahu's coalition government did not support this hostage release deal can you explain to us why that is well it's uh seen as quite a contentious deal by many members of the far right factions uh we saw three members of the odds Yehuda the Jewish power party uh vote against the hostage deal they say this is playing into the hands of Hamas giving them a free kick if you will because they say that by giving them these ceasefires that the this or this humanitarian ceasefire even though it's only for a few days will allow them the opportunity to be able to rearm to to reestablish reconnect and and and work out you know ways to go forward in this conflict ways to be able to keep uh attacking the Israeli military in this war so they were very against it but in the end an overwhelming majority did vote in favor 33 versus three uh and uh even people who had slight concerns including the Finance Minister betel smotrich it does appear that they were one over when uh departments like the Mossad and the internal security services the Shin Bet said that they were on fact on board with this deal and they thought that it was good that seemed to convince a majority of people to vote in favor okay now uh again the Prime Minister uh Israeli Prime Minister had previously resisted entering into any kind of ceasefire deal why has he agree to this one I think it's the overwhelming pressure that he's been facing by the families of the hostages as well as the Israeli public I mean this has affected you know the the the the the psyche of Israel and Israelis and I think there's been a lot of pressure on him we've seen you know protests we've seen marches and we've seen lobbying to particular ministers we've seen the families even in the knesset with heated debates with parliamentarians so you know the the prime minister is under very very severe pressure to try to get all of the hostages out of course but some hostages are seen as better than no hostages at all and it is what he has been saying has been the second aim of this military operation one of course being to eradicate Hamas but the other of course to bring the hostages home and he has to try and do everything that he can to to to make that happen and and we're seeing that the pressure has mounted and that days and days of negotiations also negotiating with the right factions of his of his government uh to try to make sure that everybody is on board and now obviously he's been able to agree you know he's he's seen parts of the deal he's been able to agree to this deal I should say thanks so much for that update Rebecca that's Rebecca rit's reporting from Jerusalem now we're hearing First Reactions from those most directly affected by this deal the relatives of the kidnapped 63-year-old gillad Coral has seven missing family members who are believed to be among the hostages held by Hamas on Wednesday morning gillad described his feelings after news broke of the truce and the hostage deal between Israel and Hamas uh one side I'm I'm happy second uh I'm I'm worried okay because uh nobody told me that my uh family will be this in this uh this uh uh deal okay there was 40 children inside Gaza and they go to only 30 where are the others I don't know and I hope that everybody will release it's terrible 7 weeks it's I think it's never happened in in my life for sure but uh in in in the history of the uh human being like too many hostages too many children too many babies too many women um I don't know how I feel right now I want to be sure that my family will release at least the the grandsons and the my daughter low and then we continue and for more I'm joined Now by our Middle East analyst shannie rosanas shannie good to good to see you uh this deal has been weeks in the making um obviously the hostages were taken on the October the 7th um tell us more about What's led to this breakthrough well I think Israel has realized that its strong operation in Gaza is not yielding the result um it it wanted at the beginning there was still hope there was one soldier they managed the Israeli forces IDF forces managed to release they realize this is not going to happen there growing International pressure to bring more humanitarian Aid into Gaza so it was clear this needs to happen and Israel wanted clearly always to said we're going to pound we're going to crush Gaza uh and we hope this will make Hamas agree to concessions and to bring some hostages uh to be released and finally Israel feels like this has yield the result that they wanted um there's also for Israel when it comes to the offensive up you know on the ground it's the time to move from the south uh from the north to the south of Gaza and seem to be a good timing we also the key here is also for Hamas Hamas wants and needs time to recoup to get fuel which is the most important thing they're also getting from the deal aside from humanitarian Aid um and it seems like both sides have realized 47 days of um attacks and counterattacks have not really yielded much more uh for this moment there needs to be some change now we know that Israeli citizens have 24 hours um to petition the high court against the release of the uh Palestinian prisoners as part of this deal How likely is that and and how would the high court react we will see petitions we already know know of several organizations mostly identified with a right sng with the Jewish power party also that we've we've heard that were objecting this deal um they will petition the court will traditionally before have always always said this is no no decision for the court we we pass the ball to the government this is a fully political decision we have we trust in the government to take the best decision on that uh the procedure still needs to be made they still need to petition they will probably be rejected but this also takes time that needs to be calibrated into the system of how you know what the next steps are tell us about the general response within uh Israel to this hostage deal I mean obviously it's been a massively emotive and emotional situation in Israel it is it's you know the the hostages families have been living through hell in the last 47 days and and and there's always in Israel there's a lot of emphasis on the uh psych psychological warfare of Hamas and the feeling that you know this is an ongoing torture um and so now it's the same thing because one of the reasons we understand there been delay in the U in the agreement on the deal so far was that Hamas refuses to take responsibility on all the kids and and their moms that are held in in Gaza um they said we know of only a certain amount of them Israel was pushing them you got to take responsibility on all of them it's still unclear who of the 30 kids that we know of and their mothers will be released um and that also means that families all these families have been United in the last 47 days together in this effort to bring back their loved ones they're torn apart between them some of them will get the best news that there are some of them will still be left hanging and there's also the um fundamental question if if if I am a woman you know there will be women released um but there is a man that is wounded and needs treatment why would I get a priority over that you know these are internal moral dilemmas Israel is torn with it's not a happy day there aren't many happy days in Israel these days and this one also very cautiously has a glimpse of Hope but I don't see we will I don't think we will see a lot of gushing and public um you know expressions of real Joy uh everything is still very um emotional and very tense shaie rosanas thank you so much we'll come back to you later but for now thank you now in a statement before the cabinet uh meeting in Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that the pause in the fighting that's been agreed Now does not mean the end of the war with let's take a listen we are at War and we will continue the war we will continue the war until we achieve all our objectives eliminate Hamas return all our abductees and missing persons and ensure that there will be no element in Gaza that threatens Israel the Israeli Prime Minister there now my colleague Terry Martin spoke earlier to Peter Lerner he's a spokesperson for the isra isi military the IDF and he asked him when the first hostages are likely to be released indeed the um framework is being processed we have a due process in Israel and of course there's a a legal process that is undergoing as uh your report as Rebecca announced uh the the names of the terrorists H that are going to be released has been uh announced to the public and anybody that has a problem with that list can appeal uh to the Supreme Court and now only after that process is completed will will there be able to be a uh an instruction to the military to hold its fire and to enable the the release of the hostages and and the the terrorists into uh as agreed uh the situation on the ground continue continues this morning to be a a situation of uh combat the IDF is continuing to pursue Hamas terrorists wherever they are hiding we are destroying and dismantling the tunnels that we are encountering and engaging the enemy wherever they are does the Israeli Army have a role in the actual release process do you know uh are the are are the IDF forces going to be escorting the hostages out of Gaza delivering the released Palestinian prisoners uh well of course the situation is uh first of all the role is to hold fire once we receive that instruction that in in itself uh is a huge feat because we have to be in defensive positions we need to uh make sure that what happened in 2014 where Hamas continue to uh to attack US during ceasefires and abduct Israeli soldiers doesn't happen again so of course there is a significant role in maintaining and implementing the government's instructions but we will do so nevertheless U the reality on the ground is one where as you rightly quoted prime minister netan is Hamas still need to go Hamas still can never be allowed to wield this sword of death above our heads ever again and that is why the the the the paes in the hostilities the PA in the in the combat will uh will take place uh but after that we are intending on to continue our operation in order to relieve the region and uh um bring home more hostages the the hostages you know the youngest is 10 months old this is the the enemy that we are facing and we are determined to bring all of hostages home and create a better security regime for Israelis and Palestinians alike now part of the deal as you mentioned is a is a is a truce a 4-day truce uh obviously there's still fighting going on there uh is there fighting happening right now as we speak Colonel lenner uh the operations are ongoing and we are achieving our goals as we speak absolutely the reality on the ground is that Hamas are still engaging our forces and we are seeking them out and pursuing them wherever they are you know they come out of tunnels launch RPGs against our forces uh and we are destroying the tunnel Network as we speak you know the the situation of hostages has been and it goes hand inand with the operational achievements and directives that we've we've um uh been guided to since the beginning of the war and you know we need the hostages home and we also need Hamas to go wherever they are they need to be pursued How concerned are you that Hamas will be able to use the truce to regroup and rearm especially given that Israel has reportedly committed to at least a partial suspension of air reconnaissance during the troops so our activities will be paused in accordance to the government's directives uh those that pause is in order in order to enable the access of humanitarian Goods of supplies to the people of Gaza the people of Gaza are not our enemy but Hamas is the eny enemy and of course this enemy is a ruthless merciless enemy and we can't trust them and we don't trust them so of course we will be watching very very carefully and utilizing all of the tools and available to us in order to address that threat and indeed it is a threat but you know the idea of and the possibility of bringing the hostages home in this case is is a is of utmost importance and that is why we are focused on bringing them home now your stated goal is to eliminate Hamas and remove any military threat from Gaza how close are you Colonel danana to achieving those goals so we understand that we have dis destroyed extensive presence in the northern Gaza Strip um several battalions have been dispersed and destroyed and dismantled we are engaging the tunnel Warfare the tunnel capabilities that Hamas had uh prepositioned and built over the last 16 years in in Northern Gaza and and throughout and we are engaging them wherever they are indeed there is they still have operational capabilities but they are definitely on the run and I would say the result of this agreement or this agreement the framework of releasing hostages is a result of the extreme pressure that the IDF has put on Hamas on its leadership on its organization and its ability to conduct its operations against us so I would say we're moving close every closer every single day to achieving our our ultimate goal of securing and safe restoring safety to the people of Israel Israelis living in the communities surrounding the Gaza Strip but not only because they continue to fire rockets at us and and this is something that we won't accept and that was Peter Lerner spokesperson for the Israeli Army the IDF speaking to DW earlier now Germany has welcomed the deal between Israel and Hamas foreign minister analina bbok described the agreement to release some of the host hostages as a breakthrough she also urged for Vital Aid to be distributed among the people of Gaza Germany as well as the United States the UK and the European Union have rejected calls for a long-term ceasefire arguing that it could give Hamas time to regroup we're going to cross straight to DW's political correspondent Matthew Moore who joins us now from our parliamentary studios here in Berlin Matthew has there been any another reaction yet from Berlin to the news of this hostage deal apart from what we just heard beyond that statement there really hasn't been much reaction Anya not from the chancellor or other government ministers which I think perhaps speaks to a sense of cautious optimism some senior MPS though have been tweeting Mikel wrote a former Junior minister in the foreign Ministry who happens to be in Israel this morning tweeted a photo of a meeting with relatives of hostages and he wrote wrote it was an important step but we can only rest when all the hostages are free another MP tweeted saying it was a good deal but it but that it was vital that quote Hamas butchers were held accountable and disempowered I going back to analena bearok statement she specifically pointed out that being liberated was not would not heal the suffering that these hostages have endured and again she talked about the need to use the poses to get Aid to gazin and what do we know about any German Nationals who who may be among the hostages that well we know that of the some 240 hostages being held by Hamas we understand that a small double digit number of them hold German citizenship last month actually some of their relatives traveled to Berlin to Lobby Chancellor schz and president Stein Meer and other government ministers to do all they can to bring their loved ones home and for a German audience really brought the conflict closer to home relatives were on the talk shows they were in newspapers and basically part of their campaign was to to keep their loved ones very much in the thoughts and minds of the German politicians but also the German public and I remember speaking to one kind of 90-year-old man who sister and brother-in-law um were held captive by Hamas and he was telling me that you know he's helpless but he got a few minutes with Chancellor Schulz and he told them then that he wanted him to put pressure on Egypt and Qatar and you know I got in touch with the family again and the representatives and they say today they're simply they don't know whether their relatives will be the ones that will be liberated and they're basically under a cloud of uncertainty and they can only hope uh and wait so do we actually know if Germany has played any role at all in these uh hostage negotiations well from the beginning German leaders have traveled through the region Chancellor sches was held talks with the Jordanian King with the Egyptian president and the Amir of Qatar all key players in the region and importantly conduit to Hamas in an interview with DW this week the forign minister an Alena bbok was quite candid about the Diplomatic negotiations going kind of behind the scenes saying how sensitive they are how tricky it is to negotiates he was talking about the the the fact that you're dealing with the political wing of Hamas which is in Qatar and it's very different and it's separate to the jihadist wing based in Gaza and she talked about the the efforts that the International Community were were um carrying out they're trying to get Hamas to put all the hostages in Gaza in one place just physically have them in one place I think she she was they felt that that would improve their welfare and make it easier to ultimately secure all of their release um and not just a few a few groups at a time so again just really underlining how Frau this is um and coming to an agreement is okay now we heard the foreign minister um earlier saying that the truce should be used to get Aid to gazans what help is is Germany sending so officials you know to describe the situation in Gaza is disastrous and um they have basically pledged more and more money to United Nations and the Red Cross there I think um the the number now that that Germany is sending to to organizations is 160 Million worth of Aid this year making sure it gets to gazin is really important they' they've um appointed an Envoy to to coordinate that um to get the food water medical supplies to the people most need to make sure that it doesn't go and end up in the hands of Hamas Matthew Moore our political correspondent thank you so much for that update now the president of the European commission Osa ferion has welcomed the hostage deal as well between Israel and Hamas in a statement she said the European commission will do its utmost to use this pause for a humanitarian surge to Gaza let's get more on the European reaction uh from DW correspondent Rosie burchard who joins us now from Strasburg which is where the European Parliament meets good to see you Rosie the uh EU has welcomed the hostage release uh at today's plenary debate what more have you heard from EU officials there officials and lawmakers from the EU have been gathering in this room behind me and of course the first message was really one of a wholehearted welcome the EU said it however re iterates it call for all hostages to be released and there was talk again of trying to use this this expected pause as a way to Surge humanitarian Aid into Gaza and with that in mind the Block's humanitarian Aid chief called for greater humanitarian access into Gaza so the aid the EU is sending can actually make it in now Beyond this there's also been a bit of reflection here about the longer term looking back and looking to the Future and the eu's foreign policy Chief yose barell issued what I would say was a bit of an indictment of the Block's foreign policy over the last few years because he said basically for decades the EU has been talking about a two-state solution in the Middle East that is what the block officially calls for but he said that has been backed up by very little action I wanted to actually ask you about Joseph Bell's comments because obviously very directly addressing the lack of unity in the EU when it comes to conflict I mean was that picked up in today's debate at all absolutely I think it's really interesting usually EU officials will try and kind of paper over the cracks in the division of course 27 different member states have different opinions but here Burell the EU foreign policy Chief really acknowledged it he said there has been disunity the EU hasn't spoken with one voice and he acknowledged he said that he's trying to converge so that the EU can bring some sort of diplomatic weight here now since the start of this since October 7th attacks the EU has been United in its condemnation of Hamas and it's United in its call for for the release of hostages but where it has been divided is in how to move forward and particularly some EU member states have been calling for a ceasefire for example Ireland Spain others have been much more reticent on that fearing that could only serve to embolden Hamas which is of course recognized by the European Union as a terror organization now with regards to all these divisions which are still in place I think critics would say that while these important deals like the one we heard about today are being negotiated it looks like the EU really seems to be much more of a bystander than any sort of a real major broker here and that's what Burell was seemed to be referring to when he said he would like to try and converge positions in order to bring some sort of geopolitical influence in future okay and Rosie we've talked about this humanitarian surge to Gaza can you just give us a few more details about the uh the humanitarian Aid what's been discussed about that so the European Union has around quadrupled its human itarian Aid to Gaza since October 7th so that's things like medical supplies things like food and that's been pretty much accepted by all member states it's not been really a big source of division where there has been more debate Ana is when it comes to development Aid so that's long-term funding uh which goes to Palestinians so for example for infrastructure for education and there we heard uh the very early days after this original attacks by Hamas an announcement that the EU would be reviewing development Aid to Palestinians there was in fact an announcement that it would be suspended and then that was retracted part of this whole what looked at the time like a real foreign policy model the EU has now announced that it's completed its review of that development Aid funding and that it hasn't found any major cause for concern or any suggestion that funds have been diverted to Hamas that was the fear that had initially been raised but it does say it's going to be looking a bit more measures for scrutiny increased scrutiny for future for this kind of long-term development Aid to Palestinians that in itself has proved divisive because we have some saying well if you haven't found any cause for concern this is not the time to be adding additional barriers but of course within this really heated geopolitical context that's what the the European commission says is needed moving forward Rosie thanks so much for that really appreciate it that's DW's Rosie burchard reporting from Strasburg and joining me again now in our studio here is DW's Middle East analyst shaie rosan it's good to see you again shaie so uh as we were saying earlier we know that this deal has now been agreed um but obviously now it has to be implemented doesn't it so you know what could go wrong what are the potential pitfalls here so many things can go right I mean Israel has experienced from 2014 when there was back then a ceasefire uh decided upon and and Hamas forces have attacked Israeli forces and killed one of uh Israel's soldiers it's still a holds its body it's it's a very painful traumatic memory for Israel so they're very much afraid of that what's going to happen I mean can Hamas actually control all of the mil militants on the ground does he even have contact with all of them do they all in line agree and in line with this deal that's that's one thing and that's why Israeli forces in the next 24 hours will try to bring themselves into safer positions because Israel does not plan to withdraw from the strip but further more within the deals mechanism we're built Securities to assure that to both sides that they will stick to their parts so only this is why we're talking about installments of four days so every day Israel first will need to seize the fire I mean we're starting tomorrow morning Hamas when he sees that he will need to release the hostages only after they have been accepted by Israeli side not just a Red Cross but by Israeli soldiers then Israel will release its prisoners there's all these mechanisms there's also inside the Gaza Strip another Force this is the Islamic Jihad the Palestinian uh another militant uh armed group and they're not officially part of Hamas and they have the freedom as they see it to always uh try and act against Israeli forces so that's also a very uh sensitive issue Israel promised um any violations will be responded with disproportionate um amount of power which we've seen Israel quite capable of applying in the last 47 days so um yeah the qataris the Americans everybody who's brokering these deals are very much uh careful for the details everybody know it's going to be a very slow progress one step after another okay what about Israel's northern border I mean do we know if the agreement also includes Israeli actions against Hezbollah in in southern Lebanon um and if so how How likely is Hezbollah um to to observe a truce well yesterday was one of the the most deadly days along the the border with Lebanon between Israel and Lebanon so um surprisingly Israel was expecting today see a lot of retaliation actually hisbah has been quite quiet today we've also seen hisbah leader Hassan asala meeting this morning with Hamas leaders um and we're expecting to see the Iranian foreign minister in Beirut this morning so obviously these two um these two places are aligned um officially however it's not part of the deal um we have seen hasbalah seeing himself as a backup for Kamas if there will be escalation if there be an unexpected turn of events we probably will see also healah uh responding with his escalation but so far it seems like all sides um that we have been seeing active in the last couple of weeks willing to slow things down to deescalate okay so there's a sense of hope there but you've also made very clear how complicated and um tricky the situation is now we are hearing that there's an option to extend the truce if Hamas um releases additional so do you think that there is a realistic chance of a longer ceasefire coming out well there is because Hamas benefits from more time to regroup recoup and actually hoping that the longer it you know Israel pauses its uh fighting um the long the harder it's going to get for it to resume fire uh because of international pressure but also for technical reasons of what's happening on the ground so the assumption is that Hamas will try to deliver 10 to 12 more hostages every day in return toist fire that's the formula I agreed upon the assumption is that could bring Israel's uh released hostages to up to 80 and not just a 50 officially agreed upon um and this is also a bit of concern in Israel mostly in the right-wing parts of the government they are afraid Israel will be drawn uh you know to follow hamas's lead you know to get in more and more hostages released and will deviate from its main goal um to get rid of Hamas control over Gaza and not to resume the fight that's the biggest concern we've seen Nano in all the the cabinet yesterday meeting trying to reassure Israel is determined to resume fire once the deal is done the key is we don't really know when the deal will be done all right I mean how many days is going to take okay but we will be watching closely our Middle East analyst Shan rosanis thank you so much shannie now I'm very pleased to welcome Gilly Roman brother of yaden Roman from Berry a German citizen who was kidnapped with her mother-in-law and sister-in-law welcome to DW thank you so much for your time today it's been almost 7 weeks of heartwrenching uncertainty for you and the hundreds of family members whose loved ones were taken hostage by Hamas on October the 7th can I ask you what are you feeling right now first of all it's uh we are feeling thrilled we we were waiting for this deal we uh we're very um firm that we support this deal for the last few weeks since it came into to critical stages before approval I think that it's our moral duty I'm not talking only as a family member but also just as a human being and as a Israeli and German citizen it's our moral duty to start bring dozens of people back to make to make sure that they are safe and they are alive and mostly when we talking about most vulnerable people like kids uh and women and uh so I'm excited I want to see them back already I want to see the the photos I want to to see this this change of Dynamics by talking only about war started talking about life um of course at the same time I'm pretty anxious it's not clear if uh among the women that are related to this uh deal and the mothers my sister who is also a mother to a three years old child uh that she was able to rescue from being kidnapped is among the people who are going to be released so we are anxious and uh we are hopeful it's a mix of many emotions I can imagine I I did want to ask you whether you had any more information about who exactly will be released no I think that nobody has I unfortunately I I assume that even our government doesn't know exactly who is going to be released and we will know daily uh as the agreement um describes as far as my understanding only the day prior to the release every day we will know who are the people who are expected to be released it is horrible it is painful but this is Terrorism this is mere psychological terrorism and we all need to be resilient and strong in order to go through it this is how terrorism is uh constructed I presume as well that then you won't know anything about the the hostages condition whether they're in good health until they actually are back well hopefully uh there will be finally uh be open to a visits of the Red Cross so far R cross has done U almost nothing for the Israeli humanitarian uh issue of this conflict and they will according to the Declaration of our prime minister yesterday they will be given permission to visit and take care of the hostages that will not be released so I believe that that is a step forward can I ask whether you have been consulted or in any way way involved in these negotiations to get the hostages back no let's not exaggerate nobody's Consulting me in this uh in this level we're talking about the highest levels of professional officials it's not even a political negotiation it's really an expert uh negotiation uh of course we try to to uh give our 10 cents for the for this matter and um deliver some uh messages but it's way above uh our level and I think it should be like this and that would enables it to be a professional negotiation and to get to the uh line where we are at the moment okay now what about the remaining hostage hostages not due to be released in the coming days is there any sense at all whether they are still alive even unfortunately there is no clear answer to this question the assumption is that uh many more hostages are alive Beyond this 50 uh hostages the agreement also talks about uh hostages beyond the first 50 or so that if Hamas will be able to gather them um and to assemble them uh towards release we'll be able to continue this humanitarian pause day by day uh we hope to see that we really hope to see that that this going not going to end after 4 days there going to be a severe continuation of that uh and then we'll understand how many uh people at least among the category of women and children are alive and available for for release now I believe that much more uh people are alive and can be released and that might take a while longer but it doesn't mean that after this deal this is the end of of the civilians and soldiers that can be saved I think that we will need to be ready for more pressure and more resilience and patient until everybody will be released I know that many of the affected families have expressed concerns that the Israeli military can't keep pursuing its military campaign against Hamas while at the same time trying to secure the safe release of the remaining hostages but we have heard from prime minister Netanyahu and I quote here um to uh continue the war to destroy Hamas can I ask you for your reaction to that I think that U our cabinet has proven so far that the two goals of uh dismantling Hamas and um protecting our our B orders and our security and the uh ultimate and very sacred uh goal of bringing the hostages back are not conflictual at so far the pressure the military pressure is the only language we see that Hamas understands and that what brought us to the point where we can release so many of our civilians at the moment so I think that those two goals as the Prime Minister indicated are not conflictual but um uh integrated uh into each other uh at the same time it's important to say that it's the military the idea of responsibility to conduct this operation in a very conative uh careful Manner and I think they have proven to uh to be doing that so far and my expectation and even demand that it will be conducted as such also in the also in the long run um but we want to see all the hostages back we understand that it might come with difficulties to the military and we see already that they're willing to do this uh to this uh to do this move but we also want to see a secure and safe uh Israel for all citizens Gilly Roman brother of kidnapped
