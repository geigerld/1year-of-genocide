the Israeli Army says it has expanded its ground offensive into every part of the Gaza Strip heavy bombing has been reported in the southern city of can Yunis following orders by Israeli forces for Palestinians to leave the area Israel says its new ground operation is needed to destroy Hamas which is classified by several countries as a terrorist organization Palestinians in the sealed off territory say they're running out of places to go outside this Hospital in Gaza City more and more bodies are lined up there's no room inside it's full with the wounded as the focus of Israeli bombardments turns to the crowded south of the strip people say they have nowhere left to go the territory is sealed off death is everywhere where should we [Music] turn survivors of strikes report evacuation orders coming too late before the bombs hit and say that it's homes businesses and civilians that are being targeted we came here in the street and saw Martyrs wounded here and there we don't know why we don't know for what reason it's an ordinary Mill why do they strike an Olive Mill but Israel maintains that it does not Target civilians and claims it's hitting Hamas locations now expanding its ground operation into the South as well the Israeli Defense Forces continue to extend their ground operation against Hamas in all of the Gaza Strip in all of Gaza where there is a Hamas Center the IDF is operating fighting face to face with terrorists and killing them the Israel goal of eliminating Hamas apparently stretches far beyond Gaza in audio obtained by Israel's public broadcaster the head of the internal security service Shin Bet vowed to eliminate Hamas leaders overseas too the cabinet set a goal for us to eliminate Hamas and we are determined to do that in every place in Gaza Judea Samaria Lebanon in Turkey in Qatar everywhere it will take several years but we will be there to do it as the war heads into its third month there's little hope that the fighting will end anytime soon Israel's closest Ally the US has called for limiting harm to Palestinian civilians but on the ground in Gaza there is no sign of respite from the constant attacks well for more let's bring in Shaina low from the Norwegian Refugee Council she joins us from Jerusalem uh Shaina what can you tell us about the current humanitarian situation in Gaza the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate day by day now already we've seen about 80% of Palestinians internally displaced within Gaza um more than 60% of housing damaged or destroyed now we have a second wave or an additional wave of uh displacement causing chaos Panic shelters are already overcrowded on top of that the ongoing hostilities are greatly limiting the ability of humanitarian organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council from reaching those who need assistance most we desperately need a ceasefire in order to address the incredible unbelievable humanitarian needs that have grown over the last eight weeks people in Gaza are now being told to flee from parts of the South but is there a safe place for civilians in Gaza at the moment sha there hasn't been a safe place in Gaza in the last 8 weeks we are continually perplexed by these directives for Palestinians to flee certain areas of the of the Gaza Strip uh to to so-called safer areas there are no safe places for people the shelters are overcrowded people are still being targeted in areas that are supposedly safe we ourselves had F had staff who lost family members when after they had fled the North to the South who were then bombed in the South this is a pattern that we've seen over and over again where people who have already fled one place to to where they were told to go are being killed in the places that are supposed to be safer the only way to establish safe places in Gaza is to have a ceasefire and end the hostilities now the widening offensive will certainly complicate Aid deliveries to Gaza how much Aid is actually getting through now well the UN hasn't been able to even release the numbers of trucks that went through yesterday there were some trucks but it's unclear how many went through the other challenge is that even Aid that has made it through that has been pre-positioned it might not be possible for humanitarian organizations to access that Aid we ourselves have been cut off from the middle area which is where uh three truckloads worth of goods were uh we're in a warehouse awaiting distribution each day we are having to reassess what is and isn't possible and adjust our plans and pivot it's incredibly difficult to have a humanitarian response that that reaches people in need when they're ongoing hostilities and also when there's such limited amounts of Aid getting in what's it like Shaina for you and particular particularly your colleagues on the ground in Gaza trying to provide help under these circumstances you know for our colleagues in Gaza not only are they trying to provide help but they're also the ones now needing help and trying to keep their families safe and and provide for their families every day is the worst day of their lives every day that it gets more and more challenging we I personally have run out of things to say to reassure my colleagues in Gaza because the situation day by day just looks Bleaker bleer not only for them on the inside but for them on the outside each day it's just a struggle to to find basic needs hours of waiting in line to get bread uh difficulty finding clean water um and then and watching people it's incredibly difficult to be working for a humanitarian organization seeing so much suffering and feeling completely helpless in in being able to provide any type of assistance we are struggling uh and our staff are struggling just as the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped inside Gaza are struggling what do people in Gaza need most right now Shaina what they need most is a ceasefire they need an end to this violence and so that then we can bring in a scale up the amount of assistance going in help people with the um recovery and help them to clear the rubble and help them to rebuild their l of course people are desperate for everything food water medicines medical supplies fuel cooking gas all of the things that they've been needing for the last eight weeks but the best way to provide for the people of Gaza is to have a ceasefire so that humanitarian organizations can go in and safely provide the assistance that people so desperately need Shaina thank you very much as always that was Shaina loow from the Norwegian Refugee Council and we can now talk to Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lan he joins us from Tel Aviv he's a spokesperson for the Israeli military thanks for being with us again now your forces Colonel down are expanding their operations in southern Gaza uh should we expect the offensive in the South to unfold much as the way the offensive in the north did with similar impact T good morning indeed from our perspective We are continuing uh our offensive against Hamas against Hamas terrorists wherever they are hiding and engaging them from the sky from the ground and from sea uh Hamas has um T decided in their strategic decision not to release the hostages these 17 women and children that are still being held by them that we will resume the offensive this is precisely the the stipulation of the agreement of the for U the framework um that stipulated the cessation of hostilities will maintain as long as they hand over hostages we still have 137 hostages and that is why um because they decided to break down and step away from that agreement we have been instructed by the government to resume our offensive in order to bring back the hostages and make sure that Hamas never power of government again so I would say without going into specifics of where we are how we're operating what specific locations we are going to operate in I would say definitely we are taking the fight to Hamas so again I'm just wondering what we can expect to happen there in the South because this is a new phase in the war we had a cessation of hostilities for a few days as those hostages uh were released um what can we expect in the South and and what's happening still in the north are you still facing resistance there um the combat is continuous we've not seen any real uh uh difference in the in the north as over the last few days of the last this is now date three since we've resumed our offensive we have uh struck and killed B two Battalion commanders from one from sajia one from Shati over the last two days we are undermining their operational capabilities and killing their fighters on the ground every single day um this is what we continue to do regarding specific Precision strikes that we're conducting in location in the South they are intelligence-based uh and um I would say because it's not boots on the ground in the south at this stage they are they are uh very uh focused on distinguishing between the civilians and um the terrorists the non-combatants to the terrorists and that is the the the current situation we are uh this still this morning um as the the operation develops indeed we have uh the freedom and the obligation to to remove Hamas from governing the Gaza Strip we have the responsibility to make sure that they don't have terrorist capabilities ever to attack Israel again I want to ask you about civilian casualties in Gaza it's a sensitive subject um it's estimated that around 15,000 civilians have been killed there uh since Israel began its operations in response to those horrific attacks by Hamas on Israel on October 7th are you expecting Colonel Lana a similar level of Civilian casualties in this next phase of the war Terry every civilian life lost in this war is a human tragedy a colle and a collective tragedy it's an individual tragedy and it's a tragedy that could have been averted it could have been averted by Hamas not launching their war against Israel uh but once they did they determined also where the Battleground is and that poses extreme challenges for any professional military we are going to continue to operate within the laws of armed conflict in order to mitigate limit the civilian strife and limit civilian casualties it is a war nevertheless and all of the efforts that we go in order to limit those casualties uh limit those fatalities are a huge challenge uh especially in light of the fact that Hamas have intentionally placed their command and control positions in hospitals intentionally position their rocket launchers from in schools intentionally position their tunnel underneath houses and mosques and and and all of the civilian infrastructure so indeed we will go out continue to go out of our way in order to evacuate people from Harm's Way uh under the understanding that Hamas is interested in maintaining those images maintaining the civilian casualties this is the tragedy of this war talk to us a little more about those evacuations because we've been hearing uh for quite a while now that there's really no safe place to go in Gaza I just spoke to an aid worker who uh who told me that people are being killed in places that they were told were going to be safe where do you expect gazin to go now to escape the fighting and survive it so we have an elaborate system of designating specific neighborhoods specific locations where we are intending and operating and indeed we are announcing to to those locations specific locations um where people should move from uh and where they should where they will be safer and indeed that is the reality that is the vast um I would say the the extensive reality on the ground that hundreds and perhaps thousands of people are evacuating from specific places and reaching safety uh in the area indeed it doesn't undermine the fact that Hamas will continue to abuse civilian locations elsewhere continue to launch rockets continue to uh conduct attacks continue to hide and plan their activities from uh from within the civilian Arena putting more people at risk this is the challenge that we face um you can't expect us not to defend our people because they are hiding behind Palestinians Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lena thank you very much good day journalist hm baloa used to report from Gaza he now joins us from Jordan ham what are you hearing about the situation in Gaza right now um according to the people on the ground and from the reports um from different sources that um some people described last night that was like as the war started um over again there was a huge bombardments and air strikes in across the G STP from the north area and from the south um many people said that they heared um uh some tanks are entering some areas like shwan in in Gaza City then new thing that the tanks are trying to to cross um from the sorry from the south from the south from the eastern part of the South to the West trying to Gaza STP and unit from other parties now people in Gaza have been told to evacuate areas that are being targeted by the Israeli military where are they supposed to go ham this is the always um the question is asked and by everybody by the people they have no place I know people who got displaced like um from five or six times some people are more some from the north this place to Gaza City then to the south then to other place in the South now they are asked to move somewhere else um I'm talking to people and they are asking and if you look at the social media people are sharing and asking um about places to go people um in in Rafa for example yesterday I saw plenty of of post asking people where to go they they are literally in the street they have no place to go as the people ask from kanun to leave the area as a ground invasion is expected uh to invade the area now Israel says it will continue its offensive in Gaza until the threat from Hamas has been eliminated what what are Gins expecting to happen there in the coming days and weeks ham the expectation is the worse um uh it's it's getting worse from day uh to another from u a moment to another uh the death go is increasing uh destruction is um is widening um people losing hope um I can see that in their words when I talk to them when I read their their messages um um it's very hard for them they have no um no hope um of of anything would happen or change of course they they are willing that to see the war is over but um the the reality on the ground that they have no um no signs of anything would impr would improve especially with the increase in the South now is like the tanks is improving and and getting new areas um especially amid of the lack of food lack of water and and electricity communication and people are not able to shelter um and they are moving from a place to another ham thank you very much that was journalist hm belala in Iman you we can now cross to our correspondent Rebecca r ERS who's standing by in Jerusalem Rebecca Israel is coming under increasing pressure to avoid civilian casualties is it showing any sign of changing its tactics in Gaza due to the international pressure Terry not at all in fact quite uh to the contrary we've heard from both prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the heads of the military that they will push on in uh the next phase as they call it of their ground operation that they will press on in the same fashion yesterday we heard the head of Israeli military saying that this would be no less powerful the operation in the South and no less successful uh we heard that on Thursday Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State did speak to heads of the Israeli government and the Israeli military leaders here saying urging them that they what we saw in the north couldn't be repeated in the South we heard Kamala Harris uh the the vice president of the US saying uh in Doha that the civilian casualties were just too high so we are seeing that pressure but we're really seeing the exact opposite coming from Israel they are vowing to push on and to continue they maintain that they they give sufficient warnings to civilians to be able to get out of the areas that they're bombarding we had confirmation yesterday of course as you've been reporting that they have now moved into the South and in all areas and have you know from all accounts that we're getting have have carved up much of the area into what's been being called a maab uh get board game if you will numbered areas in the strip that citizens can then look up and see whether their area that they're in is going to be attacked so uh I think it's unlikely that we'll see any let up from the Israelis and and we're very very likely in fact to see a similar level of Destruction and civilian casualties now Hamas is still holding hostages uh in Gaza is there any indication Rebecca that Israel and Hamas might return to the negotiating table to talk about another hostage release uh another pause in the fighting it's always really difficult to say Terry the talks are are always kept very much Under Wraps um but you know there is intention from the negotiators we have seen the US Qatar and Egypt pushing for the resumption of these talks they were ongoing even after the limited ceasefire broke down on Friday they they were continuing but on Saturday they they did come to a complete halt when Israel pulled out its negotiators from Doha where they had been there trying to discuss the resumption they blamed Hamas for for not uh sticking to their promise of of providing a list of further women and children to be uh released in the hostage exchange um but you know they it is of course likely that they could uh rejoin talks down the track we know that they're under immense pressure it's Israel from the families from the relatives of the hostages and from other uh you know from the whole nation really to to make sure that these hostages are returned to Israel um but that at this stage those talks still uh stalled Rebecca thank you very much our correspondent Rebecca ritters there in Jerusalem as Israel expands its ground offensive to all of Gaza I asked military analyst Marina Miron if the Israeli military was picking up where it left off after the weekl long pause in in or if this signals a change in strategy well I think that they have they had to readjust the strategy nobody knew how long the ceasefire will last um if it will last we have seen that it has worked out for seven days but now a lot of things could have happened during this time and Hamas might have moved its weapons might have moved um the hostages the remaining hostages so obviously Israeli intelligence would have had to be very active during this time in order to be able to assess the situation on the ground and to provide this information to the Troops in order to be able to conduct its operation further so it seemed that um Israel has started in the north now they want to start in the South so they will be more concentrating on the south and and then bringing those two closer together presumably we don't know it will depend on how the military operation evolves right and we're looking at something like 10,000 Palestinians dead were using estimates from the uh the Hamas controlled um health authority in Gaza but the UN the US has led a growing chorus of disqui at those civilian deaths um why do you think Israel has not changed its strategy despite those warnings it is very difficult um to adjust the strategy especially if you are fighting an IR regular force and then IR regular force is Hamas so according to the international law both sides would have to take all feasible precautions in order to get the civilians out um this is unfortunately not the case and this is where normal people who have nothing to do with this conflict suffer as a potential collateral damage but we don't know all the facts we do not know why Israel is CH choosing the locations and um that is choosing to strike and we see a lot of those locations are civilian locations so these ass assessments will have to be made um post morm so to say and I think um the reason why Israel doesn't want to change its strategy is because it would be a military disadvantage for Israel so Israel could be much slower much more discriminate perhaps but that would allow more time for Hamas to move around and then Israel wouldn't be able to use its entire might to strike Hamas targets so there is this tradeoff and I think right now Israel is not ready to make that step despite the fact that um for Hamas this is very beneficial because groups like that want a disproportionate response in order to be able to film it and then to put it out and um conduct psychological operations in terms of showing how barbaric the other side is clear as ever thank you so much for joining us again on this Sunday Marina military analyst Marina
