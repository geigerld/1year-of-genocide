President Joe Biden says the US is negotiating a new UN resolution on Gaza that quote we may be able to agree to the country is holding talks with key allies the UN Security Council still is working to get us approval on a resolution sponsored by Arab states to Halt the fighting a vote on that has been delayed for a third time as diplomats negotiate with the United States on the wording the latest version calls for a suspension of hostilities between Israel and Hamas which many countries designate a terror group over the weekend France the UK and Germany joined Global calls for a ceasefire but even if the security Council passes a ceasefire resolution it's not clear if it would be heeded Hamas has issued a statement saying there should be quote no talk about prisoners or exchange deals except after a full cess cessation of aggression and speaking as those negotiations went on at the UN Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who also appeared to rule out any truce we continue the war until the end it will continue until Hamas is eliminated until Victory those who think we will stop and not connected to reality we will not stop fighting until we achieve all of the goals we have set the elimination of Hamas the release of our hostages and the removal of the threat from Gaza we are attacking Hamas with infernal fire everywhere including today we also attack their assistance from near and far all Hamas terrorists from the first to the last are dead men they only have two options surrender or die for more on those diplomatic talks and the politics surrounding the situation in Gaza I'm joined from Tel Aviv by Myra zonshine a journalist and Senior Middle East analyst with the international crisis group Myra can I just get your a reaction on what Benyamin Netanyahu has said he has talked about fighting on till the very end it doesn't see sound very much like Mr Netanyahu would respect any truce if at all it was agreed at the UN or in another venue right well we've heard from Netanyahu and from most of the Israeli leadership that this war will take months and months and months and that it will take a very long time because they are dedicated to what they say is the distru ction of Hamas uh that military objective is something that almost 3 months into this war it is hard to see um I just don't I don't think that Israel is able to really build a victory narrative at this point and Netanyahu as many know and understand is interested in political survival he's already in a reelection campaign as he knows that most Israelis are interested in an election or in some kind of removal of him from Power once this war ends and so the question of if how and when when this war will end remains very obscure the victory remains completely Elusive and as such Netanyahu continues to talk about endless endless work Myra meanwhile the US also says quote very serious negotiations are taking place on a new ceasefire Gaza ceasefire but the prospects for a deal remain uncertain with Israel as we just saw and Hamas both standing firm in their demands what do you think is needed now in your view to break this Deadlock well we certainly need a ceasefire but what's on the table currently from Israel is some kind of pause the type of pause that we saw in late November in order to release hostages there is great public pressure from the families of the hostages in Israel to first get the hostages out and then continue on with the war as Israel sees fit um you know so what's what's on the table currently both in the UN and in the Israeli proposal is something that Hamas has officially rejected Hamas wants a complete stop to the war something that Israel rejects but you know as far as the crisis group is concerned and certainly many humanitarian agencies because of the disaster in Gaza uh the starvation the disease the outbreak and the fact that we don't really see an end to Hamas rule there yet uh we need a ceasefire now there's also Regional escalation to worry about and these are all reasons to stop the war and then enter into some kind of diplomatic and political process which is really the only way that will bring security to Israelis about the UN Security Council uh draft Gaza resolution the US is wrangling over the wording there as well what do you think needs to change for the US to back it well I think the US has already TR you know it's already made it clear that it's not interested in a ceasefire or what what they've been calling a sustainable I think cessation uh they want a pause um I I'm hoping that that's something that the US can agree to but you know the US has made it stands very very clear um even though it's tried to limit maybe in some ways the way Israel is is waging this war the US is 100% behind Israel it is not calling for a ceasefire and so any UN resolution that alludes to ceasefire is not going to be uh supported by the US uh if it's some kind of pause then maybe that's something that the US can get behind we were talking about Benjamin nanahu earlier and I'd like to bring him back into the conversation how much do you think there is a sense that uh Benyamin Netanyahu and his government are getting frustrated and even angry at the way Israel's closest allies now talking about its actions in Gaza well I mean I think that Israel has been able to act with impunity for for decades uh with regarding its treatment of the Palestinians and so you know I don't I think Israel is aware that there's a big problem with the number of people it has killed and the fact that it's really instead of destroying Hamas seems to just be destroying Gaza so you know Netanyahu is also showing to be be confronting by B in on his you know so-called pressure because he thinks that will get him uh points with his base here in Israel um so you know I I don't really sense that Israel feels pressure uh from the world obviously there's major protests in Western capitals um but otherwise Israel continues to operate as it as it pleases pretty much we'll leave it there thanks so much for joining us today myavon and Senior Analyst at the international crisis group in telev thanks so much
