Israeli ground troops have carried out what they are calling localized raids inside the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours Israel's Chief military spokesperson said infantry and tank units entered Gaza to locate rocket Crews to destroy weapons and to search for evidence of hostages the announcement did not appear to be the beginning of an expected ground offensive in retaliation for the terror attacks by Hamas militants last Saturday Israel has been massing troops along the Gaza Border in preparation for that offensive the Israeli military has given more than 1 million people in Gaza just 24 hours to evacuate their homes the terrorist organization Hamas controls Gaza it told residents today to ignore the warning but many gazans have decided that it's time to go dawn breaks in Gaza to a wave of aerial bombardment a barrage of explosions destroying buildings in the region and today the attacks came along with an official warning as the Israeli military continued amassing tanks and troops near the gazen border ahead of an expected ground Invasion it called for the sum 1.1 million people located in Gaza City to relocate to the South within 24 hours this involves a journey across the Wadi Gaza Wetlands the river dividing the territories north and south and so the Exodus begins gazen civilians and un staff alike started moving as best they could out of Harm's Way today we do not know where to go there is no safe place we do not know where our children are and we do not know what to do we have no food or water I'm appealing to the United uned nations in front of the UN building where do we go where do we go the UN said moving so many people in such a short period of time within one of the world's most densely packed areas would be impossible quote without devastating humanitarian consequences but the clock ticks on the World Health Organization called for humanitarian access to Gaza to be resumed it warns that Israel's total blockade and continual bombardment pushed the health system to Breaking Point lacking essential supplies and electricity and we need a corridor to provide medical services and and so on that's what I would I would ask ask for one is to protect civilians and second to provide them with the support uh they need be food Medical Services supplies Israel continues to insist that it is doing everything it can to minimize civilian suffering but for the people of Gaza time is running out as well as safe places to go all right we want to get some analysis now with military expert Marina Maron she's from King's College London Marina it's good to see you on this Friday do you see these localized raids as Israel's military are calling them do you see this as a a possible first step of a ground invasion good evening Brent um first of all yes these localized raids can be considered as so-called shaping operations in other words um these raids should be preparing the ground offensive and should increase the success of the ground offensive and of course we have the hostage situation which makes um a military operation in Gaza much more difficult so the idea is to locate and to um try release the hostages as well as destroy hamas's equipment and possibly weaken the hold of Hamas in that region and we're talking about um specifically about the massing of troops on the northern part of Gaza so we assume that the military operation if it is to start will be starting from the north there is no question that Israel's military is far superior both in numbers and Equipment compared to anything that Hamas is working with but is that really a factor we're talking about being in one of the most densely populated places on the planet and we're talking about Urban Warfare well it's a good question because as we have seen recently in Afghanistan military um superiority in terms of numbers and superiority in terms of Technology military technology doesn't necessarily guarantee success and this is what we have seen throughout military history where rag tag militias um came to be more successful than organized State forces so this will be very difficult for the IDF um specifically because such operations which used to be called C Insurgency operations require not only military skill you're operating um in densely populated urban areas so you have to be very discriminate when it comes to using your force in order not to shoot civilians and and so that the the operation itself will be very slow very painful costing a lot of lives and it might look like going block by block street by street so in in those terms what Israel needs to ensure is that it doesn't alienate the Palestinian population while conducting this operation there have been reports too of rockets being fired from Lebanon and Syria um towards Israel also from Israel towards Lebanon and Syria what does this tell you about the possibility of this conflict turning into a two-front or multi-front War there is definitely a risk that this might indeed turn into a multi-front war which wouldn't look good for Israel because Hezbollah has declared that it is ready to join the fight and the problem with such um organizations is that they are they don't have a unity of command this means that even if the official statement is would have been not to join or the official intent would have been to stay away there's still might be a cell that that makes an incursion into Israel escalating so there is also a potential for a miscalculation which could uh create a bigger war and open another front in the north all right Marina Maron we appreciate your analysis on this Friday evening thank you thank you very much for having me now let's go straight to our correspondent Rebecca R is in Tel Aviv Rebecca what more can you tell us about these so-called localized raids well that is what we've been hearing the Israeli military saying that they have been carrying out these very small very targeted very elite teams have been going in and carrying out uh these raids as you said in the lead in there to try particularly I think to look for uh some of the more than 100 hostages we know are being held in Gaza uh this is the first shift really towards a ground Invasion though as you also mentioned not an indicative of the beginning of such a ground Invasion though that is something that is largely expected to happen in the coming days if not week we've been seeing uh I was down there this week myself been seeing very very uh heavy Armament and and a huge troop movement around that Gaza border and it is thought by everyone though we've had no confirmation from the Israeli military but it is thought that a ground Invasion would be the next step so it isn't surprising that this interim step is a way that they can enter try and look for these hostages and and do other targeted acts in there without triggering the full ground Invasion at this stage thew correspondent Rebecca R is there in t thank you very much
