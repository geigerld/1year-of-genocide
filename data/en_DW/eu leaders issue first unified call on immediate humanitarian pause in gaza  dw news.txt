we have some breaking news coming in the European Union has just called for an immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting in Gaza and for the unconditional release of all hostages being held by Hamas it's the first joint EU demand for an end to the hostilities in Gaza the European Union heads of government said that safe and full humanitarian access is essential in order to provide life-saving assistance to the civilian population inside the Gaza Strip all right let's go to Jack perck now he is at that Summit in Brussels Jack the EU calling for an immediate humanitarian PS in Gaza leading to a sustainable ceasefire that's a mouthful there I mean it um came as a surprise or wasn't it a surprise it's not necessarily a surprise we had been hearing from most of the EU countries that this was going to be on the cards but using the word ceas fire has been politically difficult especially a few months ago the idea of calling on for any kind of ceasefire was looking impossible but now what we've seen is that the EU leaders have progressively moved their position the dial the needle on the dial has slowly tick towards this call which is for immediate human humanitarian pauses this is to allow a allow Aid into Gaza with the idea of this sustainable ceasefire in the future the context to this as well is that a cypriate plan that the United States has now got behind in the last few weeks uh to get Aid through a humanitarian Aid Corridor that goes through Cyprus means that European assets are also now moving towards Gaza and in order for those Aid assets to get in there the EU is now looking at this situation as some somewhere where they need to be getting the aid in and to start calling for the fighting to stop and there's a lot going on at the summit tonight we understand that a decision as been taken on Bosnia herzo and its application for joining the European Union what do we know yeah that's right there's loads going on the what we've heard from the European leaders is that the accession talks so the official negotiations will be opened at some time in the future for Bosnia and Herzegovina it's still a very complicated situation they do have to enact some reforms that's what's in the document but it is a very symbolic gesture from the European Union they want to make sure that they're sort of galvanizing and keeping the support for those Western Balan countries for their progression into the EU and there is this thorny issue of using Frozen Russian assets to boost Aid to Ukraine did anything happen with that not really uh that was the can that was kicked much further down the road the EU said essentially that the discussions on this and the proposals that have been put forward should be continued to be looked at uh and that is something that they could move forward with that is the context for this is that around 210 billion Euro odd of Russian Financial assets are in EU financial institutions acre interest and the some EU leaders want them to be used to support Ukraine but at the moment this is just a discussion that will be ongoing they haven't made a decision yesterday yeah some decisions and some kicking the can tonight at that Summit Jack perck in brussells Jack as always thank
