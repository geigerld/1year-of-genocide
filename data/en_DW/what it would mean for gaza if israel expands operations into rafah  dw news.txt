as fighting goes on in Gaza so too do efforts to Halt the nearly four-month War Hamas now says that Israel and international mediators have made it a tentative truce offer but the mil the militant group considered a terror organization by most western states says that it is still reviewing the details hundreds of tents are crammed together in Rafa hard against the border with Egypt this is probably the safest place for people who fled to southernmost Gaza to escape the fighting and bombing elsewhere it's estimated that half of the population of Gaza is now in the area but the Israeli Army is still attacking Targets in the city gaza's Hamas ran Health Services say 14 people were killed in one attack in Rafa on Saturday they tell people leave your home go to the zones considered safe but at the end wherever people go they get bombed why who knows it's just Revenge they just want to bring destruction to people that's all you can see the huge destruction in this area this shows its strength all the neighboring houses were affected meanwhile International attempts to negotiate a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel continue Hamas confirmed that it has received a proposal from Israel the US Egypt and Qatar but said it needed more time for a decision but there is no deal yet and Israeli defense minister YF Galan says his Ground Forces will also eventually Advance into Rafa something Israel's allies have strongly warned against German foreign minister analina bebok said a military operation against Rafa would not be justifiable and let's get more now from journalist hen belusa who was based in Gaza until he and his family evacuated in November he joins us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman hzm uh good to see you again we are hearing these reports that the Israeli Army plans to expand its offensive to Rafa um or rather in Rafa on the Egyptian border what more can you tell us about that this is still not certain uh there are a lot of statements coming from different sides mainly Israeli one and the Egyptian uh side which is very relevant um some statements particularly came from um Israeli defense minister who said that they would advance in but apparently according to the reports and and from different sources the Egyptians are not happy with that there are some reports that they would replace this plan uh replace this plan with the with more enforcement along the border um Egypt would build underground wall along the border between Egypt and Gaza uh other things the the the there was a report that talking them Israel asked Egypt to Rel relocate um um the RAF Crossings between Gaza and Egypt to the a place near Kim Shalom uh meantime Hasam uh Israel and Hamas are still negotiating a possible ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages what more do we know at this point about the status of those talks um a lot of reports nothing official coming but Hamas is saying that they are reviewing reviewing the proposal that submitted to them through kares and Egyptians there are two different levels of of discussion one is the internal Hamas they have different bodies they are discussing it within the bodies of of of the movement um another another level is discussing it with other factions particularly Islamic Jihad and other like pflb or dflp they want to as according to the statements from Hamas officials they want to uh show a one voice from the Palestinian side so it's not clear there are some reports that the Hamas answer or response will come out later today journalist hazam belusa joining us from Aman in Jordan with the latest on the situation there in Gaza thank you so much thank you let's bring in now Hiba TI she is the care acting Deputy Regional director for the Middle East and North Africa she joins us from Aman what options are there for the hundreds of thousands of displace people in Rafa if the Israeli Army extends its operations there thank you so much for this question unfortunately uh as you know and as we have seen in your report the options that are remaining almost uh for the people if they are moved out of RA are almost none uh these are this is the only remaining area where people are trying to secure themselves in a place that is uh that is um that is actually uh uh open for them to stay in with the minimum minimum not even enough uh services that exist if this place is going to be under military action there we are very afraid that there are no other places to go to no options to to use uh in Gaza talk with us a little bit more about the services and the aid because for weeks we have been hearing what the UN has described as pockets of famine in Gaza and diseases spreading what more can you tell us about the current efforts to reach civilians and provide help uh there are many actors in Gaza trying to reach as many people as possible among them is care uh all of us we try our best we try to secure uh services from outside from inside Gaza but what we do is still the same we use this uh uh terminology weeks and weeks ago Drop in the Ocean what we are providing now is still a drop in the ocean if the needs were already massive weeks ago they are extremely massive now the number of Aid entering is very very limited the possibility to distribute it is very limited in the north it's even almost not existence and the same is applied in the in the south in RAF and in the surrounding area the same is applied on kanun and other locations the the requirements are massive but what is happening in Gaza or entering is very very limited and little the international court of justice has ordered Israel to allow more Aid into Gaza what has your organization been noticing has there been any increase since then there are days where we see more Aid entering days with less Aid entering the highest number of Aid trucks entering in Gaza per day the highest number is as almost most half of the requirement in normal days before the war which means that we are still unfortunately facing very limited amount entering Gaza the requirements are massive as I mentioned with the winter entering more and more Aid is needed for uh winter items shelter items and medicine and this is not happening unfortunately the after the icj uh um uh announcements there was not much improved to answer your question we've been hearing and and Reporting today that Israel and Hamas um negotiations on a potential ceasefire are still ongoing um you mentioned a number of of things that are needed in Gaza what would be among the most urgent needs for civilians if there were to be any break in the fighting what's on the top of of the list for you it's very difficult to prioritize one item or two or even three everything is needed in Gaza food water fuel shelter medicine all of that is needed and unfortunately all of that is focused only on life saving and not even for for livelihood uh we don't even think about it right now it's only for life saving all these are considered priorities that we wish we are going to be able to secure in in any ceasefire or uh at least a short ceasefire in the coming hopefully days hi care acting Deputy and North Africa in Aman thank you so much for joining us on DW news thank
