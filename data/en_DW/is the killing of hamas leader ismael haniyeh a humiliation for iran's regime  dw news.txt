we begin with the escalating crisis in the Middle East Iran and Hamas are accusing Israel of assassinating hamas's top political leader Ismael hania they say Wednesday's air strike in the Iranian Capital tan will not go unpunished Hardline protesters took to the streets vowing revenge and denouncing Israel and the US Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu has not specifically spoken about the attack in tan but says there will be severe consequences for anyone who attacks his Nation there are challenging days ahead of us since the attack in Beirut threats have been heard from all sides we are prepared for any scenario and we will stand United and determined against any threat Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us on any front over to our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya Netanyahu did not speak about an Israeli role in Han's death what was his message tonight well he gave this short statement to the nation just shortly after a very lengthy security cabinet ended he was speaking there from the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and as you said he didn't acknowledge the strike in Teran which had killed Hamas political leader isma hania but he talked about that he had dealt Iran's proxies a crushing uh blow but it was essentially a message tonight uh to the Israeli public to Garner support but also to prepare them what he said will be challenging days ahead as the country now braces for retaliation uh by Iran and its proxies following those strikes in Beirut and tan and as we just heard he said that Israel was facing threats from across uh the region and that is it is ready for any scenario we know that Iran has blamed Israel for the strike against hania we know that they vowed revenge for the strike how worried are people in Israel about retaliation well I think the country is really on high alert and it's a bit of a of a strange atmosphere because when you come here and during the day you know it is as almost like normal life but when you talk to people in conversations there is a worry uh you know about the retaliation and what such a retaliation could look like there have been reports uh in the media uh saying that Iran will or or might consider to strike uh directly uh back uh at Israel and there are certain scenarios that are being discussed now obviously it could be a strike that would uh entail also all uh of Iran's proxies like a coordinated attack now we've seen something like this uh in April when uh Iran la launch drones and missiles at Israel but this is seen as that it could be much much more forceful so we are talking about potentially uh drones and missiles uh from Iran from Lebanon from Iraq from Syria from Yemen uh uh launched at Israel uh so and uh of course there's also the question what the targets will be whether this will be uh mainly military targets will there be civilian targets uh it could be that uh Tel Aviv or Hy will be uh hit so all of this of course is on people's mind while people are thinking here you know this could be really that the region is on a brink of a wider escalation and the conflict is intensifying what does heas killing mean for efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza and to secure the return of the remaining hostages well I think isma hania was seen as one of the uh key figures in these negotiations as someone from Hamas abroad he was involved in those negotiations so there is a big question mark here about what will happen to these negotiations we also heard from Qatar one of the main mediators alongside uh Egypt who has qu condemned uh this killing and also questions how uh this will go forward and this is of course also in the mind of many families here those who have still uh their relatives in Gaza there are um over a 100 hostages that I still believe to be in Gaza and of course there's a lot of worry here uh what will happen to them now negotiations were kind of stuck that they were continuing there were just not any result as of yet but now it seems unlikely that they will uh um start anytime soon DW Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem thank you is hania's killing and the assass assassination of a top Hezbollah Commander have prompted pleas from world leaders world leaders rather for restraint and while motivation for killing the Hamas leader may stem from the group's October 7th Terror attacks in Israel the animosity toward Hanah goes back long before that Ismael Hanah greets Iran's new president in what would be one of his last meetings just hours after attending the president's inauguration he and his body guard were killed in a strike on his residents in tan hania was the political face of Hamas the militant islamist group that carried out the October 7th Terror attacks on [Music] Israel Han had not lived in Gaza for several years but ran Hamas from qat where he lived in Exile he became the Palestinian prime minister in 2006 and continue to rise through hamas's ranks eventually becoming its political Chief in 2017 hamas's Gaza leader Yahya sinoa is believed to have been The Mastermind of the October 7th attacks while hania represented Hamas internationally and moved around the region for diplomatic meetings he was a key player in negotiations to stop the fighting in Gaza some fear his killing will be a major setback to achieving peace in the region hania's death came just hours after Israel said it killed senior Hezbollah commander fuad shukur in Beirut the attack also kills at least one woman and two children and wounded dozens Israel says it targeted shukur in retaliation for a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers Israel blamed Hezbollah and warned the militant group it would pay a heavy price shukur had been one of hezbollah's leading military figures since it was established by Iran's revolutionary guard more than four decades ago after the Israel Hamas war broke out on October 7th shukur was accused by Israel of being behind many of the Drone and missile attacks that Hezbollah launched against is Israel shukur is the most senior Hezbollah Commander to be killed since 2016 when Mustafa bad Rin the group's military commander in Syria died in an explosion in Damascus global leaders fear the deaths of two senior leaders of Israel's greatest enemies when tensions were already at Boiling Point could now prompt an allout Regional War Alex vatanka is director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC and joins me now for more Alex welcome to the show hania was killed in a high security Guest House of the Revolutionary guards on a day when security was extra tight because the new Iranian president was being inaugurated how humiliating is this strike for the regime in tan oh it's really difficult to describe how bad this is I mean this could not have been worse um this was a senior member of the so-called axis of resistance of Iran someone that Iran has been cultivating ties with as we just heard in the segment uh since 2017 and earlier than that and for him to show up into Iran feeling uh you know well received and he was but protected he wasn't and that is uh to your question Stephen very humiliating for for the Iranian regime but I might quickly add this is maybe the most high-profile assassination by Israel in in in recent memory uh but it's not the first I me there if you go back a decade and a half Israel has engaged in many successful sabotage and assassination attempts on Iranian soil and the Iranian regime for whatever reason just can't stop it I want to ask in a moment what that humiliation means for a Counterattack but first do we know how much of the Iranian security apparatus has been infiltrated by Israel obviously it's impossible to tell in terms of where the problem is this is a country with over a dozen of intelligence Services uh many of them that are Rivals of one another just to give you an example the ministry of intelligence notorious for its rivalry with the intelligence branch of the Revolutionary guards there is sort of competition jealousy and so forth how much of that is in the way of sort of looking for these uh agents that are essentially working for foreign powers mosad I would have to assume is one of the best um in terms of having infiltrated the Iranian security and intelligence communities and they have good reasons for it here is the Islamic Republic that for 45 years has promised to bring about the end of the state of Israel so the the Israelis including their intelligence services are highly motivated to go after um Iranian uh officials Iranian policies and doing so by recruiting Iranians and it looks like they're recruiting Iranians at the highest level of the Iranian regime what does that mean psychologically for this Iranian security apparatus and for their ability um to achieve their aims when they're so riddled with these kinds of Agents these counter agents right one of the first things that struck my mind when I was writing about it this morning is as we're speculating about how quickly and how big Iran's retaliation will be against Israel and supreme leader Ali has come out and in so many words said there will be a retaliation and I'm sure there will be a retaliation but when we question that how quickly they're going to retaliate and how big they're going to retaliate this is what we need to keep in mind the Iranian regime knows is entirely infiltrated I mean mosad was able I'm assuming mosad did this although Israel hasn't taken claim for it the the floor on which is Han was sleeping at right uh this wasn't an operation done by satellites or listening to phone conversations on mobile phones this required topnotch human intelligence meaning you have people in the Iranian regime that are working for the Israelis providing information and that means if I was thinking logically if I'm Iran I must then guess or second guess my next steps in terms of what should I do if I go big against Israel what do I not know in terms of where else they are infiltrated what else they could do to stop me in my tracks and I think that might just create some slower reaction from Iran than a lot of commentators in the west right now are assuming will be the case that humiliation that we spoke about earlier perhaps that need to save face does it make a response from Iran even more dangerous look I mean the Israelis back in April hit the Iranian Embassy in Damascus that was crossing a red line they killed two senior Iranian generals the Iranians again were humiliated and for the first time K publicly came out and said we have to do something now Israel's up the anti even more now Israel has killed a senior member of the a of resistance someone who had just hours ago met the Iranian supreme leader had been in the Iranian Parliament met all the senior officials Israel's message is very clear that he's got a Long Reach and they could have killed kame they could have killed anybody by the looks of things so I mean look I don't think the Israelis uh in terms of their strategy are sure from what I can tell what they want to achieve well one thing they did want to send in terms of a signal to Iran is you have come to us by supplying his Bala Hamas the houthis and others with missiles and drones that are attacking us and you've been sitting away 2,000 kmers thinking you can just watch the show but guess what we're not bringing it to you that seemed to be what the Israeli calculation is also about do you think the CH the chances of containing this conflict this regional conflict have dramatically changed in the last 24 hours look there's more pressure today than it was uh just a few days ago no no doubt about it but I always go back to a simple question I ask myself as an analyst when Iran is doing that basic cost benefit analysis is a regional war in Iran's interest and the answer to that to to that question for me is clearly a no Iran would not benefit from a regional War a regional war will drag the United States into that conflict and will risk the survival of the Islamic Republic and that is the most precious of of policy they have on their agenda all right that's Alex fatona with the Middle East Institute thank you very much thank you Laura Blumenfeld is a Middle East analyst a best-selling author and a former senior policy adviser at the US state department where she focused on the Middle East peace process Laura welcome to the show two of Israel's most senior enemies killed within 24 hours can we say to what extent the US government Israel's biggest Ally was caught off guard well you know the United States whatever they're saying publicly this is very complicated and challenging for them we're looking at everything through the prism of a presidential race and vice president Harris is running on the theme of Freedom versus chaos well their major Ally in the Middle East is pretty much a kingdom of chaos right now with these toppling of you know what they call the Twin Towers of terrorism what what does this these killings these two killings but especially hania what could that mean to the uh attempts to get a ceasefire going in Gaza something the US government has been very invested in in recent months yeah I mean it could go either way on the one hand you could say this this win for Netanyahu kind of gives him that symbolic victory that he needed to make the concessions uh to reach a ceasefire and the same can be said of Hamas that they've kind of been softened d by these military attacks and kind of beaten into submission um which was netanyahu's approach all along on the other hand you could say no Hamas is just going to go into lockdown they've got nothing to lose as long as they hold those hostages those souls in their hands they hold the key cards hania has also been described as a Hamas official who was interested in a ceasefire agreement How likely is it that his successors will see things in the same way I I mean it's interesting strategy right shoot the messenger I me I've known hania for decades the last time I spoke to him um he was actually laughing uh bitterly because he was talking to me about the last time the Israelis had tried to assassinate him um he was sitting at lunch and the ceiling started raiding down paint on his head because the Israelis had dropped a quar ton bomb on his house rather than a on- ton bomb and so he escaped um there's always a replacement I can't tell you how many Hamas leaders I've met with and then months later they were gone um so I don't think that it'll really have a huge impact because senoir really was the key interlocutor he was the decision maker for this deal Laura I want to ask you where we go from here but first let's listen to what the US Deputy ambassador to the UN said today at the UN Security Council it is best not to speculate on the impact that recent events May have on peace and Security in the Middle East a broader war is neither imminent nor inevitable first of all we know that this killing of hania was a major major event especially when we compare it against the Hezbollah commander who was killed the night before do we have any idea how Iran might respond you know I I went to Iran and spoke to the Grand Ayatollah years ago about the concept of retaliation and revenge and how you respond to an injustice and what he said to me it's very very specific according to Islam the key though about revenge is that the the the response is often greater than the original offense and that's why they had this prescription from the elders one grave opposite one grave so what would that mean in this case does it mean that they would go after a diplomat an Israeli leader maybe you know a diplomat um in Western Europe for example or does it mean they go to the heart of Israel the way that Israel theoretically anyway they have an it yet but struck in the heart of of Iran in tahan does that mean an attack on Tel Aviv I mean time will tell it's coming and it's coming soon at the same time we know that in April we saw an exchange of direct fire between both countries after Israel targeted an Iranian official in Damascus but neither side seemed really interested in an escalation could we not see something similar here well there was a very choreographed carefully choreographed retaliation here there's an extra element which is humiliation I'm Iran was embarrassed hania was their guest he was in their their their their sort of VIP guest house so I think that there's this element now though where you need to sort of restore you know restore um the balance of sort of honor and it's a matter of personal respect I think that's why the you know the the the um the leader of Iran declared raised the red flag of Revenge and said there will be Justice and a price must be paid all right Laura Blumenfeld thank you very much thank you
