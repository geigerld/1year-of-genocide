they've been held for many long agonizing weeks the first batch of hostages kidnapped by Hamas militants during its October 7 terror attack on Israel have been released it's part of a 4-day truce between Israel and the militant group brokerage by Qatar earlier on Friday evening this Convoy of Red Cross Vehicles crossed from Gaza over the Rafa Border Crossing into Egypt carrying 13 Israelis freed as part of a deal brokered by by Qatar also in these vehicles were 10 hostages from Thailand and one from the Philippines freed under a separate deal the passengers were then met by Israeli soldiers for identification checks and then taken from Egypt back into Israel to Major hospitals for medical treatment and to be reunited with their families Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the media after their release we have now completed the return of a first of our abductees children their mothers other women but I stress to you to the families and to you citizens of Israel we are committed to the return of all of our abductees this is one of the goals of a war and we are committed to achieving all of the goals of a war and US President Joe Biden said the release of the hostages was the result of weeks of intense diplomacy here's some of what he had to say I've consistent ly pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons to accelerate and expand humanitarian assistance going into Gaza and two to facilitate the release of hostages and over the past several weeks I've spoken repeatedly with the Amir of cutter the president CCE of Egypt and prime minister n NY of Israel to help secure this deal to nail it down and I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done I spoke with the Emir and president lce and the Prime Minister Netanyahu again on Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement as I said today's release are the start of a process we expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day after that over the next few days we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families we also remember all those who are still being held and renew our commitment to work for their release as well in Germany there is relief after four hostages holding German citizenship were among those released many of the people kidnapped by Hamas are dual citizens the German Nationals include a 77-year-old woman and a mother and her two daughters aged two and four Germany's foreign minister analina babok had this to say about their release I am immensely relieved that 24 hostages have just been released from Gaza including four Germans that a father after 49 days of Hell of unbelievable anxiety can finally hold his two little daughters and his wife safely in his arms again my personal thanks go to my catari counterpart the international Committee of the Red Cross and Egypt but there are still over 200 women and men and especially children in the hands of Hamas our thoughts are with them today and also with their families as much as this day is a day of hope it's not a day to breathe a sigh of relief so Hamas is due to release more Israeli hostages over the coming days 50 in total in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails on Friday evening a group of 39 Palestinian inmates in the occupied West Bank were freed as part of the temporary truce the group made up of women and teenage boys was released near rala Red Cross representatives were at the scene to collect them the Associated Press reported that Israeli forces fir tear gas at Palestinian crowds in an attempt to push them back from the prison and we're joined Now by Middle East expert Daniel gak he's a journalist and editor and chief of the magazine senit here in Berlin Daniel tell me how much of a political accomplishment is this deal it's a huge political accomplishment because the parties involved can show and can also showcase evidently that uh negotiations work um it's a major breakthrough I mean I'm not saying that everything is going to be Implement implemented according to plan I'm not sure if maybe the ceasefire is going to be broken or interrupted but the fact that that in the middle of a war where you have one party doomed which is Hamas and the other side Israel declaring that it wants to annihilate Hamas and still uh we see that it's possible to negotiate deals between them it's a risky strategy and it took a lot of I think nightmarish headache on the side of the negotiators namely the qataris uh the US and uh the Egyptians um but it's interesting that it works and we see that we shouldn't take too all the information that face value we have this massive destruction in the Gaza Strip but at the same time we have talks ongoing we have negotiations we have a certain Readiness even between the worst of enemies to to to come to a deal that doesn't mean that the war is over it doesn't mean that the military campaign is over and it doesn't mean that all the hostages are going to be released but there is a model how instrumental was Qatar in this would we be here without Qatar today hugely instrumental um the qataris were the ones who according to the information that I got designed the process and you can see the Qatari signature in much of what happened first of all they they really did like Playbook Med mediation and it took me some time to understand I followed it from the very beginning actually how they created expectations on both sides how they shaped a narrative saying look Hamas did something terrible but they didn't intend to do to harm to such magnitude to the Israelis they actually wanted to uh kidnap uh Israeli military and then uh negotiate the release of them in ex change for for Hamas prisoners and Israeli prisons I'm not saying that this is the true story but it's an it's a narrative to sh to to create expectations in both sides then they announced many times in in in a rather candid cander openness we are close to a deal we have that number of hostages that can be released we have the United States on board we have the Israelis on board then they said okay the Israelis are not yet in we have to convince netan but they were at the same time very strategic and also strategically communicate communic unting or even sometimes transparent about their frustrations and their efforts and it was quite interesting they didn't want to sideline the Egyptians at the same time which is very important of course they needed to have the United n the United States on board um it's a very interesting uh story and I think of course it can't be written now but it will be in the in the near future now this is a truth that is set to last four days for now what happens on day five or whatever the day after may be look for the Israeli government it is clear and I think they have the support of a major part of the population that a military campaign of some sort has to continue because they they say they want to destroy Hamas they want to end Hamas rule over the Gaza Strip and they want to make sure that Hamas will never Strike again at Israel at the same time they have that before they said that before and we have seen Israeli Prime Ministers in war saying we will not leave unless we have killed every single one of them but at the same time then they were ready for some sort of a political compromise what is what is clear for Israel that a return to Hamas rule over the Gaza is not an option maybe some sort of an Arab initiative could uh could materialize could crystallize even though everyone is very like uh careful about it they don't want because the framework is isn't clear and because they wanted to make sure that they don't have to pick up the pieces behind the destruction that Israel has caused in the Gaza Strip but but in general I think some sort of an Arab engagement is possible and would also be the only reasonable way way to to to put an end to this War uh netan needs some sort of a face saving solution at the same time he needs so he needs a victory and of course the release of hostages is a major victory for him uh after all the failure and and the dread that Israelis and Palestinians have suffered in the last couple of weeks talking about the suffering in the Gaza Strip specifically there have been calls all around the globe for a ceasefire a permanent ceasefire how do you think the International Community and especially um countries like the United States and Qatar are going to use the the weight that they have in this to maybe change Israeli minds or or exert some sort of pressure us Qatari Alliance is not an Alli political Alliance it's not that they don't agree on all the aspects the country is true like I think the the US are very clear that they don't call for a cease for for for terminate SE ceasefire because they think that Israel should have the right to continue the military campaign at the same time they see the devastation destruction that this campaign has caused which went beyond what can be considered an anti-terror operation the other state department says that they're not going to support it any longer if there's no plan for the Palestinians took them quite some time to come to that uh that uh statement and on the other hand you have the qataris who are of course Pro Palestinian and who said from the very beginning that this operation is unjustified so there's no there's no agreement we don't have an agreement even inside Europe about ceasefire the German government was very ambivalent and ambiguous about it so uh I think a a ceasefire is something that needs to come into operation with a success and the hostages though you should also look at them at at the case in an isolated fashion because it's not the only dossier that is happening here but at the same time I think the hostages can can can create trust between the negotiating parties of which Hamas is not directly part and that is of course a major challenge for diplomacy but hey these are the moments for for real crisis diplomacy for real professionals who I think can solve the situation because you have reasonable people on the Israeli side who see that their military campaign with these consequences uh is to say the least not sustainable to the security interest you say there's not going to be a ceasefire until there is Success what would success look like that depends very much on on of course the hamas's behavior hamas's operation and on the margin that you give them uh you know I'm drafting scenarios sometimes and I W don't want to say that all parties would agree to that but let's just like imagine that a group of Arab states would agree that they can provide some sort of of a security and police force in cooperation with Palestinian with the Palestinian people supported by the United States the European Union and eventually Israel I think in such a scenario it would be very very difficult to swallow for Hamas but I don't think they have major options and let's not forget that there is countries in the region that have leverage over them and Qatar is a small one but a very important one that's Daniel G great speaking to you thank you so much thank you much more to talk about let's do that with Aaron lurman he's a former deputy National Security adviser to the Israeli government and editor and chief of the Jerusalem strategic Tribune Mr lurman good to have you on the show what are the chances of this temporary ceasefire turning into a permanent one uh I would say practically Neil um the expectation of the Israeli people at large and that goes from uh the traditional left and Center to to the right um it's not a matter of a government position or a or a a group group of hardened politicians this is a public very broadly held public sentiment the Hamas cannot be allowed to continue to govern Gaza and the likelihood that they will lay down their arms and uh and surrender or um and basically um find a way out of Gaza to be replaced by something more uh amenable to our future security and to the well-being of the Palestinian people is also more or less at zero so um The Campaign is bound to continue until Hamas no longer holds sway over the people of Gaza and threatens Israeli security and and and I don't see a point at this stage much as we would all like this to end in a manner that does not require further military action I don't see a way uh to do it um try to imagine U frankly what would be uh Europe would be like what Germany would be like if there was a ceasefire in October 44 yeah would you say somehow sorry would you say that until now though the IDF Mission would you say that until now the IDF mission in Gaza has been a success yes um it was very gradually carried out it is very um well coordinated there are three elements involved tactical intelligence which recovered from the shock of October 7 um very close support from the third dimension from the air that includes the Air Force and then drones and all these elements which are now um temporarily held because of the PA in the fighting and very disciplined uh progress by the ground forces uh it's it's been painful we've taken uh losses but the results I think are well above what was expected when uh when we originally uh launched the ground campaign and much of the Hamas presence in the north has been um destroyed uh other areas are now contained and uh the capacity to destroy Hamas has been proven to exist yeah October 7th was of course an unprecedented attack on Israel and in an recent article you wrote you said it triggered an unprecedented response from Washington and can you tell us briefly maybe what the US's role has been in shaping the aftermath of October 7th well um the American response I think uh reflected first and foremost a recognition that the enormity of the crimes committed against people I would say Jewish people but some of the victims were actually Arabs uh bedwin in the netive and others but the enormity of the crimes committed by Hamas really uh raised shadows and memories from darker times in history uh President Biden is certainly mindful of that um and in addition they could see The Hidden Hand of Iran behind all this and so what they did shape is the um let's say the balance of um deterring others Iran and Hezbollah uh from going all out into the war their choice was to go halfway in bah has lost nearly 90 Fighters already in in confrontations with Israel we have had to Evac evacuate large areas of the north because of attacks on our civilian areas but it is not yet the fullscale war of which they are capable and this to some extent is due to the American um deterrent and let's now uh bring in Marina Miron she's a military Analyst at King's College London Marina what does this truce mean for the IDF operation against Hamas in Gaza good afternoon well politically it's a very important sign for Netanyahu and for his government however in terms of operations we have heard um the Qatari side explaining that they ensured that everything should be going according to the plan however ceasefires usually are very shaky and there is a chance that it might break down not because um somebody voluntarily wants to break it down but because of human error so it's a very shaky process at the same time the IDF uh has to stay alert it doesn't mean that the IDF can now relax for 4 days because there will be people wanting to move to the north from the south on the one hand on the other hand Hamas might be taking this opportunity to regroup recover uh perhaps um rotate Personnel it's very flexible now it has all the surveillance on the IDF operation and so they can better estimate on how to proceed with their operation because of course they don't want to be destroyed by the IDF so they they have to um exploit their advantages in the Gaza Strip so for the IDF it's a very important moment especially um when it comes to the end of the ceasefire and how the operation will proceed after that that is a big question now Marina while we were speaking we were looking at pictures their live pictures from the Rafa Crossing showing uh relief trucks or what I suppose are uh relief trucks Crossing that border there into the Gaza Strip or part of the agreement uh and the ceasefire uh let me ask you militarily has Hamas anything to gain from this truce well um o obviously as I said they're gaining time and they have the Strategic asset and that strategic asset are the hostages meaning that Hamas could say we will release an aatan for another 24 hours of ceasefire if they see fit and and this is very problematic in the meanwhile while the humanitarian Aid is arriving Hamas is very well entrenched in Gaza meaning that even people who are not actively supporting Hamas might be CED to support it what I'm trying to say is for instance hospitals might be coerced to host hamas's command and control centers presumably just in sir um the other possibility is that Hamas might be getting some of those humanitarians supplies to ventilated tunnels because tunnel ventilation has been a huge problem and that is what Israel was trying to prevent by cutting off fuel to to the Gaza Strip so Hamas can use this pause to recuperate to readjust its operations and to select new targets to try to confuse the IDF to move hostages so there are many things that could be happening and for Hamas of course it is Al also a strategic Victory because they are dictating essentially the terms of how this ceasefire is going to work how this deal is going to work uh now Marina what do you think is likely to happen when that 4-day ceas fire has ended and is not being extended well I think that the operations will resume as usual and the IDF will try to pick up where it left off before the ceasefire started because as we know up until the point when the ceasefire wasn't en acted IDF was continuing its operation it didn't decrease the intensity of the operation the problem is that there is a certain momentum I explained in the previous answers that um Hamas might be using this time um for IDF it's of course difficult to to connect from where they left off to four days later because the circumstances might have changed so there will be an additional challenge for the Israel intelligence to try to see what is happening while the ceasefire is uh ongoing in order to update their targeting information in order to adjust their decision making and to adjust their plan on the ground with with the exigencies of the situation at that moment and I think that that unless there is another negotiation to release additional hostages the war will continue as before the military analyst Marina Miron there speaking to us thank you very much
