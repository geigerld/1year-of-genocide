the UN Secretary General is calling on Israel to immediately halt its large-scale military operation in the occupied West Bank for now Israel presses ahead and claims to have killed five Palestinian militants in a gun battle in a mosque on Thursday several cities have been targeted in the assault which has seen hundreds of Israeli troops backed by helicopters drones and armored personnel carriers enter the Palestinian territory here in the shattered streets of tarem Israel says it has already achieved a significant success in its largest operation in the occupied West Bank for years that's after local Islamic Jihad leader Muhammad Jabba seen here in foul footage was killed in a firefight Israeli troops had tried and failed before to eliminate Jabba who was accused of carrying out numerous attacks on Israelis but Palestinian civilians are also once again paying the cost of the Israeli raids we were asleep and woke up to the gunshots at around 3:30 a.m. I started waking my wife up telling her the Army are shooting at the house I was barely able to wake her up and they hit the house with a rocket we ran my wife and I to the other room they fired another rocket my son and his wife were on the second floor they hit them with a rocket while this family were able to escape their home with their l Israeli forces roaming the streets in search of militants have created serious problems for the Health Care system in the areas being raided medical workers said troops are blocking access for ambulances the Israeli Army refuses entirely to allow ambulances to enter whether uncoordinated or coordinated even if we are allowed to enter as you see the ambulances cannot access the camps or even reach humanitarian cases and people with diseases the UN has urged Israel to ensure injured people can obtain Medical Care warning that the operation in the West Bank was fueling an already explosive situation our correspondent Tanya Kramer sent us an update with the latest from taram in the occupied West Bank so I'm standing here on the main road to the refugee camp nor Shamus now you can see here some of the military vehicles uh coming in we've been seeing this in the course of the past hours also when we came there was an explosion now I would say it's a tense quiet here uh we cannot go further at this point this is where most of the journalists here are standing right now now we came in through to Karam City and the city is almost deserted people we've been talking to in the morning said they they barely go out of the house they stay in the safety of the house they're very worried about about what is happening of course it's not the first time they're experiencing such tense situation or military rids military rids happening across the W the the occupied West Bank on a a daily basis now also coming into uh the refugee camp here behind the camera you see the ambulances waiting uh and some of the fire brigades also waiting then uh to move in now Israel says this is a major counterterrorism uh operation um they say they go in because attacks uh are emanating from the northern uh West Bank they also say that the camps are flooded with weapons and infrastructure that is financed uh by uh Iran now right now we are seeing some of the vehicles here the um fire brigades uh moving into uh the camp um so people here are saying you know they don't know uh how long this will take also the Army said uh yesterday this is the first phase so we have to wait and see uh how long this large scale operation uh will take place here in the northern West Bank that was DW correspondent Tanya Kramer and to Kum in the occupied West Bank hansjakob Shindler is the senior director of the counter extremism project and joins me now welcome back to the show now you and I were speaking on the second day of Israel's largescale military campaign in the occupied West Bank why is this happening now no look I mean there have been of course a spike in incident of attacks erating from the West Bank there has been the unsuccessful luckily suicide bomb attempt in t aiv a couple of days ago what I can see um and what I hear is there's of course a preparation from the Israeli side because they assume Iran has taken the second option there was always two options that Quan would have taken in response to the killing of Han one was the very spectacular very open very massive rocket attack option that it did uh in April after the attack on its Embassy in Damascus or a much more long-term but potentially far more harmful terrorist campaign now we've seen an exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel in the last couple of days uh we've seen a far more aggressive um campaign of the houthis against shipping there's a oil tanker that is about to sink in the Red Sea and the expectation apparently seems to be that part of that response is now a stage where the terror structures that still exist U that are loyal to Iran in the Palestinian territories are primarily in the West Bank in uh Gaza Hamas is hammed in and they want to prevent this from materializing Israeli raids are part of everyday life in the West Bank how is this operation different is this just a matter of scale and intensity or is there something more to it no it's much larger and much more intensive you've seen the heavy machinery in the images that you showed there were helicopters involved there were drones involved there were air strikes involved so this is a really large scale incursion operation in the west gank that we haven't seen really in several years so there is a major concern apparently on the Israeli side that the situation may really majorly escalate in the West Bank and they doing this preemptively analysts say the West Bank is at this point in time at Boiling Point the when has called for an immediate halt to the raids could this operation turn the West Bank into the next Gaza so to say well we we hope not because I mean Gaza is really no longer existing as far as infrastructure is concerned but of course the risk with these kind of preemptive military operations is we are in a extremely tense situation in the region more tend that we've seen in many many years any escalation on any aspects by any side always beares the major danger of getting out of hand inadvertedly slipping into a more larger scale region War situation so this is of course a another problem that exacerbates the situation how does this tie into the larger campaign against Hamas and islamist extremism in the region well the campaign in Hamas really has to be sended in Gaza Hamas does exist in the West Bank but it's nowhere near FL structures or influences concerned simply because of the fact there are competitors the Islamic state is stronger in the West Bank than it ever was in Gaza there are other Palestinian resistance groups some Islamic terrorists um that are competing with Hamas and and of course there's the Palestinian National Authority who is not going to be strengthened by this massive military raid whose Security Forces also oppose islamist extremism and Hamas who are danger to the PNA as they are to Israel that Hans yakob shinda director of the counter extremism project thank you always great speaking to you thank you so much and before we continue There are some breaking news on the war in Gaza that we want to share with you according to the World Health Organization Israel has agreed to three days of humanitarian pauses starting on Sunday they will take place in different parts of the strip this is to allow for polio vaccinations to be given to hundreds of thousands of children under the age of 10 this comes after a baby in the Palestinian territory contracted the first confirmed case in 25 years
