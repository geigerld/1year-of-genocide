the highly anticipated truce between Israel and Hamas is now underway this is the scene live looking over Gaza from Israel a 4-day temporary ceasefire appears to be holding ahead of an anticipated hostage prisoner swap later today it follows weeks of the most intense fighting in the Israeli Hamas conflict Let's cross over now to our special correspondent AA Ibrahim who's following the story for us in Jerusalem Aya great to see you again so the temporary ceasefire came into effect several hours ago are the two sides adhering to it we are in the very early hours of what is very very delicate temporary ceasefire and while there have not been any major bombings uh rocket fire or artillery strikes both sides uh accuse each other of uh minor sporadic violations but so far the ceasefire the temporary ceasefire seems to be holding but the situation is very uh volatile uh it's unclear if uh Hamas has control over all of its fighters in the Gaza Strip and they're of course not the only armed militant group in the strip and so four days of a temporary ceasefire a lot could go wrong and a lot could happen there's also the question of what if the military um within these four days identifies a high value Target it will then be confronted with the difficult choice of going after that Target or continuing with the ceasefire the situation on the ground for civilians also very volatile fears uh from the Israeli side that civilians in the South will want to be will want to start heading to the north as we touched on in that uh report um and they are warning them with with leaflets not to do that not to go back to the north as the Israeli Army says that is still a very dangerous part of the Gaza Strip uh for civilians a how are people in Israel feeling now that the pause and fighting is underway there's a it's a mixed feeling there's of course a lot of relief and joy um at the hostages that will hopefully be released starting uh to today it's an emotional roller coaster especially for the hostage families who are as we speak getting phone calls waiting for phone calls that could be the ones that tell them that their loved ones are on their way there's also a sense of dread that even with this deal we're only talking about 50 uh women and children uh out of more than 200 hostages beli to be held by Hamas and not everyone will be coming back under the terms of the deal as it stands at the moment there's also criticism for that deal coming from a minority in uh in Israeli Politics the right-wing a minority but a very vocal one that has been from the beginning staunchly opposed to this deal claiming that it plays into hamas's advantage and that the or that the militant group will be using this time to re-calibrate regroup and that this ceasefire puts it in a better position to attack Israel and to delay Israel's timeline to reach its goals which is ultimately eradicating Hamas completely from the Gaza Strip a this is planned for 4 days but Israel's military says it's already preparing for what it says are the next stages of this war what more can you tell us about that well we have very clear a very clear message from the Prime Minister uh Benjamin Netanyahu that the war is not over and that the fighting is continued is expected pardon to continue once the ceasefire uh the temporary ceasefire has uh expired and that's because according to Israeli officials the goal um to eradicate Hamas completely is yet to be um achieved up until the very beginning of the ceasefire we saw intense uh fighting and bombardment of the strip and according to the IDF until the very last minute they say they were still in the process of destroying uh hamas's uh tunnel Network so as far as the Israeli side is concerned this war will continue after the temporary ceasefire although they have also signaled uh that they are willing to extend the temporary ceasefire by one day for 10 hostages so um it's unclear what exactly will happen but as far as the Israeli site is concerned the war is by no means over and their goals have not yet been achieved thanks a DW correspondent Aya Ibrahim in Jerusalem well let's cross over to Bushra khi policy lead at Oxfam thank you for joining us on DW news tell us how much how much Aid can your organization deliver in these four days and and what are you actually focusing on I mean you have to understand that many of our organizations actually operate from Jerusalem uh we usually have responded to pre escalations and responses in Gaza through K Abu we're not used to operating Aid operations and this this is an unprecedented humanitarian response um through ra uh Supply routs have to be established registrations have to be established for those who don't have like oam then you need to have agreements with partners that are operating uh most of our organizations operate through trusted part partners that work inside the community that know the communities um they have all been affected they have all lost their homes lost relatives and maybe and many of them have been killed uh in the the the in the in Israeli air strike so um it's an extremely challenging uh response and logistical operation but it's also not enough the the difference um that we're seeing is that there's no bombardment and that you know in addition to people being able and children being able to play outside people can also sleep people haven't slept properly in the last two months and I don't think any of us can have a real understanding of what that means to not be able to have a one good night sleep so I'm hoping that Gins today have a good night sleep without the sound of drones and the sound of bombardment that's constant over their heads um in terms of the of delivering I hope that also delivery um essential delivery in is needed in the north and this happens but we haven't seen any text of the agreement so we don't know whether for example it has been agreed that there would be safe passage uh provided um uh uh on both ways now we're seeing that Israel has forbidden people to go you know families to be able to go back to their homes check on their homes and even bring some clothes Winter's approach you know people don't haven't prepared to be displaced for this amount of time I have family and in in yes um no go ahead you were saying you have family there what have they been telling you about their is there you know the question is is that they don't trust Israel to respect the truth because they didn't in 2014 um and they don't respect because of what happened on the evacuation routes in the last two months where people I mean or in the last couple weeks let's say where people were shot at they were interrogated they were detained they were humiliated they were asked to walk with their arms up holding their IDs um when evacuating to the south I mean what are we going to see on those routs and and my family you know they should be able to go back home to get some clothes maybe they have some uh food that they had you know stocked knowing that the war was approaching and not knowing that be they'd be displaced um uh my family has decided not to go uh to the north but many people will will have tried uh and now we've just seen the leaflets uh uh so so what is that agreement and why are people not being allowed to go back to their homes um is another you know question um the aid is not enough it doesn't I just want to to to to add that four days of no bombardments does not rebuild schools it doesn't rebuild homes it doesn't allow women to deliver safely in a dignified space it doesn't allow people to recover from critical you know injuries we're talking about tens of thousands of critical injuries so you know for us it's it's almost um insulting really as a humanitarian uh uh uh uh organizations to be asked to deliver this amount of aid for 2.2 million people in a very short amount of time what are we really supposed to how are we supposed to deliver real I just want to ask you very quickly so so far I mean the truce has um held up um you know we're only several hours into it but it appears that you know it's holding up for now um you're saying it's not enough Aid um you also mentioned L logistical challenges and the reality for people on the ground tell us a little bit more about that logistical issue once the a does get into Gaza how is it distributed and how is it getting here to people so um as for o fam we're operate we're still operating through Partners so we have for example a partner called jur uh in the north that helps pregnant women uh they will be expecting some medical supplies to be provided to shelters because we had pregnant women actually delivering in shelters because the hospitals in the north have been non-operational um we know that there are some humanitarian teams coming in but we have no idea of what the size is the UN will be um uh uh providing that information that data later so the to avoid confusion on the number of trucks and how those were distributed uh mainly those are being done through a few uh International humanitarian organizations um the United Nations and the Egyptian RI Crescent of course that you know is is is delivering a big part of his operation um but again you can only imagine the logistical Challenge on damaged Roots no electricity no running water uh it's it's the same challenges that we've been facing in the last couple weeks that will be met these last four days we'll have to leave it there thanks Bushra khi policy lead at Oxfam thank you the German president has received German Nationals who were able to leave Gaza in the past few weeks at a private meeting in Berlin Frank valta steinmeier was given firsthand reports about the situation in the territory among those talking about their experiences were families of Germans of pales inian descent as well as a doctor who worked at the alifa hospital which has been the focus of Israeli attacks in recent days more than 200 German Nationals have left Gaza through the Rafa border crossing to Egypt well for the families of those hostages held by Hamas in Gaza the past few weeks have been Riven with Despair and Trauma now the troops could see some of them safely returned at last after weeks of waiting the families of hostages hope their loved ones will come home soon I want to hope I hope hope hope that it's going to happen we've been on such a roller coaster for the past certainly the past uh week but since October 7th between Despair and Trauma and hope I just want to see the children come back the Hamas terror group has agreed to release 50 civilian Women and Children of which 13 are to be released in the first batch on Friday in exchange Israel is set to release one50 Palestinian prisoners mostly females and teenage males over the course of the truce the deal mediated by Qatar also includes a 4-day pause in fighting in both the North and South of the Gaza Strip as well as increased humanitarian Aid even though the agreement is considered a breakthrough both sides have remained cautious about saying too much before it materializes based on current circumstances with the start of this truce our main hope is that this humanitarian truce will give us all the opportunity to look into the bigger task which is to implement a permanent truce and Achieve long-lasting peace efforts are being made to extend the truths beyond the 4-day period but Israel insists it will resume its military operation in Gaza until it has eradicated Hamas I'm now joined by amnon aan who is a professor of international politics of the Middle East at City University in London welcome to DW news so tell me how much of an accomplishment in your opinion is this temporary ceasefire from a political perspective well I think first of all um the definition I think is a temporary pause rather than a ceasefire um I think from a political point of view it is is a significant achievement primarily for Qatar on the one hand and for the United States um on the other hand that they have been able to uh bring Israel and Hamas to agree uh to this deal assuming of course that uh the first group of hostages does U is indeed released at 4:00 uh Israeli time so just to reach that agreement from the point of view of those two states I think is a significant itical achievement now there are Moun calls internationally for um a longer lasting you call it a pause there it's a temporary pause but a longer lasting ceasefire will say um how would that impact Israel's aim of fighting Hamas so this is where really there is a Divergence um the Israeli government has repeatedly insisted that uh what we are seeing today for the next four days at this point is a pause rather than a ceasefire uh simply because uh it is concerned that a ceasefire will uh effectively constrain it perhaps even prevent it from achieving uh its stated goals namely to eliminate hamas's military capability uh and its ability to govern over the Gaza Strip those are the two key aims that the Israeli government has set for itself uh the assessment in Israel is that a ceasefire uh will effectively prevent the government from achieving those goals okay but if they're saying that what well then how what other alternatives are there well I think at the moment the Israeli government and the Israeli military are trying to use this period to uh regroup uh to refresh their military operational plans we've seen the Israeli Army spokesman um declared that the northern Gaza Strip is still a military zone and that's really the background for the Israelis at the moment preventing or trying to prevent from gazans to return to their homes uh but I think at the same time the situation is very fluid at the moment uh in two respects first of all there is still mounting pressure in Israel to increase the number of hostages that will return uh from being in captivity with Hamas to do that Hamas will try and prolong the period of a pause and from its point of view to try and Translate uh uh the existing Paws into a ceasefire so that's one set of pressures that the Israeli government is is facing uh and the other one of course is the humanitarian toll that has been exacted on the Gaza Strip especially in the context of the war so the Israeli government at the moment Israel will have to strike a balance between on the one hand achieving the Strategic goals that it's set for itself namely eliminating hamas's military capability and its political ability to govern the Gaza Strip but on the other hand uh resisting the pressure that will Mount to try and secure the release of more hostages which would mean prolonging the pauses perhaps even reaching a ceasefire which uh seems to be something that will stand in the way of achieving those strategic goals from the perspective of Hamas what does this pause mean for them and how is it impacting them well for Hamas the pause is is a is a very positive development on two fronts first of all it allows Hamas to regroup uh uh and potentially also to replenish uh some of its munition assuming that it has some smuggling routs still available uh to it but I think on the broader strategic level uh the main bet of Hamas to actually remain in power is to try and withstand the Israeli assault assuming that Israel will now continue into the uh central and southern part of the of the Gaza Strip eventually bring the Israelis to have to agree for a ceasefire and uh uh at that point Hamas still being if you like standing on its feet although perhaps severely uh uh damaged uh as long as Hamas is able to uh remain if you like standing on its feet politically and militarily if a ceasefire is declared it will be in a good position from its point of view to restore its rule over the Gaza Strip and it will also be able to claim that Israel has not been able to defeat it not withstanding the uh vast amount of Firepower that it has used since the beginning of the war so for Hamas actually extending the pauses into eventually a permanent ceasefire uh uh and then of course increasing the pressure by mil by civilians going back to the northern Gaza Strip would put the Israelis in a very difficult position I'm Nan aan a professor of international politics from London thank you 8year old na'vi and threeyear old yahel siblings snatched by Hamas terrorists their whole family ripped apart now they may just becoming home for grandfather gillad the beginning of the end of a living nightmare I go to hug them kiss them and I hope they and probably they will be in hospital in the in the first time to get the checkup and everything but uh I I know I don't know I didn't think what I got to do and what they going to say the family descended from Holocaust Survivors are among those Hamas hostages who hold German citizenship last month relatives traveled to Berlin to pressure German officials to help bring their loved ones home in the center of the German capital on thday a street artist drawing attention to their cause the send on kingom these are all our children this barbaric Hamas kidnapping shows who we are dealing with we should not forget it and neither should the whole world now all the families at the heart of this tragedy can do is wait now a little earlier my colleague Terry Martin spoke with shaon lifshitz in Tel Aviv both her mother and father were taken hostage by Hamas during the terrorist uh attacks on October 7th her mother was released last month but her father is believed to still be held by Hamas we started by asking her how her mother yvet is doing my mother is doing U very very well um her heart is in under Gaza as she say but her body is strong her mind is strong um she's quite involved in preparation for the return of other hostages and she's advising from her own experience so she's busy supporting other families that have hostages supporting the Ministry of Health and other bodies within Israel as they prepare for the return of hostages and in particular very olderly hostages and tell me if you would about your father ODed he's 83 years old I understand and and I understand he was injured when Hamas kidnapped him yes my father was at home with my mom in the secure room which is the bedroom he was shot through the metal door and he we didn't know that until my mother come we know that he's in Gaza we know that he's 83 and quite frail and we know that he we don't know if he is life or dead 49 days into the event so I gather you have not received any sign of life then from your father since October 7th except what you heard from your mother heard from your mother no we know that he's there but we don't know if he's dead or alive I cannot explain how come the Red Cross or NOS other NOS nobody is able to tell me this basic fact I find it absolutely horrific but I'm not the only one quite a few of us are in this position I'm sure now the ceasefire uh the ceasefire deal came into Force this morning as part of the deal around 50 hostages held by Hamas are to be released in the coming hours and days does that give you hope I know many of the people on the list today um I know them personally I cannot wait for each person that come back I cannot wait for the women and children we miss them so much um our heart is with their mothers and fathers this is an horrendous situation some of these children will be coming back while the par fathers will stay behind the the trauma is Indescribable it crosses um through so many circles I cannot wait to see them each one of them is a whole life and we are preparing to receive them and we are doing our best we are it's very fragile moment it's in a scale of horrendous that we experience since the 7th of October the Frailty of this uh of this is very big we don't want to speak about it till it happens we so aware that some of us will have some of our loved one back and others not the trauma that will continue because people will have to face the knowledge that their sisters or brothers or fathers died um they do not know much about what is happening what has happened since so we can't wait to see them but this is a ray of light in the great Darkness now Hamas is expected at least initially to release women and children only are you prepared to have to wait longer for your father's return look we are a community we grew together the children grow together being part of these communities that you have bonds that are like family if there is a queue there then my father and several others members of the kibuts uh fighting to be at the end of it my father truly believe in this young generation and so for he feels that he's 83 that he had a great life that he wants those children and their mothers and their fathers and everyone else ahead of him we are desperate to see him we miss him so much but I know the kind of person he is now we know that you're in contact with some of the other families who are also waiting for news about the possible release of their loved ones you mentioning that the uncertainty and the waiting for all of you must be terrible yeah I I cannot describe it our the life of our life loved ones are in the hands of politicians and terrorists um in the most immediate way um these are people that have uh caused such horrific they have uprooted us they have murdered us they have beheaded us they raped us they uh slaughtered us they have created the prgram um we were defenseless against them um so to have your loved one in their hands and in the hands of a very delicate truth and a very delicate exchange of uh terrorists and civilians is horrific now in kibuts near o your parents home more than a hundred people are thought to have been killed or captured by Hamas on October 7th after all that happened do you see a future for your family in Israel Israel yes of course they're very rooted there this is their home um I think that uh my father fought for peace all his life his parents fought for peace the gear that the two nations would live side by side is something that my parents dedicated their life too and so I think that future in Israel would also depend on making peace and finding a way to live side by side to sa from the river to the sea is is not applicable we need to find a way of living side by side we have made peace with the Germans after the World War II and over generation built relationship and it's absolutely clear that that is also possible with uh with the Palestinian Hamas is a horrific terrorist organization that engaged in the most the worst crimes against humanity there's no peace possible with people that train themselves to behave babies that just went out to inflict the maximum trauma on civilians and so there's no peace with Kamas but with the Palestinian people with people like the person my mom shook hand with Absolut absolutely we will make peace with them we will have to find a way to live side by side that was shiron liit speaking to us earlier her father is among those hostages believed to be held by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip well Israel has made clear that despite this 4-day Tru steal the war is not over yet earlier my colleague Terry Martin spoke to Israeli military spokesperson Peter Lerner and asked him what his expectations were from this pause in fighting morning indeed our forces are in defensive operational lines regrouping and and taking the necessary steps in accordance to the government's instructions of course this is what we expect to F follow through over the next few days uh but we are um uh continuing to be vigilant and prepared for any eventuality like to remind you that in recent in in not so far away history we've had SE spies with Hamas they've always taken advantage of them to attack and abduct soldiers kill soldiers so we are on on the on the go we are prepared we're taking the necessary steps but of course we are abiding by the instructions of the government what will the Israeli military do Colonel ler if a rocket is fired into Israel during this ceasefire because there are concerns that there could be Rogue elements in Palestine that in the Palestinian territories that want indeed to spoil this ceasefire so we have to be as I said we are on defensive uh positions we're making the necessary steps in order to be prepared prepared for that of course we won't tolerate attacks against us and therefore it is as the your reporter rightly pointed out a very fragile situation on the ground um we are expecting to maintain our positions and we're and maintaining our defensive capabilities um correctly saying we don't want people returning to the north precisely because this war is not over we are in a pause an operational pause that is um dictating the the way forward it the operation is currently focused on two core things first of all getting the hostages out and maintaining conducting the the um the release of the terrorists and criminals coming out of Israeli prisons and this is the focus for the next at least days we will be prepared in order to respond to any aggression against us how do you think this pause in the fighting will impact Israel's plans to eliminate Hamas is this going to compromise the Israeli military's ability to prosecute its war against Hamas no the off the war effort will continue the government has said so the Prime Minister stated it explicitly our role in this is to implement the government policy in order to make sure that Hamas can never wield the sword of death against Israelis ever again um you know they utilized and abused all of the tools of government in order to build their terrorist capabilities in order to build the rockets in order to build the tunnel system in order to build their terrorist Army that infiltrated Israel on the 7th of October so the the the it doesn't change the end goal it doesn't change the directive uh we are but Focus that because the two goals of this war go hand in hand we have to bring home the hostages and this is what we're focused on today and over the next few days and we also make need to make sure that Hamas never have that power again in order to utilize it against the people of Israel and I would add against the people of Gaza as well now Israeli forces I understand are warning displaced Palestinians in Gaza those who moved to the South telling them not to go back to the northern part of the strip but I understand that Hamas is telling people indeed to go north will Israeli soldiers stop Palestinians trying to go north if they attempt it I you know we've been very clear and I think U it was part of the agreement uh people should not be moving North we won't permit it people should can can continue to go south but not go to the north there is a very very extensive as you are aware military presence on the ground uh the combat zone is still very active and dangerous people should not return to the north that was IDF spokesperson Peter Lerner speaking to us earlier well many young Israeli soldiers have taken part in the military operation against Hamas in recent weeks and we want to shed light on what this means for their families so I can now speak to Karen an Israeli American mother of four her 20-year-old son is a member of a special combat unit in Gaza and for security reasons we've agreed to not disclose uh her full name or whereabouts welcome to DW news Karen now the truce that began this morning is expected to last for 4 days how are you feeling about this considering it means also a break in the fighting for your son well um from one point I feel relief but on the other one I feel scared because uh every sepire that we had before Hamas didn't stand with this ceas fire and uh harmed our soldiers uh even if it's a ceasefires uh they kidna two of our soldiers while they were in um ceasefire so we don't know what to expect how often have you been hearing from your son uh maybe once or two twice and I I can hear from him you you don't have much contact with him is there is is that is there just reasons for that behind it or is it just that tell us a bit more when he's uh inside Gaza you can't contact him there is no way you can contact him uh the last uh time that he was out it was um last week he lost his uh Commander um a sniper shoot him while he was um looking around to see what's going on and um he took it very seriously because he he just killed in his hands um so they took him for um a little bit of um um uh how can I say it uh just to relax a little bit from what was there and um yeah I'm not sure you know I he can't come home so I can't talk to him not all the time he can contact me so I don't know really what he feels and how he is mentally um and yeah it's scary I'm not 100% yeah I understand your your daughter will also be joining the Army in a few days H how do you feel about this um it's hard it's hard two kids in the Army uh and in a war uh it's hard this is not a usual thing that your kids are going to the Army to serve Israel and um both of them are in a war I know people that uh have seven kids and six of them are in a war six of them are soldiers right now you mentioned earlier that contact with your son is um you don't have contact with your son very often are you regularly briefed about where he is about how he's doing about his experience I can tell you that you can't sleep at night um during the day you can't leave your phone because you don't know if he's gonna call if someone will call you are scared from any uh call that it's uh not recognized so you don't know who's calling you it can be from the Army um and you're afraid that someone will knock on your door and will come and tell you bad news about your kids so you just uh try to think positive um and when I was talking to him um he was telling me a horrifying story about what's going on there um that with his value how he grew up he was not able to even um imagine being in a war in this situation and the example is that he he was telling me Mom I was fighting against um Hamas that send their kids and women in front of us in front of them to fight us so you don't know who to shoot and what what to do right now because you're fighting against Hamas but their human Shields are the kids and the and the women so to shoot or not to shoot and it was very hard from him at beginning Karen from everything that telling us um it sounds like a a very difficult situation um for a parent to be to be going through how are you coping how do you live your day today with this as you mentioned this this fear of of the phone going and and bad news potentially so I open a project of volunteering um we prepared the hot meals for soldiers and for people who uh had to leave leave their houses from south and north and I was uh volunteering up until two days ago when all the donations are over and done uh so we were just preparing meals for the soldiers for the people for and to do everything that you can for your country thank you for talking to us today Karen on DW news Take Care thank you thank
