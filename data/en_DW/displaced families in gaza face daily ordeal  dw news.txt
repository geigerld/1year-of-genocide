the Israeli military is again intensifying its air and ground offensive in Gaza strikes on Thursday killed at least 50 Palestinians as Israel presses its military campaign against Hamas which is considered a terror group by many countries over 21,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas run Health Ministry most of the population has been displaced the aftermath of another strike on the maazi refugee camp in central Gaza much of the site is in Ruins with some residents still buried under Rubble others have fled trying to escape the bombing they told us to go to Rafa but we don't want to why should we to go and live in the streets there the entire neighborhood here was evacuated as more people flee their homes in search of shelter many end up in making makeshift camps overcrowded and without running water daily life is a constant struggle enough of the war enough of the pain enough of the hunger of the hurting we're tired of everything in this life there's nothing for basic needs it's difficult to make dough to wash clothes we have to bring water to drink and to wash we're all suffering we need to buy sanitary towels for girls and women but we can't find any we have to wait in Long cues with supplies running low food prices are also soaring the UN Refugee agency has warned that 40% of gaza's population is at risk of famine some people can't even buy canned food because of the prices they're 10 times higher than before no matter where they go gazans say their lives are always at risk if the bombing doesn't kill them they fear a slow death from Hunger or disease Steven Ryan from the international Committee of the Red Cross is in Rafa where nearly half of all Gins have fled he told me about the conditions there well the the scenes that you see across Rafa each and Every Day become more and more uh concerning uh over the last couple of weeks we have seen tens of thousands uh if not hundreds of thousands of people arrive in RAF to set up temperary tents in places that aren't designed to host large numbers of people you would have seen in the report just now that the the conditions in these uh places are are not suitable there isn't enough water there isn't enough uh shelter material uh there isn't enough sanitation and certainly people also don't have enough access to food even if there is f food on the market you will have heard that most people can't afford it so the conditions here in Rafa are extremely dire and the humanitarian organizations that are here are struggling to be able to respond because we do not have enough releas supplies to be able to meet these needs these situations these places are not set up to receive large numbers of people and each and every day more and more people arrive and Beyond those very immediate and basic needs what are the health risks of having so many people living in such tight quarters well certainly you can imagine that uh for families that are looking after children it's very difficult for them to be able to look after the hygiene needs of of their children of and of their whole family being able to look after their uh their food if they have any food to be able to keep it in hygienic conditions is difficult and also cramming so many people into such a small space uh during the winter uh when people don't have enough blankets or don't have enough shelter this is something that's going to without doubt have a serious impact on the health condition of people that have had no choice but to come here in search of somewhere safe one of the areas that the ICC is focusing very strongly in is on trying to support the health system of uh of Gaza we have a medical team that's here working in one of the hospitals and we deliver relief items to hospitals medical items including supplies including uh essential medication but with the scale of displacement with the number of people that are being squeezed into very small area here in Rafa the likelihood of uh more and more people having greater medical needs beyond the injuries caused by the ongoing armed conflict uh is something that we're extremely concerned about and indeed we've seen uh 85% of gazin displaced in the last three months from the people you you've been speaking to there how do they view their future and what it might hold each and every day when I meet uh Palestinians across Gaza they tell me of their fear from the ongoing fighting their uncertainty about what's going to come next because nobody knows what's going to come next each day I meet people in the hospitals where we work who are trying to look after uh sick family members injured children uh trying to seek if there's opportunities for them to get specialist medical treatment abroad and right now most people here in Gaza are trying their best to manage on a day-to-day basis they have bigger concerns than the long-term future about know basic items like food and water and where they're going to be able to sleep tonight but certainly what is needed here without doubt is a political response that leads to a a rest bite for these people these civilians who continue to be severely affected by this ongoing fighting thank you again so much for making the time to speak with us that is Step Ryan from the in Gaza now there are are also calls from within Israel for a way out of the war I'd like to get across to DW correspondent Yan Philip Schultz joining me live from Tel Aviv now I understand there's a rally planned there in Tel Aviv for tonight can you tell us what we can expect yes people are already arriving and it's one of uh those rare occasions where uh Jews and Israeli Arabs are coming together uh as you know Israel has a very mixed population about 20% are uh Israelis uh with uh uh an Arab uh uh background and uh they often Define themselves as Palestinians but uh very often they are divided in society and this is one of the occasions where they come together it might not be it might not seem to be a big thing but it actually is and it's something very courageous in those polarized times here people say the only way forward the only way to find a solution to the conflict is a peaceful coexist istance and peace is also the only way to bring real security to the region so after almost 3 months of Bloodshed how much support is there generally amongst Israelis for the war polls show that the majority of uh people here are still in favor of the War uh prime minister Netanyahu has lost support uh in the past weeks uh but regarding the war there is still a majority that says the the the fighting has to continue until Hamas is destroyed well thank you so much for your reporting uh that is DW correspondent Yan Philip SCH Schultz for us in Tel
