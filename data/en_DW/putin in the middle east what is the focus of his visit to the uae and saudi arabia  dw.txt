and Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the United Arab Emirates for a rare trip abroad it's his first time visiting the Middle East since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine the uae's foreign minister greeted the Russian president on his arrival Putin then traveled on for talks with the UAE president shik Muhammad bin Zed he held the two countries current relations saying they were at an unprecedented High Putin will also visit Saudi Arabia during the trip where he'll hold talk with the country's de facto ruler Muhammad bin Salman DW's former Moscow bureau chief Fury retto joins us from Ria DW being banned from reporting from Russia Yuri this is one of Putin's rare appearances abroad tell us more about what's in Focus well Russia maintains close relations with both countries the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia uh according to the Kremlin in Saudi Arabia Putin is going to talk with ground Prince Muhammad bin Al Salman on trade international politics and humanitarian Aid um the issue of oil trading is very important too um as we know eight oil oil producing countries have reduced their oil production from May in order to maintain production at the lower level until the end of the year to stabilize the market uh so this is one of the topics uh uh uh today also the conflict between Israel and Hamas is on the agenda for both meetings too and the same time at the same time this visit should be seen in the context of the uh Russian internal politics uh of the upcoming presidential elections in Russia next year in March next year uh Putin hasn't yet announced his candidacy he may do so next week during his annual press conference and of course this visit abroad would help him improve his image in Russia regardless regardless of the results but y doesn't have to worry about that International arrest warrants well the Russian president is traveling abroad only for the fifth time since the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him but uh Putin doesn't risk to be arrested because neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates have ratified the so-called Rome treaty which founds the international criminal courts and that means they wouldn't have to arrest him uh in contrary to South Africa for example we remember in July this year Mr Putin skipped a summit there because of fears he could be arrested so if nothing unforeseeable happens Putin will make this visit abroad as a politician who is not only labeled as a warm time president but also who is listened to at least in the Arab world the other thing is that Putin is in the Middle East at the time of War at a time of war in Gaza what what role has Russia played in this conflict well Russia seems to strengthen its geopolitical position here in the Middle East and yeah gain influence as a mediator um Moscow has good relations with Hamas which is considered a terrorist group in most Western countries but not in Russia uh where Hamas uh regularly sends delegations to uh in the end of October this year the founder and political leader of the group came to Moscow uh he met with the RI Deputy Prime Minister before that they both had a meeting in Qatar uh Qatar is the preferred negotiator with Hamas from the Western point of view but it has been unable to find a basis for another hostage exchange between Israel and Palestinian group so I think Putin has relatively little to lose by intervening now uh during his visits uh in in Qatar interesting stuff there from our R bureau chief Yuri redo good talking to you as always
