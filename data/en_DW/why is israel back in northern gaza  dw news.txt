Israeli authorities say a number of people have been arrested after protesters in the occupied West Bank blocked an aid Convoy Bound for Gaza the protesters were seen throwing food packages onto the road and destroying some of it the trucks came from Jordan and were waiting to cross the Taria checkpoint west of Hebron a farri Israeli group says they were demonstrating against the continued Detention of Israeli hostages in Gaza now the United Nations has warned that Palestinians in North Northern Gaza are experiencing a fullblown famine this as the Israeli Army returned there to fight resurgent Hamas forces smoke Rises over jabalia in Northern Gaza Hamas operatives have returned to the area as Israeli forces pushed to retake parts of Gaza they had previously cleared civilians are caught in the crossfire they're are wounded and dead that we cannot reach because of the consistent bombing of our crews and ambulances by Israeli forces ambulances are being directly targeted and the artillery continues to launch rockets into the center of the jabalia camp according to gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry over 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war while the United States Israel's strongest Ally says it doesn't does not believe a genocide is happening in Gaza the White House has uttered some of its strongest criticism of Israel's war effort to date military operation has to be connected to a political plan for the day after so that there is a clear alternative and there's governance and there's security and all of the steps you need to take to finally and fully defeat a hardened entrenched terrorist Foe and yes um one of the risks of engaging in any kind of counter insur campaign is the ability of the terrorist group to attract more recruits and more followers as time goes on this is something we have talked to the Israelis about meanwhile in Rafa in the south of Gaza Israeli forces are carrying out what they call a limited Military operation to root out one of the last Hamas strongholds the Army says it's taken out dozens of terrorists and found tunnels and weapons Depot but the latest operation has also forced hundreds of thousands of civilians to again flee this time northwards let's bring in NOA tarnopolski a freelance journalist in Jerusalem who has covered Israel and the Palestinian territories for decades welcome in addition to Rafa Israel's force is now also going back into the north of Gaza pounding areas that they said they had cleared months ago but now seeing Hamas regrouping there um how much of a setback is this for Israel and and what does it tell us about Israel's war strategy well um what it tells us is that Gaza is on its way to becoming an Israeli Quagmire it's not so much a setback as simply uh a logical next PATH for a major military operation that has no political diplomatic strategic end point in such as the US state department as the White House excuse me said so clearly um I have to say that Israeli military top brass have been warning of this situation for at least several months now and the government appears to be paralyzed when asked to um determine what its end point for this fighting is tell us more about this paralysis as you say we heard Jake Sullivan there um urging a plan for the day after um also we heard on Monday a senior US state department official saying that Washington does not think that Israel's goal of victory over Hamas and Gaza is likely or even possible what is the Israeli government doing with that assessment well as strange as it is to say this the Israeli government has not responded to those assessments has not said a word and has used the cover of two major national holidays here Memorial Day followed by Independence Day today and really the shattered feeling of most Israeli citizens um it has used this as a cover not to have to respond the other thing that's important to say is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not made himself available either to the press or to the public so there has been no opport opportunity given the government's lack of response to ask directly and I think it's also important to say that Netanyahu himself who has been repeating now for several months this motto total Victory it's become really a daily slogan has never defined it either in Israel or abroad not to the media and not to anyone else um you could see part of this frustration and I think it's also important to say part part of the real heartbreak of uh Israeli citizens yesterday um in Memorial Day event in the only event in which Netanyahu was even nearby to any members of the public he was present at the National Memorial event for falling soldiers and a parent of a soldier who fell in this war yelled out at him you know heckled him um which is very very unusual at that kind of a formal ceremony I would say it's even unheard of so the situation is one in which it appears the Israeli government just does not want to respond to the reality that you're describing do you see a way that netanyahu's government could redefine this goal is there an off-ramp for him if Israel is not successful in outing Hamas from Gaza um yeah although first I have to say it's unclear what is meant by outing Hamas from Gaza because the Israeli government has been given a very clear Opportunity by very important Partners the United States and Egypt in this case Egypt borders on the other side of Gaza um to install Palestinian officials with wider Arab military backing to take over power from Hamas in the Gaza Strip the reason that one of the reasons that Israel has not been able to to uproot Hamas uh Power Point within Gaza is that it is refusing to determine who will take power if a different um governing body were brought into Gaza with military backing that would make Israel's task a lot easier but the Israeli government refuses to do that the reason is political nenia who fears losing some of his um more Hardline ministers if he agrees to to allow the Palestinian Authority in but he will absolutely break international support for Israel if he publicly says that Israel is simply going to remain there as an occupying power and stuck between these two pressures he has simply chosen indecision that's that's where Israel is for now thank you so much for joining us with those insights today that is
