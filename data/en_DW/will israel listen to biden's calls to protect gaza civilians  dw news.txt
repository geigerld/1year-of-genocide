the White House says US President Joe Biden has pressed Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu to protect civilian lives in Gaza Biden said he spoke at length with Netanyahu on Saturday about Israel's war against Hamas militants they reportedly discussed the objectives of the military campaign in Gaza but the US stopped short of calling for a ceasefire Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the EU and us the Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry says more than 100 people have been killed by Israeli forces over the past 24 hours the violence follows a un Security Council resolution to boost humanitarian Aid another day in Gaza another Mass burial gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says the number killed since October 7th has surpassed 20,000 that's roughly 1% of the strip's entire population Israel however shows no sign of letting up its bombardment this Israeli Army footage purportedly shows a strike on a Hass official being transported by car it's part of what Israel says are expanded ground operations in the bed territory it's part of the war it's a difficult war against a brutal enemy that's entrenched in the field above and especially below it as well as amongst the civilian population we are striking Hamas but this is a protracted difficult operation that will continue a while longer these expanded operations come as two of Israel's most senior cabinet members visited troops in Northern Gaza the Israeli government is under mounting pressure internationally as the humanitarian situation worsens and domestically at a rally in Tel Aviv hundreds of people came together calling for the government to secure the host's release some went further chanting for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also known as BB to step [Music] down we need to make sure that bam will go away he makes more harm more harm than good and he betrayed the the uh people this government has failed its citizens in every possible way from the most basic one about basic safety to uh compromising its Democratic Values nothing of any value can happen either here or in Gaza while these people are still in power the Israeli government insists it won't stop until Hamas has been completely destroyed it has not however set out a vision of what that would look like or what comes next and for more let's speak to journalist Sami sool who joins us now from Jerusalem Samy good to have you with us uh first of all uh could you please give us the latest on the situation in Gaza well I I will start with the fact that the IDF spokesperson has announced that there are more soldiers that have been killed all in all the announced the killing of 13 Israeli soldiers in the last 12 hours in different locations both in the area of Junes and in other places which is to show that the Israeli forces are facing a tough resistance by the Palestinian Fighters there they're using uh explosive devices anti-tank RPGs ET ET on top of that of course Israel is continuing to Shell including residential areas we're talking about shelling both with artillery air from the sea uh so this is an ongoing war that has different aspects to it now we uh heard in this report of course that US President Joe Biden has urged Benjamin Netanyahu to protect Civ Ian lives in Gaza how much weight do Biden's words carry uh enough to make netan change Israel's military strategy well it's clear that Biden President Biden has been successful in in pushing Israel to accept the humanitarian Aid that will go into the Gaza Strip uh we're yet to see how this Aid that has already entered yesterday will be distributed throughout the the Gaza Strip um but when it comes to the way Israel is conducting its campaign I don't think that the Americans are micromanaging uh this kind of way of Israel's Warfare uh We've also heard uh the American defense Secret Lloyd Austin when he was here and he was meeting with Israeli officials he was saying you know we're not giving the Israelis a a deadline uh we're not going to tell them how to run the war he said we're going to give them advice as to bring about less casualties well so far we still see these kind of casualties among civilians uh so we're still waiting to see what will be the impact of the these uh statements and of course in the meantime uh the Israeli government in particular Benjamin Netanyahu is uh facing growing dissatisfaction um and criticism of course uh not just internationally but also at home to tell us more about that yes so first of all in Netanyahu is very unpopular and all the polls have been indicating uh that he there are other candidates that would be more popular if there would be any elections now he would not be forming uh the next government and this is mainly attributed to the fact that he's Head of the State during the attack on the 7th of October and also the way the government has been managing the internal issues inside Israel h so so definitely we have these calls and and last night there were protests in different locations demanding the resignation of Netanyahu but we shouldn't confuse it with the Israeli aggressive approach towards the Gaza Strip only 11% of the Israeli public in a recent poll said that they support an immediate ceas fire that would bring about the hostage exchange so I I would say that when it comes to the way Israel is waging its campaign inside the Gaza Strip it's still enjoying a support in the Israeli public all right journalist Sami sakul there reporting for us in Jerusalem Sami uh thank you so very
