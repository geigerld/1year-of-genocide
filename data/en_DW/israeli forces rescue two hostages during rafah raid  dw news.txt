now two more hostages are back in Israel after being freed in an overnight raid in Gaza Israel says they were rescued in a special military operation in the southern city of Rafa the two men were kidnapped during the October 7 Terror attacks on Israel by Hamas which is regarded as a terror organization by multiple countries they were flown by a helicopter to a hospital near Tel Aviv for medical checks reunited with their families Luise ha and Fernando Simon mman were rescued by Israel's military and security forces during overnight raids in Rafa after 128 days held captive by Hamas in Gaza they are currently receiving treatment in a hospital where they are both said to be in a stable condition for their families the sense of relief is mixed with concern for the hostages still being held in Gaza luckily for us as a family they were saved tonight but I must say that the job is not done we are happy today but it's not a we didn't win it's just another step towards bringing all the other 134 hostages back home and it doesn't matter if it's babies women men Elder people everybody must come back as soon as possible Israeli air strikes devastated parts of Rafa overnight buildings and destroying a mosque dozens of Palestinians were killed and many more taken to hospital with serious injuries we were at home when the air strikes were going on I told my mother that I wanted to use the bathroom as she was awake suddenly all the walls of the bathroom and all the water containers above it collapsed on me most of the roughly 1.4 million Palestinians currently in Rafa fled from other parts of Gaza they were trying to escape the intense fighting in other areas and the city was designated a safe zone for civilians by the Israeli Army but recent Israeli strikes on Rafa have eliminated any sense of security for Palestinians there let's pick up some of those points with deal lettz who joins us now from tviv his grandmother yoked was taken hostage by Hamas on October the 7th she was later released uh she was released later that month but his grandfather odad remains in Hamas captivity welcome to DW um can we start with your late with your reaction to this latest news that the Israeli military has freed two hostages well this is really exciting thing I tell you why because today two families basically this is a one big family now got their beloved ones back two of them back so these two families right now can sleep at night and understanding that they're back at home with them and this is the most amazing thing and this is the perfect presentence for those family who' been suffering so much and for me it's it's very hard and I tell you why because we have evidence that shows that sometimes in a military actions sometimes Kamas increases their reaction for the hostages that's still H being over there that's still being hostage over there so we freed two of them H but now it's make me more terrified about the other ones alive because Hamas is a really tricky organization right they don't really care about life and they might hurt the other hostages over there so right and your grandfather is amongst that the hostage is still being held I understand um what have you heard from yeah what have you heard from or about him since he was taken the only thing we know about him that he did survive the 7th of October H and he been held in a room in Gaza we're not really sure exactly where but he's not well at all H the last news we got about him is around almost four months back and yeah this is not an ideal condition right okay now we we were just looking at some of those those protests uh in Israel and we have Mr nessan who's saying that the operation to free the hostages shows that it is right to keep up military pressure the hostages who were released today or last night say that a deal is needed to secure the release of all the remaining hostages um where are you in that um in that argument I tell you what this is an argument and this is not an argument the last deal that have been uh that have done uh that they released almost uh One released 110 people 100 hostages been released by this deal the Army Force really helped that because Hamas made made have feel that they need um some break to organize themselves for the next step and they understood that they have to go for a deal so it have influence about that but in the bottom line in the end the the Army Force might even kill those hostages and it did happen some of the some of the videos that have we seen the last host hostages that been died in there H was died because of Israeli bombing bombed right next to a place over there and Hamas guy was sced so he shot the guy because he thought this is might be a rescue and he shot the hostage that been there and you know this is a straight effect of this Army and and so so was Mr Netanyahu right to uh reject um the Hamas counter proposals for a deal last week I think that Israeli need to go for a deal as fast as we can because uh we don't really have time for these hostages that are still over there and I think that I'm not aware for all the information that netan is aware to and I want to believe that everyone wants to do everything to release our beloved ones but I do H want to tell that we have to go for hard decisions we have to because if we won't go for hard decisions including accepting stuff that Kamas demanding we won't have any chance to get them back alive so okay that's the thing thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts with us de lifshitz in Tel Aviv thank you very much Marina Miran is a military Analyst at the war studies department at Kings College London I asked her why it's such a difficult task for Israel to rescue the hostages well we have to understand in what conditions Hamas operates in Gaza we know that on the one hand they use building civilian buildings on the other hand they also use underground tunnels and it is to assume that they are not keeping the hostages all in one place meaning that they would have dispersed them because we have to understand the importance of hostages to Hamas this is a bargaining chip that Hamas can use to negotiate ceasefires with Israel so for Hamas it's very important to ensure that Israel soldiers do not find the hostages and finding them is like uh finding a needle in a stack but you first have to locate the stack and so it's very very difficult uh and we have seen also cases where the Israeli soldiers didn't recognize their own hostages so they don't know exactly what these people look like as well making it even more serious now Israel has um not come up with a plan for over a million displaced gazans who are Sheltering in Rafa what would a potential ground offensive look like that that is correct uh there is no concrete plan except for sending uh these people 1 and a half million to the north I do not think that all of these people can be relocated and conducting a ground offensive with 1 and a half million packed into Rafa um means that there will be collateral damage and it is inevitable because if even if you're using Precision guided Munitions to destroy buildings there is still a risk of collateral damage and of course for the ground troops this is not a nice environment to operate in because they will have to separate the population from the Hamas meaning that Hamas can just comfortably F uh hide inside um the population and not be easily distinguished again creating a greater risk for civilian casualties which would again benefit Hamas uh to show what Israel and Military is doing to civilians and of course of the Israeli military it is bad in a sense that neutral civilians who might not have supported Hamas before will certainly throw their support behind Hamas seeing how the Israeli soldiers are killing uh Palestinians who are not part of the conflict now there have been uh reports and that's a related issue of Hamas Fighters reappearing in the north and there is ongoing fighting there around Khan yunes as well what's happening with the ground offensive in those areas well from what it looks like the uh Han unun area is is still active in a sense that it is not completely cleared than under control of the IDF and because Hamas still has a working part of their tunnel Network they can also use that in order to surprise the Israeli forces and that's what they have been doing making it very difficult to clear areas and to hold them um me meaning also that even if Israel comes up with with a good plan to get some civilians out of Rafa we have again the risk of Hamas Fighters escaping together with those civilians and popping up in areas where one wouldn't expect them Marina Mar on there from the war studies department at Kings College London thank you very much Marina
