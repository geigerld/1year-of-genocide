US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has called for the protection of civilians as Israel prepares for an expected assault on Gaza during a meeting with his Saudi counterpart Prince faal bin faran in Riyad blinkin said that while Israel has a legitimate right to defend its people it was quote vitally important to protect civilians and that the US and Saudi Arabia were working together to do so blinkin also phoned his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to urge Beijing to use its influence in the Middle East to stop the conflict from spreading chinia Bano is a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations I asked her if the normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia could be resurrected or if it was completely off the table definitely can be resurrected because at at the basis of that normalization process I have to say that you know there are real very real interests on both on all the sites involved um the Saudis do want to have stronger relations with Israel um and also use this agreement to um sort of get a get a renewal of US security commitments to the region because Saudi Arabia um is aware that to contain the risks emanating from Iran and others they need both engagement and deterrence the Israelis obviously have a very strong political interest um in signing on to this normalization because it would unlock um a number of other Rel relationships through out the Arab and Islamic world and the United States has a strong interest because first of all they want to relinquish some of their responsibilities as security actor in the region to Israel and at the same time they also are aware that this would play out very well politically for the administration that would be responsible for facilitating such an agreement that is simply that those interests are going to stay but this is really not the time it's politically toxic to now to look at this file so it's going to take months if not more to be able to revisit that file well if you can just look at the short ter term news now those hundreds of thousands of gazin fleeing South uh and some of them in danger of you know being harmed by the impending Israeli assault how much influence does Saudi Arabia have in mitigating that possibly do you think well not a lot um if you look at the Israeli side I mean um there there's a reason a lot of Israeli commentators officials and so on are calling what happened on October 7th hour 911 and among the reasons is that the Israeli government um retaliation or reaction frankly does not seem to be very rational at all and that's exactly what happened with the US Government after 911 um so it would be you know this the Saudis could possibly entice Netanyahu to restraint where they willing to offer you know an continuation of that uh process of normalization of relations but it's arguably already too late because the Arab and Islamic public opinion worldwide is already quite um sort of enraged so it wouldn't allow it it's already too late for that and on the Hamas side Saudi Arabia consider Hamas a terrorist organization they have dozens of Hamas leaders in their in their own jails and they have very limited relations I mean arguably Iran is the one Regional player which still has intact leverage on Hamas understood thank you for that Insight chin Bano visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations a sign for every hostage more than a week after Hamas struck Israel with Terror killing and kidnapping civilians people have come to together here in Tel Aviv some are blaming the government others came in solidarity with victim's families May belongs to one of them the 24y old is missing six of her own family members at around 10:30 a.m. terrorists entered their home dozens of them armed with knives waving the knives at them and shouting I spoke with theone at the last minutes and she sent me recording my there are terrorists here we are alone they are shouting donon cats is her aunt she was taken together with her small daughters Aviv and RZ they were visiting family in n a kibuts close to Gaza Ravid Kats the uncle is missing too as is elderly mother ifat and her husband God Moshe Moses I'm here because my family has no voice right now they are dead or kidnapped I'm here to be their voice I expect from the world the maximum amount of intervention she learned what happened through a Hamas Tik Tok video my tells us her aunt's phone was later located in Gaza the situation is desperate myant is a German citizen but in her situation that doesn't help it wasn't just Israelis that Hamas killed and kidnapped 43 different nationalities were represented among their hostages as many as 150 people have been abducted and are belief to still being held hostage in Gaza their families don't know where they are how they are doing and if if they're even still alive people in Israel are united in the conviction that there needs to be a response but what exactly this should look like at least at this protest isn't clear the Israeli government must Focus first of all on doing whatever is necessary in order to release the hijacked people instead of focusing on trying to do some kind of Revenge or whatever they are trying to do I think the only option we have now unfortunately it's to clear Gaza so many people in Israel understand that this Blood circle is not the solution it never was it never will be at this point though the Bloodshed seems like it is far from over let's have a look at some of the other news concerning the conflict the militant islamist group Hamas says that nine more hostages it was holding have been killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip on Friday Hamas reported 13 hostage deaths also blaming the Israeli bombardment the Israeli government believes up to 150 hostages were taken during the terrorist attack a week ago Egypt and Israel have agreed to let us citizens leave the Gaza Strip through the Rafa crossing the only entry point to the territory not controlled by Israel the Israeli Army struck the crossing early this week and says any use of it into Egypt will be in coordination with Israel Lebanon says it will submit a formal complaint to the UN Security Council over what it calls Israel's deliberate killing of Isam Abdullah a Lebanese National and reuter journalist Abdullah was killed in southern Lebanon on Friday while covering clashes on the border with Israel German foreign minister analina bayerbach is in Egypt for talks focused on the Gaza conflict barbach met Egyptian foreign minister Sam shukri in Cairo in a statement Egypt said both ministers understood the need for quote immediate cessation of escalation of the conflict barbach held talks with visiting Turkish foreign minister hakan fidan to discuss joint efforts to secure the release of German hostages when the sirens ring it's time to go this is a routine Israelis know all too well for foreigners that sound is another sign to leave the country while they still can well at the beginning I wanted to stay here to continue studying and actually I was feeling safe but actually last night when the siren was off I I ran into the to the shelter and on the way to the shelter I fell and I scratched myself a bit and there is I saw that okay I'm not really trained or familiar with this kind of uh situation so I yeah decided to take the charter flight with most Airlines cancelling flights in and out of Israel many foreigners are depending on repatriation flights to get home dozens of countries have set these up after Israel was struck by the deadliest Terror attacks in its history on the other side of Israel's Iron Wall hundreds of foreign Nationals are thought to be trying to escape the besieged territory of Gaza there's been a glimp of Hope a Us official said Egypt had agreed to open its Rafa border crossing and let foreigners out many have gathered at the border desperate and traumatized but there's been no movement here yet I'm like really in fear and like every every time I just have to have the thought of me dying in a bomb in Gaza like it's it's not a good thing thing and like every place I go I go run away and I just find bombs and I find dead people and like maybe one day I'll end up like them but it's a really scary thing for around but all people can do here for now is
