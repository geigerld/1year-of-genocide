Israel says its troops have surrounded and entered Southern gaza's largest city the military says its forces have now reached the center of hunus commanders say their troops are engaged in some of the most intense fighting so far Israel says its aim is to eliminate Hamas hundreds of thousands of people have been told to evacuate to humanitarian zones but the UN says nowhere in Gaza is safe survivors sift through the rubble of a destroyed home struck by Israeli missiles in the early hours of the morning there were 30 people inside the house 20 of them were children we don't know what happened to us the fire hit and all of it collapsed on top of us none of us made it out completely okay everyone is hurt the United Nations says almost 1.9 million gazin have fled their homes since the War Began many wound up here in Han yunes now gaza's second largest city is a Battleground Israel says it is operating against Hamas strongholds in the South and both sides report that the fighting is fierce leaving civilians with nowhere to go all my senior colleagues have been very clear including the Secretary General saying there is no there is no there are no safe places in Gaza the main hospital in Han yunas is overwhelmed the UN says delivering vital aid supplies is impossible amid the fighting and still the injured keep coming as do the bodies the devastation in Han yunas has left many Palestinians with a sense that the world has abandoned them we need someone to stand by our side we need someone to find us a solution we are devastated St but despite a brief ceasefire between Israel and Hamas the renewed fighting is as intense as ever DW's F FAA is in Jerusalem what's the Israeli military's aim in Han yunus their aim didn't change that is from the beginning to eliminate Hamas but when it comes to hunis being the second biggest city in the Gaza Strip Israel believes that this is basically the main second stronghold after Gaza City where hamus militants and a lot of hamus Fighters are believed to be especially the presumed Mastermind behind the terrorist attacks of October 7th here in Israel and that is SVA and he's believed to be hiding somewhere there in that City but as I'm saying this it's of course very clear as well that it's not just the militants but there are a lot of civilians who have been actually told weeks ago to evacuate from northern Gaza and go to the southern part of the strip to seek some safety and now as Israel is pushing in more and more into the city the civilians feel that they have to obviously uh leave and and but then the question is where they are going to go to and and where can they actually find safety because they've been promised this once but now once again uh they have to go and and see another way trying to find some safety and there not many spots left really according to the UN in fact there is no spot left when it comes to safety for civilians in Gaza right now well besides Israel's Ambitions in uh trying to track down Yahya Sina and also dismantling Hamas how is it responding to the growing International pressure to reduce the number of Civilian casualties from the israelian perspective I mean they keep saying that they're not fighting civilians but that they're fighting the Hamas militants they are also saying that given this interactive map that that's been divided that's been dividing Gaza Strip into uh 2,300 blocks warning people depending on which block they are in that they're going to be warned by Flyers uh online radio Etc that they should leave when they get a warning uh to them uh this seems to be uh basically enough uh what they can do given the circumstances they say that Hamas is misusing civilians as human Shields and uh they happen to be from from their intelligence uh in using the residential infrastructure basically of of of civilians but yes if you are listen listening into that growing international calls for limiting the casualties uh you can't stop by wondering just really how intense how more intense this fighting is going to be and just how the humanitarian international law can be upheld given the circumstances as the fighting on the ground intensifies Ben and funny what about the political situation at home does primee Minister Benjamin nety who still have political Ambitions Prim I mean it's really anyone's guess what's going to happen to prime minister uh netan once this war is over Al it's unclear when it's going to be over what is clear that Mr netan is fighting for political survival in fact there's been a lot of criticism from the beginning the way he's been handling this entire situation for first and foremost why uh October 7th even had to take place that there's a lot of criticism that he has underestimated what Hamas is able to do a group that's been classified a terrorist organiz ation by multiple countries and there is increasing tension building up as well because a lot of relatives of the hostages that that are remaining in Gaza Strip about 130 people are believed to be still inside Gaza Strip the relatives of those people say that prime minister netan is not doing enough so clearly uh whatever Mr netan is is is doing is not just under uh uh scrutiny here domestically but also under stronger scrutiny internationally the main question is though what the United States is going to do that is extremely supporting uh uh or extraordinary rather supporting Israel just how they are going to use their leverage how this war is going to be conducted moving forward from here that was DW's funny fisha in Jerusalem let's look at this with James denzo who's a head of conflict and humanitarian policy at save the children he joins us from London welcome to DW you recent L posted on X that there is no safe space for more than a million children in Gaza with fighting intensifying around Han Unis that situation must be even worse now it is it's desperate and it's incredibly Bleak for over a million children in the Gaza Strip I've just seen some images circulated by our team uh of Drone footage of some of the displacement camps in an around car Unice these are uh you know canvas tents uh that are densely packed together to uh look after and shelter uh the families that have been forced out of their homes now over 80% of the whole of the Gaza Strip uh who are homeless and you can only imagine the consequences of explosive weapons with wide area effects landing on or near such locations the potential for for Mass casualties on top of what's already been uh an incredibly bloody 60 days for children is is a very real one right and and are you able is your organiz still working in Gaza now that fighting has resumed it's very difficult for us and our staff to operate in Gaza uh it's the most dangerous place to be an aid worker over 100 uh un workers have been killed a number that continues to rise uh our team have been forced from the homes themselves are are looking after their families understandably as a matter of priority we have been able to move trucks of Aid in across from uh Rafa over the the past few weeks but that uh Supply is incredibly precarious and the ability to move Aid inside Gaza is is getting more limited by the minute so there is a a disconnect between the growing uh need of for a population H and the amounts of Aid that can actually meet that and in between those two spaces is is of course uh the suffering of children right and I'm I'm sorry I I didn't quite get that in in your answer so is save the children still operating in Gaza we're not directly programming in Gaza but we are able to provide trucks that go into the UN coordinated system in through the raic crossing so uh we're doing a bit but there is so much that is needed I couldn't couldn't claim for a second that we're meeting that need understood and uh so Aid trucks are still coming in did you say yes uh the numbers are are still though a fraction of what they were prior to the horrendous events of October the 7th uh and of course the need is multiplying as the population becomes uh more vulnerable whether that's for medicines clean water food and and everything else so uh Aid there is a a level of Aid that's able to get in but as the UN Secretary General himself uh wrote today that Aid operation is is rapidly collapsing in on of itself as the spaces in Gaza become so much more constrained right and and I want to ask you about those spaces because it's it is incredible to me looking at this from outside that people would actually get in those trucks and drive into to what is clearly a war zone so are there have they been delivering to places that that that are known to be safe for now well I think as your program suggested there's no safe place so let's not pretend that there is and it is a risky profession of course uh being an aid worker delivering those trucks the challenge about focusing so much on trucks is that we can track the numbers that cross over into Gaza but it's very difficult to know beyond that point whether they're getting as close to the people who need that Aid as they should be because of those issues with uh no deconfliction of movement or safe spaces that are agreed to by all parties to the conflict so uh it's a bit of an illusion and on top of that if you have a continued issue around cutting off water electricity and fuel the ability to provide for a population of over 2.2 million 80% of whom were dependent on Aid prior to the events of October is completely fanciful because those numbers are are staggering and I just wonder how what the thinking is behind the distribution how how do you decide where to send a limited number of trucks in a tiny area that is being bombed and where everybody needs it it's it's a horrendous question it's such an important question this is an aid operation like no other in the sense that the ability to do needs assessments and prioritize the most vulnerable children in Gaza for the prioritization of Aid uh is simply not possible in the ways that we would like so uh I don't want to sort of talk to you as an aid worker and pretend that the aid operation is able to really push back against the amount of need we're seeing in Gaza for a while during the uh so-called pause we were able to uh increase operations and increase the sort of decline if you will into suffering but but now as things get more intense in such a small densy populated uh South part of Gaza it is almost impossible okay we thank you for for joining us and outlining that for us James Denow head of conflict and humanitarian policy i' save the children thank you so much
