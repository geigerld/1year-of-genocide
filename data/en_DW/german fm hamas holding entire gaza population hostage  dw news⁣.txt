Germany's foreign minister Ana Lina Bok is also in Israel where she has reiterated Germany's support for to her Israeli counterpart Eli K the German foreign minister has been visiting the southern town of netivot which was overrun by Hamas militants at the weekend one of the big reasons for her visit is to speak with family members of German citizens who are still being held captive by the islamist militant group babok said that Hamas is holding the whole population of Gaza hostage Hamas is now deliberately entrenching itself in Gaza and using innocent people as human Shields Hamas has taken the entire population of Gaza hostage its tunnels weapons caches and command centers are deliberately located in homes supermarkets universities and perhaps even hospitals this poses incredible challenges to everyone who wants to fight Terror German from is analina Bok there and joining us now from netwood is our correspondent Tanya ker she was with the German foreign minister there Tanya what can you tell us about the visit why is analina bbok there what it was a very very short visit as she arrived on Friday morning and um just stayed for a few hours here in theot where we're still standing we can uh this is a city or town not far from the Gaza border we can hear also some artillery fire here from time to time as the war is uh continuing and she was visiting basically here a situation room um and visited with Al she met here counterpart Al K Israel's foreign minister and uh she also also visited a location where a rocket uh came down uh on a house and killed three people of the same uh family what she basically said here is her full support for Israel she said she reiterated uh Germany's support and for the security of Israel uh that it is Germany's reson Detra she was actually asked what that uh means if that also means that there would be for example military supply and she said whatever Israel needs she was also asked about the situation uh in Gaza and she was uh simply saying in that uh moment that uh Isel should abide by international law now there are apparently several German hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza what is Germany doing to help get them out well that's another um that was another very important aspect of her visit um during the visit here NTI R she also uh met some uh of the families uh whose loved ones have been taken hostage uh also with German citizenship and also uh in Tel Aviv she was uh also meeting some more families this is of a great concern of course for Germany but there are also other nations we just saw US Secretary of State uh Anthony blinkin also in the country he was also uh looking into ways how uh the hostages with uh US citizenship uh what they can do um to release them so Germany said the foreign minister said that Germany is in touch with other nations that are you know that have been traditionally Med mediating between Hamas and Israel indirectly uh for example Qatar or Egypt Germany itself has a history of being a mediator in hostage situations in the Middle East in the past but of course at the moment you know there is this question uh um this country here is and and Gaza is in the middle of a war whether there's really a wind here for such negotiations thew correspondent Tanya there reporting from n in Israel thank you very much Tanya not just in Paris have people been demonstrating in support of Palestinians and indeed of Israel all of these demonstrations are leading uh some European governments to worry about an increas in anti-Semitism on Wednesday authorities here in Berlin banned a pro Palestinian Dem demonstration following clashes earlier in the week protesters said they were acting on their rights to free speech here in a small District in southern Berlin Pro Palestinian demonstrators had planned to gather instead police were everywhere ban authorities banned the protest on the grounds they could potentially incite anti-semitic hate and violence an accusation rejected by the organizers yeah we wanted to demonstrate peacefully here in the heart of Berlin's Palestinian Community to express our solidarity with the people of hza who are under an unprecedent unprecedented bombardment right now we wanted to reaffirm our continuing solidarity with Palestine in the face of the Israeli occupation that is at the root of this conflict berin has stepped up police presence over concerns the events in Israel and Gaza could fuel already existing tensions on Saturday police clashed with around 50 people who had gathered for a pro Palestinian demonstration in the same neighborhood authorities accused demonstrators of chanting anti-israel slogans a few hours earlier a group called Samy Dune had handed out pastries in the streets to celebrate what they called the victory of the resistance we have a very heated atmosphere right now Germany and Berlin in particular have made it very clear that they recognize Israel's right to exist and do not question it but we have people in our city who see things differently accordingly the police have to prepare for such situations despite the ban some people still came out on Wednesday to show their solidarity and to highlight the plight of the Palestinians that's not just the people of Gaza it'ses we all condone violence we're all not because we're pro Palestine with Hamas it's not what we're saying we want to have the freedom of speech and be able to send our solidarity to people who cannot speak for themselves like why are the resources how is it that Israel can turn off the access to resources for watch for electricity in Gaza how is that possible because they already control it because it is an open air prison people we need to be able to make sense of how that is wrong how why why are we being silenced while these kids live constantly day and day out with bombings many argue their right to free assembly is being infringed but police say they don't want to risk violence spreading and are enforcing the law well the first evacuation flight of German Nationals from Israel landed at Frankfurt airport yesterday Germany's been working with Loft hanser to organize repatriation flights for its citizens 950 so far reunited with family back SA on German [Music] soil we are so happy so relieved that everything worked out the relief the burden that fell away when we took off and the plane turned and we were over the sea Lanza was so great they were really thoughtful the pilot said several times it was an honor to fly us but unfortunately there were also empty seats in our plane hundreds are home but thousands of Germans remained stranded in Israel waiting for their chance to return the last few days were exhausting especially when we were waking up to Sirens it was so stressful but thank God we're home that's great now of course I'm so happy there are 12 people in our group and we're all here all healthy Thank God now let's go home well happy to be back returnes couldn't help but think of those they left behind it's a hard decision because I have friends who are there now or who are part of the conflict one of my best friends hasn't written for three days and would be part of the ground offensive in Gaza if it happens in the next few days I'm going to looking through the list of the fallen and just hoping and praying that my friends are not there more special flights from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt and Munich are set to continue on
