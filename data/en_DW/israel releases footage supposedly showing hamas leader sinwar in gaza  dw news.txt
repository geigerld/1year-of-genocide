the Israeli military has released footage it says shows Hamas leader yaka sinoa walking through a tunnel in Gaza the video allegedly shows sinoa with his wife children and his brother Israel has accused sinoa of organizing hamas's Terror attacks on October 7th Army spokesman Daniel hagari said the footage was captured on a Hamas CCTV camera 3 days after the attack and obtained by the IDF the is Defense Forces in the past few days this video well let's bring in our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca ritters here Rebecca tell us more about this video why was it released now well that's uh definitely a question worth asking Terry this video as you just said was uh allegedly obtained in the last few days by the IDF they decided to release it yesterday or late yesterday they say that it it was taken on the 10 of October and purports to show uh Hamas leader Yaya sinoa with some family members walking through that tunnel it's very short as I'm sure you've uh seen the audience has just seen it there uh of course there is no way they didn't offer any evidence to support their claims there's no way of verifying the video they say that they used among other things AI to determine that it is definitely Yaya sinoa as I said we're not able to independently verify that information uh as to the timing of its release uh that's uh hard to know obviously I can't say definitively but given the negotiations and the pressure that is amounting to try to get the release of the hostages secured this could be a reason for Israel to release such a video at this time because they have also said that they are getting closer they said that they also reached another tunnel uh in the last days that showed signs that sin sinoa had been there recently they said that they're closing in on him and that they won't stop until they get him so the video release could be of course pressure to try to get Hamas to agree to some kind of Hostage deal remind us Rebecca who Yahya sinoa is exactly well he's the deao leader of Hamas in Gaza he the the Israel the Israelis certainly consider him a mastermind behind the October 7 attack though evidence shows that it's likely that there were more than one person involved in the organization of that but he's certainly a key figure uh that that Israel have been saying from the very beginning that they are going after now uh he was elected as the leader in in 2017 he um he spent a long time in Israeli prisons he was arrested in 1989 and spent um you know till 2011 when he was released in a hostage uh another hostage exchange for a soldier that was in uh in captivity they released him in that in 2011 and then he has slowly built up his position within Hamas in Gaza he's been called The Butcher of Han yunas it is uh known very well known that hunas is his base and and is Israel saying that that's where they believe that you know Hamas have a lot of its stronghold they've been you know as we know spending a lot of paying a lot of attention on that region in Gaza um you know they they they want to go after him he's a a key figure head and very symbolic in their hunt to dismantle Hamas and he's even been called by media and by others as Israel's Osama Bin Laden so that kind of gives you an idea of why Israel is so Keen to find him and so Keen to to to make uh you know a statement by capturing him Rebecca thank you very much that was our correspondent Rebeca ritters in
