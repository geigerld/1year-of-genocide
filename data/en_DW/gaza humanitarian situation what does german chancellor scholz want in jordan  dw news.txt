more countries are joining the emergency airlift to Gaza Germany has flown an aircraft over the northern part of the strip dropping aid from above a military transporter flew from Jordan parachuting pallets of humanitarian supplies including rice and flour donor nations are increasingly turning to the air and sea as Israel continues to limit Road access to the strip the United Nations warns that a third of children under the age of two are suffering from malnutrition in Northern Gaza and Cyprus has also just said that a second ship could be on its way as soon as today well to talk more about the aid effort Julia sadeli is here with us um tell us more about these efforts and whether or not they're going to make a difference yeah so this was uh the first much awaited airdrop coming from Germany they said they'd take part in this Mission and today was the first time and these are aircraft that are being stationed in Jordan and are flying over to the Gaza Strip and and and dropping the aid but I I think the German government is very much aware that this is just a drop in the ocean this is not uh the ideal way they actually want Aid to be coming into Gaza and can have a listen to what the German chancellor has said today about this e visten as you know Germany has long provided aid for Gaza with our own financial aid for humanitarian assistance now we are directly delivering Aid via airdrops this isn't the best solution that would be reopening border crossings and letting more trucks across yeah so as we've heard it would be much preferable for Germany to actually have uh more Crossings border crossings opened via land Germany think this is the best way to actually get Aid into into Gaza uh and we've um we've heard that you know they've been calling for this for months Germany has said more Aid has to get into Gaza they've called on the Israeli government to do more in this direction and if we look at the bigger context Germany is one of the biggest uh aid providers uh to Gaza to contribute it a lot to the un uh relief organization for Palestinian refugees it is Big contributor to other un agencies Germany has increased its Aid uh to Gaza since the October 7 attacks but what we've seen for example since um the U unra has come under uh some allegations Germany has stopped its Aid uh deliveries and its contributions to unan this has also restricted how Germany can try to get Aid into the strip now the German Chancellor is heading to Jordan uh for talks what what's he aiming to achieve there yeah he's going to Jordan and then also going to Israel but the German government has been uh in close contact with a lot of Partners in the region because it wants to bring them on board and sort of have uh one kind of uh common approach to to the crisis there uh it has been spare headed by an abok the foreign minister who has traveled to the region uh quite a lot and on the one hand it is the issue of humanitarian Aid they want to push for more to get in for example there has been a concrete proposal coming from Germany for Israel to allow the port of ashod to uh take in Aid to then be delivered to Gaza but one other issue is that uh Germany and Schulz has said he wants to push for a humanitarian pause in the strip uh to allow more humanitarian Aid to come in but also to possibly release the Israeli hostages that are being held by Hamas in the strip but he also wants to have a broader conversation about the future of the region and wants to push the two-state solution which is what Germany thinks is the only way forward for a lasting peace in the region but so far we haven't really seen much of progress Julia it's unfortunate but thank you for bringing us up to date on all those
