at least seven Palestinians have been killed in a coordinated series of raids and Strikes carried out by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank that according to the red crescent the Israeli Army says the operations carried out in four cities were designed to quote thwart terrorism in Janine and tarm in the northern West Bank let's get the latest on this from DW's Felix TSA joining us live from Jerusalem uh tell us more about what we can say so far about these Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank well as you said the Israeli Army says uh it's uh active in the northern part of the West Bank to uh quote thwart uh terrorist activities um at the same time it's been active in the West Bank for quite a while virtually since the 7th of October um saying that there's a rise in Terrorist activity um several Palestinians have been killed um and uh this operation um seem will will go on in the uh in the coming days um and uh it remains to be seen uh what sort of scale the Israel army plans for this sort of operation um and as you said it's also significant due to the fact that it combines Air Raids and um and foots on the ground which hasn't been the case uh I would say before or the 7th of October so it remain remains to be seen how the situation develops as you say we have seen operations of this kind since October 7th what do you think is behind the timing of what we've seen overnight well the while there is there aren't any indications from the Israeli Army about the particular timing um the Israeli authorities have been reporting a rise in activities among uh um among militant groups uh in general uh not only in the West Bank but also in the best bank um also due to the tensions withb and Iran um and uh it remains to be seen how large this operation will become in the coming days um so that um given the tensions that remain and the uh negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza Felix stay with us for just a moment I'd like to ask you about some other news uh Israel's military has freed a hostage who has been held in the Gaza Strip by Hamas since last October Ked Farhan aladi he was found alone in a tunnel in southern Gaza Hamas of course thought to still be holding around 110 hostages and about a third of those believed to be dead aladi is the first hostage to be rescued alive underground let's take a look free after 326 days in captivity the Israeli military released this footage of soldiers bringing Ked fahan aladi back to Israel his first stop a hospital in the southern city of biva for a checkup doctors say he's in reasonably good health considering the circumstances he arrived at our emergency department is has underwent initial medical evaluation appears to be in good condition but anyone who was in Tunnels for such an extended period of time is prone to significant medical problems aladi was working as a security guard on the border with Gaza when he was abducted by Hamas during the October 7 attacks the militant group captured some 250 people in total aladi was one of eight members of Israel's bedan Arab minority that were taken his family were waiting at the hospital when he arrived his brother overcome with joy we are happy all the world is happy every W thank God who brought us good news today after almost 11 months in a way we could not imagine or dream [Music] of meanwhile since October 7th the situation in the Gaza Strip has become more and more dire by the day the UN says there's a severe food shortage and has highlighted the risk of a polio outbreak and the number of Civilian dead in Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas continues to grow the territory's Hamas run Health Ministry says well over 40,000 people have now been killed by Israel's offensive a number that combines militant and civilian deaths the ministry says on Tuesday alone Israeli air strikes killed at least 18 people across the strip eight of them children let's get back across to DW's Felix tempit in Jerusalem Felix how are families of other hostages reacting to this news well there's certainly a sense of joy and happiness here in Israel not only when it comes to hostage families but generally uh in the general population uh the uh headquarters of the hostage families have released a statement saying uh that while they're very happy to hear that a hostage has been freed um that this cannot be uh uh this cannot be applied to the other 108 hostages currently uh still being held in Gaza and that a hostage deal is still the best way to go in terms of bringing them home um the negotiations are taking place uh but at the same time it seems like uh the the the negotiations for C fire and a hostage deal uh are not likely uh to uh provide a breakthrough anytime soon uh mostly due to the issue of the so-called Philadelphia Corridor and the U the Border area between the Gaza strep and Egypt uh which Israel refuses to give up on in terms of uh Soldier presence uh so it remains to be seen how this develops in the coming days and we will of course have coverage for you of those developments in the days ahead thank you so much that is DW's Felix temper in Jerusalem
