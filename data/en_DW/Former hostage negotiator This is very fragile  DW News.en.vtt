00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.509 align:start position:0%
 
there<00:02:55.480><c> well</c><00:02:55.840><c> basically</c><00:02:56.280><c> as</c><00:02:56.360><c> I</c><00:02:56.480><c> said</c><00:02:56.680><c> the</c><00:02:56.879><c> idea</c>

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
there well basically as I said the idea
 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.750 align:start position:0%
there well basically as I said the idea
is<00:02:57.800><c> that</c><00:02:58.000><c> it</c><00:02:58.159><c> would</c><00:02:58.319><c> be</c><00:02:58.480><c> done</c><00:02:58.800><c> in</c><00:02:59.040><c> batches</c><00:02:59.560><c> so</c>

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
is that it would be done in batches so
 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.550 align:start position:0%
is that it would be done in batches so
so<00:03:00.400><c> uh</c><00:03:00.519><c> not</c><00:03:00.760><c> all</c><00:03:01.000><c> 50</c><00:03:01.519><c> all</c><00:03:01.720><c> at</c><00:03:01.920><c> the</c><00:03:02.040><c> one</c><00:03:02.280><c> time</c>

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
so uh not all 50 all at the one time
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
so uh not all 50 all at the one time
that<00:03:02.680><c> was</c><00:03:02.879><c> never</c><00:03:03.640><c> uh</c><00:03:03.840><c> agreed</c><00:03:04.239><c> upon</c><00:03:05.000><c> uh</c><00:03:05.159><c> what</c>
