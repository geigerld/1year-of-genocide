Syrian officials say an Israeli air strike has destroyed part of Iran's diplomatic compound in Damascus Iran's revolutionary guard says one of its senior commanders was killed along with several officers in the suspected Israeli air strike a foreign Ministry spokesperson in tan says it's considering a response and punishment for the attack this is what's left of the Iranian Consulate in Damascus officials say an Israeli air strike on the building killed several people including members of Iran's Islamic revolutionary guard we strongly condemn this criminal act carried out by the Zionist enemy which led to the death of some innocent citizens who were passing by the street so again we emphasize our position besides our brothers in the Iranian Embassy and the Islamic Republic of and we can assure that Syria and the Islamic Republic don't forget their enemies among the dead is Brigadier General Muhammad razar zahi he was a top commander in the elite KS Force the foreign operations arm of the Islamic revolutionary guard the Israeli military hasn't commented on the attack though Israel has been increasing its operations against Iran linked forces in Syria since the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks Iran says it reserves the right to retaliate we told you before the Zionist entity knows very well that such crimes and any kind of crimes will not remain without response as Rescuers comb through the rubble for survivors or bodies concerns over a rapid escalation of violence in the region arising let's bring in Roger Shanahan here he's a Middle East analyst and Military expert based in Sydney thanks for joining us Roger tell us Israel has allegedly struck the Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria from a military point of view why would Israel choose to do that now well you would imagine that um given the seniority of the um military personel that they were uh targeting that it uh presented an opportunity where they had very solid intelligence um it was of limited uh time value so they um elected to um kill those um iig personnel and had the uh opportunity so it was a target of opportunity obviously uh informed by uh quite good intelligence but it fits into the broader pattern uh of Israel trying to Target um uh IR Iran and Iranian supported elements uh in its region now several high-ranking members of Iran's revolutionary guard Corps are said to been killed in that attack what do we know about them yes from what we know uh is that the um uh IC uh Commander for um pro-iranian forces we're largely talking about Hezbollah here in Syria and Lebanon was killed uh including uh along with his Deputy so we're talking about a significant um uh capability loss in uh those people um that's going to set back uh Iranian operations in the region somewhat everybody can always be replaced uh obviously but given the seniority of the people uh that were killed in one Fell Swoop it shows as we said before that uh Israeli intelligence was uh quite solid on this occasion now Iranian president Ibrahim RI has just said today that Israel's attack on Iran's Consulate in Syria will not go unanswered what might Tran's answer look like yeah listen this is a very good question and it's uh one that uh I think uh analysts and governments uh also grapple with there's the two questions these are uh senior uh IC officers so uh their value to Iran is significant that kind of attack uh really can't go unanswered if you want to maintain some degree of uh deterrence on the Iranian side and so you'd be looking uh regionally uh to strike Israel directly if that's possible so you're probably looking at pro-iranian groups in Syria or Iraq or Hezbollah in Lebanon but there's only really a a Lim to what they can do then you're looking at uh International uh targets that represent Israel in some way shape or form that having been said uh Iran has in the past uh threatened retaliation uh but their options uh are relatively limited because they want to make they want to ensure that the situation doesn't go out of their own control so it's a difficult um issue about how Iran is going to respond rer thank you very much for talking with us today that was Roger Shanahan Middle East analyst and Military expert in Sydney Middle East expert Arash aizi joins us from Clemson University South Carolina Israel reportedly attacking an Iranian Consulate in Syria does that surprise you it's not so much surprising but it is an act of um you know in some ways is unprecedented uh Israel is really oping the anti it has changed the usual rules of of Engagement you see Israel and Iran have been in something of a shadow of VAR now for a very long time uh for more than a decade um but part of the rules uh was that you know you don't do uh actions like this certainly attacking a Iranian consulate which is considered internationally Iranian territory is is somewhat unprecedented although Israel has also of course done many operations on Iranian soil uh but also it killed a a rather high ranking irgc official zahi was very important in many ways in charge of uh the operations of the irgc in Syria and Lebanon but it's not entirely unprecedented as in the last few months Israel has also uh sort of killed other officials that are not quite at this level but not so far from it either but at any rate it's definitely a a a dangerous Act of escalation I if it was Israel what has it gained by killing this top Commander Israel has a program of killing um top irgc officials what it has gained is that it uh undermines the abilities of the irgc to support its allies in the regions that's you know the irgc is the militia that underg guards the power of the Iranian regime uh it has a key role in supplying Hezbollah in Lebanon um and and also the some of the Palestinian forces at times although really in this case is mostly Hezbollah and and other militias Iraqi militias and and the rest that operate on Iran on Syrian territory um now about what it has gained also I mean it it uh it's clearly is showing that if Iran is not able to respond to this it shows that uh it's not it doesn't have any deterrence Iran doesn't have any deterrence against Israel um and from the initial responses if you look at if you look at what the foreign minister is saying and what the foreign minister spokesperson is saying it might appear that Iran will do some sort of retaliation I think against a us uh for somewhere in the region there are tons of US forces in the region they might do some sort of a retaliation retaliatory attack perhaps one that wouldn't even lead to US soldiers um getting killed as this is another rule of Engagement that Iran has usually tried to observe um um but there are a lot of push on Iran of course amongst the supporters of the regime in Iran and amongst the supporters in the region for a higher uh for a more direct retaliation against Israel um and this is this really puts us all in a dangerous situation and the chances of a broader conflict which is something that Iran has tried to avoid the United States has tried to avoid um you know and it's something that many is in Israel would also like to avoid becomes more real by the minute when we see acts like this where do you think this will lead though um it's not uh you know as to what it could immediately happen my best guess would be that Iran would try to do a limited retaliation uh um so that uh it wouldn't go to something broader because Iran can ill afford a broader conflict in the region its forces are not ready um it also uh is trying to avoid a confrontation and the you know a broader confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah a repeat if you will of the 2006 War although such a war if Israel continues on this track it today it also bombed Southern Lebanon um today might you know it might become um inevitable it's also good to point out the role of Russia Russia of course condemned this attack but of course if it truly wanted to condemn it use his anti-aircraft forces to stop Israel and hasn't done that um and also the role of United States and whether the Biden Administration knew about this attack from beforehand and and how much did it know beforehand and whether it approved of the Netanyahu government with which Biden obviously has very open disagreements and um you know you can say it's almost fed up with some of its actions and these are also some of the other questions that uh will you know will determine what happens next we should also remember that the US and Iran are semi secretly talking in Oman between each other of course we don't know the content of those talks but that calming things down are are their main goal interesting analysis there from arish aizi thank
