and we start with some breaking news Israeli troops have entered gaza's NASA Hospital in the city of Khan Yunis to search for the remains of hostages who were seized by Hamas reports indicate one patient has been killed and six others injured so far mobile phone footage appears to show The Raid underway Israel's military says they have quote credible intelligence that Hamas which is recognized as a terror group by several countries had been holding hostages in the complex at some point the ra comes a day after the Army forced thousands of displaced Palestinians who had been Sheltering in the hospital to evacuate about to enter and let's go straight to our correspondent Amia who joins us from Jerusalem Amia what do we what more do we know about the situation in the hospital there well the Israel Defense Forces claim that they're conducting a precise raid using Special Forces on this hospital they claim that they've uh given a warning to the people in the hospital to evacuate although they have not evacuated the people themselves there's a big difference there in terms of security uh many of the patients have stayed for fear of being shot while leaving the hospital at least one patient has died in the raid so far according to reports uh Hamas as well as the hospital staff also say that the Israel Defense Forces shot uh into areas where thousands of civilians are Sheltering now this hospital is not being used only as a hospital but also a shelter for many civilians who have come from other areas in Gaza so at Le at least one person killed in the raid now what's interesting here is that the IDF and press statements said that they were looking to retrieve the bodies of hostages uh what they're talking about here is those hostages that have already been killed by Hamas so they're not talking about retrieving uh living hostages but the bodies of hostages so that's the situation at the hospital at this moment so civilians of course very much in Focus as you said Israel is now focusing on the very south of Gaza uh what are its goals there well it stated goals are to sweep the area for Hamas Fighters this has been the goal since the October 7th terrorist attack carried out by Hamas uh to basically destroy the organization itself uh now they've been doing this in the north of Gaza for months now the concentration now is on the south of Gaza hanun where this hospital is has largely been evacuated by civilians and they have been pushed up against the Egyptian Border in the town of Rafa where Israel is threatening to conduct a ground Invasion despite the warnings of its closest allies including Germany and the US they say that their ground invasion is imminent that they are going to give uh civilians a chance to leave that area before it begins but that they're going forward with that plan now Palestinians on the other hand claim that the uh aims of the Israel Defense Forces are more Sinister that they're not just looking for Hamas Fighters but they're looking to exact revenge on the population of Gaza for the Hamas terrorist attacks and some even claim and this has been echoed by far right in Israel uh that they are intending to push uh Palestinians up against the border and even into the Sinai desert in Egypt largely pushing them out of the area claimed by Israel itself uh so both sides uh having different opinions about what the uh the aims of the Israel Defense Forces um are here in this fight for southern Gaza but it's certainly the case that there's a humanitarian disaster unfolding in that area there the Ws am thank you very much
