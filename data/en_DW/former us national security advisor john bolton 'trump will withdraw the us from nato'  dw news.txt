my first guest tonight can speak with authority about the presidency of Donald Trump in his book the room where it happened John Bolton offers a detailed account of his 17 months as president Trump's National Security advisor in 2018 and 19 before that he was US ambassador to the United Nations under George W book Bush John Bolton welcome to the day now we appear to be heading towards a presidential election rematch between uh Trump and Joe Biden in the forwards of the new paperback edition of your book the room where it happened you say Donald Trump is unfit to be president why well he's not competent to handle the job he didn't know much about it when he came into office in 2017 and he didn't know very much more when he left in 2021 certainly in the National Security space he didn't have a guiding philosophy he didn't do policy making as we normally understand that term he didn't appreciate the gravity of the issues that confronted him uh and he doesn't have any really better idea today so at a time of increasing International difficulties to say the least uh he he is exactly the wrong person to uh become president of the United States so is that an argument for another Biden presidency no not at all I don't think Biden is fit to be president either although for somewhat different reasons uh and it's very unfortunate that the country uh is facing this choice you know we have polls that now show uh up to 80% or more of Americans do not want to see a Biden Trump rematch and that as of now is looks exactly like what we're going to get so Trump unfit because of incompetence Biden unfit because well I don't think his policies are are the right policies and I think the Democrats are whistling past the graveyard quite literally to nominate uh to nominate him if he had stepped aside I think the Democrats would have had a very active primary race for their nomination and that actually might have helped us on the Republican side dislodge Donald Trump of a second Trump presidency you've written if his first four years were bad the second for will be worse Trump really cares only about retribution for himself and it will consume much of a second term so John Bolton who are the likely targets of Donald Trump's retribution and what's payback likely to look like well I think given that Trump's view of the presidency is a series of decisions about what benefits Donald Trump politically primarily but maybe economically as well he he will look at the people who stood in his way his political opponents and in uh his world the constitutional constraints that we have the protections for uh dissent uh really uh are not things that concern him so he's indicated for example he thinks Mark millee the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff uh committed treason uh for talking to his Chinese counterpart uh in 2020 to say that whatever you see on television it's just a political there's no change in the US uh uh military or diplomatic retin status uh Trump always used to say when I was National Security advisor he wanted to prosecute former Secretary of State John KY for violating what we call the Logan act which is an old statute about not conducting a private foreign policy U and he tried to repress my book that that you just mentioned from being published because he didn't like it saying critical things about him and his conduct in office so there are a wide range of potential targets and I'm sure Trump will be eager to get at it all right well that's still something that that may or may not happen let's look at something that that's happening at the moment the the the conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and the White House has been pressing Israel not to launch a ground offensive in Rafa uh where something like a million civilians are Sheltering with nowhere to go um what is your take on whether or not Israel should do this well I think they're going to go ahead I mean when the people talk about a ground defensive you make it sound like the Battle of the Bulge or something when in fact most of the combat in Gaza right now is being conducted in this incredible system of tunnels that Hamas dug underneath what seems to be most of the Gaza Strip how many tens of millions of dollars they spent on that rather than the economic betterment of the Gaz and residents is an interesting question but they're H up down there and they're trying to last the Israelis out so I think that the Israelis obviously have an obligation to take due concern for civilian life but they're also free to to uh rid themselves of the threat of Hamas terrorism right so so in any white house uh in which you may or may not serve yours would not be one of the voices uh uh cautioning uh Israel uh to U be uh to to take more care or to or to not to go into Gaza well I think they did what they were entitled to do the right of self-defense means you don't uh respond merely by killing the number of people that uh Hamas killed on October the 7th you're entitled to eliminate the threat in World War II the United States eliminated Japanese and German threats which we were entitled to do in our own self-defense and as part of this elimination of threat as you put it um Israel has killed something like 30,000 civilians again the White House has criticized Israel for going too far in its response to the October 7 Terror attacks at the White House most countries in Europe and indeed most of the global South um what do you think has Israel gone too far well I th those are Hamas figures and it raises the question even if 30,000 is the right number H how many do you consider Hamas terrorist and how many do you consider civilians you know most most terrorists don't go around in un uniforms uh and and you can you can Aid in a beted terrorist activity in in a lot of different ways uh so I I think it's uh it's there's a propaganda war going on here I think Kamas is beating Israel in the propaganda War but I'm not sure that's a reflection of reality so just so we're clear uh you don't believe that Israel has gone too far in its reaction no I mean if if you believe in the right to self-defense you have to believe that it's permissible to eliminate a terrorist threat nobody should have to live with a terrorist threat on their border and that's what the Israelis are doing returning to um Donald Trump because one of the the the big issues um regardless of who is next in the White House is is the future of NATO and a lot of European leaders have been much exercised by Mr Trump's recent statement that he would encourage Russia to do whatever the hell they want to any NATO country that doesn't meet the the 2% guidelines on defense spending um was this Bluster do you think no I think in a second term Trump will withdraw the United States from NATO I describ in my book uh the scene at the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels where he came within an inch of actually doing it then uh so I think it's very likely he will withdraw in a second term I think that's a catastrophic mistake uh for the United States and and the West as a whole but uh he has been able to beat the drum very effectively on the number of European countries that haven't lived up to the commitment they made voluntarily in 2014 to spend 2% of GDP on defense uh uh Trump is very transactional he thinks in dollars and cents terms he doesn't have a strategic Vision uh and uh and many Europeans and I'll be honest Canada have played right into his hands he's he's not urging people to spend more because he wants to strengthen NATO he doesn't expect ultimately that that most of these members will make it to 2% and that will be the basis on which he withdraws the United States from the alliance right so that so lacking a defense strategy this is entirely this and I appreciate we're speculating this would be entirely transactional this would not be as part of some uh bigger strategy this would be just because you haven't paid your money therefore we are leaving well that and he doesn't like the trade deals that exist between the European Union and the United states he never liked the fact that Europe was buying natural gas from Russia over the nordstream pipeline which I I think was an entirely valid point Ronald Reagan warned Europe warned Europe in the 1980s do not become dependent on Russian oil and natural gas good talking to you you've given us much to think about former US National Security advisor uh Ambassador John Bolton thank you thank
