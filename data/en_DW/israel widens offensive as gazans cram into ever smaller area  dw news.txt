South Africa has filed a case against Israel at the international court of justice saying the actions of the Israeli Armed Forces against Palestinians in Gaza have a quote genocidal character it's also calling on the court to order Israel to stop its attacks the international court of justice in the ha is the United Nations highest court its decisions are binding but it has little means to enforce them Israel has rejected the filing citing that it lacked both a factual and legal basis Israel is widening its air and ground offensive against Hamas which is classified as a terror organization by many countries now the Israeli military is claiming to have destroyed a newly discovered Hamas Hideout Israeli troops attacking a southern Gaza base from where Hamas militants presumably set out to invade Israel on October 7th this footage from Israel's military shows an ongoing operation to gain control of the site now Israel is expanding its operations in the area around the southern city of cunes where it believes Hamas leaders are hiding it says it has destroyed several Hamas tunnels all over the Gaza Strip This latest one in the north we found a very significant Hamas tunnel Network that's used by senior officials it's very deep deeper than the previous ones this tunnel is different it has an elevator that goes down a very long tunnel shaft the fighting has led to one of the worst humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip this family is saying goodbye to their loved ones the bodies of those killed by an Israeli air strike on the deer albala refugee camp in central Gaza are laid outside a hospital this mother has lost both of her twins we were sleeping in the room with two of my children my twins were in another room the house was bombed and the rebel fell on the twins on their birthday parts of dear alala were flattened children search for Bel belongings in the place that many once called home according to estimates by the United Nations the latest strikes have prompted another 100,000 people to abandon their houses leaving everything behind so far 85% of gaza's population has been displaced by the conflict let's bring in DW correspondent T clma in Jerusalem Tanya Israel's military is extending its offensive further south uh do we know are they getting any closer to their goal of tracking down Hamas leaders well the Israeli Army says uh almost also in their daily updates that they are systematically destroying uh um uh Hamas INF structure and that of other militant groups as well uh command centers as they put it uh they released a footage uh last night of what they described as a hideout of Hamas leader Yahya sinir near or in a city uh a network of underground tunnels as a hideout apartment they described with several rooms but they haven't been uh getting any closer to find uh the uh Hamas leader which is one of the goals they have said uh they want to remove uh Hamas from power and this has devastating consequences of course for the civilian population now the ground operation and offensive is concentrating further south also of course their air strike across the Gaza Strip but now also on gaza's second largest city Khan Unis also in the center the AL balarat refugee camp where thousands hundred of thousands of Palestinian civilians have been uh told to go and uh seek a shelter people have been displaced now multiple times according to the United Nations over 80% that's an estimate of the population has been uh displaced um uh in this in this campaign so far da South Africa has filed a case against Israel at the international court of justice Israel has rejected the move but how long can Israel ignore the growing International pressure over its offensive and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza well so far it doesn't seem that uh this International pressure has had um any major impact on uh Israel's decision um you know we've heard multiple times from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also from defense minister yuf Galan that they continue uh uh this uh uh War uh on Hamas on Gaza um to remove Hamas from power to um destroy their infrastructure uh also now that South Africa has launched its case and at the international court of justice uh Israel's foreign spokesperson by Israel's foreign minister Ministry uh basically responded to the allegations a quote with disgust uh to the blood liel as he puts it so uh you know we are seeing basically that the uh ground offensive has been uh in the past weeks uh expanded now further uh South putting more pressure also on the southern parts of Gaza we've heard from the US Israel's closest Ally to uh you know that it should go into a more in less intensive phase but so far uh this had didn't have have any impact here on the ground Tanya CLA in Jerusalem thank you what for more we can talk to Shan Casey he's the World Health organization's emergency medical team coordinator joining us from Rafa in southern Gaza Shan good to see you uh difficult scenario but what have your teams been able to achieve after these latest Israeli strikes thanks for having me yeah what we're seeing is a significant increase in hostilities in the middle area and in the south in funus as your report just highlighted um and that's causing a couple of things to happen one is that the hospitals in the middle area and in this South are seeing a significant increase in trauma presentations um and and other partners have have tried to resupply those hospitals and support some of those hospitals with surge Personnel we've had several emergency Medicals arrive just in the past few days to to work in in several of the hospitals that are receiving these casualties but at the same time we're seeing a huge number of displaced persons moving south so every day for the last few days we've seen more and more people truckloads bus loads of people uh with mattresses and all their belongings moving south towards Rafa yeah much of gaza's North has been destroyed and and fighting is now focusing on the central and southern Parts as you allude to there are about 100,000 newly displaced people uh how are you dealing with the increasing numbers now of refugees ding in Rafa well actually almost everybody in in Gaza is displaced it's now around 90% of the population uh that has been displaced and and many of them not for the first time so they've been displaced from the north to the middle area from the middle area to the South uh it's causing a huge amount of pressure here in Rafa where I am there are internally displaced persons camps spontaneous uh camps that have been set up uh on sidewalks on Open Fields in almost any open space and it presents a huge number of challenges actually there it's it's hard to even move around Rafa because the streets are so full of people but it creates a huge risk for the spread of infectious disease we don't have enough food Water Sanitation facilities for all of these people and many of them are sleeping in very poor conditions under under shelters that they set up you know hours before nightfall even even I saw just two days ago people setting up a tent as the sun was setting and they had just fled hours before so very difficult conditions for the people here and and creating many challenges for us as the humanitarian Community to to continue to respond Sean we've talked often about the situation getting progressively worse for civilians in Gaza you've just laid that out for us how much worse can it get from this point well we are continuously um surprised and not in a good way about the how it's it's deteriorating here um about the number of casualties that we continue to see the pressure on hospitals the number of hospitals that have lost functionality the food insecurity with you know almost every family uh in Gaza now reducing their their food intake skipping meals um and now dis displacement at an enormous scale uh with more and more people being pushed into a very small area here in the South that creates very poor living conditions so it continues to to shock us the conditions that people are in are shocking um it's uh it's pushing people to really lose their dignity um to lose their safety to lose their sense of security um and Beyond the physical concerns it's causing a huge amount of emotional distress on the people of Gaza and children who are just suffering enormously and you see them just standing in the street not knowing what to do so it's it's a it's a horrible situation and it seems to be getting worse by the day Sean Casey from the World Health Organization thank you so much for your
