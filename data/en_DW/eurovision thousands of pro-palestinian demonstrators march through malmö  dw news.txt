to the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo Sweden now at the second semi-final on Thursday evening Israel's entry Eden Golan secured a place in Saturday's finale earlier in the day thousands of pro Palestinian demonstrators marched through Malmo to protest against Israel's inclusion in the contest this year welcome to the second semifinal of the Eurovision song contest [Applause] 2024 the finalists for this year's Eurovision contest have officially been decided fan favorite Switzerland powered their way through to the final round their close competitors the Netherlands stunned with a wild yet emotional roller coaster hold me again but it was Israel's qualifying performance that caused the biggest stir much of it off stage Eurovision organizers have faced calls to block Israel from participating over the war in Gaza more than 10,000 Pro Palestinian protesters marched through the streets of Malmo to protest Israel's inclusion in the show and what we would like to see is that they uh disqualify Israel like they did with Russia uh when the Russ invaded Ukraine that's it's not true that the Eurovision is not political it has always been political those who approached the arena where performances were taking place were met with a heavy police presence in another part of the city pro-israeli demonstrators also gathered to support their performers we thought it was important to get together and celebrate celebrate music celebrate the happiness instead of the hate security is tight ahead of more protests planned for Saturday when the 26 qualifying Nations will go head-to-head in the Eurovision finals right let's get more on this from DW reporter David Levitz David good to see you good morning hey so this year's euro vision has been particularly political hasn't it people protesting on the streets and people boycotting because of Israel's participation how much of that was palpable at the show well at the second semi-final last night almost none of it if you were just watching it on TV like millions of people or on a you know a laptop screen you really would have no idea that this wasn't a normal Eurovision this year um however earlier at a rehearsal that was not broadcast Aiden Golan the Israeli singer did get booed apparently by members of that audience but that wasn't broadcast as I said and a lot of this appearance of normaly comes down to the organizers the European broadcasting Union really making a concerted effort to not have protests on the screen um and some of that is that they're checking bags of audience members to make sure that they don't sneak in Palestinian Flags to wave in the audience um or any other flag of of Nations that aren't competing um but what they can't control is uh the other performers and actually earlier in the week there were some protests or attempt at protest by other performers the Irish entry had at the first semifinal some political messages including ceasefire removed from their costume the uh the Swedish entry who's half Palestinian himself or at least part Palestinian uh snuck in a kfia Palestinian flag sorry Palestinian scarf under his sleeve um and that's that's raised some controversy P people saying that that's potentially a political statement um and of course the Eurovision song contest is supposed to be not political now despite all these Pro protests and all the calls to ban Israel's participation euro vision has decided the against it what is behind that decision well it comes down to eurovision's claim of being non-political um it's supposed to be an event that promotes peace and understanding and at least that's why it was started after World War II to bring these countries together obviously though there isn't peace on Earth um and Eurovision has to to figure out what to do about that euro vision did kick out Russia andus in 2022 after Russia's fullscale Invasion um of Ukraine so the protesters are saying you know why not kick out Israel based on what it's doing in Gaza and the official answer to that from the organizers is is pretty Technical and it's pretty dry they say that it's it's not the Nations themselves it's not the governments competing but it's actually the public broadcasters that are part of this European broadcasting Union even Israel is part of it uh many countries are um that are competing and that while they had problems with public broadcasters in Russia and bellarus not following the rules um not guaranteeing freedom of press that they don't have those problems with the Israeli broadcasters so that's a very dry technical answer that's not satisfying a lot of the protesters now when it comes to the song the Israeli entry uh the Ebu did take measures there because the original lyrics were very much specifically about hamas's terror attack on October the 7th and they determined that that was too political so they they actually made the singer Aden Golan change her lyrics to be able to participate so Israel is certainly the country getting the most attention but who else are people going to be talking about at the Grand Finale this Saturday yeah I think um they're mostly going to be talking about Israel let's let's be honest here but there there are a few acts that are that are getting attention for the acts themselves one of them is Switzerland a rapper named Neo I think we've got some some pictures um of Neo who identifies as nonbinary and it's it's believed that Neo could be the first nonbinary Eurovision song winner Eurovision is also known as the Gay Olympics um there have been trans winners there have been gender bending winners but there haven't been non-binary winers winners so that that could be a first something to watch out for David litz thanks so much for coming into the studio for that
