Berlin is home to many Israelis and Palestinians some of them have taken part in protest marches and rallies others are calling for peaceful coexistence these include the owners of a restaurant here in the German Capital an Israeli and a Palestinian who share a passion for food and friendship the Canan restaurant in Berlin strives to set an example of togetherness and peace this is our our belief this is our message this is our wish to create more and more spaces that people can realize how much we are similar how much we are shared with each other and that will be the ground to start communicate in different way bonded by a shared love of humus co-owners osben David and Jal davit opened on together 8 years ago they offer meat-free dishes from their individual cultures along with a shared goal understanding between Israelis and Palestinians our philosophy in Kus and in food sorry like people that you have to mix stuff together to get the really amazing stuff like everything by himself is very nice but the real magic happen is when you have a bite of a bit of everything but then came the Hamas terrorist attack against Israel like you know someone that is in pain and kicking his friend and his friend is hugging him that's what J did he was just standing there and he told me I get you I feel you you want to close for a few days let's close for a few days Jalil went back home to help out in his family's restaurant but he was always there to provide comfort was really disappointed was really like like really crushed and me too like I was crying like like a baby for a few days but I talked to all about this when Israel started bombing Gaza many marched in Berlin huge protests were tainted by anti-semitic racist and islamophobic sentiment Canan is now back open with a stronger flavor of defiance something in me felt like okay so this is how they win this is how the bad people win we start to get scared we shutting down ourself the good places the places where people can sit together and just handing them a winning reward exactly the opposite of what I want canan's famous hus and culture of understanding are now on the the menu again along with the hope for peace now German president Frank valter steinm has expressed deep concern over the security of Jewish life here in Germany he brought together representatives of Jewish and Palestinian organizations Palestinian Israeli entrepreneurs as well as the Holocaust Survivor am Margo of friedlander he condemned anti-jewish sentiment that has been on the rise since October 7th and said the protection of Jewish life was not just a reason of state but an obligation of everyone living in Germany anyone who lives in this country or wants to live he must respect the rules of peaceful coexistence they must be aware of our history I recently said it at the brandenbur gate and I will repeat it today those living in Germany must know of aitz concentration camp and extermination camp camp and the responsibility that arises from it protecting Jewish life in Germany is a state Duty and a Civic obligation this applies to everyone living in our country I'm convinced that we need to make that clearer than before me lip service will not be enough in this time of Terror and hatred our political correspondent Julia Deli listened to the address and joins us now from outside the presidential Palace welcome Julia um so talk us to the message that the president had yeah he uh started speaking with addressing uh the terrorist attack that Hamas conducted against Israel saying that this was a turning point uh for Israel itself but also for the region and the world and that there is no going back uh from this event and then he moved on to address some of the tensions that have been building up in Germany since uh the conflict between Israel and Hamas uh in the Middle East and he addressed the fact that on the one side there has been a strong increase in anti-semitic cases in Germany there have been attacks against synagogues there have been expressions of hate against Jews and this is something that he said Germany will never condone in any case whether the anti-Semitism is coming from the far right or whether it is coming from islamist uh corners and other parts of society and now president Stein Meer is hosting a round table with Jewish and Palestinian Representatives um what can we expect from those discussions well these are all people who come uh from the Jewish or Israeli community and from the Muslim and Arab communities and they are already involved in working in building a bridge between these communities and finding ways for a peaceful coexistence for living peacefully together for example we have uh two people an Israeli and a Palestinian who run a restaurant together here in Berlin or people who are involved for example a rabbi and an Imam who are involved in Social projects uh together and we expect the discussion to focus exactly on this how can these communities come together to overcome the tensions and uh be able to live peacefully in Germany thanks for that Julia our DW political correspondent Julia selli our middle EAS analyst shanie rosanes is still with us so welcome back shaie so President we heard president steinm say that he's concerned with violence uh in the Middle East which could threaten uh social peace here in Germany so that's a real danger oh yes definitely uh We've you know that this conflict is brings so much emotion so many people that are feeling that they have a stake in this is in this conflict because they're immigrants they're all coming from backgrounds that are connected somehow um to Palestine to the Arab world same goes with Israelis and Jews living in Germany and we've seen detention we we've felt it on the streets I think anybody could feel that you you talk about you see testimonies around Europe in the US this is spilling far beyond the specific region but I want to also hang on to one thing he said that he realizes um each side you know among the the people sitting in the table there are people sharing the suffering of the other side and we tend to forget that you know we live in a world that is so polarized social media is you know it's always so quick and so onesided uh but the truth is very complex and a lot of time exists in the middle between the people who are grieving and suffering for the loved ones either Jews or or Palestinians living in Israel but then at the same time see the other side and and what he's trying to accommodate here is is the the very existence of the suffering of acknowledging the other one's suffering as the key of you know keeping you know in line with humanity and therefore um keeping this discussion you know within the legitimate borders of it and not Beyond and um picking out uh uh Jewish and Palestinian um communities uh and addressing them directly what was the president's message well I think first of all we want to say you are being heard to both sides you are being seen uh but we also need to focus on the opportunities not just the pain not just the anger not just the grief but on the opportunities many of the people he introduced are are are couples that are working in in in coordination for a long time in order to facilitate Interfaith coexistent projects educational projects um you know communal projects that that try to show it is happening it can happen if we if we stay away from you know the rhetorics that is so toxic and and that is so polarizing let's hang on to to the hope because the tragic thing is that many of the people who find themselves far from the conflict choose to be there because they want different lives they want Alternatives they want to choose better um and when they're drawn back into the very flat discussion very populist discussion of either this or that um you know these are the tensions that we see Rising you know and everybody lose in the end and the German uh government and state authorities in in a difficult uh position as tensions increase and and we already see armed police outside Jewish institutions and despite that Jewish communities uh still saying they feel threatened yes because you know the you the fear it's not NE necessarily IR rational you know that there's the feeling is something has changed and that is something that Shin also acknowledges that something in SE October 7th have changed in the whole perception of Israel I mean the way Israel has seen itself for so many years is that the deterrence effect is such that it it serves as its biggest asset when it comes to defense but Jews around the world also have felt that isra strong Israel is some sort of a of a of a of a policy insurance policy for them knowing that there's always a place for them to to escape but knowing there's a there's a a sort of a a Lobby a strong a strong you know player on the international Arena that can support the causes for the Jews um around the world and what we've seen in last month is that the all these assumptions seem to have crumbled and you know now there a a game to redefine um what is it that still makes um you know that keeps this the the strength and and and force of Israel and of the Jews around the world who have seen it as its Beacon of of protection and so how does I mean how is the German government doing then in walking this line they walking this line uh between uh honoring its historic um uh responsibility uh for what happened uh to Jews uh in the past with its very modern responsibility to ensure uh free speech and debate well it's one one of that is what we've seeing now I mean those Public Announcement but but steinm is also very much afraid of just lip surfice and he says that we cannot just stick to you know nice statements that want to think that everything is fine I see how we are threatened how are very fundamental social existence here as a as a country that brings together immigrants from all over the world can be threatened by this um I think clearly from the people that that the president has chosen to bring on education is the key um meeting is the key getting to people people to see you know each other as people you not not losing the humanity uh but then at the same time we've also seen actions such as on the one hand uh very clearly standing against Hamas we've seen the interior Minister also taking a stand on that officially banning all connections to Hamas from from Germany but then still more and more allowing for Palestinians uh uh to demonstrate to talk to to to face their their you know to bring out to public their fears their their concerns um and then at the same time a lot of pressure that is put on Israel by the International Community to allow for more um ceasefires and humanitarian Aid to be coming into Gaza to sort of show we are advocating for the people of Gaza while trying to still um accept Israel's right to defend itself thanks for much for that sh shie rosanes is at DW's Middle East
