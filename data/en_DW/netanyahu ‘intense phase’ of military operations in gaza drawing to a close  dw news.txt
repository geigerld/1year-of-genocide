welcome to the program it's great to have you with us Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that what he calls the intense phase of Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza is drawing to a close but the Israeli Prime Minister says the fighting won't stop until the group no longer controls the Gaza Strip now Israel's declared aim in the war is to eliminate Hamas and Liberate the Israeli hostages held by militant groups it's an aim Israel has not achieved but the Israeli military chief of Staff says the structure of Hamas in the city of Rafa is nearly dismantled Israel's military now appears to be shifting its focus to its northern border where clashes with lebanon's Hezbollah militia have been intensifying Applause for Benjamin Netanyahu despite the political headwind he's facing both at home and abroad but his message will likely disappoint those pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza and the Speedy return of Israeli [Applause] hostages if there is an agreement it will be an agreement according to our terms and our terms are not to end the war to leave Gaza and Hamas as it is I refuse to leave Hamas as it is we need to eliminate it as fighting along Israel's border with Lebanon heats up the Prime Minister signaled Israel could scale back its operation in Gaza after the intense phas is finished we will have the possibility to move part of our forces North and we will do this first and foremost for defensive purposes crossboard tensions have continued to rise since the outbreak of the war with Israel repeatedly striking the Iran backed Hezbollah militia over the weekend International observers have called for restraint warning an open conflict could trigger a wider war in the Middle East Israeli defense minister y Galant is currently meeting with us officials before leaving for Washington he told the press in these meetings I will discuss developments on the Gaza front the Lebanon front and they have a crucial importance at this time we are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza Lebanon and in other places as well anger in Israel Over the government's handling of the war continues to grow over the weekend protesters rallied near the headquarters of netanyahu's leud party the biggest so far according to organizers demanding the return of all hostages and an immediate ceasefire meanwhile civilians in Gaza continue to get caught in the crossfire four Palestinians including a child among the latest victims of Israeli shelling on Central Gaza on Monday and we can now talk to Hans yakob shindle he's the director of the counter extremism project here in Berlin welcome it's so great to have you in the studio now Israel's stated goal going into this war was to eliminate Hamas and Gaza and to liberate the hostages none of that has really happened has it so what has this intense phase of the war as netanyahu's calling it really achieved well there have been some successes but really not really any sustained um approach of these two core aims so of course they have killed a lot of Hamas fighters of course they have broken some of the tunnel system not all of it they have definitely eliminated a large parts of the weapons rockets and armed storages of of Hamas but they haven't gotten the two leaders safe Dave and sinoa and they still have about 100 Israeli hostages in Gaza so if they would leave now Hamas would be back within months on unfortunately so what it only can mean is a refocus of troops away from the ga strip to the north but a continuing military operation in Gaza Strip at the lower level yeah and we heard a military official today saying that Israel is close to dismantling U the Rafa Brigade now from someone who knows this conflict very well are those traditional military structures really the way that Hamas functions well Hamas had buil up military structure but it's not like a brigade it would be in the German army or in the US Army so it is a organized group of Fighters and the Rafa Brigade was really the last Brigade in in inverted commas that Israel hadn't tackled yet um but that doesn't mean it this all of these Hamas fighters of these various brigades that they've dismantled before are either in captivity or dead it's still a loose connected cell network of Hamas that really fights back on a daily basis against Israel and a couple of weeks ago was even able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv again so what does it mean then that they dismantle the Brigade then in the north they they said they had completed their mission in a sense now they're popping back up again it seems like they're playing a a very Sinister game of whack-a-mole there how can they how can they move forward in an effective way and move towards achieving that stated goal is it even possible the way they're going about it right now well the Israeli Army is now encountering exactly the same challenges that the international forces had in Afghanistan or the American and British forces had in Iraq is that you cannot just clear a area of terrorist or insurgence elements you need to hold that area now and then afterwards you need to administer that area and they've been very good at the clearing of the areas they have been partially good at holding of the areas but since they have a limited troop numbers they had always had to move troops out so what of course happened was that Hamas Fighters simply pushed into these newly cleared areas back into into this uh uh into these areas which they had been before and the Israelis had now left so this clear hold and administer step wasn't really done so yes they've cleared the northern Gaza yes they've cleared now Rafa but that doesn't mean that Hamas won't be back as soon as they leave these areas and if Israel has now decided that they have to concentrate more forces in the north because hispa has increased its attack it playing into hamas's hands and it's playing into hb's hands because that's exactly what both groups want them to do mhm this all started in response to the October 7th Terror attacks it has brought incredible hardship to the people of Gaza now has Hamas lost Support over their role in making what is taking place in Rafa and all across the strip uh happen and in triggering puls are very difficult but there has one by the Palestinian Research Center just recently which clearly shows that now fatak has greater support in Gaza Strip than Hamas does but Hamas has greater support in the West Bank than than than uh uh uh fatak has so it has lost support but that doesn't mean that there would be a at this point a viable idea of who is governing Gaza if it's not Israeli occupied at the end of all of this and that means there's question who is going to be the biggest power factor in Gaza once the Israeli Army would completely withdraw or mostly withdraw and at the moment still the only viable power structure that would very likely take over again is Hama so we're not at the end of this at all MH I want to look at the day after in a second but first what do you consider to be hamas's biggest source of power at this point is it popular support still is it something else no it's its willingness to accept as many Palestinian casualties as it takes this was the strategy from the very beginning to make this an extremely bloody Conflict for the Israeli government make the Israeli government lose International support increase the pressure on the Israeli government so that they have to stop before their back is truly broken in the Gaza Strip and looking at today's announcement I'm wondering whether this is not a strategy that will in the end maybe work out that is very interesting how could you see it working out then in their favor well if Israel really now starts a major military operation in Lebanon against hisbah and we've seen this in 2006 what kind of resource it takes because hisbah is truly an army which has actual brigades which has far more Rockets far more ballistic missiles and has developed a low-flying high-speed drone that evades the iron Drome we having a completely different military scenario that we had in Gaza where it's more an Insurgency Warfare this is an actual conventional confrontation which means most of the military energy will go to the north will go to Lebanon Lebanon will again like in 2006 experience major destruction including in in byut because that's where hpa's center of gravity is um but that also means Gaza will get less attention and then we may be back at we were at the point where we were in October 6th which would be a tragic outcome yeah you say there needs to be a plan for governance for Gaza looking at the past how have terror groups like Hamas been taken out effectively was it through diplomacy in the end there were a couple of examples were like in the Irish uh uh Republic the IRA was brought into a peace proess now the problem with a religious ideology like Hamas has is there is no political process to be had this is a extremist organization whose ideology is comparable to that of K it doesn't have a global plan at this point but certainly wants to have a Islamic State in Gaza so there is no negotiation you can have with someone who has a religious ideology the other uh ability to dry out Terror organizations is simply by providing governance that is taking away the social support and in this case it could only be Palestinian governance but the PNA is very historically weak at this point so that doesn't seem like a viable option only remaining option is then International control the Arab Union or the UN getting control over the Gaza Strip and managing until a newly established Palestinian Authority could take over H yakob Shindler thank you so much thank you German foreign minister analena babok has repeated her calls for a two-state solution during a visit to Israel her eth since the beginning of the war in a policy speech she focused on the war in Gaza as well as the worsening humanitarian crisis in the strip while reiterating that she was a friend of Israel the foreign minister criticized Israel over its approach to the war babok also spoke of the impact the images of the war were having around world these images from Gaza are traveling the globe sparking strong emotions in the Arab world but also in the US in Europe in my country everywhere this disbelief sadness anger and as a friend of Israel I want to be frank this anger is not helping Israel to meet its security needs to the contrary it only serves Hamas cynical drive to provoke further escalation our political editor Mika KFA is accompanied the foreign minister on her trip and I asked her whether bok's words Mark a shift in Germany's position in the conflict no Germany is clearly not departing from its path being close at Israel's side having declared Israel's security as reason of state of one of its fundamental principles of the German state but what analina Bok is doing here in Tel Aviv is mapping out that being a friend means telling your friend that some things might be bad news she's unusually outspoken here uh talking about a longer lasting peace being what Germany strives for in this friendship and that that also means for Isel to recognize that there is global anger as she called it at the high number of Civilian casualties in Gaza and that is something that needs to be factored in she also interestingly on a part with the US ambassador here is calling for a longer term plan telling Israel to listen to Arab voices who vowed to also help rebuild Gaza but only if there is a path to a lasting peace as two-state solution she also calls out very uneasy issues like the allegations of torture against Israel and it calls on Israel to show that it lives up to its democratic values and to international human rights law she's unusually specific in her criticism while at the same time stressing that Germany remains at Israel's side but clearly together with the United States Germany wants to see some movement not just in the Netanyahu government but also in how Israel thinks about its own future and its chances for a longer lasting piece
