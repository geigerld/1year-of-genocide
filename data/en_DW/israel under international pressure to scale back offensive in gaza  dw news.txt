we start with growing international calls for Israel to scale back its assault on Gaza that includes its closest Ally the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin has just arrived in Tel from Bahrain for talks with Israel's defense minister and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Austin's trip is part of a diplomatic tour of the Middle East he's expected to press Israel to focus its attacks on Hamas and do more to avoid civilian casualties Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the US the EU and several other countries collecting and burying the dead now a daily ritual in the Gaza Strip for those able to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones many remain trapped under the rubble of bombed out buildings these latest victims were killed in Rafa in the South a supposed safe zone for those fleeing the fighting in other areas of Gaza they hit every place they targeted everywhere they target at night children are always scared and they wake up screaming because of the sound of bombing there are big targets everywhere in Raa but unfortunately there is no safety another recent assault in Rafa killed a French Foreign Ministry worker who had been Sheltering inside a residential home news of the death came just as Francis foreign minister arrived in Israel Paris has condemned the bombing and is demanding an investigation I've also come here to reiterate the importance of a new humanitarian truce we need to return to a durable truce a truce that will enable us to work towards a humanitarian ceasefire now but Israel says a ceasefire would be nothing more than a gift for Hamas giving it it time to regroup and strike again we will eliminate Hamas release all our hostages and we promise Gaza won't become a center of Terror once again that includes disabling hamas's vast network of underground tunnels like this one according to the Israeli military it goes down some 50 m underground and is wide enough for vehicles Germany's foreign minister and the UK's for foreign secretary have also expressed support for a ceasefire but only if it can be sustained in a joint opinion article they write we do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire hoping it somehow becomes permanent is the way forward for now the pair are pushing for further humanitarian pauses to get more Aid into Gaza and hostages out the rising death toll and The Accidental killing of three hostages by the Israeli military has raised concern over Israel's strategy in Gaza the US is pushing for a transition to smaller more tactical missions into the territory in Tel Aviv thousands of protesters have been taking part in weekly rallies calling on the government to end the fighting and pursue a peaceful solution that would allow the remaining hostages to return home and tww correspondent Tanya Kramer has more from Jerusalem Tanya International pressure on Israel is growing are you seeing any signs that Israel might be looking at changing its strategy or entertaining the prospect of a ceasefire even well as you said International pressure is growing but we don't see much impact of that here in policies or strategies actually we heard again over the weekend prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu again reiterating that only maximum military pressure will yield any results mainly a victory for Israel or what they U say a clear you know eliminating Hamas topple Hamas and also uh to uh release U more hostages so there's no change at least in the public rhetorics here of the government of course we will be seeing uh today also the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin also in Israel and it's expected that he will also reiterate the need uh for more humanitarian Aid coming into Gaza for civilians St and also you know less harm to civilians in Gaza with is with the us being the closest and strongest Ally of Israel um during its War efforts but they also have been calling uh uh for uh you know less casualties in Gaza but we haven't seen anything in this regard happening uh on the ground but what is also uh Happening Here in Israel is it's there's more and more pressure on the Israeli go government domestically to do more uh to uh make a new deal to release more hostages after uh three Israeli hostages were killed on Friday by the Israeli military in Gaza several of Israel's closest allies are pushing to revive the idea of a two-state solution which is widely regarded as the only way out of this crisis is there any appetite for that in Israel well I mean there are lot of debates about you know what will Gaza look like about after post war Gaza what is going to be Israel's role in this but there's there a lot of ideas floating around but nothing really concrete and I think the idea of a two-state solution or rather the concept of a two-state solution has been promoted for over two decades by the International Community by uh Western allies but it has not been uh implemented and we've heard also prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that actually he was the one preventing a Palestinian state which is at the core of this two- State solution um saying two states uh living uh two people and two states living by side by side so I don't expect this uh um you know in this with this right-wing government also his core allies the far-right parties are also against the Palestinian state so I think this is rather a discussion that is very far away from the reality right now yeah so a lot of pressure on Netanyahu from abroad but also at home where does that leave him how stable is he right now in power well I think what we're seeing right now there's a lot of pressure on prime minister Netanyahu from the families and relatives but also from the public about bringing more of the Israeli hostages that are being held now uh in that are still being held in Gaza that there are about 130 hostages that are still in Gaza and this is the main issue that the focus the country is now focused on um there's also of course uh after this incident with the three hostages that were killed by the Israeli Army uh there's a lot of discussion about the militaries Rules of Engagement uh in Gaza about responsibilities especially when it comes to the Prime Minister but this is something that will be dealt with after the war right now there's the sense here that time is running out for those hostages and the pressure is on to bring those hostages back home Tanya kma reporting from Jerusalem always great to get your take thank you so much well she mentioned it there Israel faces pressure from abroad to scale back its campaign in Gaza at home the relatives of hostages still being held by Hamas are pushing for more to be done to rescue their loved ones those who have been released so far have been women and children but as Tanya reports now for the families whose Sons were taken on October 7th hope is scarce Rachel Goldberg keeps score of the days her son hsh has been held hostage in Gaza more days have passed since we met but the family still hasn't heard anything a lot of people feel Comfort wearing t-shirts with their loved one or a pin with their loved one that for me makes me really uncomfortable um I also don't like that the picture doesn't change I think there's something important that every day the number changes and it's showing it's uncomfortable H was caught up in the attack on the Nova Music Festival on October 7 militants led by Hamas considered a terrorist group by multiple countries killed at least 360 people and took others to Gaza H's best friend Anna on the left here was one of those killed hsh on the right was badly injured and taken I pray all the time that I know there are kind good gazen civilians who are also caught in this horrible situation that we're caught in and I want to pray and hope that there's someone kind there being kind to hirs and to the other you know innocent people who are also being held there in a terrible situation h family takes some comfort from the support of his friends they used to hang out here in this bar in Jerusalem all are Aid supporters of football club hael Jerusalem they've made sure he cannot be [Music] forgotten we are doing bad it's really nothing is the same and even when we try and we succeed in a lot of moments of our day to keep living you know we we meet here we drink our beers we watch our football team and we try to do what we were doing before but that's not the situation and every time you have a moment to to realize you you remember that her is an hostage in in Gaza they also mourned their friend Anna killed that day it was a day that changed their world it's the biggest incident we've had um for Our Generation for sure um but I I think it's kind of a part of being here is there's always something happening and there's always um but I I think this is the first time it really hit me personally with HH and um and maybe also our community H fate is also present at this German Football Club he was a frequent visitor here in Breman thanks to strong links between supporters of his football club and those of ver pran I know him as a very charismatic person he's very outgoing very open unbelievably tolerant he tries to bring people together we're so far away what can we do from here to somehow keep this topic and our friend close to us that's what we try to do with our conversations and messages with Rachel to find a way to offer support from so far away to where we feel so connected in our hearts F there flying the flag for hsh gives Comfort to his mother in Jerusalem I call them my friends they're hsh's friends but you know who write and keep me posted and send pictures of different rallies and different soccer games and different uh you know um exhibitions that are put out not to forget these these human beings who are being held against their will in very scary conditions and situations and it it actually really helps me I think it helps me to breathe in this world without air for now she counts the days and she
