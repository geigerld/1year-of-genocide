negotiators from Hamas Qatar and the US have been holding talks aimed at securing a truce in the five-month war in Gaza us officials have said Israel has broadly approved a deal but sticking points have emerged on both sides these include details of hostages held by Hamas and the number of Palestinian prisoners Israel might be willing to release the Times of Israel reports that Israel is not willing to join the talks without a list of hostages who are still alive for the moment there's no letup in the fighting Israel has stepped up operations in the southern Gaza City of Han Yunis the Army says it has destroyed dozens more Hamas targets pressure for a truce is mounting as the United Nations warns of a looming famine in Gaza the territory is run by Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attacks US vice president kamla Harris has called for a ceasefire in Gaza and has urged isra to allow Gaza Aid her comments were among the sharpest yet by senior us leadership and given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table this will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of Aid in well for more now we can speak to Georgio cafiero he's a Middle East analyst and the CEO of Gulf State analytics in Washington DC thanks so much for joining us here on DW we just heard Kel Harris call for an immediate ceasefire using really some of the strongest language we've heard so far from the US do you think this is Washington trying to distance itself from Israeli leadership well it's a good question and I think it's important to realize that of course us domestic politics are in play uh many of the sort of Base voters if you will in the Democratic party are very upset at the Biden Administration for being so incredibly supportive of Israel's war on Gaza over these past few months and the Biden team certainly does not want um more Progressive voters sitting at home in November um in terms of the US Israel relationship though I mean what we've seen over these past few months is that the Biden Administration is always voicing its opinion explaining what it prefers telling Israel what it would like to see happen but we never have seen the Biden Administration you know actually condition Aid to Israel set any red lines or ultimatums and without any of that I'm always skeptical that this rhetoric and these statements really have anything to do with the Biden Administrations actual policies that have some real substance to them okay and looking at the region itself what kind of ceasefire deal do you expect if any in the coming hours or days well there obviously is this talk right now um about an arrangement that the US Egypt and Kar have been working to secure whereby we'd have a ceasefire for six weeks uh there would a swap of captives and prisoners some humanitarian Aid let in it seems though that Hamas is sort of setting as a condition not just a ceasefire that might last for 6 weeks but rather a permanent end to the war there's also uh demands Hamas is making about letting Palestinians return to Northern Gaza and expulsion of the departure of the Israeli occupying forces on the ground in the besieged Enclave so whether or not uh the negotiators from Doha Cairo and Washington are going to be able to bridge the gaps I don't know um it's going to certainly require quite a bit more work I think um really seeing his believing and I'm I'm not so convinced that there's going to be some sort of an arrangement the two sides are going to agree to I certainly hope that's the case but again seeing is believing and so it clearly like there are so many sticking points here and while these treat talks happen the Israeli Army is stepping up attacks in southern Gaza so with all that in mind do you see any chance of Israel agreeing to a long-term ceasefire I think we're going to get to that point uh often left out of these discussions is the fact that continuation of this War uh imposes a huge cost on the Israeli economy there's also domestic politics in Israel um we're talking you know about the influence the the role of the families of the hostages who have been held by Hamas and Gaza for a number of months so obviously this conflict this war cannot continue forever there's going to come a point when the dust eventually settles in Gaza but I think it's very possible that the Netanyahu government is going to continue uh raging this war for uh a longer period of time unfortunately Middle East analyst Georgio cafiro in Washington DC thank you so much for taking the time to speak to us it's a
