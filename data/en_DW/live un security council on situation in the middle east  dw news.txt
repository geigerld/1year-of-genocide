accordance with rule 39 of the council's provisional rules of procedure I invite the following briefers to participate in the meeting Mr G Peterson special Envoy of the Secretary General for Syria and Madame Lisa dton director of the humanitarian financing and resource mobilization division of the office uh for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs it is so decided the security Council will now begin its consideration of item two of agenda I now give the floor to Mr Guyer Peterson thank you Mr President 2023 has been another very difficult year for Syria a year that saw devastating earthquakes humanitarian needs reaching new highs the economy plummeting to new loves and diversed violence in three years the year also saw new diplomatic openings but did not lead to tangible changes on the ground for the lives of syrians in short this has been another tragic year for Syrian civilians who were killed injured displaced detained and abducted in alarming numbers and who saw no tangable moves towards a better future instead on top of everything else Syrian s face the danger of regional spillover adding further fuel to the fire Mr President these last weeks have seen a reification of spillover effects from the de the developments in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel we have seen the following multiple air strikes attributed to Israel across Syria the Syrian government reported that Israeli a strikes rendered Damascus and Leo airports non-operational currently only lakia airport is functional affecting both civilian air traffic and the UN humanitarian operations we have seen multiple reports of missiles launched from Southern Syria over the occupied Syrian Golan towards Israel and of IDF fire and near daily attacks on us positions in Northeast Syria and in parallel Mr President violence in all theaters of Syria continues and is even escalating once again in some respects with alarming reports of Civilian casualties just these last few weeks we have seen escalating violence in Northwest Syria PR government air strikes intensified as did Frontline clashes with very serious incidents of shelling by by government forces on idlip intensified Shilling was also carried out by listed terrorist group hayat tar Alam and armed opposition forces including omble and s in Aleppo further drone attacks on government areas attributed to hayat T Alam and other actors based in idlib which the government says it intercepted Turkish thr strikes amid intense artillery exchanges between Turkish and armed opposition forces on one side and SDF on the other a continued trend of attacks by some Arab tribes on SDF positions in theur and no reports of government Shilling on SDF positions too continuing isol attacks in the Northeast and Central desert region intensification of clashes between the Jordanian Army and Smugglers on the Syrian Jordanian border with several Jordanian official announcements about incidents on the border leading to several casualties among members of the Jordanian bodyguard forces and ongoing assassinations and other security incidents as part of continued instability in the southwest Mr President there is an urgent need for maximum restraint by All actors syrians and non syrians no one should delude themselves that this worrying New Normal of ongoing escalation is in any way sustainable any major escalation would have devastating consequences in a deeply fragile situation where de facto authorities and the prisons and actions of foreign armies are key features of landscape we need to see sustained deescalation in and on Syria towards a nationwide ceasefire and a corporative approach to coning Security Council listed terrorist groups and we need all actors to operate in full compliance with International humanitarian law to ensure protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure Mr President the socio economic conditions in Syria are also unsustainable and on brink funding is dwindling while humanitarian needs are higher than ever even threatening food security we will hear more from MAA on this let me issue here a strong appeal to donors to to fund all pillars of the UN response following the expiry of this council's crossborder resolution we must continue also to seek solutions to ensure the continued delivery of crossborder and crossline humanitarian assistance meanwhile the economy is in increasingly dire States due to a wide range of factories that I have outlined many times to this Council and we know the critical infrastructure including electricity is on the major strain it is vital to ensure that any adverse effects of sanctions on ordinary syrians be avoided and mitigated including continuous and active efforts by sanctioning states to conter over compliance likewise the core concerns that displaced persons continue to site namely livelihoods on one hand and protection issues on the other mean that refugees and idps have not yet seen forthcoming conditions for safe dignified and voluntary returns nevertheless channels of dialogue continue as we and our humanitarian colleagues continue to assess ser government announcements Mr President the challenges on the ground are symptoms of a conflict that no one actor or existing group of actors can solve alone these challenges cannot be sustainably addressed without the political process that make genuine progress towards a political solution addressing the issues contained in Security Council resolution 2254 I had occasion to review the state of the political process and to stress the importance of moving the process forward when I met with the Syrian Deputy foreign minister in Geneva and with the president of the Syrian negotiations Commission in daa and I carried similar messages to key stakeholders this month meeting senior Russians American Iranians Arab European and Japanese officials I reminded all that International cooperation is essential to get the Syrian political process back on track Mr President the blockage of the Constitution committee for a year and a half larly over what should be a secondary issue the venue has sent the wrong signal and being a setback despite the non Syrian nature of this issue I have exerted every effort to facilitate the solution and I have appreciated the efforts of others too however I can confirm from my vde consultations that there is no venue in the region that it's both on offer and attracts consensus and indeed there is no signs this which change anytime soon in these circumstances I have been appealing to all that we should find a pragmatic Way Forward let us all respect the Syrian Leed Syrian owned un facilitated nature of the Constitutional committee the commitments made by the Syrian parties when they agreed to launch the committee namely to a continuous process process in Geneva should guide The Way Forward yes we can continue to explore alternative consensus locations but in the meantime we should come together to enable the reconvening of the Constitutional Committee in Geneva let me also remind the council that proposals for step for step confidence building measures are on the table which would benefit all syrians and give an important political impetus into the political process engagement coordination and information sharing is needed to move from ambiguous signaling to real confidence building via coordinated reciprocal verifiable actions there are concrete moves that could be made if we work in this way my good offices are ongoing with the Syrian parties the regional players and the international stakeholders in this regard Mr President a credible political process equally depends on the participation of the Widder spectrum of syrians in the eight years since the establishment of the Civil Society supporter room significant progress has been made in Syrian Civil Society of many kinds and perspectives increasingly working together they are acting as a source of advice and inspiration and supporting Grassroots peace building and humanitarian relief and advocacy I was extremely pleased to have an extensive Exchange in a virtual Town Hall format with over 130 Civil Society support room participants from all part of Syria whether currently based inside Syria in neighboring countries or in the wider diaspora I was equally pleased to engage with the Syrian women's Advisory Board this month they remain very concerned at the potential for violence spiraling in the region and the relative lack of focus on Syria VB members also engage with members of the Mediterranean women's mediators Network and examined ways to reinforce women's political role across various context in Syria and the region Mr President as 2023 draws to a close it seems no coincident that renewed violence and popular frustrations including protests peaked later in the year this took place at the same time as race political hopes on different sides were onmet following various diplomatic moves and momentum began to fade this should remind us that the status quo is unsustainable and it is unacceptable and that this conflict cannot be left unattended it also shows that partially approaches are unlikely to address the depths of syrians Despair and contain the conflict sustainably in 2024 there is therefore a clear need to refocus on the political process called for eight years ago in the resolution 2254 the year ahead needs to see a new momentum injected into the search for compromise for a political path forward I appeal for all to act in a manner that enables the Constitutional committee to resume at least initially in Geneva and for reciprocal verifiable parallel cbms to be agreed and implemented equally I remind you all that these entry points cannot in themselves resolve the conflict we must look to engage across a comprehensive set of issues of concern to relevant parties with new energy and new thinking and lay the ground for a realistic and comprehensive multilateral approach inclusive of all actors and all the issues at the heart of the conflict this is the way to stem the tide of violence and fast deteriorating soci economic humanitarian situation and mo move towards a negotiated political settlement that could enable the syrians to realize their legitimate aspirations and indeed restore Syria sovereignity Unity Independence and territorial Integrity in line with security ccil resolution 2254 thank you I thank Mr Peterson for his briefing I now give the floor to to Madam Lisa dton thank you Mr President 2023 is proven to be yet another challenging year for the people of of Syria it started with devastating earthquakes that struck turkey and Northern and Western Syria killing tens of thousands of people causing widespread damage in both countries in Syria the earthquakes hit when needs were already at the highest level since the start of the conflict they affected close to 9 million people across the country and killed at least 5,900 Millions were displaced and countless essential service facilities were damaged or destroyed the United Nations and our humanitarian Partners responded immediately following the earthquakes we provided first aid and Trauma care food assistance and shelter support we provided psychosocial support and protection programming we supported the removal of rubble and worked to urgently restore basic Services however devast ating and widespread damage to infrastructure caused by the earthquakes is still being acutely felt 10 months later even more so amid the current economic crisis some 60,000 families lost their homes while hundreds of thousands of homes thousands of schools and hundreds of Health Facilities were damaged Mr President working with our partners we've supported the rehabilitation of hospitals schools markets roads water lines and other civilian infrastructure including through projects financed by ocha's managed pooled funds here I must acknowledge the generosity of our donors who mobilized swiftly and completely funded the Syria earthquake appeal however there's much more work to be done survivors are enduring terrible trauma while grappling with the material aftermath of the destruction and our ability to address the lasting and increasing needs across the country is now being severely constrained by a lack of resources this includes fun for early recovery initiatives which could address the suffering caused by earthquakes while reducing dependence on external Aid Mr President 2023 sadly saw hostilities in Northern Syria returned to levels not seen since 2019 since August the fighting in Northwest and Northeast Syria has killed or injured hundreds of civilians it has forced tens of thousands of people to endure and many of them in fact to relive the trauma of displacement the hostilities have caused yet further damage to civilian facilities including critical infrastructure depriving millions of people of access to electricity safe water education and Essential Health Services I remind all parties to the conflict that all feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and minimize civilian harm this uptick and fighting reminds us that the conflict in Syria is far from over for humanitarians it demonstrates once again that without progress towards an end to the conflict it will be impossible to effectively address the extens of humanitary needs in the country on any sustainable basis Mr President against this backdrop crossb relief operations remain indispensable Lifeline for more than 4 million people in need in Northwest Syria agreement by the government of Syria for the United Nations to use the babal Hawa Crossing for the delivery of humanitarian assistance currently runs until 13 January uary 2024 consent to use bab Al Salam and Al re Crossings initially granted following the earthquakes in February was further extended in November for an additional 3 months until 13 February 2024 Mr President as we've repeatedly said the sheer scale of needs across the country underscores the urgency of scaling up the delivery of Aid via all modalities the United Nations is committed to continued engagement to ensure all three border crossings remain open in the coming days we will formly request that the government of Syria extend its consent for the use of babal Hawa border crossing for as long as humanitarian needs persist the United Nations will also continue to advocate for sustained and predictable humanitarian access across Syria through all possible means whether cross border or cross line the huge benefits of increased access will amply were were amply demonstrated following the Emer measures introduced by the government of Syria after the earthquakes these measures allow the United Nations agencies to conduct over 300 missions into Northwest Syria our colleagues were able to directly engage with affected populations there conduct needs assessments and improve the monitoring of projects and programs through these missions we're also able to work closely with women and girls and their Community Advocates to strengthen our interventions in response to existing gender barriers that imped women and girls access to vital life-saving Services these missions have been a net gain resulting in the enhanced overall efficiency of the humanitarian response in Northwest Syria and we look forward to seeing them continue unfortunately while access reaps benefits in one place setbacks challenge us elsewhere United Nations humanitarian Air Service flights essential for the transportation of un personnel and vital temperature controlled medical cargo have been suspended since 12 October due to repeated attacks on Damascus and Aleppo airports Mr President as I've already mentioned in relation to the ongoing earthquake response a lack of funding is severely constraining our ability to respond to increasing needs across Syria two weeks from the end of the year the 2023 humanitarian response plan for Syria is only 33% funded just $1.8 billion has been received out of the required $5.4 billion by comparison last year's response plan was 52% funded Mr President as we have repeatedly warned this lack of resources is severely constraining our ability to provide critical life-saving assistance to millions of people in need following the reductions announced by the world food program in July which cut food assistance to some 40% of those receiving it we saw families increasing in L resort to negative coping mechanisms such as drastic reductions in Daily food intake increased child labor and growing malnutrition among children since we last briefed this Council the world food program has been forced to announce additional reductions completely cutting its main food assistance program which has sustained millions of families in Syria for over a decade Mr President starting in January 5.5 million people who benefited from General food distributions at the beginning of 2023 will no longer receive it these new Cuts coming as they do ammit a deepening economic crisis will have an even more devastating impact with deep sadness our preliminary assessments forecast further declines in food Security in 2024 including a 29% increase in severe food insecurity rates among displaced people living in camps and informal sites in this context the consequences of funding shortfalls for food assistance will be devastating Mr President the situation is unsustainable and insupportable as special Envoy has reminded us again today urgent progress must be made toward peace if the people of Syria are to have any hope for a better future let 2024 be the year in which genuine progress is made in the meantime we must all redouble our efforts to keep the people of Syria and their hopes alive our ask has been consistent we need civilians and civilian infrastructure to be protected we need sustained humanitarian access throughout the country through all modalities and we need urgent and adequate funding to sustain the life-saving humanitarian response thank you Mr President I thank um Mrs dton for her briefing I now give the floor to those council members who wish to make statements I give the floor floor to the representative of the Russian Federation SP thank you Mr President we wish to thank the special Envoy of the Secretary General for Syria G Peterson as well as the director for the humanitarian financing and resource mobilization division of un Ocha Madame doten for their overview of the political humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic the unprecedented toll of casualties of the escalation in the Palestine Israel conflict Zone has provoked additional tensions in the friendly country of Syria against the backdrop of Israel's brutal military operation in the Gaza Strip and the ongoing armed raids on the West Bank of the Jordan River we have observed a stark increase in various forces and units presence in the region they are increasing flights of the Israeli Air Force targeting Syrian objects first and foremost the airports in Damascus and Aleppo which are used as the main gateways for the introduction into Sy of un humanitarian assistance as well as the heightened hostilities and an exchange of strikes on the blue line between Lebanon and Israel uh carry are fraught with risks of dragging Syria into a full-blown Regional confrontation this needs to be avoided at all costs at the same time in the country the existing difficulties in the country persist and are worsening the terrorist hotbed in Libya hostilities between the Kurds and prot Turkish groups instability in the South including the Aton area zone which is under the US control we would note that in the context of the situation in Gaza Strip our us colleagues are actively exploiting the premises on self-defense premises of self-defense and countering the threat of terrorism unjustifiably asserting that this right is something which not only Israel enjoys Israel occupying power in Palestine but also Washington and its allies they assert enjoy this right they illegit who have an illegit illegitimately occupi part of Syrian territory allegedly under under the pretext of countering isil and Al-Qaeda at the same time the US is obstinately denying Damascus both the right to counter Security Council listed HTS terrorists in idlib and the right to self-defense from indiscriminate Israeli attacks under these circumstances what is the the of our Western colleagues is deafening they cannot fail to understand the risks which directly emanate from such Reckless acts we firmly condemn the uh the uh uh the ongoing strikes targeting Syria as egregious violations of Syrian sovereignty and the basic provisions of international law including International humanitarian law in the context of the advancement of Syrian political settlement through security Council resolution 2254 we consistently unwaveringly support the resumption of the continuous work of the Constitutional committee under with the mediation of the United Nations support for this has also been ex voiced in the F outcome of the Su session of the Russian Arab cooperation Summit at the level of Foreign Affairs which completed its work in maresh Morocco in it it's there is mention is made of this of the desire to resume work on the Syrian constitutional track with assistance from the United nations in this connection we trust that you Mr Peterson will provide assistance to the Syrian parties to find new mutually acceptable platforms for the Constitutional committee without at the same time dispersing efforts in other areas which are not supported by the syrians themselves Mr President we continue to be persuaded of the need to uphold the basic right of the Syrian refugees to return as is stipulated under security 2254 under the strict condition that these efforts are coordinated with Damascus in this connection we wish to note the decree the order of the Syrian president Bashar alassad dating 16 November on the general amnesty for the citizens of the country this decision was made by the leadership of the syan Arab Republic and this in Connection in addition to the 22 2022 amnesty is designed to facilitate the return of syan refugees to their homes furthermore the syan government has demonstrated a willingness to take concrete measures to facilitate civilian reconciliation working on the detained and missing persons track thereby facilitating implementation of Security Council 2254 in the above mentioned final uh Declaration of the succession of the Russian Arab cooperation for at the foreign Minister's level mention is also made of the importance of surmounting the the refugee crisis and its consequences which the Syrian people themselves are facing as well as the host countries uh accommodating them also noted as they need to strengthen cooperation between the Syrian government and the states hosting refugees in order to AV alleviate the process of the voluntary dignified and safe return to their homes and an end to their plight in coordination with the relevant United Nations agencies distinguished colleagues in the same doc doent and the importance is noted of the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Syrian regions without any politicization whatsoever however with respect to the humanitarian situation in Syria the reasons for our alarm are only growing the situation is viewed similarly by humanitarian Personnel working in that country the dir of appropriate financing the political conditions established for donor contributions the sanctions pressure by Western countries and on the whole the exceedingly politicized approach to humanitarian operations in this Arab country has resulted in the fact that the situation on the ground is swiftly deteriorating we urge the UN country team in Damascus to devise a more effective approach to the delivery of assistance to syrians in need within all regions of the country without any discrimination whatsoever now the resident coordinator is called upon to demonstrate political will and to submit a report on the negative influence of unilateral sanctions on the situation in that country to that end there's a mandate from the second committee resolution which the general assembly approved the day before yesterday on 19 December well there are instructions to monitor the negative consequences of sanctions and these apply to the whole country team including Ocha what should long ago have been rescinded what should long ago have been rescinded is the internal secretary Mar manual on the parameters and principles for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Syria which directly links the conduct of recovery efforts in the country to progress on the political track this is nothing other than the UN Secretariat directly catering to Western anti-syrian preferences which casts a shadow on the impartiality requirement for all un staff which is enshrined in the charter Mr President the Syrian government extended on 10 November the permission for the UN to use the bab assalam and RI crossb points for another 3 months that is until 13 February 2024 on the 13th of January 2024 the temporary permission for the United Nations to use the babalwa checkpoint will expire the fate of this is The Sovereign decision of Damascus a decision taken as part of bilateral dialogue between the Syrian government and the UN in any event we believe that the humanitarian potential of the babalwa checkpoint should not be used by un Personnel from the office in gaziantep for spontaneous visits to ilb which are not agreed upon with Damascus Ocha should be strictly accountable before the authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic on this question we are aware that the UN is planning before the end of the year to finally send two Northwestern regions in Syria the first since the non-extension of Security Council 7 267 to the first humanitarian Convoy through the line of contact we trust that this operation will be a success for regardless of what some may attempt to assert the humanitarian needs in regions not under damascus's control in this part of the country remain high on the whole it behooves us to note that the crossline Convoy mechanisms which our Western and secretari colleagues do not uh the need for which our Western and secretary colleagues have not uh disputed continues not to work we see no particular Zeal in working with those who fainthearted are called authorities on the ground in order to address this absolutely inacceptable unacceptable situation undermining the premise that assistance to syrians in ilib needs to be delivered to in all using all possible means this brings us to the clear conclusion that the suffering of the syan people like the suffering of the people in Gaza is something which our Western colleagues have no concern about whatsoever all they care about are geopolitical games and support for their clients in the region regardless of what crimes they may perpetrate thank you I thank the Russian Federation I now give the floor to the United States thank you Mr President and thank you special Envoy Pon and director dton uh for your sobering briefings as 2023 comes to a close the Syrian political process remains frustratingly blocked and the Syrian people are suffering greatly this Council continues to rightly discuss the political and humanitarian files each month yet we have few results to show for our work for more than 12 years the Assad regime has waged a brutal war against the Syrian people on top of that syrians are still reeling from the devastating impacts of February's earthquakes yet rather than engage in a political process in the last few months the Assad regime has stepped up its attacks on its own people in the northwest of Syria we all know the responsibility for this war lies at the feet of the Assad regime the Searing images and accounts of the regime's chemical weapons attacks on opposition-led suburbs of demascus will never fade from our conscience nor will we forget the widespread shelling in Ms massacres in Aleppo and the present-- day bombardment that is killing civilians in idlib just two days ago the general assembly voted on a US co-facilitated resolution on the human rights situation in Syria that reminded the world of the abuses the regime wants us to forget the use of chemical weapons extrajudicial killings torture and other ill treatment unjust attentions enforced disappearances and gender based violence we joined the majority of UN member states in reiterating the call for the Syrian regime to immediately release all those arbitrarily held and to provide information about the tens of thousands who are missing we are alarmed by the reports that violence has reached its worst level since 2019 the hundreds of Civilian deaths caused by the regime and Russian offensive in idlib are deeply concerning the destruction they have caused to infrastructure and the threats they pose to humanitarian operations put hundreds of thousands of people at risk during the cold winter months while we welcome the three-month extension of the un's arrangement with the regime for Access through babal Salam and alai Crossings to access areas in need in Northwest Syria we also underscore that this peac meal approach does not fully meet the Urgent humanitarian need we continue to underscore the importance of PR ictable sustainable access particularly to improve efficiencies and allow for sufficient Staffing and planning we note that discussions between the UN and the regime regarding renewed crossb access through the crucial Crossing at Babble Hawa continue we support under Secretary General Griffith's efforts in this regard and remain hopeful for a positive outcome as Brazil prepares to conclude its Council term we want to acknowledge the close collaboration of the humanitarian pen ERS Brazil and Switzerland to focus the council's work on the needs of the Syrian people and we look forward to continued reporting to the council and close attention to this file as we appeal for Comm in Syria we also reiterate our condemnation of attacks by Iranian Allied militia groups on us personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria the United States has responded in self-defense and we reiterate that these attacks by Iranian align groups must stop special ano Pon we share your concerns about Regional spillover it is in these moments that we must persevere and remain committed to achieving a Syrian focused and syrian-led solution to the conflict in line with resolution 2254 the only viable road map for a lasting solution to the conflict more than eight years have pass since this Council unanimously adopted that resolution it is incumbent on all countries seated at this table to do their part and help Implement all aspects of this resolution the Syrian people have been waiting far too long we support the special Envoy efforts to advance the political process and to reconvene the Constitutional committee as soon as possible the United States is closely following the popular protests in SOA just as we did when pro-democracy demonstrations first sprung up in the nearby city of dar in 2011 the Syrian people deserve the future for which they have fought so hard including respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms thank you Mr President I thank the United States for statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Switzerland I speak on behalf of Switzerland and Brazil Coen holders of the Syrian humanitarian file we thank special Envoy G pedison and AA director for the humanitarian finance and resource mobilization division Lisa dorton for their briefings we also acknowledge the presence of representatives from Syria turkey and Iran in today's meeting this is the last joint statement together with Brazil before our very esteemed copenh holder partner concludes its term on the council we would like to thank them for the excellent cooperation throughout we will miss you and use this opportunity to both look back at this year and towards future developments as we are all aware in 2023 the people of Syria have experienced severe hardship the earthquake with its epicenter in turkey has heavily affected Northern Syria people lost their homes families and community members in a matter of minutes at least 6,000 people were killed with many more injured and thousands of Bill buildings have been destroyed this has led to further deteriorations of the already dire humanitarian situation the number of out of school children grew by at least 25% inadequate sanitary infrastructures in makeshift camps for internally displaced persons and the lasting extreme draft and water scarcity facilitated the spread of the colera outbreak across most of Syria the large scale vaccination campaign by the UN has been helpful to transform to transforming Coler cases into milder more manageable infections however it Still Remains a concern at the same time food insecurity keeps rising and cases of severe malnutrition are increasingly reported especially with children and we just heard it yet due to lack of funds the world food program had to reduce drastically rations since the summer while in 2024 the number of beneficiaries will be significantly reduced these reductions risk having consequences on access to other basic Services as people will have to prioritize and leading to increased negative coping mechanisms such as child labor or early manage early marriage sorry the worrying increase in violence and attacks in the Northeast and Northwest of the country since October has caused internal displacement cost lives and significantly damaged civilian infrastructure furthermore repeated air strikes under the two main airports of the country have disrupted un humanitarian Aid flights hampering severely the transports of humanitarian goods and personel we recall that International humanitarian law must be respected by all parties and the protection of civilians must be ensured at all times moreover the crossborder mechanism of Aid delivery went through a major shift this year following the devastations of the earthquake Syria has agreed to open the Babel salamand ALR border crossings in order to facilitate the emergency response the time bound authorization has been renewed until 13 February in July the authorization for the UN to operate the babble how crossb Aid mechanism from Turkey to Northwest Syria transitioned from a security Council mandate to a consent-based Arrangement which is set to expire on 133 January in the middle of harsh winter conditions we trust that all of the authorizations will be renewed without conditions and time limit as a Lifeline for millions of people depend on those parties must allow and facilitate humanitarian access to all people in need this is an obligation under International humanitarian law all access mod modalities are necessary including cross border and cross line to support people in need across Syria we further hope that sufficient funding of the humanitarian response will be ensured so that life- saving assistance as well as early recovery projects can be ured in order to prevent that this Grim retrospection transforms into an even Bleaker outlook for 2024 the International Community has a responsibility to act a political solution in line with resolution 2254 is urgently needed in the midst of the turmoil in Gaza with its Regional implications the security Council must not forget the plight of the Syrian people Mr President let me conclude with expressing our appreciation to the United Nations as well as its partner organizations for their tireless work and efforts in serving the people in need in Syria along with colera vaccination campaigns delivery of humanitarian items food rations Water Sanitation health and Protection Services cash and voucher assistance and so much more these humanitarian actors help avert the humanitarian crisis to deepen even more and provide much needed hope to the people we need to ensure the context for a safe and efficient implementation of their work building on our role on the council with Brazil so far Switzerland is committed to keep the council's continued attention on the humanitarian situation in Syria I thank you Mr President I would now like to make a statement of my national capacity on the political situation in Syria as 2023 draws to a close Switzerland can look back on a pivotal year for Syria the earthquakes of 6 February which shook a country already devastated by War revived welcome Regional diplomatic efforts under the egis of the league of Arab states these diplomatic efforts seem to have stalled and we can only regret this the current political status quo coupled with the renewed intensity of the conflict is of great concern to us we are also concerned about the serious risk of a major regional escalation into which Syria could be drawn we must avoid the situation at all costs we wish to point out that the solutions to the conflict in Syria are known they're contained in resolution 2254 which the council adopted precisely 8 years ago at a time of great Regional tension its implementation is particularly urgent in addition to a national ceasefire multifaceted commitment is needed this includes resuming the work of the Constitutional Committee in this respect we regret the lack of significant progress and urge all parties concerned to commit themselves in good faith and to collaborate with a special Envoy whom we thank for his efforts to relaunch such a process Switzerland remains ready to make Geneva available to host the meetings of this committee as well as any other type of talks and initiatives aimed at promoting a lasting peace in Syria Miss Mr President in the view of the tragic human toll of the past year we once again call on all parties to establish a nationwide ceasefire and to ensure the protection of civilians it is essential that all parties respect and en and ensure respect for international humanitarian law in particular the principles of Distinction proportionality and precaution in the conduct of hostilities it is imperative that the civilian population and civilian objects including INF structure indispensable to the survival of the population be protected this Council must make this its priority the Syrian population desperately needs this for its part Switzerland will spare no effort Switzerland would like to pay tribute to the remarkable commitment of Syrian Civil Society these organizations play a crucial role in easing tensions and bringing about National reconciliation like the international impartial and independent mechanism they play an important role in documenting International crimes which is essential in the fight against impunity their work is therefore fundamental to achieving lasting peace we would like to reaffirm our full support for them and stress the need to provide them with the resources they need to carry out their work thank you I thank the representative Switzerland for her statement I now give the floor to Ghana okay thank you Mr President I wish to thank gar Peterson as well as Lisa Dalton for their statements I wish to highlight two points absent of a political prospect there can be no lasting and fair peace in Syria nor can there be stability within the Region 8 years ago the security Council unanimously adopted res resolution 2254 which called for the establishment of a credible and inclusive political process in Syria we are far from having achieved sufficient progress due to the intransigence of the regime and its refusal to make the slightest concession human rights violations continue to remain rif frequently there is complete impunity for this and political demands are ongoing violations against the Syrian people are ongoing the bombardment of the regime and supporters in the Northwest in Syria are an unfortunate example of this this is permanent instability and captagon trafficking is another manifestation thereof which represents a threat to the region the conditions for the voluntary safe dignified return for refugees to the country have not been met uh Damascus has not made any concrete commitments to that end we reiterate our support for the countries that host these thousands of syrians under these circumstances guy Peterson's mediation is critical because much yet needs to be done and in this regard I would recall France's support for Mr Peterson's efforts there is a vital need to keep our attention and Collective efforts focused on a political solution to the crisis in Syria at a time uh when the war in Gaza shows that a crisis that is considered to be frozen can ultimately erupt if the root causes are not addressed the humanitarian situation is also worsening the resumption of hostilities in the Northwest and Northeast have compounded the tremendous suffering of civilians who have not been spared in any way this year France is also particularly concerned at Food instability as we approach winter there's a vital need for more donors to be able to mobilize to deliver assistance to Syria in this particularly Grim context International humanitarian law needs to be upheld by all parties in Syria there is a particular need to guarantee access for humanitarian assistance in a secure predictable and transparent way and there's a need to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel as the authorization for the United Nations to use the babal Hawa checkpoint is set to expire on the 13th of January we urge the Syrian regime to renew this authorization without a Time limitation the use of additional checkpoints and Crossing points should also cont uh be considered uh there's a vital need for the council to remain seize of the matter for the secretari to provide written reports on the humanitarian response in Syria thank you I thank friends and give the Flor to Ghana Mr President I have the honor to deliver this joint statement on behalf of the African members of the security Council we thank special Envoy G pson and director Lisa Dalton for their briefings and welcome the participation of the representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic the Islamic Republic of Iran and to key in this meeting the humanitarian crisis in Syria has continued to maintain its downward trajectory with an overwhelming number of syrians requiring various forms of assistance as we heard again today unfortunately children and displaced people are bearing the brand of the country's acute and Rising food security crisis at the same time Necessities such as water and electricity and in short supply with Millions having to live without them added to the economic challenges cuts to humanitarian support due to funding shortfalls and the wanton destruction of agricultural infrastructure resulting from the prolonged conflict has created a crisis within a crisis the abset in violence in parts of the country has wed the protection concerns as thousands of civilians remain displaced and are unable to safely and voluntarily return to their homes women and girls have been particularly vulnerable under such circumstances as they are exposed to gender-based violence in displacement camps consequently the daily lives of Syrian women and girls are mared by gender-based violence early and forced marriage and characterized by limited opportunities and resources Mr President IIT this an ending crisis funding shortages persist with these Year's humanitarian response plan requ in the lowest contributions of 33% in the past 3 years the low funding has constrained Aid agencies ability to provide the needed support to vulnerable populations we reiterate our appeal to the International Community to support the humanitarian cause in the country to ease the human suffering in Syria in view of the D nature of the humanitarian situation the A3 pledges its full support for any mode of Aid delivery that helps the most vulnerable people we urge the parties to collaborate closely with the United Nations to create a safe and secure environment for unhindered delivery of humanitarian Aid through all modalities given the substantial number of beneficiaries of the crossb aid delivery mechanism the A3 edges the Syrian national government to renew the authorization for the use of the bab alwa border crossing before its expiration in January 2024 this is vital to maintain an uninterrupted supply of life- saving assistance in the area despite the broader scope of this delivery system the A3 is of the view that a distribution across the front lines is equally important and should be expanded to complement the crossb supplies Mr President it is regrettable that the political situation in Syria continues to distate not with standing International and Regional efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict the Arab Spring that had renewed hope of a new dawn of democracy in Syria has failed to deliver on the aspirations of youth instead Syria is still marked by political instability and violence with devastating consequences for civilian lives and wellbeing Rising military hostilities in the country in recent times without regard to safeguarding civilian lives is deepening the crisis we remind the parties of their obligations under International humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure all parties must exercise maximum restraint and take proactive steps towards de escalations the parties involved must remember that no group can win the in the midst of such a constant blast shed a nationwide ceasefire remains s quanon for the start of the political process in accordance with resolution 225 4 the most workable solution to the conflict remains a Syrian Le and Syrian owned inclusive political process undertaken with the support of the International Community under the ages of the United Nations in this regard the role of the United Nation special Envoy G pison remains critical if the political process is to crystalize into a tangible outcome that brings resite and restore the hopes of all syrians genuine commitment to the peace process and support of the parties to his efforts including the step for step confidence building measures will go a long way to ensure peaceful resolution of the conflict reconvening the meeting of the small body of the Constitutional committee with active participation of all parties will give impetus to the political process we therefore call for broad consensus behind the proposal of the special Envoy for prompt resumption of the meetings of the committee without further delay Mr President the A3 welcomes the report of the Secretary General on the implementation of the resolution on the establishment of the independent institution on missing persons in the Syrian Arab Republic we call for full cooperation of all stakeholders to help address the plight of the detained and missing the families of the victims know deserve to know the fate of their loved ones in concluding the A3 Retreats its Collective call for a nation ceasefire and the immediate resumption of negotiations among the parties towards a political settlement that brings comprehensive and Lasting peace and stability to Syria in line with 2254 of 2015 even as a term of Ghana and Gabon on the council ends we assure the people of Syria of our continuing solidarity with them in their Quest for Peace and security I thank you for your attention I thank Gana for your statement I give the FL to China Mr President I thank special Envoy Pon and director Dalton for their briefings currently the neighboring environment of Syria continues to deteriorate and the spill over it risks of the Palestinian Israeli situation continues to accumulate which have had some a complex impact on the situation in Syria recently multiple occasion in Syria including the Damascus Airport suffered frequent air strikes China is deeply concerned about this we call upon all relevant parties to stay calm and exercise restraint refrain from any actions that may escalate tensions and spare no effort to reduce the risks for regional security the International Community in particular a major country should play a constructive role in preventing the spread of the conf conflict the Urgent priority is to stop all illegal military operations in Syria and end illegal military presence in the country political settlement is the fundamental way out for the Syrian issue China supports the Syrian Le and Syrian owned political process and calls upon all Syrian parties to enhance dialogue and work for substantive progress in the work of the Constitutional committee we welcome the extensive engagement by special Envoy Patterson with all parties on the implementation of resolution 2254 and expect Arab countries to step up coordination and facilitate the political settlement of the Syrian issue the counterterrorism situation in Syria remains complex and dire we support the Syrian government in taking necessary measures to combat terrorism and Safeguard the country's security and stability and in in strengthening counterterrorism capacity building the International Community should fight all terrorism in Syria with zero tolerance Mr President China has always supported the UN in maintaining positive interactions with the Syrian government and effectively implementing the new arrangement for crossb humanitarian assistance on the basis of fully respecting Syria's sovereignty and the ownership of the Syrian government in recent years un humanitarian funding for Syria has continued to decline over which we have expressed concerns multiple times the relevant donors should earnestly fulfill their commitments and effectively meet the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people it needs to be pointed out that unilateral sanctions and resource plundering have long hindered the recovery and development of Syria's economy and society and aggravated the humanitarian challenges facing the country we urge the relevant parties to immediately and unconditionally end these illegal actions thank you president I thank China for your statement and I'll give Au to the United Kingdom uh thank you president and thank you to special Envoy pedon and director Dalton for their their briefings president today in our our final session of the year on item we should reflect on the situation in Syria over the last 12 months 12 months in which there has been no progress on the political process no improvement in civil or political rights for syrians or on arbitrary detentions no improvement in the conditions to enable the safe voluntary and dignified return of refugees the humanitarian crisis has deepened and the capan trade has only grown as we enter the new year here we believe there are three areas where the council can meaningfully focus first the threat posed to the region from actors within Syria remains of grave concern we are particularly concerned by the continuing attacks against the global Coalition against asesh in Northeast Syria the increasing tensions along the Jordanian Syrian border and the reported strikes into Israeli territory by Assad regime and Iranian affiliation forces Regional escalation serves nobody's interest second un humanitarian access at babal Hower remains vital over three quarters of all un Aid transits via this Crossing and it remains a critical Lifeline for 4.1 million syrians the Syrian regime's current permissions expire on 13th of Janu January we fully expect them to be renewed crossline operations can complement but not replace the essential support which crossborder mechanisms provide finally we need to continue to support the UN special Envoy in his efforts to convene a meeting of the possible in the New Year Mr President 18th of December marked eight years since this Council unan unanimously adopted resolution 2254 as we have said many times implementation of this resolution Remains the only way to end this conflict and provide sustainable peace and stability to the Syrian people thank you I thank the United Kingdom for a Brazil thank you Mr President Brazil aligns itself with the statement made by Switzerland in our capacity as cope and holders of the Syrian humanitarian file we also thank special invoy gar p and director Lisa Dolton for their briefings I will now speak in my national capacity on the political aspects of the conflict but first I would like to express our sincere appreciation for the very constructive partnership we have had with Switzerland in facilitating the council's discussions on this file during a challenging year for Syria and the region as for the council as well Mr President 2023 marks a year of change in the doer notably being the first in many years without a resolution on crossborder assistance despite the Intensive negotiating process led by the copen holders Brazil and Switzerland currently three Crossing points are being used to deliver Aid to those in need with the consent of the Syrian government we welcome this important moment of cooperation between Syria and the humanitarian Community coordinated by and hope that it continues to move in the right direction for the benefit of the Syrian people and the future of the country the un's role in Aid delivery remains vital especially as a rising number of syrians depend on humanitarian assistance Mr President in recent months we have witnessed an escalation of violence in Syria and the region the situation in Northern Syria has worsened in the Northwest there have been reports of air strikes resulting in civilian casualties and significant damage to infrastructure these include attacks by the security Council designated terrorist group hayat Tahir arsham there have been disturbing reports of violence in the Northeast including attacks on civilian infrastructure humanitarian law must be respected civilians and civilian property must be protected during hostilities Syria has been repeatedly affected by the current escalation of the conflict in Israel and Palestine strikes on Alo and Damascus airports have disrupted unhas flights on more than one occasion the risk of regional escalation is real and deeply worried in the midst of this growing instability we urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint we emphasize the need to respect the sovereignty and territor Integrity of Syria in accordance with international law and the resolutions of this Council Brazil has consistently maintained that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict given the escalating humanitarian crisis and deteriorating security conditions in Syria an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire is urgently needed we are grateful to special Envoy G pson for his continuous efforts to reengage engage key stakeholders in the search for a solution to the current stalemate in the political process being so legitimately proud of its vast community of Syrian descent Brazil follows closely the situation in the country and fully shares the secretary General's assessment that quote nothing would do more to alleviate the suffering in Alleviate the suffering in in Syria then and steam the tide of humanitarian needs than an inclusive comprehensive and sustainable political solution to end the conflict consistent with Security Council resolution 22544 2015 end quote diplomacy and genu genuine political will must be given every opportunity to succeed that is not only hope but also work diligently towards a political outcome for Syria that will ultimate ately bring the peace stability and Reconciliation so desired by the Syrian people thank you I thank the representative of Brazil and I now give the floor to Japan uh thank you president first I thank special enoy uh Pon and OA director Miss dorden for their variable briefings Mr President we remain deeply concerned about the risk that the conflict in Gaza could escalate and expand across the region the security situation in Syria is already Fragile with sporadic crashes between Israel and Syria in Gan Heights Israel air strikes including on including on Syria's international airports ongoing hostilities in the north and various military crashes involving ISO and other Islamic resistance groups OA notes that the humanitarian impact of recent hostilities in the Northwest is the highest since 2019 any misjudgment could lead to a new large scale military conflict all parties concerned must exercise ma maximum restraint to avoid this clearly there is a need to refocus the political process to address the root causes of Syrian crisis which have long been ignored in this vein we highly appreciate special enoy penson's active diplomacy based on a stepbystep approach but unfortunately the prospects for reconvening the Constitutional committee which remains an important aspect of political process based on 2254 remain remain them even as the International Community focuses on Gaza conflict the importance of supporting Syrian red and Syrian owned dialogue should not should not diminish all parties must overcome their differences as soon as possible including on the issue of the venue of committee Mr President the humanitarian situation remains alarming and is worsening based on the Syrian government's decision cross border a through three border crossings have become a Lifeline for than 4 million people in the Northwest in particular barara border crossing crossing is vital and must remain open we also note the TW 12th round of crossline assistance is being imp planed by the end of this year yet OA warns that the low level of funding is unprecedented for humanitarian CR crisis of this scale with this in mind Japan has recently decided to provide approximately 32.6 million Us in addition additional humanitarian assistance to Syria which includes the AIDS for Syrian neighboring countries and we call on other donors to do the same Mr President regarding the refugees and internally displaced persons in Syria we are deeply concerned the conditions for safe dignified and voluntary returns do not currently exist furthermore it is urgent to address the issue of missing persons in this regard we welcome the recent report of the Secretary General on progress towards the full functioning of the independent institution on missing persons authorized by the UN General Assembly in June Japan will support this institution as it moves to begin substantive work in the near future as the year as the year end is approaching we express our sincere gratitude to Brazil for its role as a Syrian humanitarian copen holder together with Switzerland we would like to stress Japan's commitment to continue addressing the Syrian crisis together with the council with with the council including five new members thank you Mr President I thank Japan for your statement and I give the floor to the United Arab Emirates say Mr President I thank Mr gear Peterson and Miss Dalton for their briefings today as this is our last meeting on the Syrian political and humanitarian file during the UAE term at the security Council allow me to share a few of our thoughts on this file since 2014 the main focus of this Council has been to meet the needs of the Syrian people by establishing the crossborder mechanism to Syria and renewing it on a regular basis which has contributed to providing relief Aid to millions of syrians however we have noticed during our 2-year term on the security Council that the political track has not received similar attention by the council this is despite the fact that reaching a peaceful solution is necessary to address the humanitarian crisis in a suitable manner while Aid continues to flow through the three Crossings Babel Hawa Babel Salam and aray with the approval of the Syrian government and the efforts of the UN and humanitarian workers on the ground the security Council should simultaneously intensify its work on the political track and support the efforts of the special Envoy for Syria to reach a peaceful solution as the only means to end the suffering of the Syrian people and to restore security and stability in Syria and the broader region over the past several years the political track has not seen any concrete progress towards ending the Syrian crisis meanwhile the humanitarian and economic conditions have continued to deteriorate to unprecedented levels today there are more than 15 million syrians in need of humanitarian Aid the current situation requires the security Council to allocate the same level of attention to the Syrian crisis as it does to other crises on its agenda there's no doubt that ending the Syrian crisis will contribute to resolving one of its most serious consequences the displacement crisis today there are about 7 million displaced syrians this requires providing appropriate living conditions for the voluntary dignified and safe return of refugees and displaced persons including through the implementation of early recovery projects while we stress the importance the important work work of the Constitutional committee enhancing dialogue between the Syrian parties to end the crisis through a Syrian Le and Syrian owned process without any foreign interference we believe that merely holding meetings is not sufficient the political path extends beyond that and it requires all diplomatic efforts to be focused on resolving the Syrian crisis rather than only managing it also these efforts are necessary to address security conditions in Syria which will worsen if there's no political Solution on the horizon we have closely monitored with concern the violent escalation in the northwest of Syria along the Syrian borders and across many other regions in Syria this reaffirms the need to continue working towards deescalation and a ceasefire throughout all Syrian regions this issue has become particularly urgent in light of the escalating tensions in our region the conditions in Syria does not cannot afford any more escalation in closing Mr President we look forward to the day when Syria turns the page on conflict and regains its security and stability the Syrian people have an ancient civilization they deserve to lead better lives and a future with dignity on their Homeland as we have always known them over as has long been the case the UAE will continue to support Regional International efforts aimed at realizing these objectives I thank you I thank the representative of United Arab Emirates and I give the floor to Malta president let me Begin by thanking special Envoy pedon and director dorton for their briefings today in 2023 syrians faced the greatest level of humanitarian need since the beginning of this 13-year-old conflict as we come to the end of the year your Som Reflections remind us that next year must be better president over the past 12 months syrians have had to contend with the impact of multiple divor ing earthquakes and aftershocks a humanitarian crisis climate shocks and now major conflict on their border which threatens to bring even greater violence and turmoil to the region despite these compounding political and humanitarian crisis syrians remain dignified and resilient losing neither hope nor their voice in demanding a just end to this brutal conflict we commend the United Nations especially Ocha for their diligent work throughout the this year we thank them for their efforts in engaging with the parties to ensure the free flow and facilitation of humanitarian assistance both within Syria but also across borders at a time when it was needed most the continued functioning of The Crossings at babal Salam and alai has greatly supported the a delivery mechanism at babal Hawa a Crossing which remains a Lifeline to millions in the Northwest today we expect that once again the agreement for the use of babal Hawa by the UN and its humanitarian Partners will be extended before its expiration in mid January and that all Aid delivery modalities will remain in place as long as they are needed president violence has continued unabated in the north of the country protests have erupted in the South and seran airports remain subject to routine air strikes grave violations of children's rights remain a major concern to Malta especially with a record number of children internally displaced as we have heard throughout this year the roots of these humanitarian needs in Syria are political without adequate even modest progress on the political front we will be unable to progress towards a just lasting and deserved peace the stalling of the precious political momentum seen in the weeks directly after the earthquakes is deeply regrettable in such a context of deadly fragility the burden of political inaction is borne by the people of Syria those who continue to suffer and face daily indignities the burden is ever increasing with the cost of basic Commodities at an all high at an all time high and the humanitarian assistance at an alltime low as We Have Heard on many occasions here in this chamber shortages of these Essentials make women and girls more vulnerable in poverty violence and exploitation President we regret that despite extensive efforts by the special Envoy we have been unable to see the committee and steps for steps has yet to deliver the much needed confidence required to tackle the many pressing issues facing Syria we once again call for a nationwide ceas fire to help create the conditions for progress in line with with resolution 2254 13 years of fighting should should indicate that there is no military solution to this conflict an inclusive political process is the only way forward president as we enter 2024 we must neither become complacent nor numb to the challenges and suffering of those in Syria we must again redouble our political and humanitarian efforts to make sure sir's future does not mirror its present I thank you thank I thank Malta for your statement I give the floor to the representative of Albania thank you president at the outset allow me to thank special Envoy Pon and OA representative director Doon for their insights also I would like to extend Albania's full support for your good offices special invo Pon the magnitude of destrction as described described Once More Today by many has turned ser Syria into wreckage the rate of violence in the Northwest due to the governmental attacks and air strikes in it lip is the highest in three years and the humanitarian needs are larger than ever considering the situation in the region we Echo the call of the special invoy for maximum restrain the escalation in respect of the nation white ceasefire and in full compliance with International humanitarian law as as well as step for step measures to revitalize the political process based on un Security 2254 without breaking this political impass imposed by the Syrian regime the Invision of a brighter future for Syrian people becomes more difficult we urge the regime to use the momentum and not to delay the convening of the Constitutional committee as a practical necessary step to put back in track the Syrian Le un facilitated political process and we support the efforts of the special invo Pon in this regard president the humanitarian situation is an extension of the political stall mate the economic Devastation including inflation unemployment and the collapse of the essential Services has compounded the already D humanitarian situation putting communities into further desperation the International Community should stand in solidarity with Syrian people and deep on its support for the humanitarian response plan the aid delivery should remain predictable sustainable and transparent in this vein we urge for the extension of the authorization of the babal Wawa cross border beyond the January deadline president silence is no longer an option this Council should be United in supporting the people in Syria we own it to the millions of refugees who cannot return safely to their homes we own it to the children stripped stripped of their childhoods and victims of sexual and gender-based violence we believe that pursue pursuit of justice is fundamental to provide some relief for the victims of torure and gross gross human rights violations to restore human dignity and provide close osure to families of missing people or Deton the decision of last month of icj for Syria to take all measures to prevent Act of torture and other cruel treatment is a landmark for accountability in other potential positive note an upcoming launch of the independent institution on missing persons in Syria a mechanism supported by Albania when voted in the ga in June would provide an answer for the hundreds of thousand Thousand Lives interrupted for all those whose Faith remains unknown and voice silent above all it would bring an end to the suffering of the families who saw their loved ones forcibly separated in the shadows of the conflict and it is important this process to be transparent and coordinated with UN in concluding I want to reiterate that Albania will remain a strong advocate of the Syrian people in their Pursuit for justice and for a better future in dignity I thank you I thank the representative of Albania for your statement I will not make a statement in my national capacity as representative of Ecuador we take note and uh thank uh uh gy peton and Madame Lisa Doon of OA for their briefings and I welcome the the representatives of Syria turkey and Iran on to the meeting for Ecuador it is essential to step up diplomatic efforts that make it possible to re-engage dialogue and move towards a political solution to the situation in Syria in Conformity with the provisions of resolution 2254 we would encourage the special Envoy to continue conversations with the members of the aana group neighboring countries Regional partners and other actors inside and outside of Syria with the goal of bringing about the meetings of the Constitutional committee and to discuss substantive issues on it regarding its operations we agree with the special Envoy peton when he states that there is a direct relationship between the lack of progress in the political sphere and the risk of an escalation of violence these uh this impact will further complicate uh the security and humanitarian situation in Syria and the region we regret that the the current outbreak of conflict in the region has led to an escalation of violence in Syria and his increased threats to the civilian population the escalation of hostilities in Damascus idb and uh Western Aleppo speak to the fact that Syria is experiencing the most violent period since 2019 right now it's unacceptable that 45,000 people in the city of ea uh remain without access to uh sources of drinking water due to the military use of the water station which increases the risk of the spread of diseases such as cholera we would like to make an appeal to abide by International humanitarian law and in in this context to protect the civilian population infrastructure critical for their survival as well as uh humanitarian assistance actors the sheer number of people that require humanitarian assistance to survive in a situation of poverty malnutrition and displacement should serve as a reminder to the C that the council must continue to examine the situation in Syria furthermore we urge the government of Syria to offer responses on the condition and whereabouts of disappeared persons and those arbitrarily detained as well as to establish a transparent system of accountability we'd like to express the hope that all uh political and social sectors of society especially women take a meaningful part in the processes aimed at building a peaceful and pro prosperous F future in Syria with the goal of restoring a Civic space and the rule of law in conclusion I'd like to Express gratitude to Brazil and Switzerland for their commitment and work as co- penholders Ecuador will continue to support efforts to facilitate uh uh uh the work of the UN team on the ground and uh provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria thank you very much I go back to my role as president of the council and I now give the floor to the representative of this year in Arab Republic say the race thank you Mr President at the outset I congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the security Council for this month I also thank your predecessor the permanent representative of the People's Republic of China for successfully conducting the work of the council last month Mr President today's briefing on the political and humanitarian question in my country Syria is the last for this year it is held am midst ongoing threats and challenges my country has been facing years due to terrorism the illegal military presence of the US and Turkish forces in part of Syria the escalation of repeated Israeli attacks on Syria's vital facilities and the exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis due to the failure of donors to fund the humanitarian response plan in addition to the disastrous repercussions of the illegal unilateral coercive measures imposed by Western countries on my country therefore the condemnation of this Council of all these violations of Syrian sovereignty Unity territorial territorial Integrity international law and the charter of the UN is a legal responsibility and a humanitarian necessity Mr President we have listened to the briefing by Mr G Pon the special Envoy Syria and we continue to engage in dialogue and coordinate with him on his work the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and expatriates have met Mr Peterson last week in Geneva and stressed Syria commitment to a Syrian Le Syrian old political process without any external interference on the basis of the respect for Syria's Independence sovereignty unity and territorial Integrity Mr President it is regrettable that 75 years since the adoption of the universal Declaration of Human Rights we witness some Western countries continuing to act in contempt of the Declaration through their complicity and taking part in brutal crimes and genocide committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip and through their continued aggression against Syrian infrastructure and Lebanese infrastructure the latest of which was the rocket attack that targeted Reef deash on the 17th of this month Syria warns Israel against the consequences of continuing to persist in these attacks which could push the region towards a comprehensive escalation that cannot be contained and the consequences for the region and the world would be unsustainable ladies and gentlemen the US and the EU EU continue to impose unilateral inhumane sanctions that have significant impact on the enjoyment of the most basic human rights by syrians including children women and the elderly as they are denied food Medical Care electricity housing and essential Services the report of Miss Elena Doan the special repur on the negative impact of the unilateral cve measures on the enjoyment of Human Rights is proof of this and I quote the comprehensiveness of existing unil unilateral sanctions against the Syrian Arab Republic and the growing over compliance in particular following the imposition in 2019 of the Caesar civilian uh Syrian civilian protection act by the US of America have placed the country in a a straight jacket with serious adverse effects on the broad spectrum of Human Rights here would like to commend the adoption by the ga of the resolution unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries which requests the Secretary General to Monitor and study the impact on the affected States my delegation looks forward to the UN and esquad conducting the study on the impact of these ucms on un activities and the humanitarian situation in Syria Mr President the United States of America has not only directly engaged in the aggression against the Gaza Strip shoulder by shoulder with the Israeli war criminals and turning a blind eye to the repeated Israeli attacks on civilian infrastruct in Syria it continues its destructive policies by insisting on its illegal military presence on Syrian territory and its support for separatist milit its Looting of Syrian resources oil wheat and gas in addition to supporting and training the terrorist groups in alh and rban camps and in the same context the Turkish forces continue their illegal presence on our territory and they provide logistical military and financial support to terrorist organizations in northwest of Syria which are listed as terrorist groups by the security Council Mr President the Syrian Arab Republic affirms that the return of Syrian refugees to their Homeland is a fundamental objective Syrian refugees returning to their country enjoy like other Syrian citizens all the rights and duties guaranteed by the Constitution and the law La in this context measures and um steps have been taken to provide for the dignified Return of the refugees we continue to take a positive approach to overcome the repercussions of the terrorist war against Syria following the amnesty decree issued by the president of the Republic last month the Syrian government opened the door for regularizing um the security situation of all those who entered or left Syria illegally also we announced further measures related to the Recruitment and the laws on military service the government of Syria continues to coordinate and cooperate with AA towards improving the humanitarian situation in Syria my country has recently renewed for an additional 3 months the authorization granted to the UN to use bab Al Sal and alai Crossings out of our concern for humanitarian assistance to reach beneficiaries throughout the Syrian Arab Republic including in the Northwest however these joint efforts face the real problem of the low funding rate of the humanitarian response plan which did not ex exceed 33% and we are just days away from the end of the year the world food program due to the lack of funding has announced the end of its food assistance program starting next month throughout Syria my delegation is surprised that some un teams are reaching out to terrorist organizations listed by the security Council and we stress the need for them to stop this immediately we also stress that the continued presence of 's office in gazi andab is a waste of resources at the expense at the expense of those who really need the assistance and deserve it ladies and gentlemen we demand the halt of politicizing humanitarian work and putting political conditions on early projects and providing sustainable solution and an immediate end and unconditional end to ucms we also stress the need for the repeated Israeli aggressions on our civilian airports to stop this has led to cancellation of a total of 27 un humanitarian flights between the 12th of October and the 1st of December I thank you I thank the distinguished representative of the Syrian Arab Republic and I now give the floor to the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the name of God the compassionate the merciful Mr President we thank Mr Peterson the special Envoy and Miss D for OA from OA for their briefing Mr pres Mr President the humanitarian situation in Syria remains extremely challenging people are grappling with economic hardship were sent by the US imposition of unlawful sanctions adding to this challenge in the difficult under funding the humanitarian response plan with only 32% of the needed funds secured this significant shortfall is seriously hindering the capacity of the UN a commitment to impartial assistance is crucial to ensuring that the humanitarian Affairs serve the needs of the affected people without being influenced by political considerations donors must ref refrain from using Aid to exert political pressure on Syrian government Mr President on the political track we support the resuming of meeting of the Constitutional committee as an effective mechanism for advancing the political process we support the special envoice Affair and his diplomatic engagement with the parties to facilitate the resumption of committee meeting and to advance the political process the United Nations role should remain supportive ensuring that the entire process is Guided by Syrian leadership and ownership Iran stands in favor of Return of Syrian refugee to their Homeland the United Nations especially the High Commissioner for Refugee plays a central role in this undertaking we appreciate the support and support the engagement and constructive dialogue between the Syrian officials and the UN in addressing this pressing issue Mr president the security situation in areas controlled by illegal foreign forces and under occupation is a matter of serious concern the primary source of insecurity is unlawful presence and continued occupation of US military forces creating an environment conductive on to the growth of the terrorist activities within Syria and the broader region at the same time the Israeli regime persist in its Act of aggression against Syrian territory in parall with the atrocities in the Gaza Strip This regime engag in terrorism and aggr within Syrian borders intentionally targeting civilians and critical infrastructure we strongly condemn the terrorist attack on its military advisers in Syria on 2nd December where two Iranian advisor were mured during their mission to support the Syrian Army against terrorism we reaffirm inherent right of the Syrian Arab Republic under international law to take all necessary measures in response to terrorist attacks and act of aggression by the Israeli regime we warn against any proactive actions by the Israeli regime that could seriously impact peace and Security in the region Iran call on the security Council to condemn the stabilizing activities of the Israeli regime and its Sor violation of C sovereignty and territorial Integrity which pose a threat to peace and stability in the region in conclusion Mr President the groundless allegation made against my country by the representative of the United States in this chamber that was repeated by the UK is categorically rejected contrary to this unfounded claim Iran has consistently demonstrate its commitment to promoting peace and Security in the region the United States is fully responsible for its decade long aggressions along with other crimes and unlawful measures in our region obstructing the security Council from fulfilling its Charter based duties to establish a ceasefire and to stop the Israeli War Machine against the people of Kaza for more than two months has called in doubt the US real concerns about the spillover of the tension and peace and Security in the region I thank you I thank the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran and I now give the floor to the representative turkey thank you Mr President this week marks the 8th anniversary of the adoption of the security Council resolution 2254 the resolution reflects the Contours of a consensual road map for the achievement of a lasting solution to the Syrian conflict it remains most reliable framework for a sustainable way out of crisis which is through an inclusive Syrian owned Syrian L political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of people it mandates the UN to convince representatives of the Syrian regime and the opposition to engage inal negotiations on a political transition process and most importantly it stresses the undeniable fact that it is the Syrian people who will decide the future of their country all syrians including the opposition diaspora and refugees 8 years after its adoption in this chamber the vision goals and road map set forth in 2254 continue to constitute the international consensus for the resolution of the Syrian conflict that being said Syria has fallen off many raders recently currently fluidity of the situation in the country in The Wider region should not hold us back from addressing the root causes of the problem Syria is not a postconflict country it cannot be without guaranteeing its territorial integrity and political Unity nor can it be without a reinvigorated political process in line with resolution 2254 or without putting an end to the separatist agenda of terrorist organizations and creating conditions for for voluntary safe and dignified return of Syrian refugees our overall efforts toward the settlement of the conflict must be aimed at a genuine National reconciliation however this is not possible by playing against time and with half-hearted efforts that do not contribute to these objectives it is imperative to overcome the current inertia in the political track and to convene the ninth round of the Constitutional committee without further delay the status quo in Syria has become unsustainable not only politically but also in terms of its humanitarian and security dimensions in the 13th year of the conflict living conditions of the Syrian people are getting hard harder every day it is becoming more difficult to access basic needs economic crisis is worsening deprivation is an everyday reality for millions in the face of existing domestic problems as well as risks of regional conflagration of the conflict in Gaza the preservation of calm in Syria is of critical importance that is why we call on all relevant parties both in the region and Beyond to deescalate tensions Mr President regrettably today we heard once again a reference by un special Envoy to stdf an F shoot of pkk ypg terrorist organization as if it were a legitimate actor turkey's counterterrorism operations in the country are an exercise of its inherent right of self-defense in response to acts of terrorism of this organization pkk ypg Terror organization continues it its attempts to advance its separatist agenda in Syria these attempts include oppressing local populations forcibly Rec recruiting children military use and exploitation of Civilian infrastructure I would like to underline once again that empowering this terrorist organization serves no other purpose than sowing seeds of further instability in Syria and Beyond we will certainly do not allow this criminal entity to realize it Insidious designs Mr President as regards to situation we observe that serious shortcomings have emerged in the last months we would like to emphasize the importance of uninterrupted delivery of crossborder humanitarian assistance which helps 4.1 million people to hold on to life in Northwest Syria in this connection we once again underline significance of the UN monitoring mechanism which guarantees the transparency of the aid deliveries planned budget cuts on humanitarian assistance towards Syria are also a serious source of concern under these circumstances all stakeholders and donors have important responsibilities to help eliminate risks facing un humanitarian response in Syria we expect the continued use of Babel Hawa Babel Salam and alra border crossings for un Aid deliveries the continued engagement of the UN Security Council is essential in this regard turkey will will continue to support the people of Syria and all initiatives towards a sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict I thank you I thank the representative turkey for statement there are no further speakers on the list I now invite members of the council to informal consultations to continue uh discussing this item thank you the meeting's aour SS Ian Miller [Laughter]
