the militant Palestinian group Hamas smashes into Israel killing hundreds and triggering War and the former Prim Minister erod aled blames the government should Netanyahu resign yes you think he will he will be forced to top of the list of priorities how to rescue the scores of hostages kidnapped by Hamas and as Israel tries to reseal its borders can Israelis ever again trust their intelligence services and their much wared [Music] Army welcome to conflict Zone hi the late Israeli Statesman Shimon Perez used to remind interviewers that his people lived in a very rough neighborhood it's just got a whole lot rougher hasn't it yeah unfortunately as we have all witnessed in the last few days the vicious attack of Hamas has been one of the most brutal that I think anyone can remember in the modern history this was uh uh an attack against civilians with a an explicit purpose of killing as many people as possible the most brutal and vicious uh way and uh this is like uh the same as Das except with greatest success unfortunately in comparison do you believe this was a oneoff Invasion a one-off attack or could more be planned and from outside Gaza next time well I don't I don't look Hamas is engaged in a conflict violent conflict against Israel for since its inception for more than 25 years uh and uh they don't want to make any peace with Israel they don't want to recognize Israel they don't have any actual any uh territorial claims to Israel as May other Palestinians have in the West Bank they just want to destroy the state of Israel and I think that it is quite clear that they are inspired and operated and by the Iranians they are the long arm Iran has a long um in the south of Israel which is Hamas in the North of Israel which isbah and their attacks are part of a more comprehensive plan of Iran to upset the entire balance in the Middle East and to try and shake the foundations for the state of Israel Iran has denied any direct involvement and the Americans themselves said they haven't seen so far any evidence to suggest they were involved you have you is this a gut feel feeling on your part that they were involved or the attack was in their interest do you have any evidence yeah we have some signs in Israel I can't of course go into details but we have some signs that it's been inspired and coordinated by Iran the head of the Revolutionary guards of Iran was visiting leanon just a few days before the attack and as you know the head of the uh operational uh activities of Hamas is based in beuth so uh there is a good reason to believe that they were cooperating and coordinating and if that were confirmed would Israel take action direct action against Iran I don't think that at the present time uh we have any um plan to attack Iran in a comprehensive manner I mean with military with planes you know air attack or missile attack against Iran this is not the first priority right now what we have to do is to focus on the south part where it all started now and in as long as Iran will not take part directly uh in a military action against the state of Israel I doubt that we will initiate any attack against them one question seems to dominate at the moment and that is what to do about the scores of Israeli hostages which have been kidnapped by the Palestinian islamist group Hamas what what do you think the government will do about the hostages I must say I'm not certain that I know and I'm not certain that even if I knew that I'd like to share publicly with anyone including you at this time because I think it's very sensitive and really involves the lives of people if they were uh capable of butchering raping mothers and then killing them and killing the babies in their homes they will not hesitate to do the most brutal things against the uh Israelis that are now held by them in Gaza so uh we certainly will do things I doubt that there is any basis for negotiations with them because I don't think that they want negotiations I think that they want to release all the Palestinian uh prisoners in the state of Israel which are held in Israel and they will try to use the Israelis held by them as a as a trade uh for a trade uh with this what will be the reaction how we will handle it what will be the other activities that we may plan uh what are the surprises that we are preparing I think that this is not something that should be discussed if you were in power would you do a deal with Hamas deals have been done prisoner swaps have been done in the past there was gillad Shalit in 2011 a thousand is a th000 Palestinian prisoners were released to get him home no my answer is no and this was my answer when I was bye minister in a much so to say better deal was offered to me uh in exchange for gilad shal at the time I was prime minister and I turned it down I thought that we shouldn't uh make it and that uh it's not worthwhile and by the way one has to remember I'm not sure that you are aware of it but all the leadership of hamash today all the leadership of hamash today which has been responsible for what they have perpetrated against us on Saturday is made of the ex prisoners that were released in the gilat Shalit deal so uh I think that turns out that that deal was bad when it was made in the first place uh just the exchange of more than thousand prisoners for one soldier but I think that the long range outcome of this deal is really devastating from the point of view of Israel and we have to be very careful in this kind of format in this kind of pattering of deal but that doesn't mean that there are not ways that exist to release the the Israeli who are held by them but again as I said I think it should be dealt with very delicately and not publicly Mr ahed there's been plenty of talk about systemic failures in Israeli intelligence that led up to this attack but you blame the government for this you called it the outcome of the arrogance of the present government arrogance about what well I'll tell you two things if I may number one I think it will be a mistake I don't mind that they will make it by the way but it will be a mistake to assume that Israeli intelligence fails completed not at all we saw everything we have watched all their preparations and it was one onone with everything that we have uh scanned and noticed and and looked at for a long period of time the problem was that they we misled ourselves that they will not do it we because of what you quoted the kind of arrogance who are they the Hamas these uh terrorist organizations they are not an army they are not capable of doing things they will not do it you know we are strong we are threatening we are powerful we can stop everyone and so on and so forth and actually uh uh a few days before the holiday which Saturday is a Jewish holiday and this was also the Suka holiday which over left the same day we pulled out a group of uh um a few platoons of soldiers from Gaza from that border from this position into the West Bank to protect the settlers in the West Bank uh at that time so uh this was a reflection of the kind of indifference and complacency and and arrogance which I think has has characterized the attitude of the Israeli leadership and that's why I put the blame on the Israeli leadership their focus was the West Bank the focus was how to protect the settlers the Messianic Jews that were trying to upset the balance in the West Bank instead of protecting the Israeli citizens which live in the state of Israel in a territory which is not disputed which can't be claimed by the Palestinians because we have a vacu entirely out of Gaza into a territory which is recognized by the International Community to be part of the state of Israel and the fact also is that for a period of time for years netan explicitly preferred to deal with Hamas in order not to have to deal with the uh Palestinian Authority why because he didn't want to negotiate neate peace with the Palestinian Authority and therefore he uh put all the efforts in order to create a certain rapport with the Hamas we know that the Hamas was financed with the assistance of Israel for years by hundreds of millions of dollars that came from Qatar with the assistance of the state of Israel with the full knowledge and support of the Israeli government led by netan when he took over in 2009 said that his primary responsibility and priority is to destroy Kamas and throughout the period that he was prime minister he made every possible effort in order to buildas rather than to destroy it and in a certain way the the the expansion of the uh Kamas and the strengthening of Hamas is largely also a result of this policy of Nan Mr ahed Israel can move into Gaza with the aim of rooting out Hamas killing as many of its Fighters as it can but what then this won't be this wouldn't be a costree operation for Israel far from it would it it's very hard to answer this question number one because if this is what Israel is going to do I don't think that we should spell it out publicly and make announcement that we are going to do this we have to keep a certain degree of surprise if we came which I don't know I have to say I'm not now in the government I'm not in any official position I'm outside I can only judge it on the basis of my experience and my knowledge being in the center stage for so many years and taking these decisions when I was in charge I think number one it is definitely itely true that Hamas is the enemy and Hamas has to be dealt with how to do it by trying to uh uh penetrate into with the ground forces of Israel directly frontally as we have done in the past I don't know I don't want to join in this rhetoric what I say is this this is a long story it's going to take time it requires a very careful planning and a very calculated action we have to do it in a manner that will bring forth a practical results that will be useful for the security of the South part of the state of Israel and yet at the same time will not antagonize the International Community which presently is very much sympathetic and in favor of the state of Israel I'm afraid that if these attacks which Tak taken place over the last few days will continue and more and more buildings in Gaza will be destroyed and the smoke and the fire will spread all over the screen and this will be broadcasted day in and day out all over the world soon enough the uh the emotion and the sympathy which has now spread all over the world in favor of the state of Israel will change and Israel needs this framework of support in order to be able to achieve the Strategic interests that we want to achieve the UN the International Community has already expressed concern about the total Siege um electricity water food being blocked from going in which would you have done that I don't want to say what I would have done I said before I can say what I wouldn't have done but I'll tell you this the uh humanitarian pressure might be a reasonable vehicle in order to create a separation between the civilian population which is not involved in the terrorist organizations one of the problems of of that we encounter in this context is the relative flexibility and freedom thats in Gaza because the uh civilian population which may not necessarily be involved in Terrorist actions give them support So how do you separate between the two this is a question is this the way to do it I'm not enough into the center of decision making in order to answer this question but I don't rule it out let's talk if we may about the politics going on at this moment what the government might do next is it right to form what they call a national Unity government or attempt to form one I I'm not enthusiastic about it to put it prly I I don't think that any person that has a minimal respect for himself and for his values would want to see with b and with SM rich and what they representing as long as they are Central members of the government one is the Minister of Finance and in charge of the territories the other is the Minister of National Security and as long as they are members of the cabinet that stay out should Netanyahu resign yes do you think he will he will be forced to it will take some time it will take some time you know the these kinds of reactions have to build up a certain momentum before they erupt in a force that is UN I remember you're too young so you can't I remember the Y keeper War uh years ago uh the war started with a terrible shock it's true that subsequently Israel won the war and as a result of the of the achievement mil achievements of Israel at the end of the day we also created the circumstances that allowed eventually Israel and Egypt to make peace but uh that didn't save the government of Baya uh three weeks or four weeks after the elections after the war started there was an election in Israel and and in the election the party of gold Mayo won decisively but four months later they were forced to resign because the buildup of opposition in the public was too powerful for them to resist and they had to resign and I think that similar thing will happen sooner now than it was then netan is history he's done he will continue to be prime minister for a short while but he is gone and for good reasons Mr Omar whatever whatever I so I thought so before the war for other reasons but I think that what we have witnessed in the last few days is just the ultimate proof for the accusations and the allegations we made against the efficiency the focus of the government the values of this government and the ability of this government to uh abide by his commitments whatever Hamas has done this time it's it's very different in scale from anything it's attempted before in in your view why did they launch this particular Invasion and and why now there's a strong suggestion around that they wanted to torpedo a peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that would have left the Palestinians that they thought further isolated in the cold do you buy that as a reason for what we've seen what we've witnessed oh it's a legitimate interpretation I don't know if this is true I I don't have the intelligence that can tell me whether this something that they have deliberated what I can say are two things if they wanted to torpedo the uh the agreement between America Saudi Arabia and Israel then definitely they for the time being they have a measure of success I don't know if this agreement will come but I don't think that the reason for doing it if they if that's what they wanted to do was because they thought that the Palestinians will be left over by disagreement maybe they to the country they were afraid that as a result of this agreement there can be a basis that will force the Israeli government to the negotiate with the PLO and they don't want negotiations you have to understand something the worst enemy of Hamas is a potential peace between Israel and the Palestinians so if the agreement with Saudi Arabia America and Israel may have somehow uplifted the chances for some contacts between the Israeli government and the P the Palestinian Authority between netan and Abu maim that may have led into meaningful negotiations this was the threat that they wanted to uh to break because they don't care for the Palestinians to be left over on the contrary they want the Palestinians to be left over because this is what gives them the kind of appeal to the population you've always supported a two-state Vision um but you couldn't make it work when you were prime minister although you said this week I would have made peace with Abu Maan a long time ago yeah is is the is the two-state concept finished now as far as you're concerned no no look there's no other solution there is all only a or a one-state solution a one-state solution means that if Israel will be a bational state with millions of Palestinians living within the state of Israel and almost inevitably even if bang and swri will oppose it and affections in the Israeli population that support them will oppose it will have to give all the Israelis that all the Palestinians that will live within the state of Israel uh full rights Poli Rights Voting Rights and what not and that will create a terrible confrontation of a much worse kind than what we have witnessed on Saturday because then they will be within the state of Israel part of the state of Israel they will have also the benefit of political vot votes and rights on the one hand and the freedom to do whatever they want to do in opposition to the state of Israel because they don't want to be part of the state of Israel they want to have their own independent state and uh to exercise their right of self-determination so I think that the the worst dream that we may have is uh one uh State solution and therefore the only alternative which can bring a certain degree of stability on the long run not immediately of course not in a matter of few years will take time it will be very difficult for sides to go over the 55 or 60 years of occupation but this is the only option if I may say just one more thing in this respect I hope and I spell it out in the most in the most clear manner to all the friends of Israel that when we are through with the present crisis that the same friends of the state of Israel that support us now and and give Israel the moral uh freedom to take very severe actions against the Hamas will come back to Israel and say and now you have to do what needs to be done in order to provide the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Palestinian Authority with the freedom to exercise their right for self-determination which means for a two-state solution very brief because we're running out of time how scared are you right now for your country I'm not scared for the country Israel is a very strong we have an unbelievably powerful civil uh Society unbelievably powerful civil society and I absolutely trust in the strengths determination the enthusiasm and the devotion which is manifested on these days by all sections of population all right I'm scared of the Israeli government I'm scared of this group of fogs violent Messianic fogs run by a reckless irresponsible person netan which is leading the state of Israel we have to get rid of them and we have to get rid of Hamas first of Hamas and then we will have to make all the within the state of Israel all right thank you very much for being on conflict Z thank you thank [Applause] you
