the US has warned that all of Gaza is facing starvation Secretary of State Anthony blinkin made the remarks as he prepared to head back to the Middle East he'll meet top officials in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in the hope of brokering a ceasefire and ramping up a deliveries to Gaza there has been growing unease among Israel's Alli allies about the human cost of its war against Hamas which began after the radical islamist group's terror attack on October the 7th these children are waiting to receive a portion of food being prepared by Volunteers in Rafa this could be the only meal for some gazin in [Applause] days we have no option but to come here we're from Gaza City we have no money and we're living in tents the charity is providing us with food as food shortages are becoming more acute every day the World Health Organization has accused Israel of provoking an imminent famine this is completely man-made and it's it's avoidable we need more food to come in simply on one hand because of the hostilities there is no uh way of producing food inside Gaza secondly there is a restricted access simply what is getting in is is not enough and even getting things around Gaza is complicated because of the the level of destruction of of of infrastructure along with accusations that Israel is blocking humanitarian relief into Gaza Israel denies the claim blaming eight agencies for the distribution only a trickle was allowed to enter Gaza City on Monday night famine is particularly looming in the Northern parts of the strip people there are surviving in makeshift tents with barely any food a new UN report say that acute malnutrition is accelerating here where Secretary of State Anthony blinken expressed concern about the food shortages 100% of the population in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity that's the first time an entire population has been so classified um we also see again uh according to in this case the United Nations 100% the total of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance in the midst of Moun calls for an increase in Aid fears of widespread malnutrition across the strip are rising as Israel says it is still preparing to launch a ground assault in Rafa in the South Martin Frick is the Germany director of the un's world food program here in Berlin and he joins us now welcome to DW thanks so much for your time today uh we're hearing is imminent could you give us a sense of what famine actually means for the people who experience it well that report issued the last warning and when we are talking about famine being imminent that means that people have tried everything to survive and everything they tried is now exhausted people are eating Fe F people are eating grasses everything that is somewhere available and even that is exhausted by now this is what famine means and if not immediately remediated we will see more particularly children dying from Hunger in Gaza a consequence of famine is long-term growth problems you mentioned particularly how this is hitting children so that in effect means doesn't it that this crisis in Gaza now will be negatively affecting People's Health especially Children's Health for decades to come that is indeed the case we had already in December one out of five children being acutely malnourished this is now going up to one in three and that is not a temporary situation a child that is not receiving enough nutritious food in the critical time of growing up risk to be um disabled for a lifetime shorter than average but but it can also affect the cognitive abilities of children what is the world food program focusing on at the moment in terms of getting Aid to Gaza well we are fully prepared to bring massive amounts of food into Gaza more than 100 more than a thousand trucks are standing ready outside Gaza we urgently need access particularly to the northern part of Gaza in order to to bring the enormous quantity of food that are necessary um now in we also need access to the port of ashot which is about 30 Mi north of the Gaza Strip on Israeli territory in order to bring these quantities of food in most importantly more access points so we can bring in the trucks to transport the food that is so urgently needed now in Gaza can the worst still be averted absolutely absolutely but we need to act immediately and we need to make sure that the food that stands ready that the trucks that are ready to roll in actually can cross the border checkpoints much faster at a much bigger quantity and also at border crossing points in the north that are still unavailable for humanitarian transports Martin Frick Germany director of the un's world food program thank you so much for your time today thank you we can get more from hen beler a journalist who was based in Gaza in the first months of the war he's joining us now from Aman welcome hasm um what are your sources in Gaza telling you um about the food crisis right now the crisis in Gaza is clear um um that it's very deep um along I mean the war is ongoing um there is bombardment there are strikes there um people dying every day houses are destroyed but along of that people Ordinary People only and um um not thinking about the air strikes but also thinking about the food how to secure food especially in Ramadan it's very hard for them to be displaced intense in a very cold weather um uh with no food even the type of food is is is delivered is very hard and it's not the usual that they used to to consume before it's more um about canned food um um barly they have bread barly they have vegetables even if it was available the prices is very hard and very high um for for many people to afford MH do Palestinians in Gaza believe that the international pressure that's now being put on Israel that this will lead to more land Crossings being opened and and hopefully more Aid being allowed in well people in Gaza they're very desperate and disappointed from all the parties uh Palestinians International Arabs and every day that in all reports you would see that people are blaming everybody for the crisis that they are living in they don't think that any pressure would make any change on their reality um of course it's important I would say that the the international pressure made uh made some food uh to continue entering Gaza um um um there's some limitation of types and uh quantities um there is another crisis the crisis with the ownera uh the crisis about the crossings and inspecting and scanning the the trucks uh at the Israeli sides um there was a experiment of allowing some food from uh a gate between Israel and Gaza STP and um um in the last last week but um with the air drops um it's still the crisis is there but it it helps but people in Gaza believe that it's not enough MH there have been reports of Looting of people being killed while trying to reach uh Aid deliveries can you describe how difficult how dangerous it is for gazans to to try and get their hands on the aid that does make it into Gaza as long as there is no no Law and Order in in Gaza um Israel is um is destroyed all the entities that um uh belong to the Law and Order like police and others uh there was no mechanism uh uh to distribute the food mainly in the north that people were very in in in a brink of of starvation and famine um they were gathering at um certain points in um um Kuwaiti roundabout and abuli roundabout in the the the western side uh of the city waiting for the trucks to come in and it's very risky and very dangerous where the tank Israeli tanks are so they they jump on the tanks with with very limited number of flour um um to get some of them are killed according to the reports by by by shooting some with with ramping and and and stepping up or by uh uh you know uh the the pushing and and and so people don't don't know recently in the recent two days that there was more organized uh trucks loads like arrived to certain areas um but some reports that you know from Gaza coming that the police police officers were in charge of of organizing and secure the trucks were were targeted and killed Hasam to what extent has the aid that has reached Gaza via airdrops and by sea to what extent has that brought any relief to the people there well it's it's it's a people in Gaza believe it's a gure we are talking about a very limited number of of air drops uh 200 uh a day in in a place that in open mouth is and there is a deep starvation there um um the people in need of of food for long time and it's not easy uh for for for everybody it it dropped in in certain areas is not the whole people can go and jump and people rush to the area who be there first who can get the others wouldn't um as long as there was no Law and Order in the area so um who stronger can get so what about that you know women children sick people they can't get anything so it drops wasn't the solution for for the for the crisis especially in the north um uh because because of the the uh the quantities uh the qualities and the way of people getting it journalist ham belala reporting from Aman ham thanks so much for your insights
