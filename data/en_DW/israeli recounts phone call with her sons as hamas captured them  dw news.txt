ranana gome is one of many Israelis whose lives changed Forever on the 7th of October when Hamas terrorists are crossed into Israel killing more than 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 her two sons aged 12 and 16 were among those taken hostage we uh all woke up to the red alert at 6:30 Saturday morning October 7th I was away uh they slept alone at my house um they're 12 and 16 on a normal World teenagers can can do that every now and again um and um I called them just to see that they uh know the you know the routine unfortunately that that they need to go into the safe room which is uh the eldest um bedroom as well um and they were and um then I just stayed uh with them on the phone every few minutes to you know they were scared obviously there was a barriage of rockets falling at us um uh so well uh they were quite scared um at a certain point they said they started hearing gunshots outside the house and I told them uh it was probably the Army protecting us uh I started getting text messages from other members of community um we live in a small community of about 400 people me so we started getting texts um saying that there are terrorists walking outside freely uh Dressed in the uh IDF army uniform um and you know telling people not to go outside and not to open doors and then the texts went into saying that they started breaking into houses and uh taking people away and burning families in inside their house uh just uh half an hour an hour later I can't give you know the timeline is is all blurred um they said they called me and they said they hear someone breaking in uh they whispered and I asked them to be quiet and to stay on the line with me and just a few minutes later I could hear a few people uh speaking between them probably two or three people speaking between them in Arabic and the daughter safe room broke even though my eldest held it very very strongly he's a strong lad but he couldn't hold it anymore and they opened the the safe rooms door and uh I could hear my youngest saying on the phone well I could hear him on the phone saying to them uh don't take me I'm too young and that was it the line cut off and uh that's the last I've heard of him um and they were dragged into Gaza and I don't even know I don't know where they are and where they're about or who they're with or even there if they're still alive and what have you heard from the the the government has anyone been in touch has anybody told you what what steps are being taken to try and secure their release uh no well they they did you know there's always someone who's supposed to be like a contact person on cases like this but they don't have any new information that they can give me uh and I presume that even if they were to have new information they wouldn't give it to me and they you know there's 200 families in Israel waiting for this those news and um obviously it's uh it's it might work against um the actual um release if um if they were to give any information so and last on on Friday we we heard that the news that two people had been uh released that must have given you some hope it has actually yes um you know I would say that um um as they know that we treasure life they will keep them uh they will keep them safe because they know they're worth a lot more alive so this is my hope and obviously to see those two ladies uh released uh in a good condition and U in good health it it did give me a lot of hope that uh that there that there can be a good end to this tragedy and meanwhile um the IDF does appear to be building up to a ground offensive in Gaza um part of the aims of which is getting the hostages back is that the right thing to do to go in on the ground um obviously I'm not the um um IDF chief commander and um don't want to be um and I'm not an army uh expert so um it's it's a bit unfair to ask me as a mother obviously I don't want the IDF to go in before they take my children out and to be honest I'm against War at for for any uh on the other hand I saw them as neighbors all these years and look what they've done to us they've murdered and raped and butchered people and families complete families were butchered in their beds so um I must say I don't have uh the the answer to that all I know is I want my children back home now before any other um uh move is done or taken um I don't know what the best way to get them out is I if it was up to me obviously I'd rather have um some kind of transaction and have their prisoners released doesn't matter in a year's time we'll have another you know 5,000 or 6,000 prisoners in our in our sales given hot meals and hot showers and telephones so all I know is I want my children back home now understood and and clearly this has been a terrible traumatizing experience why did you agree to talk to us about it uh because I want the world to know and I want the world to uh enlist to the effort of releasing them children should not be a part of the war game they're not bargain ships and um I think the world uh has um a great deal of power on Palestinians uh the EU has a lot of power Qatar has a lot of power the US has a lot of power uh a lot of money is flowing into the Palestinian um state so to speak uh it was supposed this money was supposed to build a Palestinian state but it instead it was used to build an a terror organization and I think the world should know that and the world should again Enlisted the effort of releasing my children and the other children there are 31 children who are uninvolved in any in any way um I want the world to enlist to their to the effort of releasing them now I want them home now there's no and you know there's no reason to hold them and and the first thing you'll do say to them when you get them home I don't want to say anything I just want to hug them and have them in my arms and want to make them feel safe again and feel home again even they don't have a home to come back to but they have me to come back to well thank you for telling your story and sharing your story with us and we wish you um the best of all possible outcomes renina gome a mother of two boys held hostages by Hamas
