Israel has dampened hopes for peace in Gaza saying it will pursue the war until it has achieved all of its aims US President Joe Biden has presented a proposal for a permanent ceasefire and the return of hostages held by Hamas crowds turned out in Tel Aviv to urge the government to accept the truce following months of rallies by hostage families demanding more actions to free their loved ones Hamas has responded positively to the truce proposal Biden says it would be a mistake to pass up a chance to end the war let's bring in Aaron David Miller now he's an expert on the Israeli Palestinian conflict and served as an adviser to several us secretaries of State welcome to the program so I'd like to start off by asking you and thank you for joining us I'd like to start off by asking you what your take on the proposal is uh as it was laid out by President Biden I mean it's a fine plan it's phased It's relatively realistic although there's so much about phase two that needs to be negotiated nailed down problem is not the text of a 4 and a half page agreement problem is whether or not the current leaderships uh principal decision maker yakis sinir on one hand in the government of Israel on the other the war cabinet has already approved this the question is whether or not if brought to the full cabinet um the full cabinet will approve it Hamas has no stake in responding comprehensively uh quickly I mean their calculation is um Israel is under increasing pressure from the US the International Community hostage families senoir is trading Time Tunnel and hostages for what he really wants which is the preservation of his leadership and the uh the continuation of Hamas in some form uh in the politic of post October 7 Gaza so right now I think this proposal is increasingly fraud because you don't hand the sense of urgency on either side that matches the Pres President Biden's let's talk a little bit about that sense of urgency if we could uh this proposal was essentially laid out by Biden but he said it was put forward by Israel however Israeli leaders have walked that back and say they will continue to pursue their military AIMS in Gaza can you make sense of that well the war cabinet approved it it doesn't mean that every cabinet minister agreed uh and netan also has Al put out several statements which raise some questions although I know one thing about negotiations parties interpreted to their respective publics uh as they want um so I I I think again uh if Hamas responds with a yes or a no or imposes additional conditions uh there may be no need for um the proposal to be brought to the full cabinet if if Hamas wants to play this game tactically they would agree to this and let the full cabinet the full Israeli cabinet decide which could prove highly embarrassing to the Prime Minister uh whose concent majority rests with 65 seats and above all his his major objective is to main maintain himself in power that's part of the problem I have no brief for Hamas a vicious terrorist organization that killed in discre ently raped and U murdered and tortured and took hostages let's be very clear Benjamin netan was the worst possible leader at the worst possible time in the worst possible circumstance and therein with respect to both hamas's and Israel's motives in this therein lies the problem all right I'm afraid that's all we have time for right now that was Aaron David Miller thank you very much for your anoun is thank you now let's bring in Sultan Barakat he's a professor for Public Policy an expert on conflict management and the founder of the center of for conflict and humanitarian studies at the Doha Institute welcome to DW what's your take on this proposal is it a good one well obviously it's a good one in the sense that it is probably the only hope we have at the moment to bring an end into the conflict and to allow the two sides to reach a reasonable uh agreement it will never be it will never meet the main objective of either side but I think it provides a compromise and it's interesting that if you look at the details it's not really very far from what Hamas has accepted uh 10 days ago or so uh the real problem remains on the side of Israel and I think what's happening now it seems like there is a split within the war cabinet within Israel with Gans Benny Gans may be taking the lead now and I suspect what he what has been proposed by Biden has largely been worked by him and the head of the Israeli intelligence because it is very much against what Netanyahu would like to see and what Galant would like to see Netanyahu and Galant are still determined to see the end of Hamas first uh that the total Destruction of its military capability and its Governor's capability and for them that is total Victory and then they're willing to talk about uh potential withdrawal so what we have at the moment I think it's it's potentially could be a good a good start it uh it really depends on how Israel reacts to the proposal um Hamas says it views the deal positively why would Hamas take any deal as long as Israel has a stated goal of eliminating them militarily well I mean what they've taken from the deal are the key issues the deal talks about a ceasefire permanent ceasefire it is it is calling for Israeli withdrawal although it's talking about withdrawal from inhabited areas and there aren't many inhabited areas continue me liveable lived in areas by the Palestinians in Gaza and it is also talking about a commitment to reconstruction and a commitment to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages so those elements have always been the elements that Hamas uh has called for uh obviously they will continue to be suspicious of Israel and its reaction and whether it will implement the three phases as Biden uh forese them because from The Experience so far they don't seem to listen to what Biden say and Biden is not able to really Implement any of his threats he has introduced a number of lines for Israel over the last seven months all those red lines were crossed and there was no consequence so uh I think the only worry on the mind of Hamas today would be whether if they were to go into this uh phased approach whether the Israelis will go phase one phase two the release of the hostages and then they will have have a change of mind of heart and go after them for the total Destruction uh but at the moment uh both sides really have very little to bargain with uh Hamas as you you could see are pushed right against the fence and the Israelis day by day are losing their International allies they're losing their International reputation now it's not only the icj after Israel the ICC has called for the uh warrant by for Netanyahu and Gant so they are really in a very difficult position thank you very much silan Barakat Professor for Public Policy thanks for your analysis let's take a look at the proposal in more detail President Biden said that in a first phase lasting six weeks Israel and Hamas would enter a full and complete ceasefire Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza Hamas would release a number of hostages including the elderly women and the wounded in exchange Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian detainees humanitarian aid for Gaza would surge at this point with at least 600 trucks being allowed into Gaza each day in the proposal's second phase Hamas would release all remaining living hostages including male Israeli soldiers all hostilities would end and Israeli forces would fully withdraw from Gaza once these steps have been accomplished Hamas would hand over the remains of all dead hostages it still holding Rubble in gaza's cities would then be cleared and reconstruction of the territory backed by the us Europe and international institutions would begin turn to conflict negotiator Oliver mcin who joins us Oliver uh thanks for your time there's a lot of detail in what Biden announced as a conflict negotiator do you think that was a good idea well there's nothing new in what he is saying is what they have done is reordered the the timetable as where now um I think it's good to have a an overall plan if he had just announced okay a 60-day ceasefire in which certain hostages will be exchanged and then we'll see what'll happen I think it would be less appealing and we probably wouldn't have got the positive response we did from Hamas but at the end of the day I think he needs to go further um it's no good announcing it unless he is prepared to really stand by his words it's time to see the war in Gaza end it um only America I think can actually achieve that goal um because it's only they that can have the real influence on the Israeli um cabinet at present and that is they Supply the means by which America um Israel can prosecute the war if they are serious about ending it then they must tell them this this is the time you have to make a deal and then meanwhile you have Netanyahu saying that any deal must include quote the elimination of Hamas militarily that wasn't in the proposal announced by Biden so where do things stand what does that mean for negotiations well I say I would think Min it complicates it unbelievably and I think intentionally right from the beginning Netanyahu set two goals first the elimination of Hamas and alongside that the return of the hostages now those goals for anyone familiar with hostage negotiation and achieving a level of agreement that could um enable this to happen is acutely aware that these are incompatible and I see um in a way Netanyahu um nodding the head to Biden on the one hand but at the same time saying to his support and those in his cabinet and outside his cabinet there's a real cross party consensus that Hamas should be eliminated for the future security of Israel he's he's nodding to them as well so you know it remains to be seen how this will progress the Big Challenge I think is moving from not getting number one the 30-day ceasefire but it will be moving from that first stage if it goes successfully into the second stage and what effectively I think the Americans are asking Netanyahu to do in agreeing to a permanent ceasefire is in fact to end his political career because many would say that once the military operation is over then the day of accountability begins and many predict that will be when Netanyahu will have to stand down as prime minister so I see lots of obstacles in in the way and along the way very quickly I mean you mentioned ceasefire How likely is that part of it well a good positive response if the reporting is right from a m hopefully it's a first step the people of Gaza 2.3 million people are enduring insufferable conditions daily which will have long-term consequences on their whole um way of life there it's Prof changes have taken place we need a ceasefire now and hopefully both sides will for no other reason than pure humanitarian reasons will agree to um that stage and then hopefully political pressure will affect the second stage Oliver mcternan thank you so much for joining us
