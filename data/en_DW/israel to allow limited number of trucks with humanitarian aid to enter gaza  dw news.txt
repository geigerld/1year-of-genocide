well Israel has confirmed that from Friday it will allow a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian Aid to enter Gaza the raft for Crossing from Egypt is the only gas and Crossing that Israel doesn't control Israel controlled its Crossings and began air strikes after Hamas launched those Terror attacks on October the 7th killing at least 1,400 people the UN reports that more than 3,000 deaths in Gaza since then the water may be flowing but there's no guarantee it's safe to drink gaza's water supply is on the brink of collapse the United Nations says more than 2 million face dehydration and waterborne diseases as Gaza runs dry many have no other option than to drink contaminated water often we wait for 2 hours and at the end we find out there is no water anymore water is life no human can survive with without water whether it's drinkable or not no one can survive without water we fill these bottles just to go back and find that it's not drinkable in the South gin waited for hours to buy fuel the population here has swelled after hundreds of thousands fled from northern Gaza I've been waiting four or 5 hours and now they say the diesel has run out we don't know what to do we don't know where to go the Israelis told us to evacuate to this place but they kill us here then they say go to that place they follow us and kill us there also why do they tell us to evacuate just kill us in our homes Israel has blocked supplies through its Crossings into Gaza following the terror attacks by Hamas after talks with Israel and Egypt the US announced a deal to allow a limited amount of aid from Egypt into Gaza but the United Nations says the besieged territory needs more we urgently need a mechanism agreed by all relevant parties to allow for the regular provision of emergency needs throughout Gaza to get the level of distribution of assistance up to what it was before these terrible weeks of 100 trucks a day providing assistance throughout Gaza to people in need we need to get back to that level of ambition in neighboring Egypt at the Rafa border crossing trucks are waiting for the green light to enter Gaza and deliver the desperately needed Aid well nor shawaf is humanitarian policy adviser for Oxfam in the Middle East she joins us from Beirut welcome to DW um just talk us through why it's so difficult at getting Aid into Gaza indeed it's very to get Aid into Raza at this very moment I would say it's even impossible um aside from the crossings being closed uh we're looking at continued air strikes and bombardment across Raza which makes humanitarian operations very difficult and the delivery of a to people who are trapped within Gaza who have no food the very minimal food who have no water who have no electricity who are in need of an utmost need for Urgent humanitarian intervention not being able to access those humanitarian interventions so we're looking at people uh who are constantly um looking for water constantly looking for food constantly looking for any sort of Aid that could help them and their families survive tell us more about the the lack of access to to water what are your colleagues on the ground telling you about that um since the very start of of the escalation of the violence we know that water supply has been cut off to uh to the Raza strip um our colleagues are telling us how um the people have are having to drink contaminated water because there simply isn't uh enough uh clean water for drinking people do not people are at the brink of um not being able to drink at all but also you're looking at water plants uh water pumps and waste water plants that are completely uh not functional uh you're looking at um fuel that is not available to uh operate uh those water plant and waste water plants um uh our colleagues uh and Oxfam has been warning of um possible disease outbreak so we're looking at possible waterbor diseases in Raza including Kera which makes the humanitarian situation which is already catastrophic even more catastrophic and we heard uh today about these bombings in uh Southern Gaza as far as you can tell is anywhere safe for garans to shelter uh from air strikes and bombs nowhere is safe in Gazza anymore and this is exactly what we've been hearing from our colleagues in Gazza the majority of oxam Staff in Gaza have been displaced they're moving from one place to the other and they're in us on daily basis how nowhere in Gazza is safe even designated safe shelters are no longer considered safe because of the bombardment and because of the air strikes so we're looking at a situation where uh people do not know where to go we're looking at a situation where our colleague yesterday was telling us how he was going to buy bread for his family and as he walked to the bakery he saw people lying on the floor with no mattresses with no blank kids how he saw people sleeping in cars and in Open Spaces in shops everywhere because there aren't enough uh shelters and and even those shelters are not safe thank you so much for joining us uh policy advisor for Oxfam in the Middle East at nor shaf thank you Sarah Ali works with safe the children which is also planning to send Aid to Gaza through the Rafa Crossing and I asked her what she had heard about the Border reopening so the situation is extremely fluid as you know it's changing day by day and hour by hour at the moment our trucks to save the children trucks are at the border and we're ready to go and deliver Aid when it is safe to do so in partnership with the Egyptian red crescent um but what's important to remember is that this is delivering food water the most B basic needs and Gaza is an extremely densely populated um small patch of land home to 2.2 million people half of which are children so even before the recent escalations in violence 80% of people in Gaza depended on International Aid so it's absolutely imperative that we can get in there safely and deliver the aid to people who need it most and to children now the deal is to allow a limited number of trucks in can that really make a difference it's very difficult to say as I said the situation is so fluid and Gaza is a small strip of land 365 square kilometers and right now people are rationing food they're rationing water and they need electricity so the type of Aid that we have ready to go is you know hygiene kits this is basic things that people need to survive as well as food and water soap toothbrushes we're looking at really basic things that need to go through and the sheer scale of the issue is so big with over a million people looking around um in Gaza almost displaced so we really need a lot of Aid to go through now what kind of support and access do Aid organizations like yours actually need to continue working in the area well first and foremost we absolutely need a ceasefire and we need all parties to agree to that it's almost impossible to deliver Aid and give people supplies if you're under constant bombardment so we need a ceasefire we need a deescalation of the violence we need the violence to stop and we also need all parties to adhere to International humanitarian law so protecting civilian spaces like hospitals and schools where people are Sheltering is absolutely imperative sorry Ali there from save the children thank you very much for your time thank you bahir am journalist from Cairo told us why it is so complicated to get Aid into Gaza um so at this point Egypt has maintained that it has never actually closed the ra border crossing but that four rounds of air strikes on the Palestinian side have forced it closed and again this is the only passage in and out of Gaza um that is not controlled by Israel so um so on one side Egypt has maintained that it has kept it that has kept it open but the Palestinian side of the border crossing has not been operational um meanwhile there's this increasingly desperate sense of urgency um while Egypt can't guarantee safe passage of the aid that's been piled up on its side of the Border um so it was 3 days ago the who's Regional director told my colleague that Gaza had 24 hours left of essential supplies anything that remains now is being rationed beyond belief um and so Egypt has said that it needs guarantees of safe passage it needs to know that trucks are not going to be targeted that is not going that is going to be delivered safely to where it needs to go um and since Israel has bombed the crossing the roads the trucks need to take the safe areas that the aid would get to um since they have been targeted Egypt needs time to repair which is why um President Joe Biden said last night um that it likely won't be until Friday although we're hoping for a sooner timeline um and it would be up to 20 trucks obviously that's close to nothing there are hundreds waiting in Northern Cai to be allowed in but this can be seen as first gesture um and if things go well Egypt is committed to both keeping ra open for a to come in and humanitarian and medical cases to come out uh for the people uh to come out is that you just mentioned Egyptian officials have made a deliverers into Gaza a condition for the evacuation of foreign passport holders what more do you know about that so the conversation on foreign Nationals goes back to The First Agreement from the first few days of the war um the US had considered that agreement all but done um that foreign Nationals would be allowed uh to exit Gaza but then we learned that Egypt had made that conditional on humanitarian Aid going in um what they said was that the ra Crossing cannot be used only for safe exit for foreign Nationals um so it has been a point of communication for European and world leaders who have visited who visited KY who have spoken with Egyptian leaders uh but we have not learned more on that but now that we're starting to see some movement um if those 20 trucks make it safe make it safely um we can imagine that we could also see movement on foreign Nationals um Egypt hasn't said anything explicitly but um one medical when because it has committed to Medical cases and humanitarian cases coming out we can imagine that they wouldn't just block foreign Nationals as well here I'm in there reporting from Cairo for us thank Youk you
