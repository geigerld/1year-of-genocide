now turning to the war in Gaza Hamas leader isma Han has accused Israel of deliberately Starving gazans in the territories North and said Hamas was ready to continue to fight in a televised speech Han also said the group which is widely designated a terrorist organization was showing flexibility in negotiations with Israel H called on Palestinians to March to the alaka mamos in Jerusalem on the first day of Ramadan next week Israel said it would allow limited prayers there with security restrictions there are concerns the call could set the stage for possible CL clashes Let's cross over now to RW correspondent Tanya kma in Jerusalem is mentioned that Hamas is quote flexible in the ceasefire negotiations what does he mean by that well I think I mean you have to see this obviously in the context of these negotiations that are currently underway between Israel Hamas mediated by uh Qatar and Egypt and other actors now flexibility this is uh what we don't know exactly how flexible Israel and Hamas are in certain when it comes to certain sticking points there is talk about you know the potential ratio how many hostages will be released for how many Palestinian prisoners that are held in Israeli uh jails for example there's talk about and of course all the details are not yet really known there's talk about that the first phase could see the release of 40 Israeli hostages that are still being held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for those Palestinian prisoners but another sticking point has been always uh that Hamas wants to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a full end or full stop to hostilities an end to the war and this has been described uh answer by prime minister Benjamin net Netanyahu as delusional as delusional demand so you know it is still to see how flexible both sides are and depending on what sources you're looking at you could be very close to deal or very far away now let's talk about the military operation still going on in Gaza what's the current situation on the ground between the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas well I mean the war is going on and uh you know throughout the Gaza Strip there's every day every night reported air strikes and fighting going on uh also in Gaza City in in recent days but the main focus was in the past weeks on the south of course on KH Yunis although the Israeli Army has said they completing this and there is of course now the looming threat uh by Israel to also uh uh attack rafar this of course is the Southernmost city in Gaza where uh over 1.4 million people are sh Sheltering they have been told in the beginning of the war to move further south now they're in the South and of course uh there has been a lot of criticism leveled by the international uh Community uh in the wake of this announcement to also uh have an offensive uh on raar now Israel says they have eliminated several battalions uh of Hamas um there in some areas is more urban Warfare uh still going on but they need to go into rafar as they say to eliminate four of the battalions and to say as prime minister Netanyahu keeps on saying uh to remove Hamas completely from power now the world food program says a quarter of gazans currently fac starvation what are the current prospects for the civilians trapped in the South briefly if you can well we've seen in the past two days there have been uh uh humanitarian Aid mainly medical supplies and food have been uh dropped uh from Plains on the southern uh mainly the coastal uh area somewhere actually falling you could see that on on F on on video falling into the sea but they were mainly um destined to go to reach uh the population in the South and the center of Gaza but what's the main concern for humanitarian uh uh for uh humanitarian Aid organizations and for the United Nations operating there is actually Northern Gaza because access is extremely difficult uh United Nations have said that they haven't had a convoy to Gaza since the end uh to the northern part of Gaza since uh the end of January and we heard in several reports now being made by the world food program but also by the office for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs AA saying that uh a quarter of the population could be in in risk of uh famine or starvation also saying that especially for children under the age age of uh uh two in Northern Gaza one out of six children is in under threat of severe malnutrition now Israel has said they're letting in enough trucks and Aid into uh Gaza uh but it's the fault of the UN for not Distributing the aid uh faster and better whereas the the United Nations are saying there are all kind of obstacles also inside you know from the insecurity from the fighting going on but also from looting also from Desperate people wanting you know to get to this humanitarian Aid and also the high prices on the black market T and Jerusalem thank
