what would camela Harris presidency mean to the global Community would she continue the transatlantic commitment of her current boss President Joe Biden what about Ukraine what about Israel what about China what about NATO there's hardly a better person to address these questions than Ian bremmer he's an American political scientist focused on global political risk Ian welcome to DW sure great to see you let's start with Israel Ian uh the support of the Netanyahu government is a huge problem for the Democrats in the United States as many potential voters in important swing stage such as for example Michigan uh one the more critical approach where do you see CA Harris going there um it's very hard for her to differentiate herself while Biden is President because she has to be supportive of his policy and her statements while they've had different emphasis have certainly been completely supportive of his policy uh I think a president Harris would actually be quite different I think you would see a lot more pressure uh on Israel to um limit the campaign uh or else uh I I I don't think that'd be the blank check that you have seen you know uh in in reality if if not in in principle uh from the Biden Harris Administration over the past nine months she is much more concerned uh about uh the uh Palestinian ability to continue to live um with basic human conditions on the ground in Gaza um and frankly in the West Bank she sees uh US foreign policy on Israel Palestine as a failed policy um and that's again that's a I can't see her saying that publicly uh but I think that you would would see her govern that way uh and and in that regard of course she's much more sympathetic to Palestinian statehood um and especially on the back of the knesset voting against two-state solution so I think she might consider uh being willing to recognize a Palestinian State even before uh Israel would accept it you know that some European countries have already done that others are considering it I think you would find that a Harris Administration would be much more aligned with the Europeans on Israel Palestine uh than either Biden or Trump I think that would in fact in some ways it's the most meaningful differentiation between Harris uh and Biden but as you just said I will be very hard for her to talk about that during the next 10 weeks or so but it could be a maker or breaker in the election could it I don't know about that I mean you know Americans do not consider any major foreign policy ISS right now to be the top of their agenda um immigration uh inflation um and abortion are are all significantly more important than any foreign policy issues that you would ask me about today migration of course is in part a foreign policy issue but for most Americans it's a domestic issue which is why it's so important um I do think that in terms of you know a swing state like Michigan where you have a lot of American citizens voters uh with a background Heritage um from the Middle East and a lot of Muslims uh that live there uh that is a place where kamla Harris could outperform from Biden but it will be hard for her to say the sorts of things that would really allow that uh needle to move well and then there's of course uh Ukraine um when I'm traveling the US I hear from more and more Americans who say that the US should uh uh cut spending for other countries and do more for its own people what do you think where will Camila Harris stand in this regard I I think that that fear is is overstated um uh you know by the way the $61 billion in Military Support that the US Congress overwhelmingly and bipartisan approved a few months ago would not have happened if Trump didn't support it uh Trump was more than happy to see it drag out but ultimately he was was happy to have it done and his view is that the Europeans should be spending more um on defense for Ukraine and on their own Collective defense but that a Ukrainian self-defense is also in American interest he's made that very clear so I I don't think that we are facing in a trump Administration or a Harris Administration suddenly literally jettisoning uh support for Ukraine I don't believe that but I I do understand that the ukrainians are under pressure and they're under pressure in part because American Support is not quite what it should be in part because European support is also uncertain going forward you probably know that the Germans under fiscal constraints have just reduced by 50% their own commitments to Ukraine over 2025 we can't talk about the US and Ukraine unless we also bring up Germany and of course the fact that the ukrainians are themselves running out of people I hate to say this but I do fear that um because the ukrainians have done such extraordinary things to defend their land over the last 2 and a half years that we in the west the Germans the Americans and others we have made the ukrainians out to be superhuman and and it's not right you know they're people uh with with passions and with frailties and and with weaknesses and and they are you know they are facing limits of what they can do uh and and you know it is absolutely possible that the ukrainians will end up losing a lot more uh because they just can't continue to perform at this level and I say that about Ukraine's president too that brings me to my next question Ian so we experienced during the recent prisoner swap that the US and its allies are willing to negotiate with Vladimir Putin what would that mean for a Harris Administration when it comes to Ukraine also regarding what what you just talked about well the ukrainians don't like the fact that there were secret negotiations involving your country my country Poland other NATO allies for many months with Russia that the ukrainians literally had no idea was going on so the Ukrainian perspective will be well wait a second so if they could do that have they been talking about like the war and and not telling us I mean you can understand why they'd be worried about that um and you know I I know that those negotiations have been overwhelmingly um about getting this prisoner exchange and that there's no meaningful movement on negotiations that would involve Russia and Ukraine but I mean you know are we certain that this has never come up in a way that might potentially affect Ukrainian sovereignty no one can tell you that no one can tell you that so I I think they right to be worried but I also believe that the Ukrainian population themselves are moving to a position where some type of negotiation is becoming more feasible um and where they understand that they can't just continue to fight and fight and fight even if that means you know losing some of their territory I I do believe that the reality of Ukraine is that they will be partitioned I believe that they will end up losing a significant amount of territory and what I mean by that is that there will be a sign ific amount of territory that Russia will continue to occupy for the foreseeable future and and I think that the west and Ukraine are increasingly coming to that reality and I think that that by the way that is true for Harris and for Trump the difference and this is important very important for the Europeans is that Trump is much more willing to engage with the Russians unilateral he would be willing to cut a deal on the prisoners or to cut a deal on Ukraine without talking to the Europeans the NATO allies and without talking to Ukraine and Kamala Harris would not be willing to do that she like Biden would want to ensure that this was a consensus policy of the NATO alliance together with the ukrainians who have agency Trump's a lot more like Kissinger you know Trump you had a conversation with Kissinger back when he was alive and he would talk about these great Powers as if other countries didn't even exist it's like well here's here's the deal we're going to make and and of course that's just not the world we're in today you just mentioned NATO I mean given CA Harris appearance at the Munich security conference she seems very very committed to this Alliance do you agree absolutely uh I I think that she sees that this Alliance is essential um to US National Security and she also recognizes that a lot of the problems that we have are Global and that you need strong friends and you need to work with those strong friends so yeah look she she certainly would be interested in seeing these countries continue to spend more uh Obama did Biden did Trump did I mean this is not surprising um and I don't think the 2% figure is written in stone uh I think that there is upward pressure on that 2% of GDP spend even as the European countries are facing higher interest rates and challenging fiscal environments there's of course China doing have any idea how Camila Harris policies are and her take on tariffs against them probably the most aligned uh with the Americans remember she was uh there with Biden for the Apex Summit in San Francisco her home California um and she was very active uh with all of the leaders there including the Chinese delegation um I I think that she probably uh is most aligned with Biden on China policy this is a place where she wants to see more more promotion of American strategic Industries with allies uh is worried about intellectual property theft is worried about the lack of rule of law is worried about Chinese subsidies so this has been a more consensus oriented policy between Biden and Trump Republicans and Democrats she would not be interested in you know a cross theboard tariffs that Trump is talking about but she'd be more focused on expanding you know advanced technology constraints against the Chinese in a way that Trump hasn't really focused on that we we hardly talk about that but that's something I'm really interested in the more than two months between election day and the inauguration of the elected president is always really a time of uncertainty I I think especially in this climate where it's very likely that Donald Trump might actually not accept a loss it is completely certain that he will not accept the loss and if it is close we have a very serious problem this is going to be the worst election and postelection environment that we have seen in our lifetimes I think it'll be worse than uh than than you know what we had in ' 68 uh I'm I'm deeply concerned uh we have um Trump that would completely not accept a loss and the stakes are very high for him he would face jail um I think we have a lot of Democrats that would not accept the Trump win uh the stakes are very high uh they believe he is a convicted felon many times over including for lots of crimes that he hasn't been tried for yet and that he shouldn't be allowed to stand for the presidency so I think a large number of the members of the population would not see the elected president as their president uh and that is a a very serious concern I see Elon Musk who is the wealthiest and arguably the most powerful American uh certainly in the private sector is uh actively weaponizing his social media platform to promote disinformation including around the election he just said that Civil War was inevitable in the United Kingdom uh there is right now nothing being done to even try to constrain the damage that he has the likelihood of doing to this electoral environment so yeah I'm very deeply concerned about where we're heading how would foreign power might use this time of uncertainty well it is a vulnerability to American Allies who need a strong and consistent transition and it's an opportunity for adversaries I don't think the Chinese would do much because uh their economy is uh poor and they don't want unnecessarily to antagonize and alienate American Allies so they need stability in the global order in a way that most American adversaries don't but North Korea uh Iran Russia these are countries that benefit from chaos and they want the Americans to fail and and and I I think the potential that they would actually do their damnest to take advantage of that um both uh with their own local conflicts and also potentially with asymmetric attacks against the United States and allies a much a much much more dangerous time thank you in I hope we can continue this conversation a little closer to the election thank you byebye
