the United States says three of its troops have been killed and dozens more wounded in a drone attack near a base on Jordan's border with Syria us officials say the Drone struck near a Barracks at the base in the rukban region it's the first time a strike has killed American soldiers in the area since the start of the Israel Hamas War President Joe Biden blamed iran-backed militants for the attack and vowed to respond Iran denies any involvement DW's Washington bureau chief inz pole has more well the killing of the three Americans in Jordan near the border with Syria is definitely a significant escalation of an already precarious situation in the Middle East uh this is the first time as you just mentioned that US troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the beginning of the Gaza War and the prompt reaction of President Biden kind of underlines the significance uh of this attack he promised to hold those responsible for the attack I quote him to account at a time and in a manner our choosing and he also said I quote him here as well we know it was carried out by radical iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq us officials have repeatedly said that they do not want to see uh the increasingly High tensions across the Middle East broaden into a regional War uh and indeed there have been more than 160 Oro attacks on us and Coalition forces in Iraq uh and Syria since the war started however until today official officials have described uh the constant volley of drones rockets and and missiles as unsuccessful because they have not caused Serious injury or damage to infrastructure this of course has changed with today and given the increasing political pressure President Biden is facing from the Republican party in this election year which has just started it indeed doesn't seem unlikely that the US will increase their military involvement and with that of course comes an increasing risk that the conflict will spread throughout the whole Middle East well for more let's bring in Marina Miran here she's a defense analyst with King's College London Marina do we know who's responsible for this attack good morning Terry well apparently a group called um um the Islamic resistance in Iraq is responsible for this now we have to understand that this is not a group per se rather this is an umbrella term used for Iranian backed militias both in Iraq and Syria and Lebanon for that matter so hollah could be such a group so there is no knowledge which of the militant groups is responsible for this attack but it is under this umbrella so it it is believed and they did claim that the attack was conducted by them the Iranian government says it had nothing to do with the incident but we know that Iran funds many of these militia groups in the region how credible is Iran's claim of denial well it is interesting because um Iran will of course enjoy a thin blanket of plausible deniability because it's very difficult to demonstrate whether Ayatollah or or racy were actually ordering an attack what is important to understand here while these groups are being backed by Iran they still have their own goals um hoodies for example so they they have some common enemies like the United States in the region however in how far the attack has been coordinated by Iran needs to be proven it is known that the um Islamic revolutionary guard CA a cod's force has been helping these groups to coordinate attacks so more evidence is needed in order to implicate Iran talk to us a little about the US presence in the region right there where this attack took place why are US troops even stationed in Jordan near the border to Syria well we have to go back some uh 14 years and remember why the US troops were there in the first place and the reason was um on the in the wake of the Syrian Civil War the US troops were there to combat the Islamic state so they stationed not only in Jordan which is an ally and that's why that position was not well protected because an ally country as opposed to Syria um or as opposed to say Iraq where um there is a danger of such strikes and therefore we have US troops across the Middle East uh stationed since since that time and right now the Iraqi government has um asked the US to withdraw its troops from Iraq because of these ongoing attacks so this has been going for for for a while now and prior to Israel Hamas War in October there were incidents where these groups were attacking US forces but it has never come to casualty and we might might remember um Donald Trump's response to one of them um killing in the decapitation strike the former commander of the cuds force um kasim sumani so this this conflict between Iran and the United States has been developing for many years now right US President Joe Biden said that the US would respond to this attack what kind of response are you expecting well there seems to be um a lack of clarity in terms of how to respond the Republicans want the US to conduct strikes on the Iranian territory and that would be the first in history and that indeed uh in these circumstances might lead to an broader escalation of the conflict it is like a powder CAG however there are other options um such as striking Iranian Naval Assets in the Persian Gulf and conducting again decapitation strikes against leaders of these militant groups Under the Umbrella of the Islamic resistance um of Iraq so there are these options on the table however the question is is it going to be enough to deter both these groups and Iran from stopping the attacks is this deterrent credible another option is of course that can be used in conjunction are economic sanctions but it seems like Iran has still flourished in terms of its military developments uh under economic sanctions so the idea is to identify the centers of gravity in order for the strategy to work to impose um such measures that would indeed scare Iran and these groups off uh and prevent further attacks and we're seeing that strikes against huti in in Yemen they they are not making them stop so I'm wondering which of these strategies will be chosen or a conjunction of them and whether they will be successful and whether it might lead to um an increased deployment of US troops to the region which might widen the war Marina thank you very much for your insights that was defense analyst Marina mirin of King's College London thank you for having
