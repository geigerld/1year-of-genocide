Germany's Vice Chancellor Robert haboc has condemned the attacks by the Hamas terrorist group and expressed his country's steadfast support for Israel he said Israel has every right to defend itself here's what he had to for build bu by and for more on this and what I think were really heartfelt words from Robert H I'm joined in our studio by DW correspondent Hance Brandt uh what kind of reactions have there been to this statement so far it's been very positive in in German political circles the reaction there have even been very positive reactions from opposition politicians that's an unusual thing for a green politician at the moment because the greens are being very harshly attacked by politically on all sorts of issues by the opposition at the moment so it's been remarkable the the positive uh reactions to this um I think what has to say is that we are talking here about in some sense a very German discussion the last two words that uh harck uses there KN VA never again that's kind of the headline under which German discussions of Nazi history of Germany's Nazi history um have been made since the end of the war never again should something like this happen on German soil and that's the reason why uh this kind of intensity is being put into this discussion here here in Germany that intensity we feel we get from Robert Hab who is a very uh good public speaker and comes across as very empathetic and does his statement and the other statements that have been made in this regard um make it more difficult to criticize the Israeli armed forces and what they're doing in Gaza now because there's debate around that too absolutely it's a very very fine line that the German government especially the greens are trading here I think it doesn't make uh criticism impossible and there have in the past been statements that are critical of the Israeli government at the moment there is a very strong focus on Israel's right to defend itself is Israel's right to exists and the German um they call it in the interest of German states the national interest as reasons of state that Israel can exist which is um kind of explained in terms of German history U but there has been criticism and even in recent days green politicians and the German government have said for instance that uh the um civilians in Gaza should be uh safe that their safety should be respected even by uh in the course of the Israeli counter offensive um so there is some um sensitive one might say some careful criticism involved but the basis of it of German reaction at the moment is support for Israel now H if you don't mind to show our viewers some pictures and video that have been shot in the past uh couple of days and get you to react to them uh police have reported a dozen such graffitis in the past 24 hours stars of David being painted on buildings other graffiti there you have it um evoking what what is the purpose of this and why why are the police getting involved well um here in Germany one things immediately of the 30s of Nazi rule in the 30s at that time The Naz these marked buildings and shops H run by Jews with the Star of David um so there is this sense that this could be anti-semitic graffiti that uh and that is exactly how the police is in fact treating it as a sign of anti-Semitism um I think one has to say there is a very intense debate going on in Germany at the moment there are a lot of um Palestinian sympathizers people with a Palestinian background uh people with a migrant background from the Middle East and so on in Germany there have been Pro Palestinian demonstrations on German streets and uh the police are treating these as anti-semitic uh graffiti obviously if one were to for instance um uh use graffiti such as um uh a um prop Palestinian or Hamas graffiti that would be prohibited in itself whereas the Star of David is not prohibited in itself okay so police are on the lookout and and the political class seems to be standing as steadfast behind Israel and and staying in that position it has since the beginning hence brand thanks for that Insight the Israeli military says it has killed the Hamas commander who led one of the terror attacks on Border villages in Israel last week it has released a video of what it says is an air strike on a building in the south of Gaza City that it says killed Hamas Commander belal al-adra the Army said he was responsible for the kibuts N Massacre where residents were killed in their homes it also said two other Hamas commanders were killed in recent air strikes on Gaza Hamas has not confirmed their
