now Japan is suspending funding for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees it joins a growing list of donors including the US Germany and Britain that have stopped payments since Israel accused some staff of being involved in the Hamas October 7th attacks the UN is urging governments to keep funding the agency with Gaza on the brink of famine unr's Aid handouts are one of gaza's last lifelines for many here these blue and white bags of flour are all that stand between them and starvation but with more and more of the agency's donors cutting off their funding people here in the southern city of Rafa fear the worst stopping unr's Aid distribution is a catastrophe in the Gaza Street the handouts are our main support and if they stop there will be a famine like the one in the north of Gaza if unra stops helping us then our people will face death minute by minute unra is helping our people who are hungry and suffering if they stop we'll have no one on our side other than God details of the Israeli allegations against unra staff have been slow to emerge according to the New York Times citing a dossier provided to the US government by the Israeli secret services 12 workers were involved some are said to have participated in kidnappings and killings While others provided logistical support the agency has already fired several people and has vowed to thoroughly investigate the claims but the UN says that funding needs to continue while that happens Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank have also urged doners to reconsider the countries that have announced this suspension their aid amounts to 70% of the annual budget of the United Nation relief and work agency this measure is extremely dangerous and it is our hope that it will be reversed with most Garin now forced from their homes by the fighting people here are more dependent on the agencies help than ever the head of unra has warned that if money doesn't start flowing again soon its work will grind to a halt in a matter of weeks so let's get another perspective now we are joined by Kenneth Roth he served as the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch for nearly three decades and he joins us from Geneva uh welcome back to the program the allegations and the agency's response to them are of course still being obsessed but it already has a big scandal with a potential for real life implications for civilians in Gaza what do you make of of the way that this has gone down so far well clearly the allegations against a dozen unra employees are serious you know if they actually participated in the October 7th Kamas attacks they will have been responsible potentially you know for murder for abduction these are war crimes so there's no question that this is serious the but the thing that's perverse is that Western governments are responding by essentially penalizing 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza because they're not responsible for what these dozen employees did but by suspending funds to unra they the Western governments are essentially saying you know we don't care if you're facing large scale starvation we are going to cut off the one agency that has been capable of feeding you okay I'd like to pick apart on many things that you said there um the humanitarian situation but but first I'd like to ask you about the investigation because Israel says that the organization has failed or rather has fallen under the influence of Hamas in Gaza the UN probe now into these allegations should it concentrate on the individuals in question or does the organization need to take a broader approach for example looking at all of the employees um you know more than 10,000 there and and perhaps the recruitment process well unre I mean Israel is Distributing a dossier these days where it's making these broad allegations but Israel has been trying to shut down unra for decades because it sees unra as the agency that keeps Palestinian refugee identity alive you know it doesn't want people thinking about themselves as refugees they wants them to just kind of go someplace else and never think about returning to their original homes within Israel so you have to take with a huge grain of salt anything that Israel says but if you look at you know how did UNR leadership respond they immediately started an investigation they vowed to criminally prosecute anybody who was responsible for um the Kamas attack on October 7th and that's you know a whole lot more than Israel has done you don't see Israel vowing to prosecute its war criminals say the people who are you know blocking the humanitarian Aid to the needy population a clear War crime or the people who are dropping 2,000 PB bombs in heavily populated civilian neighborhoods Another War CRI so you know there's something just perverse about Western governments suspending Aid to unra immediately upon these allegations for a dozen but but you know the the military aid 3.8 billion in military aid the massive arms scales to Israel that continues right and I mean those are questions that that we will ask for of of the Israelis and their allies um but I just want to you know drill down and focus on the situation with unra in particular right now in our conversation um you've highlighted there that many important donor countries have now suspended new funding to the agency um which is dealing with this grave humanitarian uh situation in Gaza we heard in the previous program for for for example from um our correspondent in Germany uh giving the German argument that you know now there's a sort of due process that that will take place this is uh just waiting to see what the results of the investigation is and that there are other vessels and means by which to get Aid to those who are in Gaza and perhaps those are going to be stepped up so I'd like to ask you through that lens what do you make of the reaction by donor States because we've seen so many of them now jump on board and temporarily suspend while while the investigation is underway I mean the donor governments seem to be mainly concerned about attacks from the right by pro-israel partisans because otherwise there's no way to explain why they suspend Aid to unrenowned they've launched an investigation we can wait to see what the results of that investigation are but unra has very few reserves that's because you know Trump had cut off Aid and so they spent down their reserves and to say oh there are other ways to get food and and medicine and the like to the people of of Gaza I mean that's just not true you know unra is the principal agency that is Distributing this Aid it has the trucks that to some extent are able to move around the bombardment and the life so you don't think that increasing donations to the Red Cross or something that that's going to make any sort of Dent or impact I mean the Red Cross has no capacity to distribute the quantity of Aid that's required and here we have 80% of the population of Gaza having been displaced they're living in tents and the like um the the distribution has to take place amidst a war and while the Red Cross is a very important agency it just doesn't begin to have the capacity to service this enormous population in need former Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth uh thank you so much for joining us here on DW news to share that perspective we appreciate it thank you let's bring in DW political correspondent Thomas Sparrow uh Thomas Germany is among the countries which have halted funding to unra what more can you tell us about the reasons that were given Germany did stress that the UN agency played a very important role a vital role when it comes to supplying basic services to the affected population but at the same time it stressed that it was important to have a quick clarification of what's happening right now and basically stress that until that investigation is complete the German government will be haling approval for new funds and it's important Sarah to stress that we're talking here about new funds so it's not about what's already been pledged in fact the German government stressed that there are no new pledges pending but that it's all about future funds until that investigation is complete what that essentially means is that according to the German government humanitarian Aid is continuing to those affected and given the horrendous humanitarian situation in Gaza for civilians did you hear any suggestions about alternate ways to help people there no matter which way the investigation goes sorry Thomas go ahead no no problem the German government did stress that it rejected that criticism that has been leveled against those who are haling these funds stressing that it's basically a collective punishment against Palestinians that German government stressed that there were other ways to reach Palestinians other ways to reach those affected in fact stressing that Germany had increased its funds to other organizations like the international Committee of the Red Cross or UNICEF and again stressing that humanitarian Aid through this UN agency was still continuing so it's a big actually debate as to what is happening now when that investigation will end how it will end but the German government was quick to to stress both through a press statement and also today in its regular government spokes people conference that Germany was basically still helping those affected in the region and it was doing so through the UN agency but also through other agencies as well okay very interesting uh Thomas Sparrow joining us with the view from Berlin we very much appreciate it
