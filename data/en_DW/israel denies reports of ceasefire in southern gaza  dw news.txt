Israel is denying reports of a ceasefire in southern Gaza to allow foreign Nationals to flee for Egypt some media Outlets had said the ruer border crossing was about to be opened to allow people to leave and Aid to enter the besieged territory un fuel trucks have been seen in the area but their destination is still unclear reports had said the truce at the border would take hold for several hours for the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu says this is not the case Palestinians have been gathering at the Crossing in the hope of escaping Israel's bombardment our correspondent Tanya kma is in southern Israel and she told me more about the possible opening of the Rafa border crossing well at the moment it's a bit of a confusion whether it will open or how it will open because in the early morning there were first reports that there would be a pause in the hostilities or a kind of temporary ceasefire for the cross Crossing to be open that people can pass mainly this would be opening for dual Nationals as far as we understand for foreign Nationals to foreign n Palestinians with foreign nationality to uh pass through the crossing but um this was based on reports in a a news agency uh but uh we have now the uh Israeli Prime Minister's office had put out a statement and denying that uh this will happening uh there was also reports here when Hamas official reported saying that they're not aware of such an opening at the same time we are getting reports that some of the trucks are uh leaving from Gaza to Egypt so we need to get you some information uh uh and confirmation on that um in the coming uh hours or so there is uh of course you have to understand what's happening here in the past 24 hours as well there have been despite the movement of people from the north uh the evacuation order by the Israeli Army going to the South uh they have been still air strikes in the southern part of course of Gaza and people it's a very complicated Crossing so opening a crossing under the circumstances there need to be all parties involved so that people can move from place to place it it takes a bit of time to get people through the crossing and also we have to say Egypt is also very worried about opening this Crossing because they don't want to see masses of uh Palestinians then being refugees on their territory so at the moment um you know it's not entirely confirmed when the Crossing will actually be open for the people to move uh in that direction what about the situation on Israel's uh Northern froner with Lebanon can you tell us more about that well we've seen in the past days ever since uh um uh the War uh started uh more and more incidents in on the northern border between Israel and Lebanon between uh some of the um Palestinian factions there but also Hezbollah and Israel like anti tank fire missile fire and uh this morning uh the Israeli defense Ministry and the Israeli Army put out a joint statement saying that they intend to evacuate the residents of the northern border towns and Villages uh that are in the area up to 2 kilometers next to the libanese Border there will be people there will be hosted in state sponsored guest houses for the time being so meaning this could be an indication that you know there's also the expectation that uh there the situation might get worse so far it seemed to be somehow contained as far as you can say that but there's of course a lot of worry and concern that there might be a second front being opening especially if such a ground invasion in Gaza might start and that Hezbollah might enter the war or hisbah Iran back so that there might be another front uh opening up uh in the north tanyaa reporting from ashdod thank you so much Tanya the Israeli milit milary has raised to 199 the number of people confirmed to have been abducted by Hamas to the Gaza Strip Israel has been massing troops and tanks on the border with Gaza ahead of a much anticipated ground offensive they've ordered more than one million gazans to move South ahead of the operation hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are in a desperate situation now as supplies of water electricity and food run low Israel has stepped up its bombing of The Enclave as part of its campaign to obliterate Hamas after the group massacred more than 1,000 Israeli civilians a moment of silence for the victims of Israel's deadliest terror attack this is how the first meeting of Israel's expanded emergency cabinet began the solemn mood followed by a vow for vengeance I saw our wonderful fighters who are now on the front line they know that the whole nation is behind them they understand the magnitude of the task they are ready to snap into action at any moment to wipe out the bloodthirsty monsters who seek to annihilate us if Hamas thought we would fall apart they were wrong we will tear Hamas apart Israeli forces have been amassing at the Gaza border waiting for the green light to begin a much anticipated ground offensive as the threat of invasion looms air strikes have continued raining down across the besieged territory hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to the south after an Israeli evacuation order but they're not safe from air strikes here either Israel also cut off garan's access to food water and electricity compounding the misery the cues for water wind their way down streets desperate people line up for hours I've come to get water we don't have any water we've reached a disastrous situation the situation is catastrophic by all standards with the crisis in food water and electricity I mean people can't do anything in the current conditions if you go to people's homes and film inside you will see extremely dire situations Israel says it's now agreed to turn the Taps back on in southern Gaza providing a drop of relief as the conflict deepens I spoke to journalist hazam baloa earlier he's in narat in the central Gaza Strip and he told me more about the situation there uh it's kot um in um there is continuous of Israeli uh aerial bombardment and air strikes in different areas across the Gaza St um there are reports that it's more intense in Gaza City and um uh the Border area and Northern bar of Gaza but still as well there were many strikes in in my area and um in the South inun and raasa um regarding the humanitarian situation still there is no electricity um um as you mentioned in the report there are like cues uh for people with galloons and tanks or whatever they have to to fill it with the with the water for washing there is no drinking water um barely some mobile trucks come to the areas uh along cues at the bakeries and restaurants and and and grocery shops to grab whatever they have they uh there are many people are are sleeping overnight in their cars or in the street because there is no place to go go still Israelis are asking Palestinians in the north and and and Gaza City to evacuate to kanun but um those people they are not able to move because there is no uh Transportation or it's risky Road um um um um um and you know like people wondering um about like when when um this is going to end or if there is uh rumors uh about ceasefire or um a temporary post for to to cope with the with the situation they are experiencing uh these days Hasam I wanted to ask you about these these reports of a of a possible ceasefire which would allow foreign citizens to to evacuate and of course allow humanitarian Aid to come in have have you heard any more uh about these rumors about this possible ceasefire all this rumors no concrete information about this like all um I mean at least from Ian side that Hamas and and officials in Gaza they said we haven't hear about it um there is no concrete or solid information talking about this all rumors there are like a lot of mediations led by Egyptian and cutter and other parties um but I mean still on the ground there is no confirmation on that all right Hasam Bela reporting from the central Gaza Strip thank you so much for your update thank you we're joined Now by The World Health organization's Regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean Ahmed Al mandari welcome to DW thanks so much for your time we're hearing the Rafa border crossing might be opening today can you tell us what preparations are in place once the Border opens to presumably get Aid in as quickly as possible thank you Ana for giving me the opportunity and uh in fact you know yes we heard that today morning the cross border will be opened uh we as a who already um landed one airplane full of supplies medical supplies uh that are ready to be you know shipped to Gaza once the corridor is open uh our arrangements with the Egyptian authorities that these supplies will be handed over to the Egyptian Crescent which will be also from their side handed handed over to the Palestinian red Cresent on the other side and make sure that these supplies will these hospitals and will be given to the healthcare facilities across Gaza could I just ask you where are you getting the information that the Border um will open is there something that we can bet on we are having our own communication with you know the Egyptian authorities we as a w as well as the UN resident coordinator so that sort of arrangement is with the Egyptian Authority but until now we don't know exactly what time today morning it will be open okay you mentioned uh medical supplies can you tell us more about the type of Aid that you're going to be um able to provide uh people with once you get through the crossing yeah I mean these supplies are of around 26 metc tons that worth $1.2 million us it included truma kits it included emergency kits that can be utilized you know to deal with injured people in in the as well as the hospitals it included medications for around um 120,000 people who are suffering from non communicable diseases it included also medical supplies and medications for around 350,000 or 300,000 people including you know pregnant ladies and children so these are the briefly you know the content of of these supplies okay the need is obviously huge we're hearing that the ceasefire agreement is only meant for for southern Gaza is there enough Aid that's going to be getting in and will it reach people in the north as well definitely you know whatever a that we are shipping now is is below below far below the real requirements there and needs and that's why in fact we are bleding we are urging all donors and partners to provide us with these medical supplies we have our own Supply you know Hub in in Dubay and things are ready there to be shipped we are just waiting further arrangements from the authorities here in Egypt but definitely you know as you have seen on the ground you know the number of the casualties the destruction of the healthcare facilities uh it is it is below far below what
