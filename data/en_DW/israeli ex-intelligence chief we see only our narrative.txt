as the conflict in Gaza intensifies a public warning from the United States Israel needs to do more to protect Palestinian civilians if you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain you should do it period And if you don't you're going to lose credibility worldwide my guest this week from Israel is Amy Aon former head of the shinb the country's internal security service will Israel heed the US warning if somebody um Can advise us not what to not what not to do but how to destroy the military capability of Hamas without human suffering uh I am ready to uh to listen to every advice so what happens next does Israel's government have a plan for the future and can anything good be salvaged once this war is over Amy ion welcome to conflict Zone thank you for the invitation you said last month that if Israel went ahead with a ground invasion of Gaza many Israeli soldiers and many more Palestinians would die is there a point in your view at which the human price of this war as it's being fought becomes too high for you for Israel no uh no because of two reasons um I I never knew how to measure human life and I cannot compare it to any military achievement so I I never could uh could give a an honest answer uh to this question but does it worry you yes it is but it wor me um since from from the very first day so uh and you asked me about um something that for me um I have to um I have to try to measure human life um and um and what will be on the other side so the concept of Victory uh which is uh very unclear today uh should be measured uh by human life it's something that I find very very difficult to do um I'm ready to speak about um the goal of um of this military campaign or the goal what we are doing today but I cannot give you an honest answer to uh to measure this goal with human life let me put it another way are are you comfortable with first the the total blockade of Gaza and then the meager humanitarian supplies that are being allowed to trickle into the strip and I asked because I wonder what the military value is of cutting off food medicine and water to Gaza civilians uh in order to um to measure um or to evaluate what we are doing um I cannot uh tell you an honest answer um when I when you ask me uh when you want me to to to measure it in human life but I can tell you uh what we are trying to achieve and um and I think I believe and I totally believe that you will agree with me that the less uh civilians um will be killed when we are trying to achieve our goal um the concept of Victory uh will be will give us any sense so uh what we are trying to do now is uh to destroy the military wing and the military capability of Hamas which means Alam and I believe that this is um this is uh the only way for us um to create a reality in which both Israelis and Palestinians will be able to live uh in a totally different reality but you you're suggesting that the methods um that Israel is using at the moment are Justified because of the end goal is that right no no no no um well I I I left the military uh Community 30 years ago and uh and I left the shin which is the intelligence Community uh 25 years ago so I'm not sure that I'm in a position uh to advise to our military generals um exactly what to do um all what I can say that I think that one of the major parameters should be to kill as less as possible civilians and to make sure that everybody including Israelis uh people who are living in Britain Europe America will understand that we should do everything in order to achieve this goal and to remind especially to you people who are living outside that Hamas will do everything in order to use his people as a human shield so it is a totally asymmetric conflict and asymmetric um you know uh way that we we measure human life your your president president herzo said on October the 13th it's an entire nation out there that is responsible he was talking about the gazans it's not true this rhetoric that civilians were not aware not involved they could have risen up they could have fought this evil regime do you go along with that no I totally disagree um Hamas Was Not Elected by the people who lives in Gaza Hamas took over by killing fat people and Palestinian Authority uh you know uh security uh security people so I totally disagree I think that um we have to emphasize something that which is totally different from what I understand our president said we do not have war with the Palestinian people we do not have war with the Palestinian innocent Palestinians who are living Gaza they hate Hamas Hamas before this War uh got support from between 20 25 to 30% of the Palestinians who are living under his control so uh and they do not have the power Hamas is using his military power not only against us so our our our enemy is Hamas by the way that you know it's behave like Isis they left the concept of persuation and da that you know uh he came with uh when he was born uh during the 70s and the 80s they are killing civilians like Isis so our goal is to destroy the military capability of Ain Hamas and not to kill Palestinians we do not have war with the Palestinian people and if you inflict tremendous hardship on those Palestinian people in the course of fighting Hamas that's just collateral damage is it that's just what you've got to you know I I I hate I hate the idea of collateral damage um I think that um you know um we uh we kill people um but uh um but we are trapped um I don't want to tell you what you Europeans did in Afghanistan and Iraq uh it's for me it's irrelevant uh but at least I know I know most of the general all the generals in the in the in the IDF I know them and I know that they will do everything in avoid in order to avoid what you call collateral damage and I say or call uh The Killing uh of of civilians and um and that's it but we we are Corner because the reality in which on one side of what we call border leaving Israelis and on the other side of the Border Hamas control the Palestinians is unacceptable anymore we were stupid enough in order not to see and probably we made many mistakes and I blame my prime minister and I still blame him for you know creating Hamas to the evil level of evil that we see today but we cannot go to the past and to discuss our mistake we did mistakes but for our our problem today is how to fight Hamas and yes I do agree that we have to say again and again and again our enemy are not the Palestinian people and this is why I say to the Israelis not all of them you know agree with me unless we should speak not on the military go we are speaking all the way on military achievement military goal unless we shall Define a political goal Victory is not measured in military terms the political goal should be to revive the concept of two states it will take years but the the concept you know we have to we have to create a different story to what we are doing today and the story should be we are doing today because we are fight we it's not a war of Revenge it's a war in order to defend our people how worried are you that having raised the issue of humanitarian hardship with Israel in private uh America is now airing significant concerns in public and I wonder can the Israeli government afford to ignore those concerns Anthony blinken the Secretary of State said just last week while Israel has the right to defend itself the way it does so matters it means food water medicine and other humanitarian assistance must be able to flow into Gaza and to the people who need them um Israel doesn't seem to be taking too much concern with with that uh strcture well I um I totally agree uh but I would raas um the the last sentence that Israel do not really care uh I agree that humanitarian uh you know issue humanitarian issue meaning you know human suffering and human and human uh people innocent people dying yes uh we we we have to take it in account um we cannot measure it but uh I I don't think that um you you didn't mention the people the Israelis uh who are uh you know being hostages uh in the hands of Hamas uh I think that um we we will not be able to measure the concept of Victory without measuring human life and without bringing back the Israelis who were kidnapped children uh elderly and and and you know innocent people who are suffering now um in the hand of Hamas President Biden said on his way back from Israel I was very blunt with the Israelis Israel has been badly victimized but you know the truth is that if they have an opportunity to relieve suffering of people who have nowhere to go that is what they should do that's a really blunt public warning isn't it it seems that I emphas exactly and I totally agree um that we have to keep in mind and we have to try to do um to avoid um as much as we can um the human suffering do you think Israel is doing that I think that we are trying to do it um and I I said and I I will repeat it again and again and again uh if somebody listen to every advice but what is happening you know uh people you know tend to forget um the violence um and the cruelty um that we faced exactly one months ago when women was were raped and and children were assassin um and um and every time when we are blamed for human suffering um yes I'm ready to listen to every advice how to destroy the military capability of H without doing it you once talked in a film called The Gatekeepers 2012 you talked about what happens when large numbers of people start being killed through targeted assassinations you you said suddenly the processes become a kind of conveyor belt you ask yourself less and less where to stop and I ask you is that's what has been happening with Israeli attacks in Gaza a conveyor belt approach no it's it's let's let's what I said on 2012 or I don't remember exactly when um is totally true um I think that um we did many mistakes um I think that we did many mistakes uh when we did not understand the Palestinian people and in a way I totally agree that our mistakes um you know um created or did not stop the phenomena of Hamas the way we see it today but we are discussing the past and the past with all our mistakes and their mistakes will not help us now because we are fighting now against something that we cannot accept its existence and what I'm trying to explain that we should not forget the mistakes of the future but we have to start by designing the future and the future should be to revive the idea the concept and the process that will create reality of two states instead of trying to explain us how to behave on the military campaign Mr ion what comes next President Biden has said there has to be a vision of what comes next um you've talked about Reviving The idea of a two-state solution giving the Palestinians a political perspective do you see any sign of that vision from your government or is the war it as far as they're concerned no it's uh first of all I don't see it uh when I listen to our uh um you know cabinet ministers but I want to be very honest with you U I do not listen to them uh but I see the change and finally you have to understand Israel with all our mistakes is still a great democracy and we saw it not today we see it not today we saw it during the last uh six months and and this is why I look and I see when I meet people in the street and I'll give you one example the example is you know uh Israelis were asked about uh two weeks ago uh who should replace Hamas uh when the vacuum in Gaza will be created assuming that it will be created between 70 to 80% of the Israelis said it should be Palestinian Authority now you couldn't hear it a month ago but you're not hearing that from the government are you the government has now said it's going to take over security control of Gaza afterwards no no political perspective the problem is that you listen to our ministers and I listen to the Israelis and let me tell you something you know this government is over they don't know it yet probably but this government is over you know why because we are a democra and when hundreds of thousands of soldiers will come back from this campaign they will not go back home they will go to the streets and they will demand this prime minister and this cabinet minister to disappear from our life and this is you know if there is hope in order to listen to hope to see the hope you shouldn't listen to our ministers you shouldn't listen to our government you should try to understand the Israelis and this is what you will hear from the Israeli people you talk about a two-state solution and I'm wondering where you put those two states because Israel has already said the Jewish people have exclusive rights to the land contained within your current Borders or words to that effect so de facto annexation has already taken place hasn't it what does that leave what does that leave for the Palestinians no you are asking a question which is based on totally wrong assumptions um I think that only only between 10 to 15% of Israelis accept the concept of annexation and even these people you know many of them are doing it because what we learned after Oslo when we were looking for security we got Terror and in but as you pointed out you pointed out at the time that the Palestinians who who wanted a state got settlements didn't they exactly exactly that's all they got from wanting a state no it's not we can change it we can change and the only way to change the way we understand ourselves is a change the way to understand the future and this is the role of the Israeli Society but let me tell you something this is a role of everybody because it is not only a between Palestinians and Israelis anymore it is a regional conflict and will destabilize even probably I don't know the global stability because let me remind you that the energy from the Persian Gulf you know uh is is a vital for India and China and if China will enter so everything is different so I think that this is it became the interest of Britain of Europe America and everybody who care about stability and this is why it is not only our goal it should be the goal of everybody who care and it is in our hands to change the perspective in which we see the future and once people will believe that it is achievable and this this is exactly what we saw during the 90s once people will believe that it is achievable they will support it if you look at what's going on in the West Bank the settler violence against Palestinians that has been reported and commented on by President Biden recently um that doesn't give much cause for optimism does it he said this violence and the settlers responsible had to be held accountable and the violence had to stop do you think the people who've been committing these violence forcing palestin Ians out of their homes and their villages in the West Bank will be held to account um I cannot tell you exactly what will happen but I totally agree with President Biden I think that what I cannot tell you but I do believe I know what minority among the settlers are doing today in the West Bank is a Jewish Terror and I totally disagree with what they do and I think that it is our responsibility Israel responsibility to stop them and if you ask me whether we are doing all what we should I will tell you no I think that we should do much more and until it will stop yes we are accountable and they should be accountable you've spent a lifetime dealing in facts how do you rate the chances of anything good emerging from this terrible War let let me tell you something about what happened on the 7th of October um everything collapsed the way we understand ourselves the way we understand our enemies the way we understand our friends the way we understand the world and we shall have to build Israel from the very beginning but one thing that collapsed is all the rational concept in which we understand ourself and take decisions so we I used to see that you know uh if I if I have to face a problem um I have to try to measure first of all to look for the details and the factors and then to measure and to create scenarios everything is became irrelevant and if I cannot tell you what will be the reasonable scenario in the near future or in the far future so I'm not going to deal with you the only way the only way for me and many people tell me that I'm not that I'm naive I'm not naive I'm realistic because in in in in in a in a reality of care the only way to get out is to say okay I will jump into the future and I will describe Israel in 40 years from now we mentioned the film The The Gatekeepers that you and other former heads of shinb um talked about successes and failures um during your time in service um but there were two statements that stood out this was in 2012 one was from Ki Gillan who said that we Israelis he said are making the lives of millions unbearable and from Abraham Shalom who remarked we have become cruel to ourselves as well but mainly to the occupied population did you agree with those statements in 2012 and if so do you still agree with them yes I totally agree we made we made every mistake uh the only way to understand is to ask how come why did we do it and we did it because we lost confidence in achieving security because we did mistakes but Palestinian did mistakes as well and you mentioned and you are totally right there are two conflict conflicting narratives we see only our narrative they see only their narrative and the only people who can see both narratives are sitting in London in America and in a different planet and this is your role to help us if you really care about us yes tell us our mistakes but tell Palestinians their mistakes and help us to see each other Amon thank you very much for being on conflict Z good to see you thank you very much thank you very much [Music] [Applause] he
