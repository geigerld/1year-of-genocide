Aid agencies and Arab leaders are warning of a looming catastrophe in Israel's plannned offensive against Rafa in southern Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered civilians to leave before the assault begins more than a million displaced Palestinians are Sheltering in the city as Israel battles Hamas which many countries classify as a terror organization Palestinians mourn the dead in Rafa outside of the last partially functional hospitals inside the Gaza Strip according to the Hamas run Health Ministry more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting started 4 months ago Israeli air strikes pummeled the southern Border City of Rafa ahead of an expected ground offensive on the densely crowded city which has become a last refuge for displaced Palestinians fleeing fighting further north and an estimated 1.4 million people are Sheltering in Rafa many of them in makeshift tents finding enough food water and fuel is a daily struggle they say they have nowhere left to go this is the last safe Zone they told us that Rafa would be safe from military operations now they are saying an operation is to take place here and we are supposed to leave of course we heard netanyahu's statements about the evacuation of residents from Rafa for a military operation we came from Gaza City we don't know where we'll go if we leave here where will we go with our children women and wounded the US has warned Israel an invasion of Rafa would be a disaster Aid groups say it's impossible to evacuate everyone from the city the EU and the UN are also expressing alarm at Israel's plans to evacuate Rafa in order to root out Hamas militants it says are hold up there the office of the coordination of humanitarian Affairs say the unprecedent in density of Rafa's population make it nearly impossible to protect civilians uh in the event of ground attacks Ocha says the congestion in Rafa has reached a point where normal routs are blocked by tents set by families seeking any flat clean surface available Israeli troops are pressing deeper into hanun smoke can be seen billowing over the city located less than 16 km away Rafa is the last major population Center in the Gaza Strip Israeli troops have yet to enter it's also the main point of entry for desperately needed relief supplies samah Hadid is a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council and she joins us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman Uh sama we in the media sound like uh broken records but one can't overstate just how densely populated the city of Rafa is now barely containing some 1.4 million people how are those people surviving well what we're hearing from our staff on the ground in Rafa is that the conditions are already dire uh we're seeing a widespread uh diseases even starvation amongst the population so any fullscale military operation from Israel uh would lead to catastrophic situations uh and really would lead to the collapse of the aid system because a lot of the aid is being distributed uh from the area of Rafa and we also have the ra Crossing where AID is is entering into Gaza so it would be a catastrophic situation and an expansion of hostilities could also turn RAF into a zone of Bloodshed and lead to uh more civilian deaths and and casualties and this must be prevented at all costs I want to dig a little deeper into those hostilities the Israeli Prime Minister is asking the Army to draw up evacuation plans but any idea where these people can or will likely go there are very few options left for people to seek safety in Gaza nowhere is safe anymore uh over 1 million people uh fled to Gaza were moved into Gaza on the basis rather RAF on the basis that it was a safe Zone uh and people there are panicking and are really scared about what is to come because there are no options left for them to seek safety uh it's unreal realistic it's also inhumane uh to make people flee once again uh under bombardment and into areas that are are not safe uh so we're pleading with the International Community with allies of the Israeli government to stop this from happening to prevent this bloodbath uh that will occur if the Israeli uh military operation in Raa does move ahead well let's be frank many NOS like yours TR to say appear to have little leverage on what the Israeli military will actually do many noos have asked for ceasefire but the Israeli Prime Minister has made it fairly clear that's unlikely how is your organization preparing for this massive movement or of people or this offensive or both um is there a plan well like all Aid agencies uh we do prepare uh uh for for the delivery of Aid uh and life-saving assistance uh whether under bombardment uh or uh in uh situations of a humanitarian pause but it it cannot be delivered safely to people uh in need of humanitarian assistance and our Aid workers cannot work safely under bombardment and this is why we've been pleading uh with Israel and the International Community to support a ceasefire because this is vital for scaling up Aid and for saving lives and it's beyond time that further action is taken uh by allies of the Israeli government including the UK us and German governments to put pressure on Israel to support a ceasefire this is crucial now uh especially as we have this looming um military offensive in Rafa that will lead to more Bloodshed s Hadid from the norw Refugee Council thank you so much for your time now let's get more about the situation on the ground from Sarah Al Lee she's with save the children and joins us from Aman in Jordan Sarah is safe the children operating in Rafa right now and what's the situation in Rafa the situation in Rafa is catastrophic right now us like many other Aid organizations uh using Rafa as it's the only entry point for Aid into the Gaza right now this is drips and drabs of Aid getting through so some days we get more food water medical supplies but it is a vital lifeline and we know that if the Israeli military expand their military operation in Gaza and in Rafa particularly it will likely be the deadliest chapter of the conflict so far this is a small area 62 Square km where 1.3 million people are currently Sheltering in the open air in the desert in small tents we've got hundreds of thousands of rows of tents and people entire families cramped into those and the thought of air strikes or explosive weapons going off in such a densely populated area the consequences would be catastrophic now the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the Army to evacuate the civilians that are in Rafa uh where can they be moved to there is nowhere for civilians to go in Gaza right now we know that people had already been given these evacuation orders and they were told to leave North Gaza and Central Gaza Palestinians have been moved time and time again now there is absolutely nowhere safe to go in Gaza the prospect of returning North is inconceivable entire neighborhoods have been wiped out there are there is Rubble covering the floors but also unexploded weapons and the remnants of War this is a completely unsafe environment to expect families and children to return to are you in contact uh with the Israeli government with regard to getting more Aid in our staff on the ground uh in continuous Communications with all parties to try and ensure that as much Aid gets through as possible and these conversations are usually facilitated by the UN but the reality is that all of our Aid organizations are unable to sustainably provide humanitarian support because every day we're not seeing a consistent amount of enough Aid getting through even before the recent escalations in violence 80% of gaza's population depended on International Aid and now we know that the need is so severe the entire health system has been decimated the entire population is on the brink of famine people are rationing food water medical supplies are completely running out so there is a limited amount of Aid getting through and the only solution to this is a ceasefire a definitive ceasefire so that humanitarian Aid organizations like ourselves can go in and administer the life saving Aid that is so desperately needed right now sorry Ali there at save the children thank you very
