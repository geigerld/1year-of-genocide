an international operation to bring desperately needed Aid into Gaza by sea is G is gathering momentum a ship uh carrying humanitarian supplies from an American charity is preparing to leave lanica in Cyprus the US and European Union will work with the United Arab Emirates and other countries to ship food medicine and Emergency Shelters the need for Aid in Gaza is huge and overnight Israeli strike in Rafa turned a tower block that once housed 300 families into Rebel already fighting hunger these Palestinians now must live without shelter we were surprised at night with knocking on the apartment doors telling us to evacuate the tower our children fell on the stairs and women fell a friend of mine's wife whose 9 months pregnant fell on the stairs there was a state of panic and fear you have no idea the European Union is coordinating these shipments of food medicine and other supplies the EU together with the US United Arab Emirates and other countries are launching a maritime Corridor for ships to carry food and medicine to Gaza the vessels being loaded in Cypress are nearly ready to go there are many factors involved in a mission like this one it's quite a challenge so I can't predict a timetable for many reasons because of and security but as soon as everything is ready we leave from here one of the humanitarian agencies behind the shipment from Cyprus is constructing its own dock to offload the aid separately the US military is planning to build a pier but construction could take as long as 2 months right now Aid is being dropped into Gaza from the air planes from Jordan Egypt the US France and Belgium are taking part in the operation some a has trickled in by truck over gaza's border to Egypt but it's not enough to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians with the United Nations warning that Gaza is on the brink of famine mik Martin of King's College London told me what needs to be done before the aid arrives in Gaza uh so the the first thing that need sorting out is the permissions and paperwork have still not been completed in Cyprus and part of that is the Israelis signing off the shipment um the actual Journey from Cypress to Gaza is about 200 nautical miles so a ship of that type could do that in a day or less if it wanted to and and this is where it then starts to get very difficult um according to the Charities involved they are planning on building or indeed already are building a pier out to receive the supplies from the ship it's very shallow water it's a beach so you can't just drive the ship up to the the coast um and assuming they're able to do that and that's an undisclosed location for security reasons then there's the biggest problem of all which is Distribution on land how do you make sure that the aid is not mobbed and stolen you know millions of or thousands of desperate people how do they distribute it in a in a fair way and whose responsibility is is that so uh you you've basically got two options uh at the point at which the uh supplies hit the shore then the the general idea would be that one of these Aid agencies would control you know would warehouse and control the central stockage of those supplies but then to get them out to distribution centers uh located around the Gaza Strip that's a big problem because at the start of the conflict the Palestinian police were still uh on duty but they were carrying weapons and so they were targeted by the Israelis because they were carry you know they were young men carrying weapons and so they've effectively gone home and that's one of the reasons why we've had the breakdown of Law and Order so some sort of deal that enables those police to go back to work perhaps unarmed so that they could ensure that those suppliers were able to get out is probably needed in order to get it to the 10 20 30 distribution points in different neighborhoods around G you mentioned the the pier that's uh going to serve temporarily but the US is also building its own dock that could take up to two months to build what form is that likely to take and and um what difference would that one make so the US military has got uh ready-made equipment uh it's effectively a floating ponon that that gets anchored to the seabed and then you build a a floating uh cause way linking up that that pontoon to the sea shore and that equipment is is is in storage and ready to go which is why I'm quite surprised that they're saying it's going to take 60 days to get it there the unit of the US military that that's responsible for using that equipment has been tasked already is getting ready to go uh I would think that the US is able to do it much quicker than that I I wonder whether actually they are under promising so that they can overd deliver I I think they would able to get it done much quicker than that because as I say the equipment will be in storage and ready to go okay we'll leave it there for now Mike Martin from Kings College London thank you for your analysis thank you very much well joining me from Cyprus where that ship is being prepared is eron Gore from the organization World Central Kitchen it has supplied the aid that ship is transporting Aon thanks for your time uh what kind of Aid are you sending to Gaza on that ship behind you and how many people is that going to help yeah we have 200 tons of food going out on this first shipment it'll feed about two million people um this is just the beginning for us we're going to send more ships after this um after this first one goes we already have another ship on the way and we have another 500 tons of food here in Cyprus ready to be deployed to Gaza Arin all that assistance is ready to go how quickly will it get from there uh into the hands of GMS yeah look there's a lot of factors at play here um whether certainly the biggest one when you're dealing with a ship in a maritime Corridor like this um the the transit itself is about 60 hours so we are looking to um leave port as soon as possible and to have the steady steady supply of just continuous food flowing from Cyprus to Gaza um but we are very much at the mercy of the weather at this point um we have you know the food is loaded we actually just finished loading it today so as soon as we are able to leave port we will do so so leaving Port is one thing then there's the transport of 60 hours as you say how will the aid safely arrive in Gaza given that at this moment it doesn't have a functioning port yeah that's right our team in Gaza is working very feverishly to build a temporary Port right now and that construction has started it is a critical critical Factor like you said in getting the food off the boat and into the hands of Gins which is the mission right that is success for us and not only success but a continuous flow so we have a small team here in Cyprus we have a bigger team in Gaza we've served nearly 34 million meals in Gaza um have really dispatched uh 1,400 trucks and so our operations by by land now by sea um a little bit by air as well has really just helped us to get as M as much food as possible into Gaza right now Erin you say that the port or the dock is under construction how long for instance do you know how long it would take to unload that ship behind you and get that food onto land uh we will find out this is this is the first of many and there's like I said a lot a lot of factors that play World Central Kitchen our our rule is that we plan to adapt we tend to meet these moments and have a whatever it takes attitude we plan as best we can we do have some infrastructure ready to get the food off the barge onto land um but look we're going to we're going to learn learn we're going to adapt and we're going to see how this first um this first shipment by boat goes but we like I said we have a team that's on land and um lots of community helpers we have with World Central Kitchen nearly 400 Palestinians that are making this Mission possible so we have a lot of people a lot of players involved in this eron just before I let you go what are the chances that you can match the sort of volumes that could have been delivered by Road previously that you'll now be taking by SE uh that's a challenge right now let's see again how this first how this first run goes um the massive massive amount of Aid that's needed right now I mean our one guarantee is by land that continues to be our Focus here at World Central Kitchen um we have another ship on the way there's lots of conversations by lots of countries that are also going to deliver Maritime Aid so so we'll see right now more is more for Gaza and that's that's a win um as much as we can keep pushing for all corridors to be flooded with food right now uh that's what's needed that's what's needed so from World Central Kitchen I can say we're going to do as much as possible lots of work to be done good luck thanks eron Gore from the aid organization World Central [Music] kitchen now hi TB West Bank and Gaza country director for the a agency Care International in rala Joins me now uh Hiba so a ship of EU uh of EU with relief supplies could soon set sail from Cyprus the USA wants to build a temporary Port off Gaza to make a bridge from land in Gaza to see to meet these Aid ships do we know is this effort this idea moving forward in practice thank you Anthony for this question uh what is matter now is that we try to find the best most efficient quickest solution that would allow us to enter Aid into Gaza of course any kind of uh potential increase in in humanitarian assistant is more assistance is more than welcome H currently because we are talking about especially in the north uh around 25% of the population of Gaza are now moving one one step away from uh from being H uh from being declared under famine stage this means that we are also hearing about uh children who are in acute uh malnutrition one of of six children under the age of two now in the north of Gaza and we have heard about the different children that that passed away unfortunately over the last days because of uh uh dehydration and hunger this means that we need to find again the the most effic efficient solution the quickest one having that that having that said we also know that uh as you mentioned the any effort that is going to be uh um launched now through the sea is a good one but it will take two months and it does not in any way will be able to replace the already existing border points the one in RAF potentially other borders like Ares K Abu Salam all the points that exist and where we have already thousands of trucks waiting at the border to enter at any moment to the north and to the south of Gaza so with so much needed what difference would or or could Aid deliveries by C uh make in this uh scenario will this give Gaza the the volume of Aid uh that it needs unfortunately not if this moment if In This Moment both while we are talking a ceasefire is declared the needs are massive at all levels infrastructure Level Health level uh fuel level water food h h services that exist for different different uh kind of services that are needed in Gaza are massive and we need to start working immediately on Ma Max maximizing the aid entry over February only 50% of the aid that made it in January was in in Gaza was allowed to Gaza and if we used to to describe this as a drop in the ocean of the needs you can imagine half of that is something that is not even equaling what we used to say half a drop in the ocean this means that we need to increase the number of Aid make it more consistent include different components for so for instance water medicine medical equipment uh fuel for for at least the main services including water desalination and hospitals and this is required at at massive level H and this is why we always say this is unprecedent as as this is coming on huge huge scale I TB West Bank and Gaza country director for the adaa agency Care International in rala thanks for being with us thank you
