now Hamas has abducted dozens of people including children and the elderly some hostages were also taken at an outdoor Music Festival close to Gaza gunman shot dead at least 260 people there now the families of some of those at the festival still have no news about their loved ones they don't know whether they are dead or alive our correspondent Tanya Kramer sent us this report the uncertainty is unbearable since Saturday Hadas and Tom shalom have had no news of their daughter Noam she was at a rave next to giut near the Gaza border when Hamas militants launched their attack no was calling at 8:30 about 8:30 in the morning in Saturday and she was frighten and crying and um she was like saying there's gunshot we could hear like there is gunshot around and uh we find some shelter place and we group of people together and um these things happen here sometimes you know like I was telling her no problem you're in a safe place don't worry this will end soon and uh see you in a while and uh she said okay I don't have much battery so uh I love you all and um I'm I'm afraid but I love you all and I don't know what's going to happen but anyway I love you all remember that she said up to several thousand mainly young party goers were at this site Saturday morning when Rockets were launched and gunmen started to shoot at least 250 people died here dozens are missing thought to be taken to Gaza and held hostage by the militants 3 Days Later thas Shalom and his family are still searching hospitals hoping their daughter wasn't abducted that was the last time that anyone heard something from no and uh from that time we are kind of in a total darkness there is a sense of sadness anger and uncertainty of what is there to come as more details emerge from what unfolded on Saturday many Israelis have a hard time to come to ter with the unprecedented attack on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip in Tel Aviv yam hadari has also been looking for her friend Ram he was working at the festival they have known each other since they were teenagers and then the last contact with him was at 9:21 a.m. um Saturday morning he sent a text message to his mother and uh in the text message he says that he he loves them his family um but he's in a container uh there are a lot of terrorists outside lots of gunshots outside and it does not seem like they are going to make it out of their Al friends and family scoured social media for a sign of Life they didn't know what had happened to him but then a text message arrives um I was just asking Rams why wife L if um if she can send me one of his pictures so I can uh so I can send it to you it's from their wedding day and um and uh she says that they they told them now officially that he's dead um his family knows already he's one of the many killed in this attack uh DW's Jerusalem correspondent T Kramer filed that report you just saw and she joins me now um Tanya as as you say in your report many people are still missing uh they may have been abducted um but what do we know about the people who are known to have been taken well I think right now I mean it's an incredibly difficult situation for people um uh with L ones missing because there's still the identification process going on for those we saw in the report who are still waiting to know what happened to them but there are others they know for sure because there were some of the hering videos that were posted on social media where they saw their love Fones being dragged over the border into Gaza they also don't know you know are they injured uh what has happened to them and from some some of those there are some of the details that are coming there was an elderly woman from a kibuts that was dragged and you know uh driven away uh on a on a pickup truck uh we also saw a young uh guy in his 20s he was almost half naked on a pickup truck we also know about a young paramedic a young woman uh who was uh taken to Gaza these are you know relatives they know uh that their um loved ones are in Gaza and there's an identification process at the moment going on with the uh Army uh informing uh families uh what has happened to their L ones but there are also more and more details uh coming out you know from from other areas in the South that have been closed off until now for example in kibuts ber that's also very very close to the Gaza border where over 100 bodies have been discovered in the past days and more and more of those relatives and families are reaching out especially also to the foreign media because they want you know the world to know what has happened there very quickly Tanya what can you tell us about the Israeli government's plans to rescue the hostages are other governments for example whose Nationals are among those hostages stepping into help well this is still too early uh to tell because um we know we have to look maybe in the past I mean Hamas has taken hostages uh before uh like in 2006 a soldier was uh uh captured and then taken into Gaza he was released only in 2011 um against a thousand Palestinian prisoners but this is so unprecedented you know taking civilians people children so um there's no Playbook here what is there to come for them and that's where we'll leave it for the moment we will be coming back to you Tanya later in our coverage that's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem and I'm now joined by lirry Roman his sister yardin has been missing since Saturday's terrorist attack by Hamas yardin was visiting relatives in kibuts Berry in southern Israel when it was attacked Yan's husband and her three-year-old daughter uh were abducted but they managed to escape lirry joins uh me now from give in Israel lirry I really appreciate you uh coming on to the program uh today I can't imagine how difficult uh this must be for you but can you just start by telling us a little bit more about your sister's disappearance yes of course thank you Christine for having us um as you said um my sister and her family alone her husband and G and her daughter a three-year-old daughter um went to their fam's dinner um for holiday for a holiday feast um in Friday evening they stayed the night there um and woke up on Saturday for this madness um people coming to their home um to the shelter that they have built for their family um and just pulled them out of there um in the house um all alone's family my my sister's husband um two of his um parents his sister as well um they were taking at um at different stages he was the first one um he was got into a car um he thought that G and GE um were hiding and that they'll be okay yeah and but after a few minutes they also were pulled into the same car and and they were all taken together and towards the Border um this is where our story have a little of magic in it um where they found this opportunity to just get out of the car a car with three terrorists um armed and they started running they started running the beginning they had a chance uh to run without anyone behind them um but then they've they heard the terrorists after them starting to shoot towards and this is the point this is where where they they lost track of each other where they went in different directions uh Larry as I understand I'm spurring you on because I do want to get other aspects of of this uh of this story um have you heard any news uh it's been 4 days now since your sister disappeared any indication of her whereabouts no um so because there is the spot of where y Yen and Alon um got aart a certain tree where he last saw her um there are teams that are looking in the field trying to find any track any sign of a direction we hope that maybe she's still hiding somewhere but we've heard nothing we know nothing um it's an innocent woman a mother for a three-year-old child that is now here with me um that we need to take care of her until her mother will be back specifically here um then he also German citizen um so we did want to hear also from from Germany um to put as much as much pressure to to know about a citizen of Germany that is that's missing in the unknown since Saturday Larry um of course there's a lot of uncertainty here we saw in my colleague Tanya Kramer's report that we AED uh shortly before talking to you uh for some families uh the reality is their relatives have been uh found and the news is not great because the relatives have been found dead um I wondered L this is probably a very unfair question to you but if your sister is being held somewhere in Gaza does that give you a little bit more hope that that that she is alive um bearing in mind we don't know what's happening to to the hostages that have been taken uh into Gaza I think that this is why it's so important for us um to talk about it and to bring it to the attention of the world um so everyone will will care about those people so the attackers will keep them safe they will have them and hold them but they will keep them safe because they'll know that they're not messing just with Israel and they're not just messing with the Israeli um government it's not a war war of an Army against Army it's innocent people it could be if it's if it's going to be a system of Terror it's going to be everywhere and we hope that the voice of world will help us keep your safe even though she's held hostage somewhere Larry um we're reporting a lot about this ground offensive that we anticipate that Israel will launch into into Gaza and we've heard from Hamas uh that they will kill some of the hostages or they will kill the hostages that they've taken uh in retaliation uh to that does that does that worry you uh knowing that this is the threat on your sister's life if indeed she is in um in Gaza I must be honest and say that we are we're interviewing here today because we feel it's very important to to tell the story and to make the whole world aware but I'm not much aware of what's going on in the in the um press and what's what's what we hear from Kamas um because I have a three-year-old to take care of yeah um and I appreciate that I don't want to I I totally understand that um of course you've got a lot to deal with at the moment um Larry have you um there are other fames that are in in in the situation that you are in now have you been in contact uh with them is there some kind of a support system that you all have established to help each other uh at this moment so there are a few and we're trying um at the beginning everything was chaos um as expected I guess um nobody knew anything and we're still trying to figure out there a lot of different channels of communication different groups um not everything is very organized uh not everything is official we haven't got a even not one official phone call um from an authority saying we're looking for your sister or we don't have any new information but we're on it um and this is one of the main things that we need the support of one another um to try and push to try and um get some sense into this crazy situation Larry I really appreciate you're coming on to the program today to talk to us about this um thank you so much uh for sharing uh that story with us that is Larry Roman whose sister is still missing uh since Saturday's uh attacks thanks so much again Larry all the best to your family thank you well I'm joined Now by Moshi zimman he is an Israeli historian and a leading Authority on nationalism and anti-Semitism he joins me tonight from Jerusalem Mr Timberman we appreciate you for staying up to talk with us this evening um I'm sure you've heard the news Israeli forces today saying that they have regained total control of Israeli territory along the border with Gaza but they didn't do it in time to prevent the kidnapping of some 150 people who are now hostages in the hands of Hamas what does history tell you about the chances of getting these hostages out safe and sound well it is a very tragic history that we have it's very hard to get the hostages back from any ER Arab country and especially not from the Hamas we had already long story about getting back one soldier or one civilian now we have to do with a whole group of more than 100 people so the chances of getting them back uh even if we are ready if Israel is ready to pay the price is very low what is the Readiness in Israeli Society in your opinion of um accepting the price being collateral damage that these hostages um may have to die in order to defeat Hamas well it is quite clear that the Army is going to try to free those hostages by force and of course we know that this is a very uh difficult task the general public is of course all for freeing the people but they take the chance after all that while bombing the Gaza Strip This is going to bring about the death of the hostages too the wish for Revenge I think is at the moment so strong that the other considerations are becoming more background consideration it is a very cruel decision to be made but the my impression is that people are ready to take the risk they are all for punishing the Arabs punishing the people of Gaza of course punishing Hamas and they are ready to pay the price the prime minister of Israel Netanyahu he says that he is going to change the Middle East um and when you hear him say that um what do you understand in that statement change it in what way I mean what will this new this different Middle East look like after this attack on Hamas well I'm a Israeli as a Israeli I got used to not to believe to anything that my prime minister says but I understand what he intends to do he wants to erase Hamas and maybe even more than only Hamas he wants to change the balance of power in Gaza and around Gaza and between Israel and the Arab neighbors by punishing Hamas or by punishing Gaza this is a general idea I don't believe I don't think that he going to H achieve a real change if he is not going to be ready to deal with the Palestinians especially in the those of the pal Palestinian Authority as long as you don't you don't show any signs of Readiness to have real peace with the Palestinians I'm not talking about Hamas I'm talking about the Palestinian people in the West Bank then of course you are not going to change anything radically and it's a only a kind of a slogan that he uses in order to console the Israeli soul I know that you've been critical of netanyahu's government and you've called this war a failure of the Israeli State what exactly do you mean by that the Israeli state was created in order to be a safe haven for Jews from all over the world we know about the story of the Jews in the diasporas in the 18th century in the 12th century that were programed by the non-jews by Christian by others and the idea a the whole idea of Zionism world to create a state to create a place in which Jews will live safely this is something that was really destroyed by the uh what happened Saturday near the Gaza Strip Jews in Israel in the sovereign state of Israel in the sovereign state of the Zionist movement was slaughtered were programed the same way as it was uh in the 18th century and 19th century Eastern Europe or even during the second world war when the Nazis invaded East invaded the ussl if the state has failed in its obligation to protect the people in Israel um let me ask you personally do you feel less safe now than you did a week ago I mean what what have the events from Saturday what have they done to your notion of of personal safety inside the Jewish state of Israel well of course I expect the Israeli Army to protect most of the Israeli Society this was an exception this occurrence three days ago but in general one must have to admit that the Israeli State Israel the state H is not very successful ful in really keeping the safety of the Israeli people it's not only a problem of such a brutal attack like the one from Gaza this is something that you feel in the everyday life there is something wrong about the way the Israeli Israeli politics understand their Duty toward their people and their Duty toward history historian M Zimmerman Mr Zimmerman I wish we had more time to talk about this but I certainly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us tonight thank you thank you very much journalist Addie compel witz in Jerusalem told us earlier more about these reported atrocities you said earlier that we can't show the photos out of respect to the victims uh unfortunately I had to watch these materials today and never in all of my journalism career have I seen such horrific videos and images from anywhere in the world we're talking about tens and tens of mutilated bodies some of them burned beheaded babies thrown in the trails of the little community of karaza whole families burned to death in their shelters young mothers young children shot down while they were bound outside their houses truly unimaginable things immense amounts of blood in each and every house of the kibuts a result of the slaughter because the terrorists went from house to house they didn't just come to attack or conquer the kibuts they came to annihilate the community to destroy them completely to decimate them and we have to realize the scale of this Kar AA is one of several communities On the Border there were about 700 people living in this kibuts before the slaughter at least a 100 of them are dead now that basically means that the kibo as it was will no longer exist the ACT done by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in these communities is no less than ethnic cleansing President Biden uh uh compared these acts of sheer evil as he said to Isis I don't even recall images like this coming from Iraq when Isis did their journey of Horrors there truly unprecedented sight one Community after the other karaza just being the first one that we getting testimonies out
