US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has said that a ceasefire that the US is working on would be the best way to ensure humanitarian assistance gets to Palestinians in Gaza blinkin who was in Egypt for talks on Thursday said Israel needs to do more to help increase the flow of Aid he signaled some hope saying that he still believes that a ceasefire agreement is possible bin says that the gaps are narrowing between Israel and tamas over the deal here's what bin said after meeting with Arab forward ministers over the past several weeks there's a clear consensus around a number of shared priorities first the need for an immediate sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages uh that would create space to Surge more humanitarian assistance to relieve uh the suffering of many people and to build something more enduring now the ceasefire that we're working on would be the best most immediate way to enable us to Surge humanitarian assistance but it's not the only way uh we agreed today all of the ministers that we would get our experts together in the coming days uh to identify the Urgent practical and conrete steps that Canen and should be taken to increase the flow of assistance for the US Secretary of State in Cairo today for this latest round of ceasefire negotiations how much success did he have I want to talk about that with journalist kareim alahar who is in Cairo kareim it's good to see you again we just heard linoln um talking there how much how closer or how far apart are we today to an immediate sustainable ceasefire well he said basically that is the main Way Forward he said also that they're getting closer but also admitting that there are still a lot of difficulties ahead I think one of the best indications that there is something on the table that's worth negotiating is the fact that tomorrow uh there will be a big meeting in Doha in Qatar also with the head of the Israeli mad intelligence service so there seems to be enough to continue the negotiations and the blink seems to be quite optimistic that it will move forward Blan also said that Israel needs to do more W with Aid deliveries to Gaza it seems that the US is now I don't want to say on a full confrontation course with Netanyahu but it it could be described that way um and that pressure is building up what would you say is behind this strategy well he clearly said that there is more Aid coming in in the last days but he said it's by far not enough and uh of course that is a clear call towards the Israeli sides to finally open their borders to really get in massive amounts of AIDS I think what is uh behind it is is really that uh we just heard it some days ago from the world food program that is warning of an imminent famine in the Gaza Strip and imminent famine is like there's certain indicators the great of malnutrition among children for example how many children food security food insecurity of the Gaza Strip which blinkin also said in the press conference is for 100% of the people in the Gaza Strip so I think the US doesn't want to be complicit any longer into the situation and why that's why they're pressuring for more Aid to coming in and it's an indication also that the negotiations when blinkin comes to Israel tomorrow will be quite tough if he wants to move forward on this yeah how much leverage do you think the US has right now in um trying to you know push Israel in a certain direction we know that Netanyahu have said that there is no alternative to a ground assault in Rafa well that's a question uh I mean tough tough talk tomorrow in Israel probably will be not enough it's a question I mean there's clear words now or more clear words by the US side that there needs to be more Aid coming in that we need to have a ceasefire uh the question is what's what how is the US acting on this talks and I mean we have at the same time we have all this talk but at the same time of of course the biggest military assistance for netan in this Gaza War comes from the US so there's a lot of Leverage the US has which he didn't use yet and we are hearing from the office of Benjamin Netanyahu that on Friday Israel's spy Chief David Baria will travel to Qatar to secure a Gaza ceasefire that would include a hostage release when you hear that Kareem would you say that this indicates that things are moving that that we are looking at possible progress yes absolutely but because we don't know the details but we know also what the sticking points are I think the main sticking point is basically there's an agreement that for six weeks ceas fire and for the release of 40 Israeli hostages in exchange for the 20 to 30 fold number of Palestinians from being to be released from Israeli prisons but there's a lot of sticking points then then there think the main sticking point is that Hamas is saying we're going to continue to release hostages in a second phase and that means also the soldiers but we want to have guarantees for a permanent ceasefire and for an end of this war and that is something of course very difficult to stomach for Netanyahu because his uh announced objective in this war is the destruction of Hamas which he would have not achieved in this case journalist kareim Al gari from Cairo tonight with the latest Kareem thank you you're welcome well I'm joined Now by Israeli foreign and security policy expert Gil morciano he's the CEO of the israel-based think tank mfim he joins me tonight from Tel Aviv it's good to have you with us um this is the very first time that the United States is calling for an immediate ceasefire this is a major shift how is the Israeli government likely to view this well I mean I think that we are focusing on this specific step as a pressure tool on the Israeli government but I think that when we speak about the blinken call that was issued in the in the Saudi media interview we are mainly speaking about the attempt or a diplomatic action by the US to preserve the initiative in the UN Council amid reports that Russia is planning to offer new new forms or new calls trying to keep their initiative instead of Ving avoiding a veto on that level but I also think in the timing and place and the context of the visit it's also a show of resolve by the US government to show strategic partners that the American goals are aligned with a strategic Vision or an attempt to desg or to outline a vision for the day after especially lacking such effort from the Israeli government yeah so you say the United States trying to create clarity about where it stands we're getting Clarity also from Benjamin Netanyahu he argues that there is no alternative plan than to continue the attack on Rafa to ultimately defeat Hamas do you agree with that well I think that it's a question of what we Define how do we Define the goal of defeating Hamas if we are talking about a military action that is meant to reduce its military power in Gaza I think that was achieved in the last five months um but there's also limits to the military action basically if we speak about marginal marginalizing Hamas movement then defeating Hamas is not just a military action it's mostly and mainly a political maneuver and that's something that Nan is not willing to discuss right now from obvious political obstacles in his government any kind of plans for a day after a political day after and that obviously leaves major vacuums for Hamas to actually re-enter one of the main example that we see right now and you mention it the issue of humanitarian Aid uh in the last couple of months we've seen the expansion of a military of a human Aid into Gaza but lacking any alternative any attempt to build an administrative control that would replace Hamas by the Israel government uh we see how Hamas actually take over this humanitarian Aid and sell it to the citizens and basically preserve its deao power on the ground I want to stick with Netanyahu for just a moment in in your opinion how much pressure can the US exert on Netanyahu at this point I think we're already seeing a change in in American policy not so much regarding the support of Israel when it comes to supplying arms but have you we've seen a clear separation between um protecting or maintaining the right of Defense of Israeli citizens and their aversion I would even say from the policies of this Israeli government especially the right-wing the extreme rightwing ashon within it um so I think that when we are closing in on the election we are talking about a certain L of support among young the young generation of the democratic party in swing states such as Michigan um then there's also the domestic calculation I think that we still see a consistency in American in American policy towards the war but when we speak about the expansion of the war especially about Rafa which is currently the major policy issue and expansion of Israeli military operation into Rafa then we're going to see those gaps becoming more and more apparent and without an Israel ability to show any new initiative the the gaps are going to become much more meaningful in the relations between the countries yeah you you say what we're hearing from the US has to do with politics this is a an election year if we were to take that out of the equation if if Joe Biden were not fighting for reelection this coming November do you think we would be seeing the United States right now calling for an immediate ceasefire I think it's just one factor but I think the major issue I mean we can speak about disagreement between Israel in the US regarding braf or about the humanitarian Aid I think the major issue here regardless of domestic consideration is whether or not Israel is planning or even willing to discuss an exit strategy I mean the uh acceptance or the understanding that the US has shown before to the war goals to the understanding that Hamas could not continue governing Gaza to regaining the security situation or to allowing Israelis all those things that we've seen at the start were based on the commitment of an Israel government to actually speak about the day after to offer initiative to speak about the return of the PE of the Palestinian Authority uh to speak about a an alternative for Kamas that would be viable and would allow the US instead of being stuck in an ongoing War to actually promote a new political order together with region electors and that's why coming back to your origional point this meeting between region electors and between blink is about that about signifying the need to deal with a certain Vision something that we have not from this Israel government I want to emphasize it's not about the lack of a ability to present a plan that the US accept it is the unwillingness to discuss any kind of plan or any kind of exit strategy at this moment okay yeah that's right the day after still the big question Gil Marciano Israeli foreign and security policy expert Gil we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you thank you very much European leaders meanwhile have been meeting in Brussels today where Gaz is humanitarian crisis is on the agenda alongside Ukraine and plans to develop Europe's defense capabilities now EU leaders will also consider proposals to buy armaments for Ukraine using the proceeds of Frozen Russian assets and whether to open membership talks with Bosnia Hova un Secretary General Antonio gutieres arrived at the start of the two-day EU Summit to encourage more relief for gazans the UN says a quarter of gaza's population is starving well the European Union's foreign policy Chief Joseph Burell has described the situation in Gaza as being not a humanitarian crisis but rather a failure of humanity he says the EU leaders meeting in Brussels who collectively form the European Council will be calling for the release of Israeli hostages as well as a ceasefire that will hold today the council goes much further supporting unra asking for a sustainable CE fire certainly asking also for the freedom of hostages needless to say condemning Mam's attack but showing an strong concern for the situation of the people in Gaza which is unacceptable toally Israel has the right to defend not to Revenge not to Revenge defend all right I want to pull in our correspondent Jack perck now he's following the summit for us in Brussels Jack is Joseph barell as he's speaking for all all EU heads of government when he calls for a sustainable ceasefire well that is exactly what we're looking to see throughout the process of this Summit whether the EU leaders will agree for that progression the last time we had any of the European union leaders agreeing on some sort of call for a change in the situation of Israel's military uh campaign in the Gaza Strip against the Hamas Terror organization they called for humanitarian pauses to allow Aid in our DW team here in Brussels has been covering and listening to a lot of the briefings from a lot of the different EU member states over the last few days and going into this Summit we understand that the language coming out will say that the EU will call for immediate humanitarian pauses leading to a sustainable ceasefire five or six months ago the idea of calling for a ceasefire was an absolute nogo for the EU leaders especially Germany which didn't feel they could call for that but we do understand that as this Summit progresses the EU leaders will be able to call for that sustainable ceasefire that that language will get into the document that comes out after this Summit Jack leaders are also talking about using Frozen Russian assets to boost Aid to Ukraine are we going to see that happen that's a trickier one to get an agreement on frankly this is a really interesting concept uh about the Russian Central Bank has about 210 billion EUR in a a financial mechanism which has been ACR interest over the last couple of years since the fullscale invasion and since Russia's assets Financial Assets in Europe were frozen around three billion has been uh raised as part of that now the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz on his way into this Summit said there's a growing majority here in the European Council of all the 27 leaders that suggests that that money could be used to start buying uh ammunition and weapons by the Europeans themselves that then could be sent to the ukrainians now KL nmer however the Austrian Chancellor he's saying actually no that what they understood their agreement was was that it would be for the Reconstruction of Ukraine so it appears to be some disputes within the European Council we can see that Olaf Schultz during these meetings he's trying to get the other leaders on side whether he manages to do so it might be a long shot but this is now on a table how does the European Union use these Frozen Russian assets we know that Russia's fullscale invasion of Ukraine has prompted a lot of talk about boosting Europe's defenses is there agreement on how this will happen now this is an even more complicated again issue this idea that's being floated of Defense bonds after the corona V virus pandemic what we saw is the European Union started using the European commission the executive body it's a bit technical but it has a AAA r rating it has the best rating to borrow money on the international markets and it used that rating to borrow money to get out of the covid-19 pandemic and then it's used it for green uh to help with the green transition and now there are some countries which are starting to say it should be used to gain money for the European Union to proect protect its defense a lot of leaders including the German Chancellor said okay nice idea but I don't think that we'll see any clear agreement on that during this Summit but it is significant Brent that they're talking about this now okay Jack perck for us in Brussels Jack as always
