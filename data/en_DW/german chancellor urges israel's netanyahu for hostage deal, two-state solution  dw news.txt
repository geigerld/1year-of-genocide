German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem amid growing bilateral tensions over Israel's war against Hamas Netanyahu reiterated Israel's focus on eliminating Hamas his plan including an offensive into Rafa in the strip where more than a million displaced Palestinians are Sheltering Schultz said Israel's security is essential but that there must be a long-term peace solution that includes Palestinian governance in Gaza and the West Bank Schultz also called for more Aid to reach Palestinian civilians voicing concern for the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip both ladies gave statements after their meeting we cannot stand by and watch Palestinians risk starvation that's not us that is not what we stand for together much more humanitarian Aid is needed continuously reliably I shared my concerns with the prim Minister that provision of aid from Israel into Gaza and the conditions for distribution must be urgently and massively improved we believe that the key to peace is security many believe that the key to security is peace but peace is unsustainable without a strong Israel and if we are offered a peace agreement or a path to peace that makes Israel so weak and unable to defend itself and our neighbors still uh adhering to the go goal of destroying the Jewish State uh then obviously we will set peace backward and not forward we want to move peace forward and for that Israel has to have the necessary security responsibility in this tiny area otherwise the radicals take over so as you heard there Germany pushing for the protection of Palestinians the German Leader's narrative shifting from Israel's right to defend itself DW Shani rosanas was following the press conference um he adults also pushed for a comprehensive hostage deal that's important because I mean every day that goes by puts their lives at risk correct and that's actually the center of attention now in Israel we know that Hamas gave its answer for uh the terms that were already negotiated just the end of last week Israelis were contemplating over the weekend what should be their response and um the head of the Mad Israeli spy agency is expected to travel to Doha the capital of katar tomorrow to further go on with the with the negotiations though there are still major uh contention points between the two sides we need to be very cautious about any signs of optimism because Hamas still very much is against U any any demand of Israel to to to to stop they insist that Hamas insists that gazans can go back to the S the northern part of the strip Israel is very much against it and that's a very big point in what's the future for the Gaza Strip and for these negotiations and it's it is correct very much the lives of of those hostages are are in Jeopardy every day um it's getting you know we hear more and more of them that are being are being pronounced that by the Israeli military at the same time it sounds like there's no stopping the raer offensive correct because Israel feels that's the only ace it has up its sleeve it's back to a wall uh the humanitarian uh situation is so dire and the international pressure is such that um you know Americans Germany is itself also started delivering Aid themselves to the Gaza Strip so Israel does not have that car that it's been using for months so what else does it have they feel like they have to keep on pushing on Rafa or at least seem to be willing to push into ha in order to get Hamas to budge a little bit when it comes to some uh making some you know some compromise on the deal and and that's also let's not forget the idea of the hostages and bringing them home is a core issue when it comes to Israeli policy when it comes to the Israeli mindset the public the Israeli public that's a sore open wound that keeps bleeding every day and Netanyahu knows he needs to solve that problem predictably Schultz brought up a two-state solution the reaction well n doesn't like the word the combin they hear this word combination together uh he he doesn't like to hear it from Schultz he doesn't like to hear it from the Americans uh and this is partially part of the criticism that he's getting from the International Community but also slowly growing criticism from within and what is the plan what is the political long-term plan what's the Strategic goal for the end of what we're seeing because we're approaching over almost you know five and a half months almost in this uh terrible war and there's no Seem doesn't seem to be any end inside the the goal of elimination of Hamas is also far from being reached um so if you don't want to bring in the Palestinian Authority which is also something that Charles clearly said you know the need for a reformed Palestinian Authority that will have Gaza and the West Bank is the only way out and Netanyahu is not willing to even discuss that and this is exactly what we're seeing now the the growing tension between netan and the rest of the world on the plan for the day after and who's taking over uh the chaos that we're seeing uh in the Gaza Strip is something that it's very clear is not sustainable sh rosanas our Middle East analyst thank you very much for coming you're welcome
