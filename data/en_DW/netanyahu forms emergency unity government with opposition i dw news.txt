Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formed an emergency Unity government with opposition leader Benny Gans Gans a former Army Chief is also to be part of a three-man war cabinet led by Netanyahu they'll be joined by defense minister yav Galant netanyahu's far right and Al Ultra Orthodox Jewish allies are to remain in government but Parliament will have no say on matters relating to the conflict Netanyahu has promised to in Words Crush and Destroy Hamas in retaliation for its terrorist attacks and I am now joined by our correspondent Tanya Kramer who is in Jerusalem for us Tanya it's good to see you what is the mood in Israel on day five of Israel's war with Hamas well I think it's a bit difficult to generally describe the mood but I mean you could say in Jerusalem uh West and East it is unusually quiet we also have seen this in in Tel Aviv in the past days and also in other cities many shops are closing early um uh people are very worried basically what is there to come and people don't seem to like to be you know very much outside uh there's a sense of uncertainty uh here uh what the next uh days and weeks will bring Tanya tell us more about the emergency wartime government that prime minister Mr Benjamin netu has formed uh with the [Applause] opposition well I think it would have been Unthinkable uh to have such a Unity uh government just a few days ago um the opposition leader Benny guns had refused before to join Benjamin Netanyahu uh we are coming here out of a internal crisis since January thousands of uh Israelis were going to the streets demonstrating every week against the controversial judicial overhaul of the farri religious government and what this Unity government or emergency government now wants to show is uh they want to reassure Israelis they want to show we're taking care of that because there are also a lot of questions why this could happen the way it happened what unfolded on Saturday and uh it's also the makeup or the setup of this government and this smaller War cabinet it's all people with a u military background we have former Chiefs of Staff we have former and current defense ministers there and that of course goes also we have a minister for National Security far right Minister it bangua he will not be part of that so basically it's saying we're taking care of this situation and we have to overcome this division that is basically the message now to the Israeli public Washington's top Diplomat is on his way to Israel what do we know about Anthony blinken's visit yeah he's on his on on his way uh he's being dispatched here in a way uh to show uh uh to Israel that um it has the US has its back he said it himself before um boarding uh the plane on his way way here he will meet uh Israeli officials uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu isra president herzo as well uh there will be certainly talking about military assistant uh there's already uh some um military equipment arrived and uh the US has sent a large aircraft carrier uh to the region uh they will also we heard this warn basically other parties and I think um other parties to join this conflict basically to open another front uh and to prevent a vider conflict but they also are expected to talk about um uh Missing uh American Nationals there's still uh some Nationals also Americans unaccounted for and some that are believed to have been uh taken hostage all right that's Alanya Kramer reporting for us in Jerusalem thank you Tanya and I'm now joined by a spokesperson for the Israeli military Masha mitchelson Miss Michelson welcome to DW there is a desperate need uh for humanitarian Aid in Gaza as we speak um will Israel help open a corridor for this Aid to flow into Gaza the coordination of humanitarian Aid to this area is being discussed uh the decision will be made by the political Echelon after they've assessed the situation right now the IDF is focused on securing the border and targeting Hamas military targets within the Gaza Strip and as you do that uh Miss Michelson we know we're talking about an area that is densely populated the Gaza that is how are you distinguishing between Hamas terrorists your enemy and innocent civilians the IDF has various protocols in place to minimize the harm to civilians but uh you could ask what measures did Hamas take when they infiltrated our Villages and killed over a thousand people over two days the IDF is targeting Hamas military targets the problem is and we've been saying this for years that Hamas is hiding behind their people if a terrorist organization is hiding missiles and launchers and ammunition underneath kindergartens and schools and mosques it becomes a lot more difficult to warn civilians the IDF is still attempting to do that because we care about the citizens of Gaza a lot more than they do but our first priority is to protect our country and to make them pay for the great mistake that they made on Saturday morning understandably so but Israel also has the responsibility uh to abide by the rules of engagement and that is you have an obligation to protect civilians in Gaza again various protective measures in place the IDF is attempting to minimize civilian harm in Gaza but we're striking terrorist targets and if there's a terrorist there shooting missiles at Israel he will be struck Miss Michelson how far are you in your efforts to free the hostages that have been taken into Gaza can you give us an update on that there are military efforts to uh finish identifying the bodies something that only began happening a day or two ago as we cleared the southern area mostly of terrorists and it became more or less secure to move around there so families right now are trying to identify their loved ones a task made immeasurably more difficult by the gruesome ways Hamas has massacred and butchered those people people burned decapitated uh so we're taking DNA samples waiting till our bodies are ident identified and we're Gathering the final number of hostages and trying to get their locations to see how we can move forward so if I understand correctly you're not sure exactly how many hostages are in Gaza we have a general number we're trying to exactify it right um you're having to fight Hamas in Gaza as you as you pointed out um you're also having to defend against attacks uh potential attacks as well uh by hisb in the north is Israel uh in a good position or or does Israel have the capacity to be able to essentially fight a war on two fronts here because that's what it looks like over the last few days since the beginning of the war Israel has had the most efficient recruitement of reservists in its history 300,000 people reported for Duty in 48 hours not all of those recruited into the southern front some of them moved up North so the 91 division of the IDF is fully prepped and ready for any threat that comes its way so far the IDF is operating in the north and keeping it relatively contained there have been uh some incidents that have been dealt with you're presumably planning a ground offensive um I'll be interested if you could tell us a little bit more about perhaps when we can expect to see that happening um but also what do you need from your Western allies right now in terms of a support to be able to carry out uh that ground offensive I would leave the timing of the ground offensive and the decision itself to the political Echelon we have a security cabinet that has been presented all plausible military options to make that decision considering all the factors um but right now what we're focusing on is securing the border and we're stabilizing our force that have recruited we have reservists that need to be trained and prepped for all further options on the point about securing the borders are there still Hamas militants in Israel if there are there are very few and they will be met uh with IDF fire shortly just yesterday we had an infiltration close to ber three uh terrorists were killed in that engagement with idea forces we are placing our forces armored vehicle tanks aerial supervision around the border and anyone who tries to get close to the fence and infiltrate into Israeli territory will be shot Miss Michelson we know that the stated goal as we're hearing it from Israel's political leadership uh is to eradicate Hamas um my question then is when you are done with Hamas in in Gaza um you'll be left with a vacuum does Israel intend to reoccupy Gaza then is the plan that Israeli troops will have to remain in in in Gaza for for an extended period after that operation I will not delve into the larger strategy of the ID F again as I said there's been military options that have been presented to the security cabinet and we just want to make sure that Hamas has no ability to attack Israel like they did on Saturday that was the deadliest attack on the state of Israel since the day of its formation are you any closer to establishing uh why this planned attack by Hamas was missed by Israeli intelligence we're getting this question a lot and it's very important everybody understands it but this important question needs to be answered properly properly being without bias calmly thoroughly and that means that the state of Israel and the people of Israel need to be safe in their homes with their loved ones without the country being under attack When The War is Over the IDF will make sure that all those questions are answered and the answers are given to the public just coming back back and perhaps we can leave it then here uh to the the ground offense of that R World anticipating um what are some of the Tactical challenges uh that awaits on that front I wouldn't know when a ground Invasion would happen but as you stated yourself the territory of Gaza is highly uh densely populated and I would think that the main challenge there is moving between the streets um while considering that they have aial capab capabilities that there are still tunnels in Gaza and that we would need to be aware of a have to stop you there thanks very much ma'am our program has come to a close we appreciate your being on the program today thank you thank you all right we want to get some analysis now on the security situation with military expert a familiar face here Marina she's from Kings College London Mar it's good to see you Israel's response so far has been to launch air strikes on alleged Hamas Targets in Gaza how effective is this type of military power against um an organization like Hamas well it is a good question because um so far the IDF claimed to have struck 2,300 Targets in Gaza how effective it is is difficult to say at the stage in military terms whether it managed to weaken the capabilities to strike um command and control uh points of Hamas because Hamas Was preparing for this and Hamas has studied the Israeli military approach over the years they have encounters with the IDF that being said the political cost for Israel launching these attacks because of their indiscriminate n creating um a lot of um collateral damage is difficult and specifically difficult it is for the overall um power dynamics in the Middle East and the normalization of Israeli relations with the likes of Saudi Arabia and Qatar because this seems to be hanging in the air so the political cost might be very high for Israel regardless of what the military will be achieving this ground offensive in your opinion is this just a matter um not of if but of when and is it even possible that Israel would not start this ground offensive well it seems to be that Israel has met the resolve to indeed start this um ground operation we don't know when exactly ly but if they have decided so we might be seeing some movement soon that being said it will be quite difficult because of the nature of the operation and because of the fact that this is precisely something that Hamas probably wanted to provoke knowing the controversial nature of the operation knowing how the Israeli military operates and knowing how difficult the terrain is because as we have seen from many analysts the attacks prepared by the Hamas they haven't been prepared in two weeks they have been prepared for for possibly many years building underground tunnels and getting all the necessary ammunition and Military Support from um regimes like the Iranian regime and also from other militant groups like Hezbollah and so the risk here is that this ground operation might trigger something bigger namely opening of another front um um in the north where on the border with Lebanon and hollah has already launched some attacks in order to signalize it meaning that Israel could see itself surrounded if this was to escalate military expert Marina from King's College London as always Marina thank
