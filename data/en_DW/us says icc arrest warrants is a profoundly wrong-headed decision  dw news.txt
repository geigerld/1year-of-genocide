well the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has called the international Criminal Court's move to request arrest warrants for Israeli leaders quote a profoundly wrongheaded decision Israel denounced the ICC on Monday after the Court's Chief prosecutor requested a warrant for the arrest of Israel's prime minister and the defense minister over the war in Gaza now in a statement a spokesperson for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged quote nations of the civilized free world to oppose and condemn the decision several of Israel's other Western allies have also criticized the Court's move saying that it equates Israel's actions in Gaza with hamas's October 7th terrorist attack well I'm joined Now by luwis Mareno OKO the founding prosecutor the first Chief prosecutor of the international criminal court Mr ampo it's good to have you with us I want to just start by asking you what did you think yesterday when the chief prosecutor Mr Khan when he announced that he is seeking arrest warrant for Israeli and Hamas leaders well I'm grateful that we have an international criminal court because um it's instit is a Judicial institution the prosecutor is doing his job now three judges will review the evidence and in some way put order no the law know is the law no one no one can commit war crimes or crimes against humanity and if someone do it and the I has jurisdiction is intervening so I think it's it's providing order the the case that the chief prosecutor wants to build um against Netanyahu and the Israeli defense minister Galant I mean if you read through through it it's talking about um attempts to starve the people in Gaza starvation it is not an accusation of genocide that's a correct read right yeah he did not charge genocide he charged war crimes and crimes against humanity but that very serious charges no um no and so the reaction to that what we've seen in the last 24 hours US President Biden he has called the move by the chief prosecutor outrageous saying we're talking about false equivalencies here if you're putting Israel in the same basket as Hamas now I understand that the chief prosecutor said in an interview with CNN's Christian Almanor yesterday that he made the announcement yesterday in an attempt to be fair and balanced that means including Hamas and the Israeli leaders in the same announcement um was that the right decision in your opinion well the President Biden opinion is a political opinion but it's interesting because President Biden knows there starvation there that's why President Biden is building a port to provide food and water in Gaza so what he see as humanitarian assistance the prosecutors see okay this a war crime of starvation that's simple and I would say prosecutor charged hus with work crimes and crimes against humanity very important and and then a different crime for Mr nanyu and Mr Gallant but they are still innocent they have the right to go to court so this the beginning of the process they're Innocent but it's very important let the let Justice work now there are yeah I was just going to say Mr I but what about the Optics of this no one is disputing perhaps the facts on the ground but the Optics having this announcement include the repu the is leaders and the Hamas leaders um can one can argue that maybe it wasn't the right decision considering what the public opinion is at the moment in Gaza well what when when you are the I prosecutor Peter williz you whatever you do if if Mr Khan persecute just Hamas half of the world would say how you ignoring it yeah he justy half of the world would say how you Hamas he persecuted both at the same time oh why you do this come on he's doing his job it's important he present a very strong case something very important he did he request a group of advisors to check his case including the meron who is who was a victim of the Nazi regime he was in a labor camp he was a legal advisor of Israel so you cannot believe the Maron is anti-Semitic so we are talking about international law criminal law that's what they are doing political comments are political comments this is very important law has to be respected I I I also want to get your thoughts on what we've heard from Washington Republican lawmakers they have threatened to sanction the ICC at the same time secretary of state blinkin has said that he will work with Congress to formulate what he has called an appropriate response should the court be worried about any type of act by the United States to punish it for this decision well for me it's the world should be worried that one country is threatening to prosecute judges or prosecutors for doing their job I think that is worrying Mr ampa we appreciate your time tonight looks like we've lost the signal there but we appreciate that's Luis Marino ampo the first Chief prosecutor at the ICC thank you Mr ampo
