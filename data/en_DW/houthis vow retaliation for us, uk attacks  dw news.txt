the US has carried out a second day of military strikes on houthi Rebel Targets in Yemen us officials say the new targets posed a threat to shipping in the Red Sea which has been disrupted by houthi attacks in recent weeks houthi leaders have vowed to retaliate following the attacks the aftermath of air strikes on houthi targets the rebels said at least five people were killed as two waves of strikes hit 28 Targets in parts of Yemen controlled by the Rebels the US and UK say these strikes were acts of self-defense the houthis are backed by Iran they've been targeting ships in the Red Sea for weeks with the group releasing this footage in November of its Fighters appearing to seize a vessel it claims the attacks are in response to Israel's war in Gaza against the radical islamist Hamas organization which the US EU and other countries have labeled a terrorist group a different ship though the USS Carney launched another attack on Saturday destroying a houthi radar station with a missile President Biden warned there would be more to come if the houthis didn't leave shipping alone we will make sure that we respond to houth and they continue this outrageous behavior WR with our allies but he also said the hou's main allies knew better than to escalate the conflict was IR does not want to war us at the United Nations the US once again pointed the finger at Teran we need to also be clear about the role of Iran in these attacks without Iranian support in violation of their obligations under resolution 2216 the houthis would struggle to effectively track and strike commercial vessels navigating shipping lanes through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aiden Iran's Ally Russia is currently waging a war of aggression against Ukraine but it condemned the air strikes claiming they were against international law there is no authorization for the arbitrary acts that the US and its allies are carrying out in Yemen there is the risk of a full-fledged War not only in Yemen but throughout the region it's a worry shared by some including these protesters in Seattle but Washington once again sees air strikes as the least bad option to keep a conflict from spreading Hans yakob Schindler is with the counter extremism project in New York I asked him whether the air strikes would impact ai's ability to attack ships in the Red Sea thank you so much for having me I'm well I'm afraid this is not going to be the end of it so what we need to reopen really the maritime straight the um B mandap and the Su Canal is a sustained Maritime military presence to make sure that the houthis cannot Kaa and piracy um any ships anymore and we need to deter them from using their longrange strike capabilities that's why the message from the US and the UK and the International Coalition who's already on the ground there is both towards the houthis as well as to Iran motivation wise the houthis are a super anti-western anti-semitic movement their slogan is God is the greatest death to America death to Israel occurs upon the Jews Victory to Islam so we have to assume that they are continue going to continue to try to take advantage of the situation of the war of Hamas against Israel to gain favor within their supporters within Yemen but the capabilities that the huthis have are stemming from Iran I this yeah well if they're getting their weapons from Iran is there a way then that the supply chain can be cut we need to be much stricter with what Iran does in Yemen right so everyone knows where the smug smuggling routs go everyone knows where the supply chains go multiple ships have been seized therefore the straight of forus is the Waterway here where most of the long range capability spare parts the hthis have the ability to assemble Rockets they don't have the ability to produce be parts are coming from that needs to be much tighter controlled right now the if the US military strikes can't deter the group from attacking ships in the Red Sea are there other means um of stopping this like for example um can there be talks uh what other means does the International Community have yeah so a couple of issues here um the deterrence is going to be twofold number one there is going to be a sustained military presence there's going to be sustained strikes every time time the houthis do something the Americans are trying to regain the escalation dominance here you strike one ship we hit three targets that's the declared aim of the United States secondly more controls on what the Iranians are doing in supplying the huies in particular as the long run St straight strike abilities go and thirdly we need to be really serious about the sanctions that already exist against the houthis and their violent Behavior inside of Yemen and that means we need to be much better in controlling the diversion of actual humanitarian Resources with the houth regularly steal regularly resell and which contributes a major part of their income in Europe all right now another question I really want to put to you is that instead of weakening the houthis could these strikes by the US actually give the the houthis more leverage of course inside Yemen if you're attacked by an outside force you always gain some more sympathizers in Yemen that's the whole point why the houthi is doing this they're feeling very comfortable with this conflict uh as does Iran inside Yemen what Iran doesn't want is the regional conflict there are no Regional Friends of the houthis outside uh the Iranian uh Islamic Republic and just as a reminder the Coalition that um Sai LED in Yemen in 2015 included apart from Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Sudan Bahrain Kuwait Qatar Egypt Jordan Morocco and Sagal so there's really no Arab state whose heart is bleeding for an Iranian proxy like the houthis so we just simply need to make sure that the Iranians understand that they are walking sleepwalking into a regional confrontation with the United States which they apparently in the last couple of months do not want to have otherwise they would have activated hispa a long time ago thanks hakob hakob Schindler senior director at the counter extremism project thank you so
