Israeli officials say three people have been killed in a shooting attack at a border crossing between the Israeli occupied West Bank and Jordan Israel's military says a gunman approached the alambi Bridge border crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and open fire at security forces who killed the asent in a shootout three Israeli civilian guards were killed at the Crossing which is also known as the king Hussein Bridge Crossing Jordan's interior Ministry says it is investigating the shooting Jordan made peace with Israel in 1994 but is fiercely critical of its policies towards the Palestinians more than half of Jordanian citizens are of Palestinian descent and many still have family ties to people in the occupied West Bank or Gaza and for more I can now talk to Emily gordine who is joining us in Jerusalem Emily uh what more can you tell us about uh what happened at the king Hussein uh Bridge Crossing yes so the IDF has said that a gunman approached the Crossing in a truck from the Jordanian side and opened fire at uh border officials their Israeli border officials and security forces then responded and killed the attacker in a shootout um now Jordan has responded by saying that it is investigating the incident and like we just heard um Jordan and we need to remember this Jordan has made peace with Israel and in in 1994 and um over the past few months it has helped Israel fending off drone attacks by Iran um and at the same time we also know that um it has been very critical of um Israel's policies uh towards Palestinians um and back to this attack to at where the incident actually happened now this um incident happened at a Crossing that connects the occupied West Bank with Jordan and in the occupied West Bank we have seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza that was triggered by um hamas's terror attack on Israel on October 7 last year and um we've seen ever since we've seen um almost daily milit Israeli military ra raids in densely populated Palestinian residential areas we've seen an increase in settler violence but we've also seen an increase in Palestinian attacks towards Israelis and observers are very concerned that in the absence of a ceasefire deal the violence there could escalate even further uh and of course what we've also been seeing is uh more and more protests in Israel with people demanding a ceasefire deal and the release of the remaining hostages uh what's the response of the Israeli government to that well yesterday for example we saw it was the eighth consecutive day of of mass protests in Israel in um Tel Aviv alone we saw about 400,000 people take to the streets uh demanding a ceasefire demanding the release of the hostages um they have been accusing Benjamin Netanyahu Israel's prime minister of abandoning the hostages for political reasons um so he can uh keep his Coalition together and safegard his own political survival now what you need to know here is that um some of his cabinet members too in particular Israel's national security minister itamar benir and Finance Minister pezel smotrich have both spoken out against uh a SE fire deal and they are also putting immense pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu um and that is causing a lot of frustration among many protesters and that's why they keep coming to the streets keep going to the streets and at the same time it seems um that it has very little effect on Benjamin Netanyahu and his government all right Emily gordin thank thank you so very much
