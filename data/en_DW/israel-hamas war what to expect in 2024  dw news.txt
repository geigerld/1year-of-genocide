well Elsewhere for many in the Middle East it was a very different passage into 2024 Israelis marked the New Year to the sound of Air Raid Sirens after Hamas militants fired Rockets out of Gaza and Palestinian civilians in the narrow territory saw little hope for a better year as Israel's military said that it was planning for a long War to eradicate Hamas after its October 7th terror attack against Israel the stroke of midnight a barrage of rockets and flares Light Up the Sky over Gaza Sirens activate as Hamas fires a new wave of rockets intercepted over Tel Aviv a new year brings no respite for both sides Palestinians displaced in the masasi camp say there is nothing left to celebrate My Tragedy lives inside me the outside world does not feel it at all let them have their celebrations and leave me to live My Tragedy but many still hope their wishes for 2024 can somehow become reality they dream of one day returning to their homes and mourning all they've lost I lost my son my son-in-law the most precious people how will I receive the New Year my wish is to return to visit their graves retrieve the bodies under the rubble this is my wish for 2024 earlier in the day as Israeli troops carried out more raids in Gaza the Israeli military announced some of its own plans for 2024 Israel set thousands of reservists will be allowed a temporary return to civilian life some of the reservist soldiers will return to their families and their jobs this week this will allow a significant relief for the economy and will allow them to gather strength ahead of the coming activities in the next year and the fighting will continue and we will need them these adjustments are meant to ensure planning and preparation for the rest of 2024 a clear signal that Israel is in this for the long hul correspondent Tanya Kramer is standing by in Jerusalem so Tanya we've heard that Hamas has fired several rockets at Israel last night bring us up to date well this what happened uh just at midnight a massive rocket barrage came out of Gaza towards Southern uh Israel but also towards Central Israel including uh T aiv where the air raid Sant uh went off and people had to take shelter so it shows that 3 months into the war Hamas militants are still capable of launching uh such Rockets although there have been less Rockets according to the Israeli military in the past couple of weeks at the same time the military also said that it's continuing its ground operations and uh air uh strikes uh across uh the Gaza Strip at this uh at this point meantime Israel's farri Finance Minister has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and Make Way for Israelis who could and I'm quoting him here make the Desert Bloom tell us more about how that statement is being received well that's right these were comments made in an interview by uh prime minister Benin netanyahu's farri right Coalition partner bet smwi he is finance minister he also holds a portfolio in the defense uh Ministry uh he is part of the rder security cabinet not of the decision-making uh smaller so-called uh War cabinet he basically uh uh said that Israel should encourage residents uh uh from Gaza to leave Gaza and also uh to resettle Gaza now uh uh Israel was in Gaza with its own settlements until up to 2005 when it then withdrew its settlements it later put a closure on Gaza when Hamas seized power there in 20 2007 largely controlling what went in and out of Gaza for the past 16 years now um of course these statements are of very much concern great concern for Palestinians but also for other Arab Nations watching very closely what are the plans and scenarios put forward uh by Israel they're not shared by most of the security establishment and also that at odds uh with what positions put forward and ideas put forward by Israel's main La the United States um we're expecting us Secretary of State Anthony blinkin coming this week and we're expecting more discussions on uh what will post uh Gaza postwar Gaza look like DW correspondent Tanya Kramer thank you let's pick up some of those points with Frank ledwitch he's a former UK Military Intelligence officer who now lectures in strategic studies at the UK's Portsmouth University he joins us from Oxford welcome back to DW Frank this point about the Israel's war in Gaza covering the whole of 2024 if it does last that long uh what are the likely consequences for the region good morning Phil happy New Year there's no doubt at all that this war at whatever scale of intensity will last throughout this year and probably the years afterwards and this is something I think that's concerning the IDF the Israeli Army very much not not not only them of course uh also jumping over the political level of Israel the United States because there's no clear idea what form the rest of the war or the rest of the conflict in Gaza will take at the moment we have no idea what the political track will be and of course from a military perspective the Army wants to the IDF want to know that so that they can shape operations to lead up to it what they call phase four there's no sign of that and at that at that political level it's very clear there's a great deal of exasperation on the part of the us and specifically President Biden with Netanyahu uh with respect to getting some answers on that so coming back to the point of a long War there's no doubt there will be a long war in Gaza it may well take years the nature of the war so far has made it almost certain that there will be some form of Insurgency afterwards the question is will the Israelis have responsibility at the uh uh the civilian Administration level which raises other issues and then of course and you know this is an entirely separate possibly even more serious matter what will Israel do about about Hezbollah in the north Israeli ministers have said made statements concerning whe we're going to solve all our problems well if that's the case and they want to do that militarily that raises a whole new box of problems right to put it mildly okay um so many things in there just just to pick up on one of the points you made there why are there these difficulties in getting word from um uh the Israel's government about how this war will uh uh progress for the next year why is it difficult uh for America America uh to get that information I would suspect that uh there are disputes in the Israeli government as to how this is going to be done the they're under pressure now from the Army leadership for an aners what will as they call it phase four look like now phase one are the initial assaults pH phase two is where we're in now that's the fighting phase phase three they're moving into or they say they are transitioning winding down intensely and phase four is what happens afterwards as the military say day the day after the British and Americans had this huge problem in Iraq which doomed the campaign and the Israeli military are very concerned they don't make the same mistake and clearly they're finding it very difficult to get answers from the government as to what the day after will and should look like and of course they need to plan for that now who knows what's going on inside the Israeli government they're under pressure from The Americans on various levels uh very little leverage being applied but that's the problem and it's becoming a real problem I think within the the war fighting decision makers right meanwhile what we have seen is Israel withdrawing some of its reservists from the Gaza strips so what does that tell us strategically okay what that tells us is that the Israelis are in fact moving from phase two which as I said is the high intensity phase and these are normal military I say normal these are the terms used in military campaigns of this kind so we're moving from phase two the high intensity as Israeli said they would into phase three which is which is winding down into the more into the longer term so the brigades that are coming out there are five brigades brigades about 3,000 people depending on it's its uh role uh and there are five of them coming out so it's a fraction of the of the of the force in G already these are training brigades so what they want to do is is put those all Reserve is they going to be put back into society and they may well be redeployed and it's just the mechanisms that by which the Army functions it's called ront the likelihood is at some point they'll be replaced or they'll be pushed back in um or or perhaps even redeployed okay so it's all part of the cycle and and finally the US Navy says it sunk several yeny houy Rebels uh Rebel boats in the Red Sea killing some of the crew um briefly how concerning is this when we talk about Regional contagion well that is regional contagion it's extremely concerning we're looking at bringing Iran into a much rer Regional War involving not just the US and Iran and of course Israel but indeed European powers as well Britain Britain included thank you for that to Frank eminently
