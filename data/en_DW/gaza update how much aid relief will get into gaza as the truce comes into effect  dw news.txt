the highly anticipated truce between Israel and Hamas is now underway this is the scene live looking over Gaza from Southern Israel a 4-day temporary ceasefire appears to be holding ahead of an anticipated hostage prisoner swap later today it follows weeks of the most intense fighting in the Israeli Hamas conflict now after such major destruction on the stet it's hardly a return to normality for the people of Gaza but this pause in hostilities is allowing some now to move about with relative Freedom after weeks under bombardment people are back on the streets across the Gaza Street like here in K Yunis in the South the 4day truce may be fragile but even a short break in fighting is welcome we look at the truth as a way to breathe after 45 or 48 days of suffering for us gazans I'm from Gaza City and I was displaced to Rafa I hope the truth is taken effect in all of gaza's trip in order to see my demolished house and what's left of it just like Haled many Palestinians who fled southwards have been hoping to use theal in fighting to return to their homes in the north but Israeli planes have dropped lifl lets warning against that I don't think we can go back to Gaza City at this moment because of that announcement from the Israeli army they are forbidding the displace living in the south from heading north at the Rafa Crossing on Egypt Gaza border eight tracks have been entering the territory this was a key component of truth and they'll be bringing much needed Fuel and food supplies for as long as the ceasefire lasts we had a lot of losses this will let people breathe move eat and drink because the situation is difficult and all Resident from the north are in Rafa without food and water I hope it's a chance for people to live and move around and we wish it's an introduction for a permanent truth Israeli armored vehicles have been filmed heading away from the territory but Israel's military has warned that its troops are going nowhere and that the war against Hamas is not over well for gaza's 2 million plus residents the truce brings some hope of a rest bite from weeks of sustained Israeli bombardment and shortages of basic supplies now now as we've heard uh fuel tankers and a trucks have begun entering the Gaza Strip from Egypt through the Rafa Crossing Egypt says 130,000 L of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily to Gaza as well as 200 trucks of other Aid now the Israeli blockade of fuel has made it virtually impossible for hospitals and other basic services to operate inside territory well for more uh let's speak now to journalist kareim Al guari who joins us from Cairo Kareem thanks for joining us on DW news so what is the latest that you can tell us about the situation at the Rafa border crossing well Egyptian authorities says that the agreement is that over the next four days 130,000 L of diesel and gas will cross uh the strip uh the need on the other side de to just run the basics things in Gaza is about double the amount but that is what's allowed for this next uh 4 days they will allow 200 trucks a day with uh relief Aid the first uh fuel trucks already went over uh this morning and uh we are expecting also that about a 100 Palestinian injured people will cross over to be treated in in Egyptian hospitals the first 20 of them already entered Egypt this morning since the TRU now Kareem um you've mentioned fuel there but what kind of supplies are also being delivered apart from fuel fuel very important uh cooking gas for the first time uh since uh seven weeks that they can get cooking gas of course like other things like water urgently needed caned food tents and other medical supplies all right okay um now tell us about the urgency um in Gaza for this material well we have a cameraman who's working for us here in Ciro and in in in the southern Gaza Strip and he sent us pictures yesterday and there's basically three things that are urgently needed one of them is electricity and uh and uh fuel um he sent us pictures how people are like the car batteries are basically the essential supplies in in Gaza right now people charging their phones and charging their power banks with car batteries and what's the car batteries for the energy supplies are the donkeys for transport most of the goods and most of the persons who are transported right now are transported by Donkey cards because also no petrol available and the last big issue is water they're saying like the water is not fit for drinking they're having there and also not enough for the basic hygiene one woman said to us that once in two weeks she's able to take a shower right now kareim what does this first day of this pause in fighting mean for Palestinians well you can see big relief the pictures we can see out there is for the first time children playing on the streets people going out and about without fear um of course lots of people trying to get to their houses uh that were destroyed also partially in the southern Gaza Strip trying to get out basic needs they have from their houses and one of the problems is of course the people are doing the same thing and trying to get into to the houses in the northern Gaza Strip which the Israeli Army has forbidden and that right now is I think the biggest point of friction uh this border the Israelis draw drew between the northern and the southern Gaza Strip that is a friction point that might actually even endanger uh the Seas fire it all thank you kareim journalist kareim El guari in Cairo well for the families of those hostages held by Hamas in Gaza the past few weeks have been Riven with Despair and Trauma now the truce could see some of them safely returned at last after weeks of waiting the families of hostages hope their loved ones will come home soon I want to hope I hope hope hope that it's going to happen we've been on such a roller coaster for the past certainly the past uh week but since October 7th between Despair and Trauma and hope I just want to see the children come back the Hamas terror group has agreed to release 50 civilian Women and Children of which 13 are to be released in the first batch on Friday in exchange Israel is set to release 150 Palestinian prisoners mostly females and teenage males over the course of the truce the deal mediated by Kar also includes a 4-day pause in fighting in both the North and South of the Gaza Strip as well as increased humanitarian Aid even though the agreement is considered a breakthrough both sides have remained cautious about saying too much before it materializes uh based on current circumstances with the start of this truce our main hope is that this humanitarian truce will give us all the opportunity to look into the bigger task which is to implement a permanent truth and Achieve long-lasting peace efforts are being made to extend the truth beyond the 4-day period but Israel insists it will resume its military operation in Gaza until it has eradicated Hamas Let's cross over to Mike Martin now he's a former British army officer and Senior fellow now in the department of War studies at Kings College London Mike the ceasefire has begun how fragile is it what should we be watching out for uh it's very fragile um the thing that you need to look out for are effectively spoilers to the deal so these are people who weren't included in the deal and they might be people within Hamas so different factions within Hamas Hamas obviously has a cellular structure so it's not like a an army with with direct command and control and also other factions like Palestinian Islamic Jihad um they haven't been mentioned at all so I don't even know whether they're included in the deal and they hold their own hostages and they may also wish to Scupper the deal so those are the things that we need to keep an eye on what about the what's happening on the ground there in the Gaza Strip is the Israeli military staying there during this pause in the fighting or are they expected to actually pull some of their troops out for now oh no they are all everyone's staying in position it is literally stop firing even if you are you know a couple of hundred meters away from people that you've been firing at before 7:00 local time um the one difference is and this was built into the deal uh Hamas insisted as part of the deal that the Israelis would stop overflights of the Gaza Strip so that they were able to move the prisoners without giving away uh their military positions or or perhaps where the other prisoners were and that is part of the deal so Israel won't be while the deal is on while the prisoners are being moved won't be overflying uh I think the northern part of the Gaza Strip okay we're looking at an exchange of hostages and prisoners coming up that's supposed to start happening this afternoon walk us through the steps involved in that exchange the way that it's set up in this deal it must be quite complicated uh it it's hugely complicated the the main issue is trust neither side trusts each other so even if accidents happen someone's weapon goes off uh the problem is that the other side will assume that they're attacking and then the ceasefire will be broken um both sides will need to bring prisoners to an exchange Point um and what assumes that will be on the border um of the Gaza strip um for the Israelis that's fairly easy but for uh Hamas they've got these prisoners dispersed um they're likely to be underground and they need to move them we just spoke about Israel overflying they need to move them to The Exchange Point without Israel knowing where they've come from and when when they get to that exchange Point both sides will want to secure their side of it and both sides will then set themselves up with a distance in between them where they can show each others the prisoners and so that they can then exchange them it's horrendously complicated and fraught with uh potential issues both accidents and some of the spoilers that we spoke about earlier so a complex deal we're talking about here it was weeks in the making a lot of negotiations those negotiations took place in Doha the capital of Q talk to us about the role of Q in brokering this deal Mike they're playing an an essential role aren't they yeah I think really it comes back to trust Terry and the qataris really at the end of the day were the only side uh the only the only actors really that both sides could trust enough to get this deal over the line obviously the qataris uh host at times part of the Hamas leadership but the qataris have also over the preceding years built up a good enough relationship with the Israelis that they can act as a mediator and I think actually we we can see this is a role the qataris see themselves taking on they've played a a few other roles like this in Libya and in Syria at a much lower level and I think this is a role that they see for themselves in the region and on the world stage Mike thank you very much for your analysis there that was Mike Martin of Kings College London well with me here in the studio is our Middle East analyst Sha rosanis so shy we're now into the ceasefire it has begun it's supposed to go on for 4 days at least that's the plan so right now it could be extended we understand but uh what are you expecting to happen when the ceasefire ends well first of all it depends on when it ends I mean if this going to last only for four days it's going to be much easier for Israeli IDF forces the military to regain momentum to go back they still have some parts of the northern part of the street they they say that they still need to uh uh clear out from from Terror um what they say Terror uh terrorists of Hamas um and then we will see them trying definitely to go into the southern part of the street with the main goal is hunas this is where hamas's stronghold is where lots of the leaders are coming from that will happen if this only lasts for 4 days good chances though this won't last only for four days we've already seen yesterday there was a bit of a delay um some of it is considered to be part of as psychological warfare or some manipulations that they're trying to pull they might try to do it again because there is a scheme that is agreed upon a formula which says that for every 10 days the Hamas is willing to provide and or Hest the habas is willing to release Israel is giving 24 hours more of ceasefire what if Hamas comes to Israel and says actually we only have eight what's now I think it's going to be very hard for the Israeli leadership you know with the big pressure we see from the public um for the release of the hostages say well actually that's not good enough we're breaking off uh contact so there is a chance that Hamas will try to leverage this uh hostage deal formula for furthering you know to extend the ceasefire more and more and then by that time what Hamas is hoping to achieve within 10 days maybe even longer International pressure on Israel will be so so huge it's going to be very hard for it to go back into fighting the world in the meantime we'll see the the mass Devastation in Gaza it will see the real numbers of casualties as high as it is right now there's still many you know bodies buried under the rubble it's going to be very hard for Israel Hamas hopes at the end of it to go back to what it's planning to do right now you mentioned International pressure uh there has been tremendous International pressure on Israel to show restraint in Gaza there pressure has been mounting on Israel to introduce at least a temporary ceasefire uh now we have that how much of a factor is international pressure on Israel in making this happen well so far it was huge and and Israel played on it they knew that the world wants to bring more humanitarian Aid into Gaza and they said okay we're talking humanitarian needs our humanitarian need is to have our hostages released and we're going to use this card this is our leverage um however you know we've seen a great support from the Americans the European uh countries have been supporting Israel I'm not sure it's going to stand uh as firm once we've see we see the great Devastation and also um the biggest contention point is that uh Biden really wants to see some sort of plan for the future of Gaza what is the end game after the war is over who will take over of Gaza who will take care of the 2.3 million Palestinians living there Israel is country very reluctant to discuss that and maybe if it brings out a plan it's going to be able to gain more time to have uh you know to have to complete its military goals what about the families of the hostages uh that Gaza is is holding uh rather that the Hamas is holding in Gaza those families have been very vocal very active they've been pressuring the Israeli government to are they convinced uh about the Israeli government's priorities in this situation well for now yes but it's not clear what's going to be happening next you know I think there's great consensus that that the families the young children and the mothers the elderly women there should be released there's a fear that the that the war will not be resumed or the attacks will be resumed the Israel military operation will seize that's one fear but then also at the same time um there's so many great dilemmas I mean bringing back the rest there will be at least 180 left at the end of this if the ceasefire is extended bringing them back most of them are Soldiers by Hamas definitions even um even if you're not an active combat you you're consider Kamas is considering any male as as a as a soldier we've seen in the past the pressure to bring R the soldier on Israeli decision makers very very strong it's going to be hard for them to resist and that will require very um painful moves but they going to cost political um support for netan um and today unlike what he did in 2011 with the Shalit deal his government is run by extreme right um parties it's going to be much harder for him to go for a deal that brings swaps of heavy terrorists sitting in Israel uh released against Israeli Soldiers the is the Israeli Prime Minister Ben yahu you mentioned uh him and his govern his popularity is really low at this point there polls show that many Israelis simply do not trust him anymore at this point how much of his political career is staked on getting those hostages out a lot of it I mean it's clear you know Israel has been debating within itself in the last 49 days what would be the moment the Victorious moment that they can take out there's no doubt that without a hostages return that's not going to happen so that's a big part but um as long as the war is still ongoing as long there active fighting as long as there's so many dra soldiers drafted U I don't think we'll see a lot of movement in the political um area and once that is done it's really hard to tell where Israel will find itself uh emotionally psychologically nationally there's so many factors it's clear that Israel is not like it was until October 7th things have shifted things have changed the cards are still up in the air we don't know exactly where they'll fall once everything is over shie thank you very much that was our Middle East anal shie rosanes now as we've been discussing some humanitarian Aid trucks have been entering Gaza from Egypt this is the scene live that you're looking at right now at the Rafa border crossing Egypt says 130,000 lers of diesel and four trucks of uh of natural gas will be delivered daily into Gaza including 200 lores of Aid boosting the amount of a arriving at Gaza which the UN and other agencies said is desperately needed in territory now let's bring in James Denzel here he's head of the of conflict and humanitarian policy at save the children UK and he joins us from London thanks for being with us Aid trucks are entering Gaza now what do organizations like yours hope to achieve while this truce holds well AR we need to do so much and inevitably we won't be able to do as much as we would want because of the restrictions uh both bureaucratic legal political and physical in Gaza I think your images of the Gaza Crossing show uh Rafa Crossing show activity but we've already got uh thousands of trucks backlogged if you look at the average numbers of trucks that would have gone into Gaza 500 a day prior to the horrendous events of October the 7th so there's a massive backlog of course we've had almost 50 days of complete Carnage in Gaza that has had a huge impact on the population 80% of whom were a dependent prior to the events of October the 7th we suspect that number is now up to 100% uh and the most important and immediate things that they need are are life-saving Aid so clean water food and shelter as the Gaza winter approaches now the we've we've had weeks of bombardment and street fighting in Gaza how much of a challenge is it going to be to move the big trucks full of Aid around inside the Gaza territory given that maybe the roads aren't even passable yeah it's such an important question uh the devil is in the detail when it comes to Aid Logistics uh and it is not just a case of what is the Urban infrastructure in terms of where trucks can move where AID workers can move and let's not forget Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker over 100 un Aid workers have been killed so there is a question about where AID can get to there's also a question about where uh it is most needed and in particular uh tens of thousands of of Palestinians and children will remain in the north of Gaza and there's huge question marks as to whether this uh this humanitarian pause this ceasefire or short ceasefire will allow us to get to to people in the north who who have been under the most intense uh part of the uh the military um operations going on there so where AID can get to is is crucial uh and and who needs it the most is also incredibly important talk to us about the needs of the people in Gaza we know that it's a desperate humanitarian situation there what what do people in Gaza need most right now well the response needs everything we'll obviously prioritize life- saving Aid because that is uh what you do in these kind of situations uh there's aspects to an aid response that we don't talk about because they're so far off from being realized such as the fact that uh Palestinian children in Gaza have had almost seven weeks of of no education but we're obviously so focused on keeping people alive uh that that is where attention lies understandably um there is large numbers of Palestinian children who have suffered uh injury often life-changing injury um losing limbs being unable to walk again having significant organ damage huge question mark as to whether they can get the treatment they need from some of these new field hospitals in the south of Gaza or whether they will need to have referral uh overseas or outside of Gaza um then there's other aspects of care that we really need to think about uh Child Protection there's large numbers of children who have been uh separated from their family there's unfortunately large numbers of children who have lost their entire family and uh reports coming in from hospitals of wounded children no surviving relatives arriving at A&amp;E so uh Child Protection Services nutrition services water and sanitation in a part of the world where the water supply was already hugely contaminated and if you don't do not get power fuel and water back on then you're back to issues around people drinking dirty water and waterborne diseases whether that's from uh you know toilets or sea waterer all sorts of stories that we're hearing so the aid response is multifaceted we all need weeks to even start to address the needs of over 2 million people in Gaza yet of course we only have a matter of days okay we'll have to leave it there James thank you very much for talking with us that was James denzo from save
