the leader of Hamas Ishmael Haner has been in Egypt for talks on halting the fighting with Israel to allow humanitarian Aid into Gaza Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has once again ruled out a ceasefire until Hamas is eliminated and the remaining hostages are freed several countries including Germany classify Hamas as a terrorist organization meanwhile there has been no letup in attacks on the Palestinian territory there is no end to scenes like this in the Gaza the street several Israeli air strike hitting the southern city of Rafa survivors rushed to barely functioning hospitals with little hope for safety anywhere in the territory all of a sudden the first rocket landed destroying everything by the time the second rocket hit we weren't able to see anything in the house anymore we barely made it out the whole house fell down we found a woman who had just given birth via cesarian and were able to drag her out with her baby girl who was choking she was taking her last breaths there she is over there the UN estimates that nearly 60% of all gaza's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed in more than 90% of the population displaced as the smoke from the latest bombardment fills the sky above rougher some of them share their desperation we came from the north and they said you should head to Rafa it's a safe place they followed us to Rafa and hid us where is it safe where should we go I wish for a complete ceasefire an end to the death and suffering it's been 75 days people are still getting killed there's still people under the rubble I don't hear from many people Communications are out negotiations are taking place that could lead to a new temporary truce but many differences still need to be overcome qatar-based Hamas leader isma hania traveled to KY on Wednesday for talks with Egyptian officials the group which is considered a terrorist organization by multiple countries says it only wants a permanent ceasefire something ruled out by Israel with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that is impossible until Hamas is defeated now epat machika is from Israel her Uncle gillad Moses is still being held hostage in Gaza after being kidnapped during the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7th his partner ephrat was killed in that attack his wife and his partner's daughter and two granddaughters were among the hostages released during the weeklong ceasefire Islamic Jihad militant group has just released a video showing gillad in captivity the first sign of life since his abduction thank you so much for for coming in eat so this is Gaddy Gaddy yeah Gaddy Moses my uncle um we had no news for 74 days and learned last night from a video released that he is captured by the Islamic Jihad we just heard um was hard to watch but we are people of hope so seeing him alive gives us hope so you had no idea until that 74 days no contact so how did this uh video get to you well I'm not so sure as I was here but um I just got tons of messages on my phone last last night and uh realized it was released and then um I was sent the video actually um I'm here in Berlin for the event that took place today at the Berlin Orchestra a Berling philarmonic Orchestra and who was very very touching I have to really thank them for the wonderful event we held and uh what was the what were you doing the um Berlin philarmonic Orchestra has played a concert uh tonight um that was uh dedicated for the release of the hostages and for all the um idea of having to think of what's going to happen next and this was Palestinians and Jews together together together for Humanity um um it's very important for me to actually stress the point that I'm here on a non political issue it's a human humanitarian human human umari human not humanit yeah humanitarian issue I think that the brutal um attack on the people on the innocent people on that morning of of October 7th was not only an attack on the Israeli Jews and Arabs and the nepales and the Tha and whoever was there it was an attack on global Humanity it was an attack showing us the destruction that Terror can bring to the world and this is why I'm here to talk about it to stress how terrible it was how much we all need to be cautious and Afraid actually terrified of what can happen with Terror and you you gave a speech at the concert saying that you'll have to learn to trust again what did you mean by that you know my profession deals with cultural diplomacy and for years I taught in the Academia um all sorts of dialogue within diverse communities and um um communication among diff different people Saturday October 7th was not only an attack on my family their Community my community and my nation it was an attack on my beliefs I feel we are in a moral hell and I think the message really the global message should go anywhere because what happened there the atrocities the terrible stories that are too difficult for me to describe in words should be learned and then there was this crack crack in trust in humanity crack in Trust of what I was preaching and teaching in and working for all my life and unless they are all back alive I don't know how this trust can be rebuilt so the return the safe return of this 136 people that are still alive in Gaza is a must and it has to be very quickly because they're they're they're they're dying there so how do we bring that that about tell me what you think of the Israeli government's efforts uh to to get the hostages back it's the Israeli government and it's the International Community well let's start with well let's start with isra no problem I think that with help and pressure from the International Community and the talks we just heard that I'm very glad to hear with our good neighbors the Egyptians the Israeli government has to do all it takes to bring everybody is it doing enough is there more that it could be doing now I think there is a shift in the last two days and I believe I want to believe that everything but everything is being done because there isn't price there isn't any price price that then cover my uncle's life and the rest of the 13 and5 people in Gaza they have to be back so does does Mr Netanyahu therefore have to soften his line this line that there will be no ceasefire until Hamas is destroyed our prime minister Netanyahu has to do everything but he would say that he is well he will have to prove they're back alive at home we have to bring them back alive if they do not come back alive does that what does that what does that say it it is that would is that a failure of the Israeli government is that a failure of Netanyahu is that Hamas being terrible terrible people if they if they don't come back alive what does that tell you I told you I lost trust in humanity but I did not lose hope so so I don't even think of a scenario where they don't come back they will come back we're strong enough where people who cherish life they will come back the price might be high for some people to think of but whatever price it is whatever price it is the lives of the 136 innocent Israelis has no price I we're running out of time I would like to just try and end on a hopeful note because I I mentioned at the start that amongst all this horror that that happened that the killings and the kidnappings one glimmer of of light and hope was that four of your family were actually returned in that in that weekl long ceasefire I cannot imagine what that must have been like to be notified that they were coming and then to see them it was um a brief moment of joy and we're very very grateful but it will not be completed until everybody is back so it's wonderful and you know we all need to remember after their return there is a long process of recovery it will take very long time and The Echoes the ripples of the pain and and the sorrow and the mourning is enormous it will take a long time for the trust for the rebuild but as I said we are strong we cherish life and life shall overcome thank you so much for joining us eat machika thank you very very much for having me thank you
