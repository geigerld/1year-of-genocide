the Israeli military claims to have killed one of the top rocket Developers for the islamist terror group Hamas during an air strike on Gaza Israeli troops are continuing to battle Hamas in Gaza targeting underground tunnel networks around Gaza City where Hamas are also thought to be holding hostages seized during the October 7 Terror attacks Israeli air strikes pound Gaza as Israel says the next stage of its war on Hamas is underway the Israel Defense Forces release this footage of its soldiers on the ground in Gaza they don't name specific locations but ground troops are believed to be targeting the complex webs of underground tunnels as Israeli troops get further into Gaza City the tunnel systems are going to be a real problem and and they' be extremely well they won't clear any until they're sure no hostages are there this is the number one priority the Israeli military could aim to drive Hamas militants out of the tunnels or blow the tunnels up or even flood them with seawater Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu says his troops are making progress above and below ground in Gaza the fighting in the south is advancing with a force that Hamas hasn't known Kaza city is encircled we are operating in and deepening the pressure on Hamas every hour every day so far we have killed thousands of terrorists above the ground and under the ground as Israeli troops Advance on Gaza City in the north armored IDF vehicles are also gathering on Israel's Southern border with Gaza and the Israeli Navy released footage of operations off the coast of Gaza Israel is targeting Hamas by air on land and potentially soon by sea our correspondent T kma in Jerusalem told us more about the idf's operation in and around Gaza City well I mean the Israeli military stays very vague as to the locations where they are exactly but we heard from army officials that they're closing in uh on Gaza City Gaza City is a huge City with many neighborhoods that they're operating in some of them but I mean their main target is we understand they in shti uh you know with air strikes also probably one of the the the areas of interest is the shiffer hospital which is in the center uh of Gaza City the Army also said that they have found and destroyed 130 tunnel shafts uh that they have you know seen on their ways uh in uh military experts also talk more about these days about you know mounting pressure to possibly come to a a temporary ceasefire that would be put on the Israeli government that has of course rejected uh these calls so far but seeing the mounting death to among uh Palestinians and and civilians in the Gaza Strip um but so far there's no of course call for a full ceasefire here that's would not be responded so we also saw today again thousands on the move again from the north to the South as the Army has called on residents that are still in the north to move southwards but we understand that 1.5 million at least that's an estimated number by uh the United Nations are on the move out of the 2.3 million uh population of Gaza between um in the North or the South and we also understand that air strikes continuing as well in the south of Gaza Tanya the war is now entering its second month are Israelis is overall satisfied with the way that government is handling this conflict well I think you could say that um you know there's an overall support for these War efforts people are still also coming to terms what happened on uh October 7th the the terror attack and uh there's a coming together in this but of course um there is a question what is happening to the 200 over 240 hostages and there's a lot of criticism level by the families and relatives uh against the government how they're handling it there's also there are more questions about uh where will this war Go I mean it's going on now for uh uh over four weeks now and also there's a lot of criticism leveled at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself because he hasn't taken responsibility so far for the intelligence failures leading up to October 7th T you me mentioned the hostages there are reports that Qatar is trying to mediate for a possible release of at least some hostages what do you know about that well these are unconfirmed reports that you know where in the media in the past days that Qatar is actually coming closer to some kind of breakthrough that could see between 10 to 15 hostages released there was also a statement earlier in the week by the Hamas Kasam Brigade saying that they would be willing to release uh about dozens of hostages uh but that Israel is not responding now we also understand you know prime minister Benjamin Nan himself has said he wouldn't go for a temporary ceasefire that would be needed to release those hostages unless all the hostages are released so the situation is as always in such situations when it comes to you know negotiations behind closed doors unclear and we just have to wait and see you know what the next hours will bring in this regard Tanya K in Jerusalem there thank you Tanya Mike Martin is a senior fellow for war studies at King's College in London I asked him what Hamas tunnel Network looks like and how long it might have taken to build uh well I think Hamas have been building it uh for the last 15 years since the Israelis last 18 years in fact since the Israelis pulled out from the Gaza Strip in 2005 um what it looks like imagine uh the above ground landscape but mirrored underground so you have tunnels at different levels so you have communications tunnels at a higher level and stores of supplies and Rockets further down and the whole thing exists in three dimensions with some of the tunnels up to 50 or even 80 M deep uh you just mentioned that some of them are 80 M deep and the whole network be like 500 km long others say that is exag at so your take is that it is the size of the this web is correct look in reality we don't know and I think it's also important to stress that there's probably no one within Hamas who knows the entire uh network of tunnels the nature of Hamas is it's a decentralized organization so different people will understand different sectors of the network um but it is extensive it's sufficiently extensive that it can and withstands the bombardment that we've seen over the last few days Hamas was still able to continue firing Rockets back at Israel using this tunnel system even though it was under very very heavy aerial bombardment so it is quite a successful operation from Hamas now Israel seems to have tasked a special unit a special combat engineering unit to find out more about the location and structure of these tunnels how exactly will they do that h um well there are a number of ways the the chief way is by using ground penetrating radar and that's not perfect because obviously different types of ground have different reflexive signatures and there are other things like sewers and other layers within the ground but that is a chief way of understanding the tunnel Network or at least where the tunnel start closer to the ground and then you can trace them uh using robots and other uh uh you know drones that are able to move through those tunnels to see where they go to there are suspicions that the hostages uh that Hamas is holding are being held in that tunnel Network now when an army unit gets into these tunnels to uh um how how can they rescue these uh hostages and how can they avoid to kill them accidentally so I I think the key well firstly I think not all of the hostages are held in tummel I think a large proportion of them are um but the key here is reconnaissance so if you discover the location of a tunnel perhaps with ground penetrating radar like we just said the next thing you need to do is get some sort of unmanned like a drone or something on wheels or perhaps a fiber optic cable with a camera so imagine the telescopic surgery that we do every day in hospitals get one of them down the tunnels to see what's going on and then once you can see what's happening in the tunnel you can look at different ways of assaulting them obviously a key way is just to pump them full of anesthetic gas so it knocks everyone out and they they everyone's unconscious and then you can move in and separate the hostages from the hostage takers now some are also speculating uh that Israel may use a so-called sponge bomb what is that exactly uh it's expanding foam so if you have a tunnel that perhaps you've done your recon you know it's an arms dump or you know that it's only full of Fighters then you can either seal off the entrance or seal off a critical Junction with this particular type of munition which basically creates expanding foam and it like you do on a building site or or somewhere else it will explode and fill up all the cracks in the tunnels with a foam that then hardens so it's it's soft at first but then hardens into a very hard substance and it's seals off the tunnels Mike Martin there from Kings College London thank you very much Mike thank
