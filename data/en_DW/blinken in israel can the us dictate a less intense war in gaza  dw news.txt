We Begin tonight with diplomacy and worries of an escalating war in the Middle East US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his War cabinet Lincoln reiterated us support for Israel and the return of the hostages held in Gaza but he also sounded a cautionary note warning that the daily toll of the war on civilians in Gaza is far too high Washington's top Diplomat arrives in Israel for late is stop on a week-long tour of the Middle East Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is calling for calm in the region to prevent for war in Gaza from spreading nice to see you blink held talks with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Washington is trying to balance support for Israel with limiting civilian suffering blinkin emphasized the need to protect the people of Gaza and increase Aid we know that facing an enemy that embeds itself among civilians who hides in and fires from schools from hospitals makes this incredibly challenging but the daily toll on civilians in Gaza particularly on children is far too high 3 months of fighting have left Gaza devastated and thousands of gazans dead blink called on Israel to start planning for peace he said it must do more to support moderate Palestinian leaders to holdt new settlements and Stamp Out settler violence it's our unique Bond and America's enduring commitment to the people of Israel that allows indeed demands that were as forthright as possible in the moments when the stakes are highest when the choices matter the most this is one of those moments the role of Iran has raised those Stakes defense minister yaa Galant said increasing the pressure on Tran was critical to preventing the war from from spreading Iran which backs Hamas supports a network of militant groups throughout the region whoi rebels in Yemen have attacked and seized ships in the Red Sea Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon are firing rockets at Israel while in Iraq and Syria militants aligned of Iran have attacked US troops with rockets and drones we're determined again that we uh not the escalation that we don't have the conflict spread uh and we've made that very clear uh but of course if our Personnel if our forces are are threatened or attacked we'll take appropriate steps we'll respond blink will continue his Tour on Wednesday he's due to travel to the occupied West Bank for talks of Palestinian president Mahmud abas joining me now here in the studio is our Middle East analyst shaie rosanis shaie was here with me we were list listening to that press conference from Anthony blinkin let's talk about the biggest takeaways here did you notice a change in the US's patience with the Israeli Prime Minister when it comes to making a way out for this war in Gaza well that's clear undertone we've been first of all we've been seeing the Americans sending these messages in the last days before the visit uh hinting at netan that they are very serious in their intents to move forward with a longlasting plan for a peace in the region with all the mo moderate Nations AR Nations on board so um we're seeing it uh blinkin saying the same things again again very diplomatically he's aach not not for no reason he's the chief uh Diplomat for the Americans but we hear behind closed doors that the patience is running out there's more and more pressure for Israel to decide is it going to go for escalation or is it going to turn its back on the on the opportunities that the Americans are offering for a national a regional pact of security and long-lasting peace yeah the the Secretary of State what struck me as he said that the Israel has to be a partner for the Palestinians um and the Palestinians they also have to be a reliable partner for the Israelis on a path to whatting pie right first of all statehood Palestinian statehood two words that netan does not like like seeing together uh combined and the word partner is a very very contested word when it comes to the Israeli Palestinian conflict uh and you know the idea of having a partner having no partner uh we've seen it already by going back to the prime minister Barak former Israeli Prime Minister talking about there's no partner back then about um yaser Arad who was still the head of the Palestinian Authority back then trying to bring back the term partner and the need for partnership into the discussion is not in vain you know they're choosing this word very carefully they want Israelis to start realizing this place where you're living in this region nobody's going anywhere Israelis are there Palestinian are there you got to find a way to make it work you got to make a partnership out of this situation you got to use this tragedy the way the Americans see it and turn it into an opportunity and he also mentioned what's going on in the West Bank uh that also struck me there that you know you can't there has to be Law and Order in the West Bank correct the Americans are very concerned because we've seen Nan so astonishly against anything connected to the Palestinian Authority and and blinkin says Israel need to stop undercutting the Palestinian Authority it is in Israel's best interest to let the Palestinian Authority Thrive because of the security coordination because of the people that are happy that are satisfied that are working that are part of society are not people that are busy too much with Terror and we've been seeing it again and again and again and um this is what they're trying to convince Netanyahu in but this is breaking some of his more you know the objection Netanyahu has to this idea of Palestinian statehood is is very deep we've seen it as part of his as a stone of his uh of his policy for the last 15 years and if we're talking about less of a conflict in Gaza the threat on the border northern border with Lebanon that is actually even cuter than it was let's say a few weeks ago isn't it correct we've seen it last week since the assassination of U he is a chief Hamas former operative um it's clear that things are more tense in the last days uh there's been we've seen Americans uh talking about their fear that n we might be using this escalation for political reasons um against their wishes they would want to see everything scaling down and they would definitely not want to see a spill over into Lebanon into Shiite uh access connecting to Iran and forth it seems from uh his response to some of the questions he's he's content with the answers he's been hearing from Israelis about them not wanting to see escalation uh we still need to be very careful not wanting escalation and having escalation do not necessarily uh correlate in the m e these things are so tense and can go either way any moment our Middle East analyst shaie rosanas as always shaie good to have you here thank you wel friend US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Israel as part of a week-long diplomatic tour aimed at trying to prevent prent an escalation of the war in Gaza a short time ago he met with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is due to hold talks later with the Israeli War cabinet he's expected to press them to do more to protect civilian lives and to prevent the war in Gaza from escalating into a wider conflict I've just come from a number of countries in the region uh Turkey Greece uh Jordan cutter United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia and I want to be able to share some of what I heard from those Leaders with the president as well as with the prime minister in the cabinet later today um and of course we'll have an opportunity to sit with the families of some of the hostages and uh discuss our Relentless efforts to bring everyone home and back with their families uh and there's lots to talk about uh particular about the way forward and blinkin just met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his War cabinet as well tww special correspondent AA Ibrahim has joining us now from Jerusalem so a just tell us a little bit more about what is being discussed today we know uh not all of the conversations are open but we do have some ideas of what's going on the secretary of state is visiting Israel not for the first time since October 7th but at a very critical moment in the conduct of this war um they increased uh demands by the International Community for Israel to scale back the war in Gaza and certainly that is a message that uh the secretary of state will be coming to his Israeli counterparts with especially that this visit to Israel comes at the back of a regional tour where he's met with a number of uh other uh Regional uh leaders there's also going to be discussions about the proverbial day after uh what happens once the war is over and in that area there's not um there's there's some disagreements between the vision that the Americans have put forth and some of the statements that we've heard from Israeli officials just as an example uh the United States wants to see a refurbished revitalized uh sorry rehabilitated uh Palestinian Authority be part of the future in Gaza but we we've heard from various Israeli officials that that is that is something that they uh reject so a lot to discuss but certainly talks will be overshadowed by a number of disagreements between uh the two partners and blinkin we know will travel to the West Bank on Wednesday what is he hoping to achieve there so probably there will be more discussions as I just mentioned on what what role can the Palestinian Authority play in the future uh of Gaza after uh the war the Palestinian Authority does not govern Gaza but it does govern parts of the West Bank but it is seen as weak and ineffective by um a lot of Palestinians they have not had elections in a very uh long time and so the American Visions is is to try and rehabilitate and uh reform the Palestinian Authority so that it can be an effective productive uh uh part of gaza's uh future there's also increasing since October 7th increasing reports of Israeli extremist settler violence in the Westbank that the United States uh has spoken out against and so that is also likely to be a a topic of discussion uh when the Secretary of State visits tomorrow DW special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem thank you now Israel is under going growing pressure to allow more Aid into Gaza the opening of a second Crossing has not significantly increased deliveries Aid trucks are delayed waiting for security checks at the Israeli km Shalom crossing the UN says only around 120 trucks a day are entering far below the number needed Medical Aid is also being held up by fighting in central Gaza most of the 2.3 million population have been displaced and now rely on aid for survival Sarah Davies joins us from Aman she is with the international Committee of the rest Red Cross thank you so much for your time this afternoon what are you hearing from inside Gaza how much Aid is actually getting through thanks so much for having me Sarah in Gaza right now the situation is incredibly dire uh what we are seeing is a catastrophic situation that is only worsening I think it's very important that we remember that regardless of how much Aid actually enters Gaza it also needs to be effectively and safely distributed and right now that's not able to happen with things like the ongoing armed hostilities the sheer number of people who are as you said displaced uh living on roads the rubble the debris the Telecommunications challenges people are not receiving the aid or the supplies that they really desperately need of course our teams are working to the best of their abilities but there are many many challenges uh that are currently being faced for civilians to to receive Aid the World Health Organization is also warning that the health system is collapsing in Gaza um at a rapid Pace give us a sense of what you at the icrc are hearing tell us about the situation inside the hospitals so we do of course have a surgical team in the European Gaza Hospital uh we've had rotations of this surgical team but they lack supplies uh the health system is a huge concern for us right now public health infectious diseases the the number and the rate of things like amputations that are having to occur because people cannot receive the medical treatment that they need in time there are the burns the severe wounds um displaced people have also set up tents in hospitals in the corridors because they they don't feel as's anywhere else safe to go medical professionals the local medical professionals who have tirelessly worked for nearly 3 months now uh have continued without without a break they're they're reaching exhaustion some of these medical professionals have also being displaced themselves multiple times there is not enough drugs there not enough anesthesia GW simple tools more uh comprehensive tools there is simply not enough medical supplies to be able to deal with the increasing medical needs that exist meanwhile in Israel and I just like to ask you about um some of the reporting that we're hearing there have been some calls for your organization in particular to intervene and ensure the well-being of Israeli hostages currently held by Hamas and I'd just like to ask you first of all is that happening and if not why so since the 7th of October we have been calling for the immediate release of these hostages and for our access to them we have reiterated that hostage taking is prohibited under International humanitarian law at this time we have not received access to these hostages uh in order for us to as you say check on their well-being uh provide them with any necessary medications and of course reconnect and re establish the contact between them and their family members who are desperately waiting for news who have spent sleepless nights not knowing uh what's happening to their their family member to their friends to their neighbor we will continue calling for this access publicly as well as in our direct dialogue with all parties to this conflict but what is needed are the necessary conditions for the international Committee of the Red Cross to have access to these hostages it's not a simple matter of of yes or no we need an agreement between the parties involved because it it is an armed conflict Zone we need to ensure that our teams can access these hostages and that no further harm comes to the hostages because of this we need a firm agreement which we do not take part in negotiating so that we can then step in in our role as a neutral intermediary to facilitate either the the release and transport of these hostages out of Gaza or access them and provide them with the the medical uh needs that they have thank you so much for providing that context on what your organization um is experiencing and seeing in Gaza Red Cross spokesperson Sarah Davies we appreciate your time thank you so
