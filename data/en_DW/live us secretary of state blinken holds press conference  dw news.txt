that's getting in to people uh who need it um with regard to uh humanitarian pauses again we see this as a way of further facilitating uh the ability to get assistance in uh to make sure that the um resources are in place as well to absorb the the assist the assistance coming in to make sure that it um gets to the people uh who need it uh we see it uh as a way also and and and very importantly of creating a better um U environment in which hostages uh can be uh released uh and this is a very important piece uh so as I mentioned already and I won't uh I won't repeat it there are a number of very important uh practical questions that go along with this uh that uh We've agreed to uh to discuss and work on uh We've agreed that our teams will continue to uh to talk about this uh in the days ahead um and uh from our perspective this can be be uh a critical way to advance many of the interests that I uh that I discussed earlier um I haven't seen the details about the um the the strike G on that you alluded to that hit the AFP office in Gaza uh and let me just say and and say again that as we stand strongly uh for Israel's right and obligation to defend itself uh we also believe that it's vitally important how Israel does this uh including with the highest regard for the protection of civilians and that of course includes journalists journalists who are doing extraordinary work under the most dangerous conditions to tell this story to the world something that we deeply admire deeply respect and we want to make sure that uh they're protected the next question goes to Karen betel with Channel 12 thank you uh thank you SEC secretary B for for being here uh two issues kasan asala the Secretary General of kisala is talking right now if uh following his speech or his remark um another front will open in the north will the US actually use its fire power in the region not only to deter but also to destroy Target in Lebanon or if needed in Iran and on the hostages um uh the Biden Administration is asking Israel for attemp temporary pose and we understand it is not a ceas fire but uh do you have any guarantees any assurances that this temporary pause will lead to hostage release and I know you have heard the family of the hostages today outside the the kabas and if May I a can you assure us that uh the United States will not hold Israel back before the main objective of this war will fulfill which is eliminating Hamas thank you thank you uh let me take the second question first um there are no guarantees about anything as a general proposition and maybe even more specifically uh in the context of um the uh the fight against Hamas but uh we are absolutely focused on getting hostages back and getting them back to their families in safety and we believe that among other things uh a humanitarian pause could uh help that effort uh could facilitate it it's one of the reasons why uh we're focused on it uh but regardless our determination uh to get uh get people back um is manifested every single day in our efforts to to do uh to do just that and as I said and said repeatedly and as President Biden has said and said repeatedly We Stand strongly with with and behind Israel in its right and obligation to defend itself defend its people and take the steps necessary to try to ensure that this never happens again uh nothing nothing has changed and that won't change um with uh with regard to um Lebanon with regard to um Hezbollah with regard to Iran we have been very clear from the outset that we are determined that there not be a second or third front opened in this conflict um President Biden said on day one to anyone thinking of opening a second front taking advantage of the situation don't and we backed up those words uh not only with work that we've done with many partners in the region to reinforce that message but with practical Deeds including the deployment of uh two aircraft carriers uh battle groups uh to the region uh including with action that we've uh taken for example against missiles coming from Yemen in the direction of Israel shooting them down uh including as well uh with strikes that we took in response to multiple attacks on our Personnel in Iraq and Syria who were there as I said earlier to try to prevent a Resurgence in the region of of isil of Dash uh we remain absolutely determined uh in that effort and um I'm not going to get into hypothetical situations but all I can say is uh we're committed to deterring aggression from any part um and we'll take steps necessary to deal with it for the next question Vivian Sal with the Wall Street Journal Mr secretary thank you as always for bringing us along with you um and your travels before we left DC um you stressed that the US was discussing with Israel uh the current conflict and you added we will also be focusing on the day after can you talk a little bit about what that looks like um in particular uh what is being done to ensure that whatever does come after doesn't spin into potentially short or long-term occupation um and also are there discussions at all to create a multilateral force for Gaza and if so would the US be willing to take part in something like that thank you thanks R here's what what we know and I think is uh agreed among uh everyone there cannot and must not be a return to the pre-october 7th status quo that's unacceptable it's not tolerable for Israel it shouldn't be acceptable or tolerable by uh by anyone else uh and that means that the idea of uh Hamas remaining responsible for governance such as it was uh and um and security and posing an ongoing and enduring threat to uh to Israel and its citizens is unacceptable so that's one thing we know we also know that um Israel cannot reassume control and responsibility for Gaza and it's important to note that Israel has made clear it has no intention or desire to do that so within those parameters um we are and will continue to have discussions with uh Partners throughout the region and well beyond about um what should follow um once Hamas is defeated uh there are a a number of uh possibilities permutations but it's really premature to get into uh any detail about that as important is putting this into a bigger picture um a bigger vision of how we achieve enduring and and Lasting peace and Security in the region and as I said earlier the United States is convinced uh we have been for sometime and I think we're only reinforced in that conviction uh since October 7th that the best path maybe even the only path as I said is through two states for two peoples again that is the only way to ensure lasting security for a Jewish and Democratic Israel the only way to ensure uh that Palestinians uh achieve their legitimate aspirations for a state of their own so I think it's important as we're talking about all of this with uh with every partner in the region Israel um our Arab partners and many others as well as the broader International Community that we have that big frame in mind and whatever we do whatever is done also helps to advance that so that's how we're looking at it right now can I just press you Mr secretary because um you're talking about the defeat of Hamas and I'm wondering you know for uh Hamas is not just a bunch of individuals but probably an ideology as well and especially with the intense bombardment that we're seeing in Gaza right now the potential for extremism down the line is high and so you know when you say defeat Hamas is that being factored in and what are you doing then to address those those issues as well yeah Vivian I uh you're you're exactly right um this is about dealing with uh Hamas in terms of defeating it physically that is making sure that it can't repeat what it did on October 7th but it is also about defeating an idea a perverted idea but an idea that um we have to combat with a better idea with a better better future with a better vision for what that future can be and uh demonstrating that we're committed to achieving uh that future that Vision because in the absence of that even after Hamas those who sing the siren song of nihilism will find open ears so it's imperative in our judgment that not only is Hamas dealt with in a way that October 7th can never be repeated but that we lay out a Clear Vision and a path to achieve that Vision that gives people something to hope for to buy into to grab onto um and I believe that there is a broad and strong Coalition throughout the region that wants to do exactly that all of these countries uh are are on one side of the equation who's on the other side of the equation Hamas Hezbollah and Iran so it's incumbent upon us I think not only to to lay out that Vision but to be clear about the ways that we propose to to achieve it this is not flipping a light switch needless to say um given how Dee rooted and enduring these uh these problems are but um there that we have to we have to address this and we have to address it in uh in concrete way ways and with determination uh because again it comes back to exactly what you said um we have to demonstrate that we have a better idea and a way to achieve it for the final question muhanad Tut of course we've been listening to the US Secretary of State Anthony blinking addressing the media there in Israel after his talks with Israeli leadership striking a balance between emphasizing Israel's right to defend itself uh as well as the imperative to protect innocent Palestinians with me in the studio is DW's Middle East analyst shaie rosanis shaie uh lots of talk there from the Secretary of State about the need for humanitarian polies he mentioned that several times but it sounds reading between the lines that there's still work to be done what was your take I I agree with you Michael they there's an understanding that it needs to be done there's there the moderate Arab countries uh that are pushing for that there's a lot of pressure in America around the Western World we see the number we see what's happening in Gaza and there's also an understanding the way Americans see it that the pause will allow Israel to get more credibility more time you know in order to complete its Mission uh but we don't see any clear indications that they have agreed on the where and the what and the how he himself says that uh we know it was uh this was delayed we know it was a longer visit and longer meetings than planned um he still has some of his Representatives American Representatives staying in Israel trying to find how to strike that balance we've seen Israeli um announcements from Galant the for the defense minister and netanyahu's uh office saying we have not agreed on fuel coming in which is a contestant issue we will not give any pause any humanitarian relief until we see any progress with the hostages the way Israel tries to keep the the equation is humanitarian issues are our hostages you know alongside the humanitarian needs of the gazan population so in the last 48 hours particularly we've been hearing a lot the words ceasefire and humanitarian pause please make it clear for our viewers what's the difference between those two and why is that Nuance so significant for the actors in this conflict well first of all pause is a unilateral step you know Israel will decide on it when how and and for how long and can just abruptly stop it at any minute um and a ceasefire which will bring Hamas in that's something that is not feasible Israel does not want to be even seen in any way communicating to negotiating giving up to Hamas it needs to stay strong that's what it sends out also in its message in the military front um and Americans seem to be so far willing to let Israel do that got it that is a Shani rosanas many many thanks that is your DW news update live from Berlin don't forget you can always get DW news on our website at DW I'm Michael oku thanks for watching there's more news
