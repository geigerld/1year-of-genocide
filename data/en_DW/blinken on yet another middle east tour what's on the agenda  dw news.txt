US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin will be touching down in the Middle East in the coming hours seeking to secure a new truce between Israel and Hamas it will be his fifth trip to the region since the Hamas Terror attacks on October 7th and he'll be making stops in Saudi Arabia Egypt Qatar and Israel the proposed ceasefire deal would allow the phased release of Israeli hostages and exchange for Palestinian Prisoners the negotiations come as Israel continues its attacks across the Gaza Strip the Hamas run Health Ministry says at least 30 Palestinians were killed in central Gaza on Sunday wounded Palestinians arrive at this Hospital in central Gaza in what seems to be an endless flow of stretches Medics scramble to help the injured gaza's few operational hospitals are running at the limits of their capacity with Personnel left with no choice but to treat patience on the floor as Israel attacks targets across the Gaza Street residents say there is no place left to hide the occupation Army claimed that D Al Bala is a safe area we was safe and secure living in our homes suddenly after midnight we were surprised by F-16 missiles that shook the world shook the Earth destroyed everything Israel says its operations are focused on eliminating Hamas this footage was released by the Israeli Army it says it shows Israeli troops conducting raids at Hamas facilities in Han Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip after almost 5 months of fighting International mediators are working to secure a new truce between Hamas and Israel but as diplomats are still trying to secure a humanitarian ceasefire for many gazans it is already too late our correspondent Rebecca richers is following this story for us in Jerusalem Rebecca US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is heading to the Middle East yet again what's on his agenda yes Terry that's the fifth visit that Anthony blinkin has made to the region since October 7 since those horrific attacks and the ensuing War um absolutely top of his agenda on this trip will be this potentially imminent uh temporary ceasefire deal that everyone is talking about and hoping will come to fruition another item on top of his agenda and something that he reiterated as he was getting on the plane to leave for this trip was the absolute urgency to get more humanitarian assistance uh to avoid a catastrophe or the catastrophe that we're seeing currently in GZA so they will be absolutely two priorities uh on the agenda as is the way as as we just mentioned it's his fifth trip and he always often is uh what another thing that is really at the Forefront of the US mind is of course what what's going to happen in a post conflict Gaza and it's very likely that he'll have some discussions uh with people here certainly in Israel uh regarding that topic the US really pushing for a Palestinian state for a two-state solution in the aftermath and looking for the Palestinian Authority currently uh the people leading in the West Bank looking after the Palestinians in the West Bank uh looking for them to take leadership in uh Gaza in a postconflict scenario that is something that Israel uh has vly refused or refuted and saying that that is not how they see it panning out so some discussions on that but certainly top of the agenda will be this potentially imminent ceasefire agreement that has been laid on the table talk to us more about that ceasefire proposal Rebecca what details do we know about it well this deal that's currently being assessed by all parties involved uh was set out on the frame framework was set out a little over a week ago in Paris among negotiators uh particularly Qatar Egypt um the Saudis are also involved the US of course uh and uh they're they've set out this framework that is a little bit uh in keeping with the one that we saw earlier or late last year I should say in November it's looking at uh a a longer pause in the fighting this time up to 6 weeks or at least 6 weeks uh pause in fighting to allow for humanitarian Aid into the strip and of course to allow for a release of hostages that would happen in stages We Believe similar to last time with of course women uh the elderly and the infirm being in in the first tranch and then looking to release more and more as that pause continues uh of course the devil Terry is in the detail and that is what is being hammered out by both sides uh we Hamas have not come out in agreement yet Israel looking as though they they are at least uh okay with most of the terms of this deal although they're not wanting to look like they're going to give away too many concessions either particularly members of Benjamin netanyahu's far right cabinet they are calling to to make sure that this deal doesn't look like they're giving to many concessions so there's still a lot of detail to be hammered out it is hopeful that this could happen in the coming days uh if not weeks but it's really not over the not not over the line until it's over the line Rebecca Thank you very much our correspondent Rebecca Ritter is there in
