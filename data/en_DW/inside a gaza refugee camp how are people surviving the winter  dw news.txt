the war between Israel and Hamas is entering its 100th day the fighting erupted after Hamas launched a terrorist attack on October 7th and Israel responded with air strikes and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip since then the toll has been devastating around 1200 people including 520 soldiers have been killed on the Israeli side most of them on the first day making October 7th the deadliest day since the founding of the Jewish State the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says almost 24,000 Palestinians have been killed that's 1% of the population the Israeli military says more than 7,000 of the Dead are militants the UN says at least 300 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank Israel's military campaign has damaged or destroyed around half of gaza's buildings and displaced almost 2 million people DW reporter Muhammad alut visited a refugee camp in the southern city of Rafa to to learn more about the difficult conditions displaced people fa there re surur is living in difficult circumstances here in a tent in Al maazi in the city of Rafa in the south of the Gaza Strip she was forced to flee her home in Northern Gaza in search of safe shelter displacement has deprived her of even the most basic necessities we are suffering here in this camp we cook over fire and we have to carry water in buckets over long distances often there's no access to Safe Water which forces us to drink dirty water our children get sick frequently and suffer from malnutrition and cold relief organizations warn that the aid entering the Gaza Strip covers only 10% of its needs rudimentary Comforts such as blankets mattresses and Tents are in dangerously short supply you see how we live here in the tent we have no clothes to protect us from the cold we do not have bed covers there's not enough food and we are suffering from Hunger 17 people live here in this tent and there are only three beds and three bed covers as you can see there's no roof to protect us from the rain and the tent is dilapidated re and her family have been appealing for blankets and other donations and distributing these to those most needy across the camp yet many remain extremely vulnerable in harsh weather conditions we fled here after the house next to our were struck my daughter was injured so we had to get out fast we had very few things with us when we came here to Rafa we had little clothes but it's not enough it's cold in the tend it's not cool in the summer and not warm in the winter when it rains the T fills with water shortages of blankets clothing and tents are just some of the many challenges facing displaced people here in Rafa unless greater humanitarian Aid arrives and soon even valuable work such as re is unlikely to bring an end to suffering for more let's now speak to Hiba Tibi she's the acting Deputy Regional director for the Middle East and North Africa for the NGO care and joins us now from Aman uh hea the war between Hamas and Israel has now been waged for 100 days with no end Insight how is your staff coping good morning dear I wish I can bring better good news uh around how my team is doing uh they are still very similar to what you have just shown on the report um they are among those who have uh who have lost their houses who are suffering to secure their their needs their family basic needs but in the same time they are the ones who are running our vention in Gaza in help with and support of our partners uh other inos and NOS who work in the same field they put the needs of people before the needs of their families and they jump into the distribution of of our our humanitarian assistance using every chance that we have to fight uh the time against weather against potential strikes and trying to reach out to as many people as possible let's talk about those people in need we've been hearing particular about the strain on women and children what are you hearing from the ground specifically about the challenges uh and and what are doing to help them so one of the focus main areas of our work in Gaza is to work with women specifically pregnant women and those who give birth to the newly give birth to babies in 100 days normally the child would have a trans a transformation process where they start to de their sleeping pattern their coord communication with the out the outward a nutrition related uh uh patterns and you can imagine in the last 100 days the number of women who went to give birth under very harsh circumstances very afraid of giving birth for two reasons either for complications that can happen with them without a medical system but also from the very unknown future for them and for their babies um and this this is something that we have seen however one thing I want to share with you as you know in these 100 days the babies themselves the children that you have also shown in your on a few seconds ago in the in the report their images they are the most innocent actors and they still give us and their mothers the hope for the future their reactions their smiles even for very simple things like the very basic food that they receive or the a hug from their mother to give them warmth in the in the night without any without being in their houses or shelters uh that is uh Hiba Tibi Deputy and North Africa for care many thanks Diva thank
