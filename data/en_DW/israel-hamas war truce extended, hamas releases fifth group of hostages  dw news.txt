a truce between Israel and Hamas militants has been extended into a seventh day Germany the Us and other countries consider Hamas a terrorist group negotiations on prolonging the pause in fighting which began last Friday came right down to the wire the truce has brought the first break in the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip since the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7th those attacks killed more than 12200 people and saw 240 taken hostage gaza's Health Ministry which is run by Hamas says more than 15,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed in Israeli air strikes let's crawl straight over to our correspondent in Jerusalem T Kramer standing by there Tanya the truce has been extended now how did this extension come about well it was really just minutes before uh the truth was was about to expire at 7:00 a.m. local time that the Israeli military released a statement saying that you know they will prolong the uh what they described as operational uh pause that the truths will continue in light of the uh efforts by the mediators to release more hostages this was also then confirmed by Hamas and also by the main mediator here Qatar now we understand that negotiations are underway uh this is just an extension uh as far as we know for the next 24 hours and their negotiations still underway concerning the list that will be submitted or has been submitted uh for the uh potential release of the hostages uh for later uh today there's also there reports whether this list will continue also the remains uh apparently of some of the hostages that might have been killed uh in the past week so this is uh one of the part of the negotiation and the other part of the negotiation uh pertains of course to whether this uh truth will be extended at the same time there has been a shooting attack a terror attack this morning in Jerusalem uh two attackers as we understand from the police uh were getting out of their car at a bus stop and were firing at a bus stop and the uh First Responders are saying that uh one 24 yearold woman was killed we also understand just in the past minutes or so uh that another person has died of his wounds and we have four more seriously injured in this shooting attack as well as three uh people that were lightly injured that were all taken uh to hospitals okay well getting back to those hostages that were released Hamas apparently released 16 hostages that it's been holding in Gaza yesterday among those freed are two Russian women for Tai Nationals and 10 Israelis all women and children uh women and teenagers rather some with dual nationality they include citizens of Germany the Netherlands and the us we'll come back to them in a moment but first this report finally free escorted by masked Hamas gunman the latest group of hostages to be released was received warmly by the International Red Cross in Rafa at the Egyptian border as the footage was beamed back to Israel there were joyful Embraces and tears of relief among the host's loved ones as weeks of worry came to an end I finally saw him briefly he seems okay overall cute and nice as usual and I hope that emotionally he's resilient and strong and he will get over what he went through I still don't know what he went through and tomorrow I expect to see him with my my own eyes meet him hug him kiss him I really didn't know what's happening with him and in the moment that I saw him right now I was I had no words like was a crazy feeling amid the celebrations there remained concern for those still held captive it is uh I'm very happy about it and yet uh my mother is there so uh it is also sad for me uh because she's in the she was supposed to be released she's 70 she's uh wounded Israel released 30 Palestinian prisoners comprising 14 women and 16 children according to the qari foreign Ministry many of those released are teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces so Tanya uh 16 more hostages released by Hamas yesterday what are the hostages who've been released so far been saying about their ordeal well so far we heard mainly from their relatives because the hostages themselves are a bit shielded away from uh the public but there have been some accounts here uh in the Israeli media uh for example most of them say uh basically that in the first weeks you know they were getting enough food but that in the past uh uh weeks uh two weeks or so uh you know the food rations were getting smaller that they didn't really have enough food for most of the elderly patients uh what we heard from the medical staff that were treating them uh some of them didn't get their medication uh they needed also there was the case uh we heard about a young teenager he said that uh you know you know he was held in a separate room there were also talks uh of beatings that it was harsh so uh there different accounts that we getting but at the moment uh it seems to know that they're a bit shielded away out of the spotlight and but there will be more of these accounts of course coming because there's also a lot of interest to understand uh where they were uh held uh during uh most of these almost now two months since October 7 and what happened to them uh during their captivity T thank you very much for now that was our correspondent Tanya krer in Jerusalem in return for Hamas freeing hostages that uh freeing hostages Israel has been releasing Palestinians held in Israeli jails by Tuesday a total of 180 Palestinians had been released uh Tanya Kramer who we just uh were speaking to there filed this report about one of those Palestinians released a 17-year-old whose family says he was arrested and detained after throwing firebombs for days now Amani M has been anxiously waiting for this moment her 17-year-old son Ham was expected to be released from an Israeli prison as part of the delicate truce agreement between Israel and Hamas he's been in prison for 10 months I haven't heard from him since October 7th I'm just waiting for him to come home and then a moment of joy and relief Hamza was 16 when he was arrested the Israeli prosecution accused him of amongst other things supporting terrorism Grievous bodily harm and arson on nationalist grounds his family said he was throwing Molotov cocktails he was never sentenced he is one of the under 18year olds that Israel agreed to release from prison many are still still being held in administrative detention I'm just excited to be among my people and with my family I feel extremely happy now nobody here wants to talk Politics as there's fear that they could be easily rearrested Amani Al as a mother is worried about her son's health I'm upset my son wasn't like this every week he had a haircut he was wearing nice clothes he's not like he used to be changed a lot for now the family is just relieved that their son is back home Let's cross over to journalist hm Balia now he reported from Gaza extensively When The War Began and he joins us now from the Jordanian Capital Aman H what are Palestinians saying about the release of of prisoners uh Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails it's important to say say that um the the prisoners uh or theones cause is very important for the Palestinian Society uh Palestinians usually see the the Palestinian and and Israeli jails are heroes um they are fighting or they fote for for the Palestinian cause so any release of these PR prisoners would be welcomed um all the Palestinians they were welcoming this release maybe they were they didn't agree on the deal or they disagreed with this deal um I mean would worth it or not but the release of the pr prisoners themselves were uh were welcomed there are reports ham of an increased number of detentions of Palestinians happening now in the occupied West Bank uh what can you tell us about that yes true according to the official numbers we are talking about uh over 3,000 were were arrested since October 7 um those um arrests from different cities whether in in in West Bank or east Jerusalem or some of them in um Palestinian Israelis in in Israeli cities um those those people probably um majority of them they were arrested before and they were released for different reasons uh some of them were accused of throwing stones or um Molotov uh or or those who are you know known as Hamas supporters and and and or those who are um uh writing over the social media supporting Hamas or other factions or the fighting um against Israel now you're in Aman but I know you're in in touch very closely with people who are still in Gaza where you used to have your home um another day of truce what does this mean for the people of Gaza it's uh very important I mean people was um was um very worried that the the bow would be over um Everybody um um was talking about this whether would be extension will be more days um um this is uh very essential for them the the previous six days were weren't enough for them to to to um to have a relief uh still they are suffering there there is lack of everything food water and and other basic needs like electricity or or Internet or even the telecommunication is very poor so the extension is is more hope that they will live more uh of course the fear is that coming um at one at some point that it will be over and the fighting might be resumed ham thank you very much for talking with us again that was journalist hen Balia in Iman well for more I'm joined Now by Hans yakob Shindler he's a former German Diplomat and a Middle East expert who is currently a senior director at the counter extremism project thanks for being with us H we've seen an extend we're seeing an extension to the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel the temporary ceasefire it's been extended now for another day this has just been negotiated what do you make of these Arrangements between Hamas and Israel thank you so much for having me look this is a extraordinarily complex hostage negotiations not only because of the number of individuals held in Gaza but also because they are held by several groups none of which are directly answerable to Hamas plus of course Hamas is using these negotiations to make political points right so when Hamas says they can't find hostages I would take this with a grain of salt this could be just a delaying tactic because what Hamas wants to achieve is a regaining of ground within the Palestinian Community which it has lost because it cost the Palestinian Community pretty much all of Gaza and thousands of Palestinian lives you mentioned that there are other militant groups that holding hostages in Gaza talk to us about those who what groups are we talking about here yeah chiefly is the Palestinian Islamic Jihad this is a pure terror group that is much smaller than Hamas but it's separate and a competitor to Hamas for power in Gaza and then according to various sources there are anywhere between a couple of dozens to 40 individuals that are held by other groups in Gaza primarily criminal networks that give themselves some fancy names but we are talking about smuggling and criminal networks these also are not part of hamus but in competition to amas but for amas it's going to be important that it and only it exchanges these hostages with with Israel that's the only way they can score political points So you you're talking about a competition between the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas both of these groups I understand are get support from Iran is that how you understand it absolutely so Palestinian Islamic Jihad was the original group that Iran adopted at his first Bry in the Palestinian territories Hamas the relationship only really became very intensive after 2012 so both of them are Iranian proxies however um Hamas has political Ambitions Palestinian Islamic Jihad doesn't and there is always been a competition outside killing Israelis of course for both this is one of the chief aims that they want to achieve you you you say you're skeptical about Hamas making claims that it doesn't know where all the hostages are but you're also saying that there are different groups who may be holding these hostages is it really clear how many hostage are there the sad truth is we only know what Hamas tells us hence there is no independent confirmation whether it's 30 with the palestini Jihad or 50 with the palestin Islamic Jihad and Hamas uses this uncertainty where those individuals are to really demonstrate to the Palestinian Community but also to its wider Global support network that it is in charge it is in control of these negotiations not Israel unfortunately this is always the case when a host taker negotiates with the government we're sitting in Berlin of course it's very difficult to say what's really going on inside Gaza not that many people know uh but Hamas is saying that some hostages were killed by Israeli air strikes do you lend any Credence to that do you believe it I think given the intensity of the military operations it is uh likely that some of the hostages may have been negatively affected by these military operations until now until last night indeed Hamas hadn't mentioned any names uh and now that they have come out and said the mother and the two children are definitely dead I would think that this is a quite likely that they indeed uh were affected do you think that the uh that there's still room for continuing this temporary ceas fire oh definitely it's in hamas's interest to do so it is also in the Israeli government's interest to get as many hostages out in this early phase of the negotiations because this is the what I say confidence building stage any stage after this is going to be significantly more complex and to be very honest Hamas is going to ask for more when it comes to the military uh members of the Israeli Defense Forces that it holds hostage right now some people distinguish between the political arm of Hamas and the military wing of Hamas Israel says it wants to destroy to annihilate Hamas completely many think that's simply not realistic well how do you see it well well it depends on what you define as destroying Hamas um really after the 7th of October making a distinction between a political wing and a terrorist Wing is no longer valid the political Wing is of course responsible for what its terrorist Wing does in the organization so of course um there should be more scope to get more hostages out um and destroying Hamas infrastructure militarily in Gaza that's what Israel can do destroying Hamas income streams is really a task for the entire International Community because it has various income streams Beyond State support by Iran and by Qatar H destroying Hamas ideology is going to be the big push here we've seen with the Islamic State we've seen with Al-Qaeda eradicating an ideology is a very political educational task that is going to take many many years H yob Shindler with the counter extremism project thank you very much thank
