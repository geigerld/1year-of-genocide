and we're going to Israel now where a labor Court says a nationwide strike being held in the country must end following a petition from the government the strike which has been taking place today is intended to pressure the government into securing the release of the remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza demonstrators have blocked main roads across the country and flights at Tel aviv's Boran airport are facing delays last night's Mass demonstrations took place cross Israel calling for a deal with Hamas to free the hostages that are still being held the protests come after Israel's military said six hostages were killed by their captors the Army said soldiers found their bodies a short time later in a tunnel meanwhile Israel's offensive in Gaza continues there is sadness everywhere this is 24-year-old eaten jeros shami's funeral she was in hamas's captivity for nearly 11 months the family had hoped their daughter would return home safely this is not how I imagined it would end Eden my love I wanted so bad to have you back alive I wanted to get back my Eden my funny Eden the one making us laugh so many people wanted to get to know you but not like this not like this Eden Eden is among the six other hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza on Sunday the Israeli military said Hamas Fighters had killed them shortly before they found their bodies the news of their killings led to an eruption of mass demonstrations across Israel pressuring the government to make a deal with Hamas to free the nearly 100 hostages who are are still held in Gaza on Monday the country faced a strike further pressuring the government to work on a solution that could bring the hostages back people in the region are struck with an overwhelming grief just around 100 kmet away from Tel Aviv in the southern Gaza City of Khan yunas relatives mourned the loss of their loved ones guiled in an Israeli strike and here in the central Gaza City an Israeli attack caused several casualties a Gaza City municipal vehicle was targeted resulting in a number of Martyrs and injuries they were transported by ambulance to hospitals and the fire in the vehicle was extinguished according to the Palestinian Health Ministry more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas following the group's October 7 terrorist attacks the war has left thousands of people in Israel and Gaza devastated many continue to hope for an effort that could finally halt the fighting oh uh our Middle East analyst shanir rosanas Joes me in the studio now for more shy uh why did this execution one must say wasn't and it wasn't the first but this one had a much stronger impact than previous Hamas atrocities why quite strong impact some people it was say it was the saddest day in Israel since October 7th it was really you could see uh the the the national morning and and everybody being very much upset um several reasons they were young um healthy relatively healthy most of them they became household names in Israel many people know them know the stories know their families by now uh one of the more prominent International uh of these U uh now late um hostages is Harish Goldberg Poland his mom Rachel has been seen you know speaking in International media uh day in and day out since October 7th so there were quite known house name names for every Israeli and also at the same time uh we know that four of these six were actually on the lists uh in the negotiated uh deal that's been you know going back and forth since May so the feeling was that this is not was you know this could have been prevented you know that they were almost there they were almost back and for all sorts of Reason mostly political if you ask the protesters that we've been seeing on the street since yesterday uh Netanyahu has been stalling and that of course led to their execution by Hamas but Israeli um you know Israeli policy has not shown enough urgency in trying to bring them back now as we've heard Israel Israel's main labor union has called a general strike today um will this strike be able to pressure netan to accept a truce deal well it is the the first wide you know uh strike we've been seeing since October 7th this is the the harshest uh a measure that we've seen taken by uh not just the uh the workers but also uh private businesses and municipalities everybody kind of joining trying to you know pressure Netanyahu for being more active in trying to promote the deal uh you know netan is a very divisive figure in Israel is very much uh with you know he has his base and there's then there's all the rest so it seems and it's been becoming more and more you know this rift this this Schism in Israeli Society has become more and more strong in the last months and I think n himself also sees that I mean there's very little noises background noises as he might see it coming from the left uh or sort of out of his base that can actually move him or or shift you know his policies uh he feels like everything he does you know is already you know he never gets a fair chance by the media by the public and so on I don't think this will make a difference we will still need to see how much of momentum this wave of demonstrations will will will you know eventually have and if it will grow big enough it might shift some other members of the Coalition that then will maybe exert their pressure on netan but I doubt this will actually make much of a difference talking about pressure on um Netanyahu the media reports uh that the American Administration is currently preparing a final take it or leave it ceasefire deal how much leverage does the US really have no that's that's the good question I mean the leverage of the Americans especially Biden himself knowing that he's not running for re-election you know is very much eroded if he ever had any leverage of course uh since his announcement that he's withdrawing from the presidential race that has completely uh diminished um there's always you know the biggest tool that Americans have is their support their their military support their their support for the Israeli defense Biden will be very reluctant to do anything you know to withdraw some of that we've seen you know the backlash for any uh you know delays and shipment of of arment so far and we need to keep in mind as much as there's a lot of anger and frustration on netan and the political you know um uh the way the politics have been affecting his his decisions we also have another side here and this is Kamas and we don't see much of a flexibility there it brings us to a point where we are more than 10 months in and we don't see any change coming unfortunately Shan is there thank you very much Donnie
