Can the International Court of&nbsp; Justice stop the war in Gaza? The UN's top court will hear South Africa's&nbsp; genocide case against Israel on January 11th.&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial hearing will likely focus on&nbsp; South Africa arguing for an interim order&nbsp;&nbsp; asking Israel to "immediately suspend its&nbsp; military operations in and against Gaza." We asked three legal experts about the arguments&nbsp; and what to expect in the coming weeks. Their main argument is that Israel is&nbsp; committing genocide and is also failing&nbsp;&nbsp; to prevent genocide and also to prevent&nbsp; the incitement to genocide. And that is&nbsp;&nbsp; based on article nine of the Genocide&nbsp; Convention, which gives jurisdiction to&nbsp;&nbsp; the International Court of Justice. In its 84-page long application,&nbsp;&nbsp; South Africa has provided details as to why&nbsp; Israel's actions and omissions are genocidal&nbsp;&nbsp; in character because they're intended to&nbsp; bring about the destruction of substantial&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the Palestinian national, racial and&nbsp; ethnic group that is living in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; Israel has rejected these allegations&nbsp; and called the South African case "a&nbsp;&nbsp; despicable and contemptuous exploitation"&nbsp; of the ICJ. It also accused South Africa&nbsp;&nbsp; of "giving political and legal cover"&nbsp; to the Oct. 7 terror attacks by Hamas. Israel says it's doing everything it can to&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid harming civilians â€“ while&nbsp; Hamas uses them as human shields. So this is not like a criminal case or where&nbsp; it's required proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is more like a higher risk probability&nbsp; of genocide being committed or impending. And&nbsp;&nbsp; South Africa has detailed the wrongful conduct&nbsp; by Israeli authorities, and the genocidal intent. They have drawn from UN and other expert&nbsp; reports as well as talking about the risk&nbsp;&nbsp; or the occurrence of genocide. They have looked&nbsp; at the extensive destruction of Gaza. They have&nbsp;&nbsp; looked at the extensive killing of Palestinians&nbsp; that has taken place, including predominantly&nbsp;&nbsp; civilians, including, as we know, many,&nbsp; many children that have been killed. And the genocidal intent can be&nbsp; inferred both through the pattern&nbsp;&nbsp; of conduct of Israeli authorities, the&nbsp; actions of the IDF in the Gaza Strip,&nbsp;&nbsp; but also through statements that have been issued&nbsp; by senior Israeli officials. And South Africa has&nbsp;&nbsp; provided a long list with examples of such&nbsp; inflammatory and dehumanizing statements,&nbsp;&nbsp; including by the Israeli prime minister,&nbsp; the president, Ministry of Defense. And some of these statements&nbsp; are open to interpretations&nbsp;&nbsp; that are consistent with genocidal intent. It's still, however, will be, I think, difficult&nbsp; for South Africa to prove that these statements&nbsp;&nbsp; were actually translated into, uh, policy.&nbsp; Especially since there have been also many other&nbsp;&nbsp; statements by many officials, including the some&nbsp; of the same officials, which I have mentioned,&nbsp;&nbsp; the highest leadership of government and&nbsp; the IDF, that actually strongly rejected&nbsp;&nbsp; the insinuation that Israel is targeting, for&nbsp; instance, Palestinian civilians, and have been&nbsp;&nbsp; maintained that Israel is conducting its war&nbsp; campaign within the confines of international law. There is a distinction in what the ICJ and the&nbsp;&nbsp; ICC [International Criminal Court] do.&nbsp; The ICJ deals with state responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ICC deals with individual criminal&nbsp; responsibility. Their procedures are also&nbsp;&nbsp; separate. They operate separately. There&nbsp; are two independent international courts. The ICC is already looking at,&nbsp; uh, a host of allegations, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp; In fact, going back all the way to 2014. The&nbsp;&nbsp; ICC prosecutor has already been to Israel&nbsp; and to the Palestinian territories. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; and he and his team are looking into&nbsp; that. I believe that for South Africa,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was an interest to, uh,&nbsp; in a way, expedite the process. Only the question of provisional measures, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; would be discussed. The court would have to&nbsp; ascertain a, that it does have on its face,&nbsp;&nbsp; jurisdiction to hear the case that the&nbsp; claims made by South Africa are plausible. This is not the merits phase. The merits,&nbsp; which is where the court if it gets that far,&nbsp;&nbsp; would decide on whether or not Israel has&nbsp; breached its obligations under the Genocide&nbsp;&nbsp; Convention. So this case is not there yet. It's&nbsp; nowhere near that. And so the provisional measures&nbsp;&nbsp; that they [South Africa] have requested are&nbsp; essentially around the idea of Israel suspending&nbsp;&nbsp; military operations in and against Gaza. by senior Israeli officials are damning enough for&nbsp; [this] stage of the proceedings. And most likely&nbsp;&nbsp; the court will indicate the provisional measures&nbsp; along the lines requested by South Africa. So if a provisional measures order is issued&nbsp; from the ICJ, then all of the other state&nbsp;&nbsp; parties to the Genocide Convention should be as&nbsp; part of their obligations under that Convention,&nbsp;&nbsp; pressuring Israel to comply with&nbsp; that provisional measures order. In some cases, the court simply reiterated&nbsp; the legal obligations of the parties, namely,&nbsp;&nbsp; reminded the parties of their obligation not&nbsp; to commit genocide. Since Israel is maintaining&nbsp;&nbsp; that it is not practicing genocide, it would be&nbsp; rather relatively straightforward for Israel to&nbsp;&nbsp; comply with a measure if it is formulated in that&nbsp; sense. But there has been another genocide case&nbsp;&nbsp; in Russia versus, uh, Ukraine, sorry, versus&nbsp; Russia, that was adjudicated last year, where&nbsp;&nbsp; the court had ordered Russia to stop the war in&nbsp; Ukraine. And there we have seen Russia effectively&nbsp;&nbsp; refuse to comply with, uh, those provisional&nbsp; measures. So, if the court would order Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp; for instance, to stop its military campaign&nbsp; in Gaza, I would imagine that we will see a&nbsp;&nbsp; reaction that is probably closer to the reaction&nbsp; that we have seen from Russia in that regard.
