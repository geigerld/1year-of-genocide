the Palestinian militant group Hamas has fired a barrage of longrange rockets from Gaza at Israel for the first time since January the Israeli military said at least eight Rockets were fired from the southern Gaza City of Rafa where Israeli forces recently launched an incursion the Army intercepted a number of projectiles Israel's war against Hamas is now in its eight months following the October 7th Terror attacks air raid siren rang out in Tel Aviv sending people running down into bomb shelters until the danger passed the Salvo of rockets fired from Gaza left debris outside of a school and damaged a house in Hara to the north of Tel Aviv no casualties were reported in the attack but residents here say they're lucky to be alive mother was sitting in the living room and the caregiver went to another room to get a drink suddenly there was a bang in the caregiver's room and she fell from the blast the whole room was damaged we took the caregiver to the hospital to take a series of tests and mother miraculously survived a Hamas spokesperson said the barrage was a response to high civilian deaths at the hands of of Israel's military in Rafa civil defense workers pulled at least six bodies out of the rubble of a house destroyed in an Israeli air strike despite an order from the international court of justice to stop its offensive in the southern Gaza City Israel says it will continue until it destroys Hamas battalions [Music] there many of the displaced Palestinians who ended up here say they refuse to relocate again I have made the decision to stay here I have my own tent I've been told to make my own oven and start a business baking bread we will never leave we started our own oven business and God willing we will resist amid the violence and suffering in the Gaza Strip living another day and baking bread is an act of defiance and vital humanitarian Aid has begun entering the gasa strip via the km Shalom crossing a few kilometers from Rafa the assistance is from Egypt but can't cross directly from there due to Kyra's refusal to coordinate Aid through the rougher Crossing until control of the gasan side is handed back to Palestinians kamam Shalom connects their Gaza Strip directly with Israel the change comes after a deal between the Egyptian and US presidents Egyptian media say a total of 208 trucks are expected to cross into Gaza today but un agencies say ongoing fighting in southern Gaza usually makes it too dangerous to retrieve the aid deep malam Mala is the chief humanitarian officer of the eight organization care I asked her about the challenges the charity faces in Gaza and the 200 trucks that were allowed to end into today I mean absolutely the ongoing military offensive in and around Rafa since sixth of May compounded by cutting off and blocking what was the lifeline of delivering humanitarian Aid the Rafa Crossing this combination has severely impacted and affected our ability as Aid agencies to distribute life-saving assistance to people who are on the brink today it's a welcome sign it is encouraging that trucks are starting to enter Karim Shalom 200 200 were manifested to enter today as far as we know 126 only 126 have entered today because it's up until 5:00 p.m. that the trucks can enter and the process the bureaucracy loading unloading it takes a whole lot of time so 126 have come and for the remaining we are not yet sure will they come tomorrow or have they been sent back but as you said this is only the trucks entering the ability to uplift the cargo on the Palestinian side is hugely restricted and our ability to distribute Aid is also limited by The Continuous bombardment and several impediments that we have Yeah you mentioned that I mean there's this ongoing fighting especially in southern Gaza I should imagine that it's very difficult for uh uh your co-workers as well to provide Aid uh what are you hearing from the ground there what we are hearing is in since in the last six or seven months every day every single day I thought it cannot get worse and I have been wrong every single day so at this point let me start by saying the aid workers themselves are affected so you know people Aid workers the Distributors they are themselves trying to save themselves their families moving around continuously being displaced and then there's total kios in many places there have been situation where aid supplies have been looted where AID work workers have been attacked killed the number of Aid workers killed in this crisis is not something that we have seen before and then there is lot of rubble the physical land access is also very very restricted and then the bombardment the military offensive the attacks that also impedes so it is quite chaotic at the moment but the aid workers are doing their best and I believe I'm certain that much more can be done if there is Assurance of protecting Aid workers and letting more trucks in we are very encouraged by 200 trucks being allowed in however before October there were 500 trucks coming in every single day 500 and in all these uh six seven months the needs have only escalated so much much more is needed and Aid workers need to be alive to deliver aid for a start uh physical access to reach the affected communities also needs to be improvised in order for us to be able to save lives right so 200 trucks is a start 500 was better and a lot of people also say 600 drugs a day that's what it uh takes uh let's hope we get there Dr deep Mala Mala chief humanarian officer at K thank you so much for your time thanks for having me
