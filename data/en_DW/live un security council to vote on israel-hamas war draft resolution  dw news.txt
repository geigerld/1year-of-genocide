in accordance with rule 37 of the council's provisional rules of procedure I invite the representatives of Israel Qatar and Tunisia to participate in this meeting it is so decided I propose that the council invite the permanent Observer of the Observer state of Palestine to the United Nations to participate in this meeting in accordance with the provisional rules of procedure and the previous practice in this regard there being no objection it is so decided the security Council will now begin its consideration of item two of agenda members of the council have before them document s224 SL 173 the text of a draft resolution submitted by Algeria the council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements before the vote I give the floor to the representative of Algeria thank you Madame President I wish to extend my sincere appreciation for your efforts in convening this meeting to deliberate and take action on the draft resolution s 2024 173 the draft resolution and their consideration is the culmination of extensive discussions among among council members as the primary custodian of International Peace and security the security Council cannot afford passivity in face of the call for its ceasefire in Gaza by presenting this text Our intention is to empower the council to fulfill its mandate and protect lives commencing with an immediate humanitarian ceasefire ample time have been afforded for council members to deliberate on the content of the text our approach involved meticulous consideration of received proposal and Amendment resulting in what we believe is a balanced text capable of garnering broad support the draft resolution ution and the scores key elements including one a humanitarian ceas fire second 100 a delivery to all parts of Gaza of the Gaza Strip third rejection of forced displacement of Palestinians four compliance with provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice and Fifth and last the imperative for all parties to respect their obligations under International humanitarian law Madame President throughout this process we have heard calls to give time to a parallel track in order to preserve its Chances with concern raised that any action from the council would geop pariz this however almost one month after the icg orders signs of Hope are still absent for improvement of the situation in Gaza silence silence we content is not a viable option now is the time for action and the time for truth Madame President members of the security Council bear the responsibility of voting in favor of measures that uphold International Peace and security this resolution is a stance for truth and Humanity standing against the advocates for murder and hatred a vote in favor of this draft resolution is a support to the Palestinians right to life conversely voting against voting against it implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and Collective punishment inflicted upon them a positive vote for the draft brings hope for hundreds of thousands of children to return to school and enjoy their right right to education conversely voting against the draft resolution is a vote in favor of annihilating their dream for a better life a vote in favor of the draft resolution stands in solidarity with the right of Palestinian women while while opposing it means to accept degrading practices that destroy their dignity furthermore supporting the draft resolution means endorsing the Palestinian right to food rejecting it constitutes however an approval of starvation as me war of war against Palestinian a vote in favor of the draft is a defense of the right to health while voting against it is an violations violation of Hospital sanctity and an announced death of those those who escaped it in the first place Madame President the council must not merely call for a ceasefire it must ensure steadfast adance by all parties the International Community must act swiftly as the value of ceasefire diminishes with each passing moment we are rapidly approaching a critical juncture where the call to hold the Machinery of violence will lose its significance today every Palestinian is a target for death extermination and genocide we should ask ask ourselves how many innocent lives must be sacrificed before the council deems it necessary to call for a ceasefire for us and I hope for all the security members I hope for all the security Council Palestinians Palestinian matter each one of us decide where to stand in this tragic chapter of History I thank you I thank the representative of Algeria for his statement and I now give the floor to the representative of the United United States colleagues for months the United States has tirelessly pushed toward a goal that all of us should aspire to a sustainable resolution of the Gaza conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side and enjoy equal measures of security dignity freedom to build towards that future the United States is working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas along with Egypt and Qatar this hostage deal would bring an immediate and sustained period of calm to Gaza for at least 6 weeks and from there we could take the time to build a more enduring peace President Biden has had multiple calls in recent days with prime minister netan Yahoo as well as the leaders of Egypt and Qatar to push this deal forward and though gaps Remain the key elements are on the table so that if an arrangement is reached it would help create the conditions for sustainable cessation of hostilities which I know all of us would like to see of course we want this deal to happen as soon as possible as is shown by our exhaustive efforts but sometimes hard diplomacy takes more time than any of us might like believe me I understand the desire for the council to act urgently to positively shape the situation in line with the security council's mandate still that desire cannot blind us to the reality of the situation on the ground it and it cannot come at the expense of undermining the only and let me repeat the only path available towards a longer durable peace and that is why you've heard me say over and over again any action this Council takes right now should help not hinder these sensitive and ongoing negotiations and we believe that the resolution on the table right now would in fact negatively impact those negotiations demanding an immediate unconditional ceasefire without an agreement requiring Hamas to release the hostages will not bring about a durable peace instead it could extend the fighting between Hamas and Israel extend the hostages time in captivity and experience described by former hostages as hell and extend the dire humanitarian crisis Palestinians are facing in Gaza none of us want that and so I reiterate the United States belief that while numerous parties engage in sensitive negotiations this is not the time for this resolution which jeopard jeopardizes these efforts colleagues I communicated our concerns publicly and privately over the last several weeks we've submitted numerous rounds of edits all were ignored and so for that reason the United States has offered an alternative resolution that would do what this text does not pressure Hamas to take the hostage deal that is on the table and help secure a pause that allows humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinian civilians in desperate need again there's much more we all agree on and the alternative resolution put forward by the United States is rooted in those shared belief beliefs to start in line with President Biden's comments last week our text calls for a temporary ceas fire in Gaza as soon as practicable based on the formula of all hostages being released last I checked no one here opposes this a majority of us also agree that it's time for this Council to condemn Hamas we know because you provided that feedback to Russia on its prst and to Algeria on its resolution a feedback that was inexplicably ignored should the US resolution be adopted it would be the first to condemn Hamas for the abor attacks of October 7th including the sexual violence documented that day the US text also makes clear that Hamas has no place in future governance of Gaza nor does Hamas represent the dignity or self-determination of the Palestinian people again all things I believe we agree on in addition our draft states there can be no reduction of territory in the Gaza Strip and rejects as we have before in resolution 2720 any forc displacements of civilians Gaza it also highlights the concerns many council members have regarding the fate of civilians in Rafa making clear that under current circumstances a major ground offensive in trafa should not proceed colleagues this is not as some members have claimed an American effort to cover for an imminent ground incursion rather it is a sincere statement of our concern for the 1.5 million civilians who've sought refuge Rafa civilians must be protected and have access to humanitarian assistance and basic services on that note our text outlines a path for implementation of resolution 27202 uh 2712 and 2720 including Provisions that call for the expansion of Aid at scale it also further clarifies and strengthens the Mandate of the senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza ziger kog whose plan I know we all support as in previous resolutions it places an emphasis on the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers and it calls for lifting all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance opening additional humanitarian routes and keeping current border crossings open our draft also aims to support the secretary General's effort to investig at those UNR Personnel who directly participated in October 7th and it supports the work of the independent review group led by Katherine Colona focused on ensuring unrest neutrality these and other steps are necessary to restore donor confidence finally and as always the draft reiterates our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two Democratic states Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders under a revamped and revitalized Palestinian Authority colleagues this resolution reflects the many ideas that have been shared over the past month but which are not reflected in the text before us today and we believe it will both support the ongoing negotiations and lay the groundwork for a sustainable peace in the region but in addition to getting the what of this text correct we also know it's critical to get the how and when of it right too we will work in Earnest in negotiating this text and indeed intend to leave time for everyone to comment rather than impose an arbitrary deadline for the vote colleagues we're at a pivotal moment and a critical one critical for the hostages who've been held captive for nearly 20 weeks in Gaza and critical for their families who are desperate to be reunited with their loved ones critical for Palestinians whose homes and families have been destroyed and who now wonder where they'll find their next meal critical for Israelis many of whom are still displaced or face barges of Rocket fire critical for Palestinian civilians in the West Bank who are at heightened risk of extremist settler violence critical for humanitarian workers and journalists who put their lives on the line every day to do their jobs and critical to everyone who desperately want to see sustainable peace in this region that includes I believe every single person in this room and so let us commit to doing this the right way and at the right time so that we can create the right conditions for a safer more peaceful future thank you madam president I thank the representative of the United States for her statement and I now give the floor to the representative of the Russian Federation Madam president for the fifth month now in Gaza unpr unprecedented violence has been Unleashed in Gaza the magnitude of which has surpassed any conflict that humankind has encountered following the second world war the number of the Dead civilians has reached the shocking threshold of 30,000 people and these are only estimates in all this time the United Nations security Council has been unable to adopt a critically important resolution with a demand for an immediate ceasefire I wish to recall that on the 16th of October last year when Russia proposed the very first draft resolution with this call the number of the Dead Palestinians were approximately 1,000 people at that point Western delegations of the council preferred to obain on mass in order not to incur the ire of Washington colle will be no exaggeration to state that this new figure 20 more than 28,000 dead is the cost of that very first disgraceful in action this is the collective responsibility of Western delegations at the security C for whom solidarity within NATO transend any L National declarations on commitment to International humanitarian law the protection of civilians and humanitarian Personnel since then the United States three times exercised their right to the veto exercis their veto in order to prevent the council's adoption of Demands foras fire each time heard from the US delegation those samees and hypocritical calls to just wait a little bit longer to give time for their effective allegedly effective diplomacy on the ground however this did not yield any results and it could not yield any results because the real goal of Washington is not to achieve peace in the Middle East not to protect civilians but rather to advance their geopolitical agenda demanding at any cost for their closest Middle East Ally to be shielded this is why Washington having pushed through in Security Council resolution 2720 an effective license to Kill for Israel to kill Palestinians on the occupied Palestinian territory under the pretex of iote establishing conditions for cessation of hostilities which is something we warned about contines to provide International cover for the authorities of Western J Jerusalem and uh uphold their impunity for Myriad crimes against the people of Gaza distinguished colleagues of the delegation of Algeria on behalf of the Arab group propos a robust balanced draft resolution at the heart of which is a long anticipated ceas fire our colleagues our Algerian colleagues organized negotiations in good faith conscientiously they consulted with all delegations and they strove to take their remarks into account and we wish to highlight in particular the professionalism shown by our Algerian negotiating team however the US delegation this time from the very beginning effectively put forward an ultimat demanding a Hal our us colleagues asserted that the draft proposed by Algeria was dangerous in so far as it would obstruct so-called delicate diplomacy on the ground we just heard the same in this Hall we call on all of you to consider the cynicism of this argument effectively Washington has been proclaiming that the security Council of the United Nations is in the way of its plans and demanding that it the security Council interfere in the US's plans and our my us colleague just yesterday publicly stated that they would vote against the Algerian dis colle the United States time and time again has been demonstrating utter disregard both for international institutions and multilateral diplomacy and international law today essentially the authority and the standing of the United Nations Security Council is at stake we call upon the membership of the security Council to demonstrate solid counter the lawlessness of Washington which is willing to countenance any sacrifice in any region for the advancement of its geopolitical Ambitions the US government has no concern either for the lives of the people of God are nor the views of its own people who are increasingly vocal in their support of the Palestinian people we should like to hope that within other UN member states and member states of Security Council that they generally listen not if not to at least the voice of conscience but at least to public opinion public opinion will no longer forgive United Nations the situation in the south of the strip around the city of Rafa is in the context of Israeli military plans exem dangerous the implementation of these plans will result in a catastrophical increase in the magnitude of the humanitarian disaster at the epicenter of which are more than 1 million residents of Goda who have LED hostilities in the city to the border of Egypt there is a need to do everything possible to prevent this kind of a development our shared objective is to stop the Bloodshed as soon as possible and to provide conditions for the establishment to sustained channels for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people in the strip we urge the security Council membership to vote in support of the Algerian draft thank you I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his statement I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now will those in favor of the draft resolution contained in document s202 hand those abstentions the result of the Voting is as follows 13 votes in favor one vote against one abstention the draft resolution has not been adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the council I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements after the vote I give the floor to the representative of the United States thank you madam president colleagues over the past few weeks we have made incredibly clear that the resolution before the council would not achieve the goal of a sustainable peace and may in fact run counter to it proceeding with a vote today was wishful irresponsible and so while we cannot support a resolution that would put sensitive negotiations in Jeopardy we look forward to engaging on a text that we believe will address so many of the concerns we all share a text that can and should be adopted by the council so that we can have a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable based on the formula of all hostages being released this temporary ceasefire is critical to getting Aid into the hands of Palestinian civilians who desperately desperately need it we should look towards this text so that we can finally finally condemn Hamas for their horrific attacks on October 7th which set this conflict in to motion so that we can Empower Senor coordinator Cog and the United Nations because her success is the UN success and it is so very needed to ensure civilians get the aid that they need more efficiently and effectively and just more period And so that ultimately we can together help create a future in which Israelis and Palestinians live in states of their own side by side in peace we're committed to engaging constructively on our resolution with you all in the days to come to that in and we will continue to tirelessly engage in direct diplomacy and negotiations on the ground thank you of the United States for her statement and I now give the floor to the representative of China thank you Madame President Madame President China expresses a strong disappointment and and disatisfaction with the outcome of the vote just taken we have uh voted in favor of the resolution Algeria on behalf of the Arab states put forward the draft resolution demanding a uh immediate Gaza immediate release of all hites guaranteed access for humanitarian supplies and opposition to for transfer this is both urgently required by the situation on the ground and it is also based on the minimum requirements of humanity and it should deserve the support by all council members Algeria by displaying reason sincerity and open attitude held lengthy and extensive consultations with all parties on the drop resolution and to on board many construct ideas making the draft resolution more balanced the outcome of today's vote clear clearly shows that on the issue of a to hold the fighting in Gaza it is not that the security Council does not have an overwhelming consensus but rather it is the exercise of the veto by the United States that has stifled the council consensus the US veto sent a wrong message pushing the situation in Gaza into a more dangerous one while the security Council CI resolution is being V innocent civilians in Gaza are dying in the fighting and they are struggling on the brink of death the US claimed that the council resolution would interfere with the ongoing diplomatic efforts such clim is totally UNT given the situation on the ground the continued passive avoidance on an immediate ceasefire is nothing different from giving a green light to the continu while the security Council cire resolution is being beaten the spill over of the conflict is destabilizing the entire middle east region leading to a rising risk of a wider War only by extinguishing the Flames of war in Gaza can we prevent our fires of Health from engulfing the entire region the council must act quickly to stop this in the while the council C resolution is being vetoed the basics of international law are being trbl upon and the bad of the multilateral system is being eroded the Secretary General of the United Nations has already written to the council invoking article 99 of the charter and the international Court of jce has issu provisional measures the council must respond forcefully to the serious violations of the international law and international humanitarian law in the Gaza conflict and uphold the authority of international rule of Madame President the security Council must take actions to push for this far this should not be a matter of debate but rather this is a moral obligation that the council cannot shy away a legal responsibility that the council must assume even more so this is a political requirement that the council must fulfill in accordance with the Char The veto cannot marle the strong call for sisire and Ender the war the security Council cannot stop its work to uphold Justice and fulfill its responsibilities just because of the V China urges Israel to call of the International Community abandon his plan from ra offensive and stop its Collective punishment of the people of pal we expect countries having significant influence to do less of their political calculations to be truly impartial and responsible and to make the right choice in pushing foris in Gaza we call on the International Community to pull all diplomatic efforts to give the people of Gaza a chance to live and give the people of the entire middle east region a chance to have peace and give it a chance for justice to be upheld I thank you madam president I thank the representative of China for his statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Slovenia thank you very much uh Madame President we voted uh for the resolution because the killing of civilians in Gaza must stop the suffering that Palestinians are enduring is beyond anything a human being should be subjected to a possible Israeli ground offensive in Rafa would have unimaginable humanitarian consequences it would push us on a path of no return it is our duty to react before we wake up in a nightmare and that's why we are convinced it is high time for the council to pull a break let me emphasize once again that Slovenia condemns the horrific terrorist attack by Hamas on 7 of October as well as their continuing attacks on Israel we continue to call for immediate and safe release of all hostages we feel the pain of their relatives and loved ones and we thank the leaders of Egypt Qatar and United States for their tieless efforts and we hope that negotiations they are facilitating will soon bring peace to Gaza and return the hostages home safely however it is the responsibility of this Council to to maintain International Peace and security we believe that everyone can and should contribute their piece of the puzzle that will eventually bring peace we believe in compl complimentarity of all efforts bilateral Regional or those of the council the council's role is important and it is indispensable in order to end hostilities to bring hostages home to rapidly and safely deliver humanitarian system and to draft a day after road map lastly the council has responsibility towards the International Community its expectations have been clearly expressed through a general assembly resolution with the overwhelming support of member states it has been clearly manifested by citizens across the globe their voices are loud and clear the war needs to stop the security Council needs to hear these voices of global Consciousness and respond to their demands and pleas and it all starts with a call for a ceasefire to end hostilities to bring hostages home to bring water and food to starving Palestinians and to silence and clear the Skies over Gaza and Israel a call addressed to both sides Israel and Hamas it is our firm belief that Algeria proposed a balanced text calling for respect of international humanitarian law on human rights law addressing all violations committing by both sides of the conflict and calling for accountability for those violations it is putting protection of civilians as a civiliz civilized Norm in the center of our action we therefore deeply regret that the council was not able to pass this resolution which we supported strongly but we cannot give up it is our responsibility to continue working towards a consensus in this body for peace in the Middle East thank you I thank the representative of Slovenia for swiland thank you madam resolution regret that it was not adopted despite the very broad support it enjoys among the members of this Council I would like thank the Algerian delegation for its efforts in building consensus around this text which calls in particular for an immediate humanitarian ceas in Gaza and immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held captive in Gaza since the acts of Terror perpetrated by Hamas on almost three weeks have passed since the first draft of this text was submitted welcomed the intense negotiations taking place in the region and stressed the need to the necessary time to reach a result at the same time stress the responsibility of this Council act in accordance with it mandate for the respect of international humanitarian law and especially the protection of civilians that a firmer and more explicit condemnation of hamas's Acts of Terror was not included in the resolution despite the injunction of several council members including Switzerland protect the population in G is growing by respect for international humanarian LA and human rights particular regards the protection of civilians must remain a priority for under conv the delivery of humanitarian Aid must be safe rapid and cannot allow hundreds of thousands of besed civilians to be left pre guarante for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for their own protection very concerned the risk of a large scale military in Rafa and the sub Regional escalation thetion was therefore intended as a preventive meure against further escalation on the spot which would endanger the lives of all civilians including the host is why for iMed humanarian ceasefire Ina with our Collective commit to respect andure respect for the and international humanitarian law in all circumstances remains committed to unified action by Council in this direction we also recall that the

Justice on January thank you I thank the representative of Switzerland for her France Madam chair France thanks Algeria for prepar and proposing this resolution it regrets that the resolution was not aded given the disaster situation on the ground the immediate and unconditional release of all explicitly requested by resolutions 2712 and 272 of our as well as the draft that was just rejected should take place without further delay there is Extreme urgency to without further delay conclude an agreement on a ceasefire that would finally guarantee the protection of all civilians and a massive delivery of the human toll and humanitarian situation in Gaza is intolerable and Israeli operations must stop it's urgent to massively deliver humanitarian Aid to imperative the As and open land path directly between incomprehensible acceptable that this Council still has not condemned the terrorist acts committed by Hamas on 7 October with other terrorist and sexual violence used as we

Palestinian question we also express our sincere appreciation to Algeria for the tireless work that led to the tabling of the resolution aimed ATT ending the totally unacceptable and unbearable suffering of the Palestinian people the humanitarian catastrophe currently unfolding in Gaza Madam president by voting in favor of this Security Council resolution mosambik aligns ourself with the International Community as a whole in its effort that overwhelmingly calls for the immediate session of hostilities in the Gaza strep we consider it imperative that all parties scrupulously comply with their humanitarian law and international law human rights law in particular with regard to the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructures we strongly call for the total and full compliance with the provisional measures laid down by the order of the international court of justice within the scope of Articles two and three of the convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide side handed down on January 26 2024 throughout history we had our share of a painful experience with all and armed conflict it is on this basis and the on the dictates of the laws of war that we Embrace that mosm firmly oppos es the forced displacement of the Palestinian civilian population women and children in particular in that connection we strongly appeal for the full implementation of the United Nations resolutions 2712 of 2023 and 2720 also of 2023 in the same vein mosambi demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages as well as a guarantee of humanitarian access to meet the medical needs of all hostages Mr President Madame President we urge the International Community and the security Council in particular to continue working tirelessly together towards achieving peace and stability in the region based on a two-state solution for the people of Palestine and Israel I thank you Madame President I thank the representative of mosambik for his the representative of the Republic of Korea uh thank you m Madam president the Republic of Korea voted in favor of the resolution proposed by Algeria considering the urgent need for a humanitarian ceasefire to end the suffering of civilians in Gaza right now in Rafa where more than half of the entire population of Gaza is densely packed people are panicking at a looming catastrophe that may be caused by a full scale ground operation the Republic of Korea could not ignore the possibility of another humanitarian Calamity that will lead to a huge number of fatalities nonetheless we adhere to our position that the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas on the 7th of October is the direct cause of the current disaster in Gaza thus it is regrettable that the clear and unified condemnation of the deplorable terrorist Acts perpetrated by Hamas was missing in the draft resolution Madame President the Republic of Korea takes note that serious negotiations among key stakeholders namely Egypt Qatar us and Israel are vigorously ongoing on the ground to achieve the long overdue release of the hostages we express our strong support and appreciation for these efforts the Republic of Korea will continue to engage in Council deliberations actively and constructively to achieve a ceas fire in Gaza as well as the realization of the two State solution I thank you representative of the Republic of Korea for his statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Japan thank you Madame President it has been over four months of devast ation hostilities and suffering since Hamas horrifying acts of Terror against Israel we are witnessing an alarming escalation of violence and unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe the situation on the ground is only worsening as each day goes by particularly the situation in Rafa is deeply concerning Japan appreciates the ongoing tireless diplomatic efforts led by Us and other countries towards the release of hostages improving the humanitarian situation and calming down the situation as soon as possible Japan believes that humanitarian ceasefire needs to be realized promptly in a such a way to ensure a conducive environment for sufficient humanitarian assistance activities as well as to lead to the release of the remaining hostages therefore resulting in realizing ation of a sustainable seize Fire based on this position we'll call on all the parties concerned to act immediately from a humanitarian Viewpoint in this V Japan voted in favor of this draft resolution we would like to express our gratitude to Algeria for their efforts to coordinate various positions among the council members at the same time in efforts to ensure a more fa fair and balanced text the resolution should have included a condemnation of hamus terrorist attacks which the security Council has so far failed to speak out though we couldn't agree on a resolution which other the council members can support we are all engaging seriously to stop the violence this Council should be should be a place to explore and find a peace and SEC security jointly not a uh place to aim for finger pointing Japan will continue to work constructively with other council members to find the PATH toward forward to for peace and stability in the region thank you I thank the representative of Japan for his the representative of Malta thank you president Malta also thanks Algeria for their measured and constructive approach as can hold us throughout the negotiations Malta voted in favor of this draft and we unequivocally reiterate our call for a permanent ceasefire it is therefore regrettable that the use of the veto prevents this Council from calling for an end to this conflict we also believe that the council has provided the ongoing negotiations taking place on the ground the necessary space and time however regrettably we still find ourselves on the precipice of another wave of hostilities this will undoubtedly have catastrophic consequences on the civilian population in Rafa an area already designated as a safe Zone we also reject and denounce any forced population from and within Gaza such actions amount to grave breaches of international law the severely deteriorating humanitarian conditions and the threat of fam famine within Gaza are extremely troubling and need to be urgently addressed Israel is required to facilitate the full Rapid Safe and impeded unimpeded delivery of humanitarian Aid into Gaza at the same time anra remains essential to ensure an effective humanitarian response the broader Regional situation also continues to to be deeply worrying under these circumstances the full and immediate implementation of Security Council resolutions 2712 and 2720 is now more pressing than ever let us be clear this Council has the duty and responsibility to make sure that its decisions are respected we also Echo the call for the remaining hostages to be immediately safely and unconditionally released and we call on this Council to the announc the terrorist acts of October 7th in closing president Malta underlined unwavering commitment to a comprehensive pece based on the two- State solution thank you I thank the representative of Malta for her the representative of the United Kingdom thank you President we want to see the fighting in Gaza end as soon as possible in a way that never again allows Hamas to carry out the appalling terrorist attacks against Israel we saw on the 7th October last year Palestinian civilians are facing a devastating humanitarian crisis we're particularly worried about the situation in Rafa where a military operation could have appalling consequences for civilians Sheltering there with nowhere else to go ongoing negotiations are critical to secure the release of the hostages held in Gaza we are calling for an immediate suspension in fighting to get Aid in and hostages out leading to a permanent sustainable ceasefire that means the release of all hostages the formation of a new Palestinian government for the West Bank and Gaza accompanied by an international support package removing hamas's capacity to launch attacks against Israel Hamas no long longer in charge of Gaza and a political Horizon which provides a credible and irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution President we welcome the efforts of our aerian colleagues on this resolution and we regret that some of our proposals were not taken on board simply calling for a ceasefire as this resolution does will not make it happen indeed as it could endanger the hostage negotiations it could actually make a ceasefire less likely the way to stop the fighting and potentially stop it from restarting is to begin with a pause to get hostages out and Aid in that is what what we are calling for it could end the fighting now we will continue to work for a stop fighting a humanitarian response at scale the release of all hostages and the delivery of the two sovereign states of Israel and Palestine that ensures peace security and justice for both countries thank you I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for to the representative of Sierra Leon Madame President the delegation of s Leon would like to thank Algeria for proposing and facilitating effort to agree to a resolution that would have inter earlier led to an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Street we further thank the Algerian delegation for leading a reasonable transparent and inclusive process s voted in favor of the draft resolution because of the imperative for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire the Security Council is mandated to act promptly and effectively in order to maintain International Peace security the council has had its attention call to the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and for it to act under article 99 of the UN Charter by the Secretary General some members of the security Council have had the opportunity to visit both Rafa Crossing from the Egyptian border and Israel including representatives of the delegation of s the assessment there from has been that only a humanitarian ceasefire will put an end to the unbearable killings in Gaza and certainly the looming and Unthinkable catastrophe in Rafa CA appreciates and commends member states embarking on diplomatic engagement with parties to the conflict to secure prolonged pause to the hostilities but while we do so we remain worried that reaching a meaningful conclusion in Practical terms takes time A luxury that cannot be afforded by the suffering Palestinian people the families of the hostages and the hostages themselves the other main organs of United Nations have acted ously and effectively in this tragic conflict the UN General Assembly has adopted resolutions es12 1 and Es 1022 with the overwhelming majority demanding in the latter an immediate humanarian ceasefire in Gaza the secet general of the UN invoked article 99 of the UN Charter last use over half a century ago to warn Us in this Council of the humanitarian catastrophe we now see in Gaza as council members we were urged to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire the international court of justice has acted promptly and rightly when called upon to do so by South Africa throwing the requests for indication of provisional measures the icj in the 26th January 2024 order in the application of the convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide in the Gaza Street South Africa versus Israel inter earlier specifically ordered and I quote that the state of Israel shall take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of Life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Street end of Court the court deem it necessary to emphasize that all parties to the conflict in the Gaza strep are bound by International humanitarian law it expressed its grave concern that the fate of the ostage is adopted during the attack in Israel on 7th October 2023 and held since there by hammer and other armed groups and calls for their immediate and unconditional release the icj further reminded the parties that the provisional measures ordered under article 41 of the icj statute have binding effect and thus create International legal obligations for any party to whom the provisional measures are addressed C is of the view that in the absence of any primar facet change in the current perilous humanitarian conditions prevailing in Gaza coupled with the continuing perpetuation of the hostage situation following the 26 January 2024 order of icj the UN Security Council is now more than ever compelled to act to use the mer of tools available to us as a council to save human lives and put a check on the mountain dead toll and inordinate destruction of Civilian object Madame President it is extremely worrisome that after over 130 days in conflict a draft resolution calling for ceasefire demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages rejecting Force displacement of Palestinians reiterating the call for full Rapid Safe and unhindered humanitarian access into Gaza and the optimal political solution of a two-state solution could not be adopted which we deeply regret at this stage with the immense suffering vet and anguish in Gaza the security Council must not relent until a complete halt to the contined hostilities in Gaza Street and in the West Bank is Achieve to do otherwise is to accept passively the prevalent criticisms of dysfunctionality of this Council meanwhile the reality in Gaza is that of faming like conditions malnutrition displacement and the spread of infectious diseases and the potential for spillover of the conflict in The Wider region our failure to act extinguishes hope the hope that 1.3 million Palestinians in Rafa have licated to us and Beyond this the hope that Humanity has placed in us as members to deliver on the council's Mandate this must awaken our resolve to act in closing Madame President San sincerely looks forward to not only having a positive outcome from the ongoing diplomatic negotiations being mediated by the United States Egypt and Qatar but also as a security Council would have have a product that will call for full and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire and hostages this we hope will lead to an end in the fighting and alleviate humanitarian crisis in the Gaza stet I thank you I thank the representative of sier Leon for his statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Ecuador seora pres Madam voted in favor of it that the council needs to take a stand on the humanitarian situation which is constantly unra with thousands of innocent victims the draft that we just voted on was not perfect and included in it all the issues that we think were appropr was presented after negotiations process that included the necessary elements about a situation which is deteriorating mainly requests a humanitarian ceas fire that will make it possible to alleviate the situation for the civilian population and it also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and it deor the violence against civilians and all acts of terrorism including implicitly the horrific acts committed by Hamas in October last year however it's worth mentioning like several members of the counil required insistently required the text have explicit condemnation of the terrorist actions of Hamas and we regret that it was not included in the text that condation was not there however we think it's important to clearly signal responsibility that is evident all those present and also point to the responsibilities that will be seen in future Madam chair regret at this time possible to adopt resol it will continue working so that the council can take a stance and act effectively through successful adoption Ecuador for his statement and I now give the floor to the represent resentative of the Russian president distinguished colleagues today we have born witness to yet another dark chapter in The History of the United Nations security Council this was against again yet again written by the United States delegation the US delegation which continues to pursue the same objective to provide cover for its close middle e Ally and to drag out time drag out that time to the greatest possible extent for them to be able to carry out their inhume plans against Gaza specifically to expel the Palestinians from the strip and to completely cleanse the strip essentially and quite literally transforming it into an unhabitable uninhabitable territory under these circumstances there are open discussions in political Israeli political circles about categories which completely rule out the two-state solution once again having reped calls again for calling an end to the Carnage and gaja against demands to con condemn the actions of Hamas in doing so our us colleagues have once again hypocritically remained silen Sil by the fact that the 18th October they having already vetoed the Brazilian draft resolution with this condemnation theeran draft was capable of reversing this situation of ending the annihilation of Palestinians in Gaza unfortunately the latest the now fourth us veto uh prevented this from happening and doomed to uh the doomed the fates of another thousands of peaceful Gaz citizens of Gaza however everybody needs to understand that this result is not the failure in the work of the UN SEC Council which today was effectively United rather this is the pernicious policy of a single member of the security Council namely the United States full responsibility for the consequences of this lies with Washington regardless of its attempts to elude this responsibility expatiating on its quote unquote important mediation efforts regardless of how bitter the after Taste of today's meeting may be we have no intention of throwing in the towel the demand from the UN Security Council for the parties to immediately adopt a ceasefire remains imperative absent this any Council product will be devoid of practical purpose we all had an opportunity to see this based on the example of the toothless humanitarian resolutions on Gaza that the council previously adopted and these remained letters on paper because as we warned amid circumstances of active hostilities it is impossible to deliver humanitarian Assistance or to monitor pauses now turning to the US tax which previously today was so proactively uh uh uh uh uh championed by the United States Representative as far as we are aware this text has not even been officially circulated at the security Council not to mention the fact that there was no comprehensive or meaningful discussion thereof for this reason for now this all looks like further spoilers which are designed to detract attention from the latest shameful veto exercised by the US veto on a critically significant resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza call on the membership of the security Council not to be misled by the duplicit admonitions that there is a need to wait just a little bit longer the United Nations security Council in the world waited for five months and with each passing hour that we wait there are more and more human victims the US draft does not contain I emphasize this does not contain a call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza the text refers only to a temporary and even this when the conditions are right so there is no real alternative to the Algerian draft resolution which a us vetoed this uh a brainchild is no viable alternative and cannot be any viable alternative to that this is yet another uh bad faith attempt by Washington to drag out the time for the purposes of advancing Israel's benefit interest and allowing it to definitively resolve the Palestinian question our shared objective is to prevent this from taking place and to achieve a just peace between the Palestinians in Israel on the basis of Security Council resolutions and general assembly resolutions let us resolve this together and perhaps our us colleagues will at some point have their conscience awakened I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Algeria thank you Madame President President at the outset to express my appreciation to all the members of the Council for constructively participating in the negotiations allow me to thank all states that voted for and not against the draft Palestinians saying that the world is not standing idly by their suffering however however and unfortunately the security Council once [Music] again to rise to the and aspirations of peoples of the world this failure does not absolve the security Council of shouldering its responsibility obligations the unarmed Palestinian people this does not absolve the occupation power of its obligation to implement the precau me ordered by the international court of justice it is high time for the agression to end it is high time for humanitarian to be delivered across it is that 272 2720 did not achieve their objectives it is clear that assistance did not meet the basic needs needs of the Palestinian people we have to acknowledge that only a ceasefire only a ceasefire can achieve the desired objective Madame President the current situation requires everyone as stressed by the Algerian president his Excellency AB to work on putting the purposes and principles of the United Nations first to provide the necessary protection to the Palestinian people and to put an end to their history historic Injustice Madame President the people of our region have always looked up to the security Council as the source of international legitimacy however and unfortunately the security Council has failed them Community should respond to the calls ending of ceasefire all those ining such calls should review their policies and their calculations because wrong decisions today will have a cost on our region and our world tomorrow and this caused violence and instability so ask yourselves examine your conscience what will your decisions today cause how will history judge you everyone that we our Martyrs this evening in rafaz in in all Palestine and that Algeria will return tomorrow on behalf of the Arab world behalf of Muslim countries on behalf of all the free people in the world powered by the the souls thousands occupation with no accountability whatsoever Algeria will return to knock on the doors of the security Council once again to call stop this Council shoulders its responsibilities in tire and we will never stop thank you Madame President I thank the representative of Algeria for his statement I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Guyana colleagues Guyana is disappointed that this Council has once again been unable to deliver a ceasefire for the people of Gaza a ceasefire is the difference between life and death for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and others trapped in the war zone that Gaza has become the delegation of Algeria has approached the tabling of this resolution with great patience transparen Y and inclusivity they have listened to all sides acquiescing to requests for additional time to be given to other efforts on the way it has been almost 3 weeks since the draft was circulated and we still find ourselves at square one in that time almost 2,000 more Palestinians were killed in Gaza another 2,000 more injured in those 3 weeks every aspect of life in Gaza has gotten worse internal displacement has increased with a serious crisis on the way in Rafa food insecurity continued to worsen with the latest integrated food security and nutrition phase classification IPC report stating that Gaza now has the highest share of persons facing devastating levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC has ever classified for any given area or country the humanitarian situation has been described as increasingly severe humanitarian access is extremely limited and people's desperation has led them to looting Aid trucks to secure a marel of food the population is in Dire Straits the most vulnerable among them including children the elderly and people with underlying conditions are especially vulnerable to malnutrition and all of this is happening in freezing temperatures in that time we have also seen a further hardening of positions for the worse for example we have heard heard the determination of the Israeli government to proceed with the ground operation in Rafa despite the strong urgings to the contrary by many of its friends and partners and others in the International Community we know what a ground operation in Rafa would mean for the people who were driven there by the Israeli Defense Force the icj orders of 26th of January are being completely ignored as though there is no obligation to adhere to them un Personnel are continuing to Opera in Gaza under these extremely dangerous circumstances with unprecedented numbers of them killed since 7th of October the confliction mechanisms are not being respected so everyone is at risk and nowhere is safe dear colleagues what else needs to happen happen to act for the people in Gaza how many more lives must be lost how many more must be maimed how many more we need a ceasefire now resolutions 2712 and 2720 cannot be fully implemented if there is no ceasefire the longer we take to agree on the need for a ceasefire the longer this Council will be seen as being complicit in what is taking place in Gaza to be clear Guyana also calls for the release of all hostages taken on October 7th and Palestinians unlawfully detained in Israeli prisons without trial though progress has been stalled for decades the two-state solution Still Remains the best option for a permanent and Lasting resolution of the Palestinian question the current situ situation in Gaza puts the two-state solution at Great risk especially given the rhetoric from some Israeli government officials gyana calls on this Council to act now for Gaza and for the future of both Palestine and Israel a peaceful and stable Israel depends on a peaceful and stable Palestine the two are not mutually exclusive and a peaceful Palestine and Israel is crucial for lasting peace and stability of the Middle East region I thank you I resume my function as president of the council I now give the floor to the permanent Observer of the Observer state Palestine Madame President we thank you and your friendly country Guana for your leadership of the SEC Security Council we thank Algeria for all its efforts and its statement that my brother Amar delivered few minutes ago in bringing forth the draft resolution on behalf of the Arab group that has just been voted regarding the grave situation that continues to be faced by the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip as Israel the occupying power carries on with its genocidal War we also thank the 13 members of the Council who voted in favor of the draft and we thank you also for your intense engagement with the Arab group led by our brother the ambassador of Algeria during the course of the last three weeks negotiating in good faith of trying to save the Palestinian people lives in the Gaza Strip and not to allow the looming catastrophe flying over our heads in having a further catastrophe on the Gaza Strip we sincerely thank you for that effort for your principal position and for your determination that a ceasefire has to be demanded implemented now to save lives to save the Gaza Strip to save the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Rafa District this draft resolution was brought to the the council precisely because Israel persist with the onslaught persist with every single grave breach it has been committing despite the near unanimous calls by the International Community for a Seas fire and despite the icj provisional measures ordered to Israel to seize all acts of genocide and incitement to genocide and to ensure humanitarian assist resistance to the Palestinian people who every day are facing death and destruction and the torment of starvation and repeated Force displacement it has been nearly 3 weeks since I last addressed the council following the Court's order appealing for Action to be taken to ensure the implementation of the pro of the provisional measures to ensure a ceasefire that would protect the Palestinian people and a avert the further ravaging of their lives by the Israeli Onslaught but our appeals have regrettably been to no avail between our last Council session on the 31st of January and today the casualty toll has risen from 26 ,000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli occupying forces to now almost 30,000 people killed and more than 69,000 injured this means that in just the past 20 days alone Israel has killed nearly 4,000 more Palestinian children women and men in just 20 days this is deplorable consequence of an action it means more than 200 Palestinians killed every day it means that by the time this Security Council session ends more than 25 Palestinians will have been killed it means more babies will be murdered wounded amputated and orphaned more children will die for of hunger and hypothermia and disease it means the continued threat of the further Force displacement of families the looming danger of a mass expulsion or Worse Slaughter of the nearly 1.5 million people in rafah who have nowhere to flee no protection whatsoever it means the continued deprivation of of the entire population of Gaza left without food water medicine and shelter essential to alleviate suffering and ensure survival it means that the human lives that that could have been saved and saved are instead being forsaken to israeli's genocidal War Machine deliberately knowingly by those who oppose a fire we all know this we know the Staggering figures we have heard the the warning from the Secretary General the heads of all un agencies on the ground dozens of independent special repur and humanitarian and human rights agencies the world over we have seen it with our own eyes in pictures and videos that have seared and stained our Collective conscience and broken our hearts and our Humanity in the face of israeli's brazen violation of the icj order the court sent another warning issued another decision on 16 February reminding Israel that it is bound to fully comply with its obligations under the genocide convention and all the provisional measures ordered by the court on 26 26 January the court also had to remind Israel that its obligations are immediate and should be effective the call for ceasefire should have been agreed to long time ago what threshold needs to be crossed for this Council to finally demand a ceasefire what could be more serious than the crime than genocide history as my brother Amar said is going to judge the council harshly it is already doing so impairing its credibility and Authority in the eyes of people all over the world perhaps irreparably but we will not be complacent in in this inaction we have a duty to our people to seek every possible Pathway to bring an end to the slaughter an end to the trauma and Terror and an end to the threats to expel them from their land we will not be silent and we will act with every legitimate means to uphold our sacred obligations to defend and protect our people and to pursue Justice for them that is why we have come back to the security Council over and over again imploring it to act to protect our people that is why we will not relent in seeking accountability calling on the council the general assembly and all states to act in line with the charter and all obligations under international law without selectivity without exception we will not stop demanding accountability for the war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide that is Israel is perpetrating against the Palestinian people but accountability must move beyond words in these chamers it must mean real consequences for the occupying power for its criminal Behavior to this end I just have returned around midnight last night from the hag where the state of Palestine stood before the icj appealing to the court for justice after more than 75 years of nakba 56 years of belligerent occupation 17 years of blockade and nearly 140 days of in vindictive punitive Siege and massacres perpetrated by Israel in Gaza which is a genocide what crimes has Israel not committed yet we have gone to the court along with an unprecedented number of countries to confront the Israeli impunity that has made life a living hell for the Palestinian people appealing for an immediate and complete end to this illegal Colonial occupation and aperti regime the root cause of all the ills our people are suffering including this genocidal War the court has undertaken its solemn duties acting swiftly both in response to the case brought by South Africa against Israel under the genocide convention and in response to the general assembly's request for advisory opinion which we hope will be a true turning point in the Quest for accountability and for justice for the Palestinian people when will the security Council finally undertake its solemn duties when will the council act to demand the ceasefire that has been demanded by the rest of the International Community majority for months now the veto of this draft resolution is not only regrettable after weeks of consultations with every single council member and after endless Patience by the state of Palestine the Arab states and nearly the entire International Community that for months have demanded a ceasefire it is absolutely Reckless and dangerous against sh again shielding Israel even as it commits the most shocking crimes while exposing millions of innocent Palestinian civilians to its wrath and more Untold Horrors it is not Israel that should be protected by the veto it is Palestinian children women and men who must be protected by this Council acting now only with a ceasefire can we give a chance for life for resolution 2712 and 2720 to be implemented as the president of the security Council has indicated correctly ceasefire would allow these resolutions to be implemented to be implemented for humanitarian assistance to reach the millions of desperate people in need for onoa and other un agencies to deliver life saving Aid and a chance for our Collective efforts to chart a path for justice and peace and as long as the council fails to demand a ceasefire it will be considered not only delicate the relicate in its duties but an enabler of the most horrific crimes we are witnessing in the Gaza in the Gaza in these days in Gaza the message given today to Israel with this veto is that it can continue to get away with murder Israel cannot and should not and will not get away with it we will not allow it this veto does not observe Israel of its obligations nor of those who Shield it not here in the security Council not in the in the icj and not anywhere even if the security Council continues to share its responsibilities to be obstructed by The veto of a permanent member over and over the other organs of the International System are upholding their responsibilities and one day or another Palestinian children will not be viewed as a demography threat but as children with the right to life and to fulfill their hopes and dreams I thank you Madame President I thank the of Palestine for his statement I now Israel thank you Madame President since October 7th this Council has voted upon numerous resolutions constructed around the same flawed theme the concept of a of a ceasefire this word is constantly mentioned in the security Council in the general assembly and by un officials and agencies as if it is a silver bullet a magical solution to all of the Region's problems for the past 137 days the only solution discussed on the international stage is this absurd notion of a ceasefire will a ceas fire bring home hostages will a ceas fire eliminate Hamas will a ceasefire disarm kisala the hutis and all the other Iranian terrorist proxies in our region will a ceasefire end the genocidal Ambitions of Palestinian Terror groups aiming for Israel's Annihilation we're still waiting for president abas to condemn the October 7th Massacre what exactly will this Silver Bullet ceasefire achieve a ceasefire achieves one thing and one thing only the survival of Hamas exactly the opposite the opposite of How It's portrayed a ceasefire is a death sentence for many more Israelis and Gins supporting a ceasefire means supporting the survival of jihadist terrorists that will continue continue butchering Israelis and endlessly spilling the blood of Innocence there is a reason dear colleagues that the icj unanimously and rightly rejected South Africa's attempted attempt to undermine Israel's right to defend itself by calling for a ceasefire the very idea that Israel would be denied this fundamental right while Hamas would be free to continue its Terror and hold hostages is morally Unthinkable because as you know Hamas is not going to even read your resolutions so why are some on this Council determined so determined to impose harmful measures that the icj refused to take you all know the answers colleagues a ceasefire is the epitome of a kick the can down the road policy a ceasefire today means immunity for baby killers and rapists it's an easy way to make this problem an issue for another day with a ceasefire in place Hamas will regroup rearm and their next attempted genocide against Israelis will only be a question of when not if Kamas has sworn publicly to commit the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again until Israel is annihilated so why is the council charged with security is so fixated fixated fixated on aiding these monsters to stay in power just yesterday Israel exposed footage Prov proving that Shiri bibas and her two children four-year-old Ariel and one-year-old K were taken to alive so tell me distinguished council members a 4-year-old and a baby were taken hostage by Hamas among others and most of you choose to support a ceasefire why do you want to leave them in Gaza do you not see how immoral that it that it that is and what kind of precedent this would set for terrorists around the globe did you think about baby fear when you voted on this resolution a resolution that would ensure that kir along with 133 other hostages remain in dark terot tunnels did you think about Noah gamani Noah's look of sheer horror as she violently separated from her boyfriend aino or and taken to Gaza on the back of a motor motorbike has become a symbol of the hostages plight in the heartwrenching video you can hear Noah screaming and pleading with the terrorists not to abduct her Noah's mother Leora born Chong Hong Le a Chinese Israeli citizen originally from Wuhan is terminally ill with stage four brain cancer all she asks is that she can hug Noah her only daughter one last time before she succumbs to her illness to my Chinese colleague I ask you in the name of Leora Chong Hong Lee rather than pushing for a harmful ceasefire which will keep Noah in Gaza I urge you pressure Kamas press Kamas to release Noah so that her mother can see Noah one last time before her death colleagues jihadists around the globe see that the body mandated to uphold International security is willing to allow murderous Hamas rapists to continue their reign of terror your calls for a ceasefire ow Hamas giving them hope to stay in power this does not ensure security it prevents it you truly want a ceasefire well Israel also wants a ceasefire your children are not the ones that are falling in battle against blood thir thirsty terrorists they are ours if Hamas survives it will be our children that Hamas will murder in Cold Blood again Israel seeks a ceasefire but there is only one formula that we are willing to accept all of our hostages must be released and Hamas must turn themsel in colleagues the Algerian resolution not only empowers jihadists by calling for a ceasefire it also fails again to condemn Kamas for their heinous crimes not condemning hamas's atrocities has now become a tradition here it's tragic Kamas Nazis invaded Israel deliberately murdering families raping women and girls and destroying everything they could get their hands on they are brutal terrorists who took pride in their barbarism yet not once not even once since October 7 has this Council or any un body condemned Hamas and their violence one day we mentioned history here when historians studied the reasons why the UN lost its standing and influence the inability of this organization to condemn terrorists that Slaughter children will be one of the driving factors mark my words but the impact of this council's decision spread much further than this room if this council is incapable of condemning Hamas un officials feel like they have further legitimacy to whitewash Hamas mere days ago under Secretary General Griffith stated that Hamas is not a terrorist group but a political movement is the intentional brutal murder of hundreds of civilians not terror is the systematic rape of women not terror is beheading and burning children alive not Terror we all know Hamas is a terrorist organization yet by staying silent in the face of hamas's crimes and not condemning them you allow such lies to perpetuate your politicized decision of Silence promotes the falsehoods that Kamas can be reasoned with that they are not the bloodthirsty terrorists that they are and this is the stance that the UN adopts and promotes condemn Kamas condemn Kamas as a councel condemn them their atrocities read their in this institution of its shame do it for the sake of those butchered for the sake of the hostages for the sake of morality and truth it's in your hands colleagues some of you have approached me and asked me why Israel is so critical of the UN and its agencies the recent event over the past weeks have hopefully hopefully made it clearer clearer to you one week ago special reporter albanez lously stated that the victims of October 7th were not murdered for their identity but in response to Israel's so-called oppression this is victim blaming and a clear justification of Terror but for some un employees even poisonous words are not enough dozens dozens of unra employees took active roles in the October 7th Massacre while many more praised The Savage attack F Ali musim naami of an anra social worker stuffed the body of Jonathan Jonathan Samano into a truck to be taken to Gaza aamas data center was located directly underneath anra headquarters in Gaza connected to an Ra's power supply and terot tunnels have been found running underneath various anra facilities schools everything out of anr's 1300 employees in Gaza 12% I repeat 12% are members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and at least 236 of them are active terrorists in these organizations armed Wings anra has been proven to be an instrument mental part of hamas's Terror machine which makes anr itself a terrorist organization yet rather than take responsibility for the weapon weaponization of this murderous UN agency commissioner General lazarini has chosen to say that he had no knowledge of hamas's hold on his own agency this is blatantly false Israel exposed terrot tunnels under unrest schools and supplied evidence of hamas's exploitation of anra you can see it in my Twitter account I personally sent letters to the commissioner General and the Secretary General we implored them for years to carry out a comprehensive search of all unra facilities in Gaza yet not only did they refuse they chose to bury their heads in the sand and ignore their reality this is why every report every statement or number provided by the un cannot be trusted in Gaza dear colleagues Hamas is the UN and the UN is Hamas distinguished council members this ostrich ostrich tactic bearing one's head in the sand is the modus operandi among un leadership yet no matter how deep one's head is buried it will not change the reality on the ground a terrorist is a terrorist a terror organization is a terror organization and a low abiding liberal democracy will remain as such even if here at the UN for political reasons light becomes darkness and day becomes night this is also the case with the escal escalating situation on Israel northern border with Lebanon for years and you heard it here for years Israel has called for this Council to impose the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 yet for years the UN has opted for the ostrich tactic tragically this is no longer a situation that can be ignored the clock is ticking it is not a matter of years but weeks before Israel will be forced to implement resolution 1701 ourselves just yesterday a kisala drone was downed while flying over the Sea of Galilee deep deep inside Israel over 2,000 kisala missiles and Rock ETS have rained down on the cities of Israel's North 2,000 and nearly 100,000 residents of Northern Israel have been displaced due to the threat posed by kisala with of course Iran's backing a ceasefire in Gaza is not only destructive for Israel and the Palestinians it also ensures that a blind eye is turned to what is unfolding in the rest of the region be the hooes Relentless attacks on Maritime trade pro-iran militias targeting even American Service members Oris bala's constant bombardment of Israel's North the clock is ticking and sadly we will be forced to take decisive action Terror will never be tolerated Madame President this Council must put politics aside for the sake of its mandate a ceasefire that allows Hamas to remain in power means ensured death and destruction ignoring hamas's atrocities and not condemning them means empowering terrorists worldwide and focusing only on Gaza while looking away from the terror aggression across the region will lead to a future that none of us seek the security Council must fulfill its mandate it must side with Israel against the forces of evil and it must face reality reality is not found when one's head is buried in the sand thank you Madame President I thank the representative of Israel for his statement I shall now give the floor Qatar statement on behal of the Arab of the counil country state Saud Arabia the United Arab and the kdom of aligned themselves with the statement to be delivered by the Arab group Madam president today's meeting is being held under extremely
