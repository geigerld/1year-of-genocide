Israeli troops have raided gaza's biggest Hospital the alifa hospital the site of a long standoff the Israel Defense Forces say that they were targeting Hamas militants and trying to avoid civilian casualties but Aid organizations are warning the fighting will worsen the already dire situation for patients and staff footage from the Gaza Ministry of Health appears to show the Frantic evacuation of patients after Israel launched its raid the Israeli Defense Forces said explosive devices were discovered and suspected terrorists killed in the action Israel says Hamas is directing quote terrorist activities from a command center beneath the hospital the UN estimates there are at least 2,300 people still in the hospital including patients staff and displaced Palestinians in recent weeks the IDF has publicly warned time and again that hamas's continued military use of shifa Hospital jeopard izes its protected status under the international law but the Palestinian Authority said Israel's raid was in flagrant violation of international law it never happened in anywhere in history that hospitals are targets what is happening in Gaza is a very obvious very clear War crime that Israel is committing against those who have been treated in the us Israel's raid Drew International condemnation the World Health Organization called it totally unacceptable while France said that Palestinians should not be made to pay for what it called hamas's crimes but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his troops that the raid was just the latest step on the road to his ultimate goal of eliminating Hamas they told us that we would not enter alifa we've entered and in this Spirit we say a simple thing there is no place in Gaza that we will not reach there is no hiding no shelter no refuge for the murderers of Hamas we will arrive and eliminate Hamas and return our hostages these are two sacred missions as Israel released footage of its forces apparently pushing further into Gaza the United States reiterated its concern for the safety of patients at alifa hospital but said it wouldn't address the specifics of an ongoing Israeli military operation alifa Hospital's head of surgery is Dr Marwan abusada and we spoke with him today by phone the connection was poor but the doctor was able to tell us about what he had seen during the Israeli raid last night at 2 p.m. at 2: a.m. in the morning the Israeli were invaded the of the xray department and they stay till this till this hour I think half an hour ago they left this building but I think they are still in hospital in other places in the in the in some buildings here but not in the surgical buildings during the St here they okay tried to inv some of the be there and they destructed the whole ex department they instructed the C scan and B even the building of the C scan and also the they distracted it and a lot of things like furniture they distracted but I think there's nothing to found there a lot of people they were in the door in that building this is the issue I think the city scan was exploded because the wall is damaged the wall of the wall of the building where the city scan is allocated is damage I think they did some sort of uh exposion and so on isra left one building but they didn't they did not leave the did not live leave the hos they didn't live or they didn't don't leave the hospital so this is still they are in some places of it is nonfunctioning place like a kitchen and another department which is not functioning and so they are still there and that was Dr marwin abusada alifa Hospital's head of surgery and again we apologize for the poor connection there I want to cross over now to Sophie fan she's a correspondent with Germany's domestic TV service Ard and she is reporting from Tel Aviv she has been following the events in this war sopie it's good to have you with us talk to me about the latest that we know from the hospital grounds tonight so as far as we know the Israeli military raid in asifa hospital the biggest Hospital in Gaza is still ongoing the Israeli military says it is a targeted and precise operation based on intelligence that Hamas is using the hospital for terrorist purposes we cannot independently verify this it is in general very hard to get information out of asifa hospital today it is hard to reach people we've heard from an eyewitness that there was a lot of confusion a lot of fear a lot of uh chaos as Israeli soldiers were entering the complex conducting searches and interrogating people on the ground and and Sophie has the IDF have they told us what their forces found inside the hospital during this incursion so according to the Israeli military they found weapons they found rifles body armor ammunition other military equipment and for the IDF the America uh the Israeli military this is an indication that the hospital was used by Hamas uh for for its own purposes we cannot verify any of this we cannot we don't have any access to these grounds at the moment the US government said yesterday already that they also have intelligence information pointing to that however they said today they did not sign off on this specific operation in alifa hospital and and do we know about the idf's next steps in this area the Israeli government and the Israeli Army have repeatedly said that the goal is to destroy Hamas militarily and politically and they've also repeatedly said that they assume that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure such as hospitals as command centers that they're building tunnels underneath so it is possible that we're going to see more raids in these kind of Institutions the question is also will Israeli Ground Forces at some point move South in the Gaza strip as it is very likely that hostages have been taken South and that Hamas militants have escaped South there are also rumors of a possible hostage deal uh 50 hostages uh 50 women and children in return for 5 days of ceasefire and Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons but we cannot confirm any of this Sophie fundan Ard correspondent reporting tonight from Tel Aviv Sophie we appreciate your reporting thank thank you when nearly 240 hostages taken during the Hamas attacks on October 7th are still in Gaza talks about freeing them continue relatives of the hostages have marched from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in an attempt to put pressure on the Israeli government to bring their loved ones home DW's Rebecca ritters reports tonight Red Cross do your job Red Cross do your job now we're on a major highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem these people behind me family members and Friends of some of the 240 hostages still being held in Gaza they started off yesterday they're making this 5day journey between Tel and Jerusalem to try to raise awareness for the pl of their loved ones you'll hear them calling Red Cross do your job un do your job they're angry at the Israeli government and at the inter commun they're frustrated but not enough is being done to bring home their loved ones we wait we wait we wait I hope it's okay you you don't eat you don't you don't sleep there is no day and night it's it's impossible I think they need to do and everybody needs to do whatever it needs in order to release this all kidnapped from Gaza if they are doing enough I'm not sure because they are still in Gaza 40 days now so obviously it's not enough not everyone here has a family member in Gaza but as the people here tell me there isn't a person in Israel who hasn't been affected by the events oer we don't feel that enough is being done in order to bring them home there are many other targets that netan and the government have uh selected and we don't feel that we are in the first priority the Marchers and an army of volunteer supporters will arrive in Jerusalem on Saturday night for protest outside Benjamin netanyahu's office bringing their message directly to the Israeli government the United Nations security Council has passed a resolution calling for Urgent extended humanitarian pauses in the fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip the resolution also calls for corridors throughout the strip to allow Aid to reach civilians and it urges the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas militants and other groups especially children it's the first resolution the council has managed to pass since the War Began more than a month ago the United States Russia and the UK abstained
