Egyptian State media is reporting significant progress toward a Gaza truce between Hamas mediators Qatar and the United States they have been holding talks in Cairo in the hope of securing a truce in the five-month war between Israel and Hamas which is seen as a terrorist organization by several Nations now us officials have said that Israel has broadly approved a deal meanwhile US vice president kamla Harris has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for at least the next 6 weeks her comments are the strongest by a us Administration official on Israel since the war started Harris is hosting Benny Gans on Monday a member of Israel's wartime cabinet and a political rival of President Benjamin Netanyahu gun will also be meeting with other us senior officials let's have a listen to what Harris had to say and given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next 6 weeks which is what is currently on the table this will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of Aid in and let's get more on that we are joined um by Kareem alahari who has the view right now from Cairo so you know we we're getting these reports in reports of significant progress this is at least what the Egyptian State media are saying what are you hearing well it's a first of all very very sketchy news we don't have any official statements we know that uh Hamas delegation Egyptian intelligence the Qatari mediators and US intelligence are sitting together in Cairo now we have the Egyptian State media reporting that there is significant progress without any further substance or details what this process process might entail but one of the problems yesterday one of the sticking points why the Israeli delegation did not show up in Cairo was that Israel demanded a list from Hamas about uh who is going to be released the names who is still alive who is injured who is dead they wanted to have more details about the hostages Hamas refuse to give this details they say this will be given when there will be finally a ceasefire the other thing which is also maybe important but also not confirmed is that from the Israeli media there are reports that the Israelis are now not any longer demanding this list and uh that they're demanding just the number of people the number of hostages who are still alive but very important all these reports are not really officially confirmed and we we're also getting reports at least this is what uh the United States is saying is that Israel has already agreed to a framework for a proposal and they are saying now that it's up to Hamas to respond to that proposal so um you know how do things now progress and move forward yes we know that all sides agree to the framework and the framework is a six we true truth and um they will set free about 40 Israeli hostages in exchange for the tenfold number of Palestinians in Israeli prisons we have about 9,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons many of them children 3,000 of them with without any formal trial so uh now one of the points that is point where they both sides are not agreeing is who is going to be released on the Palestinian side in exchange for the Israeli hostages Israel yesterday presented a list of Palestinians they are not willing to uh set free so I think that's one of the main discussion points in add addition to that Hamas is also asking for guarantees that this process of setting free more hostages and then later possibly even more should end up in a permanent ceasefire basically in the end of the war that is something Israel is not willing to accept and I think this is one of the main contradictions in this whole negotiations we have here two sides negotiating basically Israel is negotiating with Hamas who at the same time one of the formulated goals of this war is the destruction of Hamas and this is something of course that is decisive for all the decisions both sides make now within this negotiation process journalist kareim alahari in Cairo thank you you're
