the head of the United Nations says he is shocked at reaction to remarks that he made at the UN Security Council yesterday Antonio gutes says he clearly condemned the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks against Israel but in that speech he also described Israel's bombing of Gaza as quote Collective punishment of Palestinians I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council as if as if I was justifying acts of Terror by amas this is false it was the opposite in the beginning of my intervention yesterday I clearly stated and I quote I have condemned unequivocally the orfy and unprecedented 7 October acts of Terror by amas in Israel nothing can justify the Del liberate killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets end quote indeed I spoke of the Grievances of the Palestinian people and in doing so I also clearly stated and I quote that the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by amas end quote and then I went on with my intervention referring all my positions on all aspects of the Middle East crisis I believe it was necessary to set the record straight especially out of respect to the victims and to their families thank you well Israel's ambassador to the UN you may recall has called on the Secretary General to resign my colleague Phil Gail asked DW's Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem how the statements from gutes have been received inside Israel well we haven't had any reaction yet Phil of the the statement that you just heard from Antonio guz saying that he was shocked by Israel's reaction but there certainly was a flurry of reactions after he made those initial statements uh the Israel's you ambassador to the UN as you just mentioned calling on an anonio gues to step down saying he had no place to be making such remarks they also said that they want to block un worker visas for com un workers or un representatives from coming in to Israel and in fact the first Visa has been refused and Aid uh emergency aid coordinator had his Visa refused to come into Israel now we don't know exactly how far down the hierarchy such a Visa ban would would would be whether or not that will affect people who work here the many humanitarian Aid workers who are here for the US representing uh one of the the main body the the unra the main body that represents Palestinians in the Palestinian territories or not represents them sorry but looks after them um so you know we're not really sure exactly how far that will go but we're seeing that they are standing by their words having refused that first Visa uh and absolutely Furious he you know the the the Israeli Ambassador wasn't the only one to to be furious there were other people the chairman of Yad fem also uh expressing outrage by gish's comments but as heard there you terish feeling firmly that he's been misinterpreted well my first guest tonight is the US Diplomat David hell he is a former under Secretary of State for political Affairs he also served as the US ambassador to Pakistan Lebanon and Jordan Mr Ambassador it's good to have you with us tonight um let's talk about what's happening right now at the UN the UN Security Council appears unable to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza Israel is accusing the UN security or Secret Secretary General of justifying acts of Terror by Hamas I want to ask you as a diplomat how do you describe what is going on at the UN right now well it reminds me a little bit of the negotiations over a security Council ceas fire in 2006 between Israel and and uh and hisbah during the Lebanon war and uh you know what's important really isn't a piece of paper from the security Council calling for certain steps but actually whether the situation on the ground is going to provide an environment in which the parties can can somehow establish some stability and and and peace and we're not there yet um you know after the vicious attack by Hamas on innocent Israeli civilians uh it is unrealistic to expect that Israel is just simply going to accept a ceasefire they're going to need in their View and frankly I would say objectively uh it is true to reestablish the deterrence and reestablish their ability to defend their country and they're not there yet and how do you see this impacting the possibility of negotiating a full hostage release we know we're still talking about more than 200 people who are being held by Hamas yeah I mean this of course is separate from the security Council which which is pretty much irrelevant frankly to to that um we and Israel uh are working through cutar which has relations with Hamas and with Iran and they have been able to produce the releases that we've seen so far um my suspicion is that you know you'll see more releases uh but this is designed by Hamas to sort of uh tease out slowly one by one two by two um perhaps the most vulnerable hostages which is obviously relief to everyone to to see see them uh liberated but it's really part of a strategy to uh maneuver against Israel and to try to Forstall the land offensive that we all expect to see the ground offensive that we all expect to see in Gaza US President Biden today he called for a two-state solution also calling for settler violence to stop it sounds like a reiteration of standing US policy um what should we read into it today yeah that's right I mean no Administration has deviated from those basic principles although president Trump uh had a slightly different position he said whatever the part's going to agree to it's fine to make those statements it's fine to have those objectives the question really is what is the realistic path forward given the state of play since October 7 and even before October 7 to the two-state solution neither side Palestinian nor Israeli has really invested seriously in an effort to reach that outcome and their publics are cynical and skeptical frankly on both sides that there is a viable path to a two-state outcome how would you grade us credibility right now in the region there are those who point to US policy in the Middle East particularly with Israel and the Palestinians and say that you know the US has largely been missing now for the past 10 years um how credible is the us right now well I would I would challenge the statement that we've been missing we may not have been doing things that certain actors want us to do but the Abraham Accords was a major historic breakthrough uh in uh relations between Arab states Sunni Arab states and Israel so uh I I wouldn't accept that what has been missing is a realistic path toward resolving the issues that the Palestinians face and that's a long complicated story that I don't think we can tackle in a sound bite but again I you know personally was involved in much of this and uh at Key moments uh both sides ran away from opportunities the United States offered I don't think the US wants to ever walk away from being able to play a constructive role in bringing these parties together and establishing peace but we can't deliver things that those leaders themselves don't wish to achieve do you do you think there is some validity though to the statement that the US had had reduced or shifted it its focus in the last few years I mean we've talked a lot about the the pivot to Asia for US foreign policy and then you've also had the Russian invasion of Ukraine did the events on October 7th you know Force the United States to refocus on Israel and the Palestinians well I never liked the phrase the pivot uh obviously China is the significant geostrategic challenge for the United States but that's a global Challenge and it's not just about the Pacific important as it is that we re reprioritize and make sure that we have the military assets we need to deter an attack on Taiwan or and ensure the freedom of navigation in the South China Seas uh but the competition's global and it includes the Middle East we need to make sure China is not exploiting the situation and I'm also struck that all the parties in the Middle East at the moment of Crisis like this they look to Washington and they don't look elsewhere and finally our own interests are at stake our energy interests Global uh energy Market stability uh our friendship with Israel and with key Arab Partners our values uh anti-terrorism all of this is at stake in the Middle East we can't walk away from it and unfortunately if we try to we are reminded at moments like this that that's not an option before the events of October 7th the Biden administration had been clear in its criticisms of netanyahu's push to reform Israel's Judiciary Netanyahu was being called um at least not a friend of the system of checks and balances considering that is he now is he still a credible partner for the United States well he's the prime minister of Israel so we don't have it's not for us to choose I you know I've seen every president uh during BB netanyahu's tenure up close dealing with him and he's the Israeli Prime Minister American president's love to hate but he's elected time and time again he will face accountability after what's happened once this campaign is over and I suspect he's he's going to have some difficulties but it's not for us to choose and I was uncomfortable where wherever you stand on the judicial question in Israel I'm uncomfortable when I see American officials try to dictate to foreign officials in a democracy how to conduct their Affairs do you get the feeling that the Biden Administration Secretary of State Anthony blinkin that there has been an attempt somewhat to to at least set up guard rails for Israel to stay within considering what's going [Music] on well in my experience since Ronald Reagan and the siege of Beirut and the big blowups that he had with makim Bean most American presidents have tried to avoid being in a position of advising Israeli officials about uh military tactics uh it's up to Israel to defend itself we provide our friend the support they need but not dictating the T the the the military decisions that they have to make because we don't want to own them that's for them I do sense that President Biden is leaning a bit forward compared to the Past um and I think it's it's a responsible thing for an American president to ask questions particular you know what's next after this operation occurs as it appears to be the the plan for ground operation what's next uh what are the what's a realistic set of objectives for this campaign because we're together going to have to be dealing with a Fallout from it yeah I think a lot of people in the Middle East and on both sides of the Atlantic are posing that very question what is next Ambassador David hell Ambassador we appreciate your time in your analysis tonight thank you thank you very much good
