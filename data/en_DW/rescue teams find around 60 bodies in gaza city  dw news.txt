rescue teams have retrieved around 60 bodies from under the rubble in the shed Shaya neighborhood of Gaza City that's according to officials in the Hamas run territory gaza's Civil Defense Agency said the discovery came just hours after Israeli troops withdrew from the area images from the site showed the extent of the destru destruction residents told the AFP news agency that they returned to find nearly all their homes had been demolished Israel's military says it has now completed its two we mission in cheda and that its forces have moved on to other parts of Gaza City let's speak now to DW's senior International correspondent funny fcha who joins us now from Jerusalem funny tell us more about this about the Israeli offensive on Gaza City we have definitely seen A Renewed offensive by Israel this week in Gaza Gaza City specifically the people on the ground describe as one of the fiercest weaks in this entire war and that been going on for more than nine months in fact the war entered its 10 months just a few days ago and of course there is this lingering question why is there is there this focus on Gaza City because most parts of it at least that's the impression that Israel made a couple of months ago were deemed to be cleared of Hamas Hamas militants but Israel says that they need to dismantle the whatever the remaining capabilities of Hamas militants are in that region so that clearly indicates that possibly there's been a regrouping of Hamas militants and if there wasn't that there's still infrastructure in there like tunnels but any sort of infrastructure that helps them to communicate and finance the ongoing attacks also against Israel in Gaza Strip against Israeli soldiers and while this is going of course the question there is how should people all the hundreds of thousands who have returned to Gaza City now leave towards the South because they've been relocated over and over and again and this is obviously an active war zone funny outside of Gaza City the intense fighting across the strip is still continuing tell us a bit more about that exactly and this is very very important to mention that the fighting is not only in the north not only in in Gaza City but in in central Gaza in the in the South Rafa hunis Etc so we are speaking about more than two million people roughly two 2.1 million people who are on the Move pretty much for the past more than nine months and the question is really if you drop Lea Flats like Israel did on on Wednesday on the citizens of Gaza City urging them to leave declaring Gaza City a combat zone where they should go to and how should they leave we're not only talking about people who have been traumatized who are exhausted but we're also speaking about people who simply cannot leave about the elderly about children so all of that combined really leaves in fact a lot of Human Rights organizations at this point speechless they're struggling to find words to describe the devastating humanitarian situation on the ground while there is the the question what about the political implications of the renewed offensive in the north for example while also bombardment is ongoing in other parts of Gaza Strip am must militants have indicated and said that all the talks that are ongoing right now with regard to a potential ceasefire agreement or a framework toward it could be put back on Square One jeopardizing uh the entire talks that are currently ongoing yeah let's talk a bit more about that Fanny as you say ceasefire talks are ongoing is there any progress that's being made the very fact that Egyptian negotiators and Israeli negotiator negotiators are talking right now there speaking of course can be seen as a progress because talks are ongoing well they started in Doha and Qatar they are now in Egypt the key mediators obviously at Qatar and Egypt in this but obviously it's it remains to be seen what the results of the negotiations are and whether they're going to be in fact put into action that depends a lot on the trust of the people involved and the negotiators involved and specifically of Hamas militants and Israel involved has to be heard in the future we do not know yet tww senior International correspondent funny faar there in Jerusalem funny thank you
