00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.360
Can the International Court of&nbsp;
Justice stop the war in Gaza?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.760
The UN's top court will hear South Africa's&nbsp;
genocide case against Israel on January 11th.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.560
The initial hearing will likely focus on&nbsp;
South Africa arguing for an interim order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.480
asking Israel to "immediately suspend its&nbsp;
military operations in and against Gaza."

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.280
We asked three legal experts about the arguments&nbsp;
and what to expect in the coming weeks.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.000
Their main argument is that Israel is&nbsp;
committing genocide and is also failing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.360
to prevent genocide and also to prevent&nbsp;
the incitement to genocide. And that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.920
based on article nine of the Genocide&nbsp;
Convention, which gives jurisdiction to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.440
the International Court of Justice.
In its 84-page long application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.000
South Africa has provided details as to why&nbsp;
Israel's actions and omissions are genocidal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
in character because they're intended to&nbsp;
bring about the destruction of substantial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.520
part of the Palestinian national, racial and&nbsp;
ethnic group that is living in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp;

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.480
Israel has rejected these allegations&nbsp;
and called the South African case "a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.600
despicable and contemptuous exploitation"&nbsp;
of the ICJ. It also accused South Africa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:29.840
of "giving political and legal cover"&nbsp;
to the Oct. 7 terror attacks by Hamas.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.880
Israel says it's doing everything it can to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.240
avoid harming civilians â€“ while&nbsp;
Hamas uses them as human shields.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.160
So this is not like a criminal case or where&nbsp;
it's required proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.760
This is more like a higher risk probability&nbsp;
of genocide being committed or impending. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.600
South Africa has detailed the wrongful conduct&nbsp;
by Israeli authorities, and the genocidal intent.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.000
They have drawn from UN and other expert&nbsp;
reports as well as talking about the risk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.200
or the occurrence of genocide. They have looked&nbsp;
at the extensive destruction of Gaza. They have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.520
looked at the extensive killing of Palestinians&nbsp;
that has taken place, including predominantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.040
civilians, including, as we know, many,&nbsp;
many children that have been killed.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.240
And the genocidal intent can be&nbsp;
inferred both through the pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.160
of conduct of Israeli authorities, the&nbsp;
actions of the IDF in the Gaza Strip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.480
but also through statements that have been issued&nbsp;
by senior Israeli officials. And South Africa has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.760
provided a long list with examples of such&nbsp;
inflammatory and dehumanizing statements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.920
including by the Israeli prime minister,&nbsp;
the president, Ministry of Defense.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.680
And some of these statements&nbsp;
are open to interpretations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.280
that are consistent with genocidal intent.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.360
It's still, however, will be, I think, difficult&nbsp;
for South Africa to prove that these statements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.480
were actually translated into, uh, policy.&nbsp;
Especially since there have been also many other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.080
statements by many officials, including the some&nbsp;
of the same officials, which I have mentioned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.600
the highest leadership of government and&nbsp;
the IDF, that actually strongly rejected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.120
the insinuation that Israel is targeting, for&nbsp;
instance, Palestinian civilians, and have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:37.480
maintained that Israel is conducting its war&nbsp;
campaign within the confines of international law.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.080
There is a distinction in what the ICJ and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.360
ICC [International Criminal Court] do.&nbsp;
The ICJ deals with state responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.160
The ICC deals with individual criminal&nbsp;
responsibility. Their procedures are also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.036
separate. They operate separately. There&nbsp;
are two independent international courts.

00:03:53.036 --> 00:03:58.520
The ICC is already looking at,&nbsp;
uh, a host of allegations, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.760
relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp;
In fact, going back all the way to 2014. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.760
ICC prosecutor has already been to Israel&nbsp;
and to the Palestinian territories. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.920
and he and his team are looking into&nbsp;
that. I believe that for South Africa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:27.520
there was an interest to, uh,&nbsp;
in a way, expedite the process.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.720
Only the question of provisional measures, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.760
would be discussed. The court would have to&nbsp;
ascertain a, that it does have on its face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.040
jurisdiction to hear the case that the&nbsp;
claims made by South Africa are plausible.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.240
This is not the merits phase. The merits,&nbsp;
which is where the court if it gets that far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.000
would decide on whether or not Israel has&nbsp;
breached its obligations under the Genocide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.440
Convention. So this case is not there yet. It's&nbsp;
nowhere near that. And so the provisional measures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.640
that they [South Africa] have requested are&nbsp;
essentially around the idea of Israel suspending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.960
military operations in and against Gaza.
 
The facts on the ground and the statements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.600
by senior Israeli officials are damning enough for&nbsp;
[this] stage of the proceedings. And most likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.480
the court will indicate the provisional measures&nbsp;
along the lines requested by South Africa.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.520
So if a provisional measures order is issued&nbsp;
from the ICJ, then all of the other state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.040
parties to the Genocide Convention should be as&nbsp;
part of their obligations under that Convention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.480
pressuring Israel to comply with&nbsp;
that provisional measures order.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.480
In some cases, the court simply reiterated&nbsp;
the legal obligations of the parties, namely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.360
reminded the parties of their obligation not&nbsp;
to commit genocide. Since Israel is maintaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.160
that it is not practicing genocide, it would be&nbsp;
rather relatively straightforward for Israel to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.920
comply with a measure if it is formulated in that&nbsp;
sense. But there has been another genocide case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.280
in Russia versus, uh, Ukraine, sorry, versus&nbsp;
Russia, that was adjudicated last year, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.920
the court had ordered Russia to stop the war in&nbsp;
Ukraine. And there we have seen Russia effectively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.080
refuse to comply with, uh, those provisional&nbsp;
measures. So, if the court would order Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.720
for instance, to stop its military campaign&nbsp;
in Gaza, I would imagine that we will see a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:50.720
reaction that is probably closer to the reaction&nbsp;
that we have seen from Russia in that regard.
