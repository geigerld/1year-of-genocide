Israel's military says it has taken full control of the strip of land that serves as a buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt the Israeli military claims the Philadelphia Corridor provides a weapon smuggling route into Gaza for Hamas militants but it's also a key part of a delicate peace Arrangement between Israel and Egypt Israel has also deepened its incursion into Rafa in southern Gaza Israeli helicopters firing towards Rafa near the southernmost City in Gaza where Israel's military says it has seized control of a key stretch of land the 14 km Philadelphia Corridor that has long served as a buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt in recent days IDF forces have taken operational control of the Philadelphia Corridor along the border between Egypt and Rafa the Philadelphia Corridor served as an oxygen pipe for Hamas through which it regularly transits weapon to the gasa strope the capture of the corridor where Israel says its troops found these rocket launchers could complicate Israel's relations with Egypt Cairo has accused Israel of using the allegations of smuggling to justify legally occupying the stretch of land this latest development is also a signal of Israel's deepening of offensive in southern Gaza despite growing international calls for it to stop Israel's military Chief of Staff visited troops in Rafa assuring them they will push on we are here for a couple of reasons this is the last Hamas Brigade that remains with all its capabilities and we want to dismantle it Israel insists it needs to carry out the Raa operation to rescue the hostages Hamas took in the October s Terror attacks despite condemnation from allies and Aid groups alike as civilian casualties Mount Israeli bombardment in Rafa on Wednesday hit a building in the asalam neighborhood meanwhile the Hamas ran Health Ministry announced a death toll in the Gaza War had risen above 36,000 the problem is that that military operation has been conducted in such a way that the number of Civilian casualties and the destruction of Civilian infrastructure and housing are unprecedented and there's no end in sight Israel's National Security advisor says the offensive in Gaza is expected to go on for at least seven more months let's get some analysis now from Marina Miron she's from the War studies Department in King's College London good to see you Marina why does Israel say operations in Gaza will continue at least till the end of the year good morning well what we have to understand is that such operations are very complex and it's a very optimistic assessment that the operations will continue for at least 7 months I would be very cautious on naming a timeline in terms of when this operation might end because looking at history of counter Insurgency campaigns they can go on for decades and a military Victory doesn't necessarily mean that the war is over therefore I'm sure that it is sad for more political reasons to relieve some of the pressure on Israel rather than an accurate assessment of what might actually happen on the ground you said that it's mainly for political reasons and I'd like to sort of uh like you to potentially expand on that because I think military analysts around the world are generally saying that the stated aim of destroying Hamas cannot be done militarily so you are saying that this operation could continue even beyond the end of the year because it is primarily for political reasons is that correct well what I'm trying to say here is that a military defeat of Hamas in its present form and shap shape doesn't necessarily mean that Israel will be more secure and the reason for this being is that Hamas is not only a military organization it has an ideology so what is essentially happening is that the civilian casualties that are mounting in Gaza might be pushing the population that would have been neutral perhaps prior to this war to support Hamas and to carry on its ideology so in essence if you destroy militarily all of the Hamas Fighters you don't know how many of the civilian population of those um children whose parents have been killed will be joining to carry on the cause and it it will not be an immediate thing but there has to be a political plan for reconstruction of Gaza for ensure ensuring Law and Order In order to prevent it from happening and doesn't the Israeli military know this oh of course they know it but it's not the task of the military to solve political questions I think it's the task of the political leadership to ensure that there is a viable political end State military can do only so much and it has its set objectives however it is the political leadership that has to take care of that situation and I think the International Community has to also be involved in resolving this crisis that we're seeing anday Paving The Way Forward what is going to happen to Gaza once the military objective is achieved is there a way for Israel to achieve its military objectives at the same time as protecting civilians it is a very difficult task to protect civilians while also trying to destroy Hamas um one of the reasons being is that Hamas does live among the civilians they are not um wearing designated uniforms in many cases so it's very difficult to distinguish them from civilians the other problem is the problem of military necessity and proportionality when does military necessity eliminating say um key leaders of Hamas outweigh the collateral damage that it would cause among the civilians so you have a lot of ethical dilemas to solve what do you do do you cause a lot of damage but take out the main Hamas leadership or do you take it slow potentially risking more deaths over a long over a longer period of time and do it more surgically we'll leave with there for the moment thanks for joining us today Marina iron from the war studies department at Kings College London thank you for having me let's get more now from DW correspondent Rebecca rits in Jerusalem Rebecca why does Israel say operations in Gaza will continue at least till the end of the year Well bees Israel has maintained since the get-go since the very beginning of this war that its main military aim is to eliminate H Hamas now as we're seeing uh Israel hasn't managed to do that so far they're continuing uh to carry on that uh military aim in Rafa as you just heard in that report there and we're also seeing fighting resume in areas that had been officially cleared and confirmed uh you know that they had pulled out of in Central and Northern Gaza and Hamas are fighting a Guerilla Warfare many experts are in fact warning of what they say might be a forever War you know it's sort of like Insurgency style Warfare happening in Gaza that Israel won't be able to come back and say to the Israeli population we did it we eliminated Hamas and therefore uh we're inevitably going to see this war drag on that's certainly what experts are saying and of course we have the issue of the hostages there as you heard in that report and we've been talking about now for months Israel needing to also be able to come back bring the hostages back to the many people in Israel who are calling for that now of course you've also got the political angle Benjamin Netanyahu really fighting for his political survival and knowing that when such a time comes that the war ends he will have to face questions uh regarding how uh something like October 7 was able to happen under his watch he's been saying it's not fair it's not right uh to have to answer those questions as the war is ongoing and that that would come at the end of the war so there's little incentive on his part as well well to to try to bring this to a close but definitely the main aim is going to be because of this this you know desire or this stated claim that they're going to eliminate Hamas and bring back the hostages something that they haven't been able to achieve to this date and Rebecca how much consensus is there amongst Israelis about this ongoing offensive well since the very beginning again you know Israel most Israeli the majority of Israelis have been in support of this they see this as um inevitable they see this as as a must have they want to see Hamas eliminated and that threat they don't want to see another attack happen like what happened on October 7 all understandable they um you know there are of course voices within Israel a small amount of voices who who don't want to see this war continue that are calling for a ceasefire and a small but growing number of people who are calling for anything to be done in order for the hostages to to be able to brought back so they calling for you know any deal to be made with Hamas so that their loved ones can come home that's being spearheaded of course by the families of the hostages but that is a growing uh voice here but by and large overall we're seeing you know the support maintained for this for this conflict until uh Israel manages to meet that aim of eliminating Hamas but the media landscape here it should be said is very different the discussion in the mainstream media here isn't what we're seeing on International uh news and reading an international papers it's much more focused on the hostage situation and the threat of Hamas and and people certainly uh hoping that that Israel will be successful in meeting those aims and in the midst of all of this Rebecca the UN is warning of famine and is also saying that the amount of humanitarian Aid entering Gaza has dropped by 2third since Israel began this assault on Rafa this month what is the Israeli government saying about that well the Israeli government painted very different picture they say that a lot more Aid is getting in but the numbers the way that it's calculated varies the way that the UN calculates calculates it is different to how the Israelis do and the Israelis include the numbers coming through places like ashdod Port which is on the Israeli side that that's not including trucks that then actually enter into Israel so we're seeing a huge drop in the amount of Aid the UN saying have been warning for a very long time that famine is IM imminent and now we're seeing you know 50 trucks a day or 50 eight trucks a day I should say on average compared with nearly 180 before this May 7 incursion that is M far far fewer than the 500 to 600 trucks a day needed to Stave off uh the the humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding there we'll leave it there for the moment but thanks so much for joining us Rebecca RS in Jerusalem meanwhile Chinese president xiin ping has promised help for the Gaza Strip and spoken in favor of a peace conference saying the war cannot continue indefinitely at a meeting with with top representatives of Arab countries he indicated China's support for the creation of a Palestinian State China firmly supports the establishment of an independent state of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital it supports palestine's full membership in the UN and supports a more broad-based authoritative and effective International
