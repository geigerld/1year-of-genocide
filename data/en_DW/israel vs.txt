on October 7th Hamas terrorists used body cams and cell phones and posted footage of their atrocities on Tik Tok X and Facebook experts say their intention was maximum provocation if there's a strategy and I don't have a doubt that there is a strategy is is threefold number one show we don't have any limits you need to be really shocked you need to be feel terrorized and that's exactly what what's Terror all about Weeks Later leading Hamas members told the New York Times what the aim of filming and streaming their attacks was Hamas the Kasam and the resistance woke the world up from its deep sleep and showed that this issue must remain on the table I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders and that the Arab world will stand with us when Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas terrorists it's killed thousands of Palestinian civilians in the process the public perception of the conflict shifted images of the victims in Gaza dominated social media posts like these caused shock they also led to hundreds of angry comments and therefore were rewarded by the platform's algorithms and gained even more reach many of the elderly that we've seen that's exactly what Hamas also does on the one hand strengths Terror on the other hand and a drogy of victimization of their own population which cynically is used by Hamas the Israeli Army claims that Hamas Fighters have hidden command centers and hospitals in the Gaza Strip I want you to understand as proof it has published this video of what they say is the basement under the rantis hospital in the however Hamas officials and Hospital staff deny the existence of such centers they accuse Israel of targeting hospitals and committing genocide in [Music] Gaza for social media users both narratives are difficult to verify from the outside however they are spread widely this is playing a key role in the demonstrations around the world easily stoked emotion has led to outrage and in some cases CS for riots and attacks on Jewish institutions supporters of both sides have taken to the street worldwide with social media creating Echo Chambers the narratives from both sides are furthering The Divide between supporters of Palestinians and Israel thisinformation and fakes have also played a role in this propaganda War when Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a photo of a dead baby on NEX saying it was killed during the massacre some social media users as well as the Arabic broadcaster Al jazer claimed that the photo was an AI fake based on this picture of a puppy a later analysis with an image forensics tool showed that the puppy photo was in fact a fake but false claims are coming from both sides in this conflict when a rocket hit parts of the Al Ali Hospital in Gaza on October 17th the Israeli influencer hananya naftali initially wrote that the Army had struck a hidden terrorist base but the Israeli government then said that the misfired rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group was responsible for the incident but facts experts say are no longer needed to discredit an opponent online indeed you need to create at least doubt if those emotional videos address already existing prejudices and and already existing emotions they work very well fakes rumors and misinformation like the false claim that an Israeli helicopter shot the Nova Festival goers are often believed by social media users they are simply too much content and sources for people to check everything they see never trust one single Source even if it's as credible as possible don't trust anything which is immediately drastic and emotional always try to get a second opinion Instagram Tik Tok X and other platforms have become political battle arenas especially in terms of narratives imagine being a refugee in your own country spending your entire life in a cage being able to assess content on social media and putting it into context is now more important than ever especially since not just governments but also Terror groups like Hamas are exploiting the potential of social
