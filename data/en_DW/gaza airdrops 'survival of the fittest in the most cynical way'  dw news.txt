the US says it will continue parachuting Aid into Gaza despite a plea by Hamas to stop the practice the militant group says people have died while trying to collect food packages parts of Gaza are facing famine nearly 6 months into mil Israel's military campaign they are triggered by the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks sin like this are quickly becoming another Grim feature of the war in Gaza humanitarian Aid dropped from an aircraft over the territory this time it falls in the Mediterranean well of shore making the civilians on the ground even more desperate we were waiting for the aid when we were surprised to see the plane coming and dropping it into the sea people were swimming to retrieve the aid but didn't survive Hamas appointed Health officials say at least 12 people drowned this week trying to reach aird dropped packages another six people were killed in stampedes the group is urging that air drops be stopped a plea supported by many gazin in terms of the aid one of the biggest mistakes is that it's dropped in dangerous places like the sea some of the people trying to get the aid have drowned the problem is simple they need to bring it through the crossings so it can reach these poor people pressure has been growing on Israel to help speed up Aid deliveries through the border crossings into Gaza with the UN warning the territory is on the verge of a man-made famine you cannot claim to adhere to these International provisions of law when you block un unwa food convoys when you just last week denied five missions to the north when we have now reports of Israeli attacks on warehouses and the police that are supposed to help secure this Aid inside Gaza the UN also criticized claims by some Israeli officials refuting reports of an imminent famine I say it and I will say it again as much as I know there is no starvation in Gaza as a groups are desperate to bring more food into Gaza the US says it will keep parachuting Aid into the territory Washington insists the air drops are just one of the channels for Aid deliveries and that they should continue I'm not joining to by Christian lint he's a spokesperson for the World Health Organization and joins me from Geneva Christian we heard people absolutely desperate for food paint as a picture of what's happening right now there in the Gaza Strip yeah thanks for having me god well this is unfortunate exactly uh the scenario um that everywhere um in the middle in the North in the South people are desperate uh the food is lacking the fresh water is lacking I think yesterday AA said again that right now the ailable maximum for a person uh per person is two to three or less than three lers of fresh waters per day and that's not pure drinking water that's just water for everything including cooking and you know the the rule by thumb is you need about three liters of drinking water per day only drinking water so that's that and Medical Aid is is missing evacuation missions to the north uh are have often been denied literally half an hour ago I got the message that another uh Convoy which we had planned for evacuating um critically injured people from the um patients from the shifa hospital was denied again so there's desperation everywhere uh from the food from the medical supplies from the Sheltering from the lack of space to go if you look at ruer a place of more than a million people now squeezed together in the tightest always waiting for the offensive that has been announced for so long and with no place to go now Hamas has asked uh the US and others to stop the air drops but wouldn't that make the humanitarian situation worse let's look at two parts here every single piece of bread every single piece of medical equipment every wound dressing every liter of water is urgently needed so in that sense of course an airdrop uh is a little Aid to what's going on but the amount of Aid that can be dropped in by air or by the famous uh boat delivery I think the boat delivery was about 200 tons of food put that into comparison of a truck a single truck can carry about 20 tons of foods so you with only 10 trucks you have that big announced uh delivery of of a ship transport for example solved the air drops are extremely critical one as you see in your in your uh commentary here in the in the pictures they drop somewhere either on land or on sea people Rush uh people drown and on top of it it's a rush of the healthy ones let's not forget that so those who get to get these these Aid packages are those who are the most fit and the most well in healthy conditions stable ones the ones sitting in or lying in hospitals in shelters the elderly the weak they will never get to these deliveries and they are the ones who need it the most so it's a it's a survival of the fittest in the most cynical way um again an air drop can be a little middle point of relief in a very specified situation can be useful but what we need here is steady access safe sustainable access with convoys from the north from the south from the middle constantly and that will relieve a little bit what's going on there uh you touched upon uh this a bit earlier but let's talk about the health infrastructure uh briefly how is the situation now and how are people getting any basic healthare yeah it's it's a desperate situation and then the word desperate is so overstretched already because we have since months we're describing the uh the health situation as desperate and it's getting worse by the day if no by the hour um so we have very few hospitals working anymore in in terms of partially working delivering some Aid uh we have a few hospitals in the north we have a few health centers in and hospitals in the South but also with very limited capacity the big uh centers for health used to be the ones in the north the big with many operation theaters with the Specialties for for injuries or diseases and most of this is out of function the Laboratories are out of function so people get help well if they reach an a health care center they can get some basic help very often on Tre being treated on the floors next to people who are Sheltering in the the hospitals under totally unhygienic conditions um very often with the B lack of the basic medical equipment or the basic medical supplies um operations and even amputations having to be taken um without any anesthesia an aesthetic material so really really desperate and again those who make it to the hospitals or to the health centers are even the lucky ones because they made it there ambulances very often can't get out anym of the people to help them those injured or sick or anything cannot even reach the the the the shelters or the hospital so again the ones who make it to the hospitals are actually the lucky ones and that's again a very cynical comment chrisan lar they have the World Health Organization joining us from Geneva thank you very much thank you oh let's bring in hea Tibi who is the West Bank and Gaza country director for the eight agency Care International based in ramala he the US says it will continue parachuting Aid into Gaza Hamas wants the practice to stop where do you stand and is there an alternative to airdrops um thank you so much for the question uh unfortunately as we have seen over the last days over the last weeks the report that was announced indicating that almost half of Gaza is under catastrophic situation and a lot are already uh uh identified under the famine uh category C category number five uh the the the problem with what we have seen in this report is the scale and the speed of deterioration in the situation and we have seen that the numbers doubled in the last four me four weeks because of the lack of access of food into Gaza is air dropping is the best way it's not it is Saving Lives if if any any food that is entering Gaza is saving lives but it is not the best way to to facilitate Aid into Gaza um as you have seen as we have seen now in your report it's not safe to get it it is it is not equally accessed it is not guaranteed where it will be dropped and unfortunately it it is connected over the last weeks we have seen for different reasons it is connected with with dangerous life uh um life issues so people are losing their life to access it the alternative is to open the border with consistent amount of Aid uh uh that is entering all of Gaza um enough one enabling environment to facilitate the distribution to reach to those who are in most need and most vulnerable ones including elderly people with disabilities and women in the north and in the South now the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian Affairs has made some very specific accusations against Israel alleging it is blocking food convoys and is also said that there are reports that Israel is attacking warehouses where AID may be stored does your organization have any information about that unfortunately our mandate does not F does not fall into the information seeking or confirming this piece of information but what I can share with you is that for instance what we are having in care is that we have delays in in h um in the process the lengthy process that is taking time in terms of uh uh checking the convoys that we are sending we don't have access to the north so most of our work is done in the South and even to less extent in the Central Area uh the unsafe environment makes it very difficult for us to distribute it in a more um in a more relaxed way if I can say more uh uh uh equality related way the also the third point that I can share and confirm with you that the break of Law and Order and the for different reasons makes it very different very difficult for the organizations to receive the eight convoys and store it so we try to distribute it as quick as possible so that we make sure that our our our uh convoys content is distributed rather than being and lost in the in the storage he T there K International's country director for the West Bank in Gaza thank you very
