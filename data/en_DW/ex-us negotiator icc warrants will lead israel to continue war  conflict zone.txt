The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal&nbsp; Court has said he’s seeking arrest warrants&nbsp;&nbsp; for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister&nbsp; Netanyahu, for their conduct of the war in Gaza. Israeli politicians across the&nbsp; spectrum have condemned the move.&nbsp; The prosecutor has also applied for&nbsp; warrants for key leaders of Hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp; widely designated a terrorist organization. My guest this week from Tel Aviv is Dennis Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp; former special assistant to President Barack&nbsp; Obama, and for more than 12 years a key player&nbsp;&nbsp; in shaping US policy in the Middle East.&nbsp; He’s not optimistic about what he sees now. I can tell you this is worse between&nbsp; Israelis and Palestinians than at any&nbsp;&nbsp; point on which I worked on this issue,&nbsp; including during the Second Intifada. The ICC’s announcement comes at&nbsp; a time when Israel’s human rights&nbsp;&nbsp; record is under minute scrutiny, with&nbsp; investigations by major media outlets&nbsp;&nbsp; into violence by Jewish settlers.&nbsp; Can a Palestinian state ever emerge&nbsp;&nbsp; from so much conflict and hatred?  Good to be with you. Let's start with the announcement from&nbsp; the chief prosecutor at the International&nbsp;&nbsp; Criminal Court. Arrest warrants have never&nbsp; been sought before for Israeli leaders,&nbsp;&nbsp; and there's a storm of protest&nbsp; not only from those named,&nbsp;&nbsp; but from across all political factions in&nbsp; Israel. What effect do you think that this&nbsp;&nbsp; will have on Israel's conduct of the war if the&nbsp; warrants are approved by pre-trial judges?  I don't think it'll have a positive effect. I&nbsp; think it creates in the minds of most Israelis&nbsp;&nbsp; across the political spectrum, that a moral&nbsp; equivalence is being established between&nbsp;&nbsp; those who came in with the expressed purpose of&nbsp; deliberately killing innocents, kidnapping people&nbsp;&nbsp; as young as nine months old, raping, just engaging&nbsp; in unspeakable violence, brutality, and in a very&nbsp;&nbsp; deliberate, determined way. And you're creating,&nbsp; in a sense you're saying, you're treating them the&nbsp;&nbsp; same as you're effectively treating the leaders&nbsp; of a state who are responding to this kind of an&nbsp;&nbsp; assault. There certainly are issues that I think&nbsp; the prosecution is raising about the way the&nbsp;&nbsp; Israelis have conducted the war. But most Israelis&nbsp; will see this as creating a moral equivalence&nbsp;&nbsp; where there is none. And I, in the absence of&nbsp; that I think in terms of most Israelis will be&nbsp;&nbsp; that they need to, they need to prosecute the war&nbsp; and try to ensure that they've defeated Hamas in a&nbsp;&nbsp; way. Because in a sense they're going to fear that&nbsp; under no circumstances will they ever be seen as&nbsp;&nbsp; being justified in terms of defending themselves&nbsp; against these kinds of attacks. Whether that's&nbsp;&nbsp; a correct perception [that] should exist or not.&nbsp; That is the perception I'm afraid will exist here. To be fair to the prosecutor, he didn't suggest&nbsp; there was any moral equivalence. On the contrary,&nbsp;&nbsp; he, the way that it's being explained by him and&nbsp; by his officials, is that if evidence is brought&nbsp;&nbsp; to him, prima facie evidence is brought to him.&nbsp; of crimes committed on both sides of a conflict,&nbsp;&nbsp; he has a duty to act and to pursue that evidence.&nbsp; And this is one way in which he's doing it,&nbsp;&nbsp; by seeking arrest warrants for those who have been&nbsp; named. What other choice did he actually have? Well, I think there is an interesting question&nbsp; here in terms of timing because there was an&nbsp;&nbsp; expectation he was going to visit Israel and&nbsp; have discussions prior to coming out with this&nbsp;&nbsp; and obviously he did not do that. It does strike&nbsp; me that it might have been, again, just from a&nbsp;&nbsp; practical, pragmatic standpoint, it might have&nbsp; made more sense to be here in advance before he&nbsp;&nbsp; issued these, but obviously he chose not to do&nbsp; that. There's the panel he has is, I have to say&nbsp;&nbsp; is a serious panel. I think the problem however&nbsp; is I'm suggesting is by not having come here&nbsp;&nbsp; before releasing this, I think it contributed to&nbsp; the kind of very broad reaction, you have people&nbsp;&nbsp; who are extremely critical of Prime Minister&nbsp; Netanyahu who are also quite critical of this.&nbsp;&nbsp; So a little bit more could have been done to set&nbsp; the stage I suspect, but we are where we are. If these very serious charges are not to be&nbsp; tested by the ICC, where else would they be heard? Again, it's not, it's not clear, but I think&nbsp; there's a larger issue here that ought to be&nbsp;&nbsp; kept in mind. And that is when you fight an enemy&nbsp; that deliberately uses its civilian population not&nbsp;&nbsp; just as a shield but really as a hostage, and&nbsp; you're put in a position where, what are the&nbsp;&nbsp; choices you have, not to go after them, given&nbsp; what is going to be the civilian consequence&nbsp;&nbsp; and therefore face this again or go after them and&nbsp; unfortunately, there isn't going to be a civilian&nbsp;&nbsp; consequence. Now, I will grant one of the things&nbsp; that the Israelis should have done. I've made an&nbsp;&nbsp; argument for this from the very beginning of the&nbsp; war. They should have been much more forthcoming&nbsp;&nbsp; with humanitarian assistance. They should have&nbsp; gone out of their way to demonstrate this was an&nbsp;&nbsp; effort to, an imperative to defeat Hamas and not&nbsp; to punish the Palestinians who live in Gaza. And&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel did not act in that way, and it made it&nbsp; easier for those to portray what they're doing&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way that is outside of what, outside the&nbsp; bounds of acceptability. But is again the reality&nbsp;&nbsp; is Israel was faced with a very cruel dilemma.&nbsp; You have an enemy that carries not one width&nbsp;&nbsp; for the well-being of its own public, is&nbsp; quite ready to expose them, doesn't mind&nbsp;&nbsp; if Israel kills a lot of Palestinians,&nbsp; in fact seems to relish that prospect. But this is what you what you seem to be outlining&nbsp;&nbsp; is that this is a watershed moment&nbsp; for international justice, isn't it? I really do think there's a question here&nbsp; about how we, we may have to redefine&nbsp;&nbsp; international humanitarian law. I mean on&nbsp; the one hand you still have an obligation to&nbsp;&nbsp; try to minimize the casualties to civilian&nbsp; non-combatants. That's an obligation that&nbsp;&nbsp; shouldn't change. But how the tactics you can&nbsp; use, how you go about doing that. How do you&nbsp;&nbsp; create in a clear distinction between those who&nbsp; are using human shields as a deliberate tactic&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who have to contend with that. I&nbsp; do think this is an issue that we're long&nbsp;&nbsp; overdue trying to come to grips with how we&nbsp; can better define international humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp; law given these kinds of non-state actors and&nbsp; given their, the tactics that they employ. Whatever system that you want to work towards&nbsp; or you think that the international community&nbsp;&nbsp; should work towards to provide some&nbsp; kind of justice in situations like this,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're not going to be able to live in a world&nbsp; where accountability is reserved for enemies,&nbsp;&nbsp; not friends. Isn't that the question that Gaza&nbsp; is forcing everyone to consider, in its essence? Well, I think, it is, at least in part. But I&nbsp; don't think it's coming to grips with the question&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been posing which is what is a legitimate&nbsp; strategy for trying to root out an enemy,&nbsp;&nbsp; a non-state actor, as it seems - if you're going&nbsp; to have to have international humanitarian law,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can't simply be one which says, ok you're&nbsp; entitled to strike back, but you have to minimize&nbsp;&nbsp; civilian casualties. What if it turns out that&nbsp; the choice for minimizing civilian casualties is&nbsp;&nbsp; quite limited. I mean there is something else that&nbsp; could have been done. Something else that could&nbsp;&nbsp; have been done is in a situation like this, maybe&nbsp; international humanitarian law should say there&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to be a period and there need to be areas&nbsp; where people can be evacuated so they're not, as,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not as shields. I mean what separates,&nbsp; for example, how the United States approached&nbsp;&nbsp; Fallujah is that the people who lived in&nbsp; Fallujah were actually allowed to leave. In Iraq. In Iraq. In Iraq, yes, they were allowed to leave. They&nbsp; could, they could leave the city. The problem&nbsp;&nbsp; here in Gaza, because it's so small, that they're&nbsp; not allowed to leave, what one finds in every war&nbsp;&nbsp; zone is that people leave. And look at Syria.&nbsp; About five and a half million people left, fled&nbsp;&nbsp; Syria. It wasn't a simple thing to do,&nbsp; but five and a half million people left,&nbsp;&nbsp; left Syria. In Gaza, the people are not allowed&nbsp; to leave. So one of the, I think one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; challenges for international humanitarian law&nbsp; is to be able to come up with if you're trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to protect the well-being of civilians, which is&nbsp; a, it's not just a moral imperative, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a moral imperative. It should be a political&nbsp; imperative as well. But then one of the things you&nbsp;&nbsp; have to come up with is strategies for evacuation&nbsp; that the international community can facilitate&nbsp;&nbsp; as a way of ensuring that if a war is being&nbsp; fought against those who are using human shields,&nbsp;&nbsp; at least the international community is&nbsp; doing everything it can, not just in terms&nbsp;&nbsp; of providing humanitarian assistance, but in&nbsp; terms of getting them out of harm's way.  It hasn't been helped, the situation, has it, by&nbsp; the fact that some of the reporting about Israel's&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior by the administration in the [United]&nbsp; States has been contradictory. On May the 10th,&nbsp;&nbsp; the State Department wrote to Congress with its&nbsp; most detailed assessment of Israel's conduct,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it concluded that Israel had most likely&nbsp; violated international standards in failing&nbsp;&nbsp; to protect civilians in Gaza, but saying at the&nbsp; same time it had not found specific instances&nbsp;&nbsp; that would justify cutting military aid. The&nbsp; department was immediately accused of a fudge,&nbsp;&nbsp; Democratic Senator Chris Van Holland told&nbsp; reporters “if this conduct complies with&nbsp;&nbsp; international standards, then God help&nbsp; us all”. He has a point, doesn't he? Well, he does, but I guess I keep coming&nbsp; back to the issue of international&nbsp;&nbsp; standards. The international standards&nbsp; have not adjusted to a reality where you&nbsp;&nbsp; have an enemy that uses human shields.&nbsp; So we end up judging the actor who has&nbsp;&nbsp; been attacked as they then try to root&nbsp; out those who are using human shields. But how do you explain the apparent contradictions&nbsp; in the State Department report, on the one handed&nbsp;&nbsp; concludes that both action and inaction by&nbsp; Israel had slowed the flow of aid into Gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp; But on the other, it says “we don't currently&nbsp; assess the Israeli government is prohibiting&nbsp;&nbsp; or otherwise restricting the transport or&nbsp; delivery of US humanitarian assistance into&nbsp;&nbsp; the area.” In other words, slowing the aid&nbsp; flow is not restricting it. Of course it is. Look, I think what you what you have is that you&nbsp; have really, I think you're raising two different&nbsp;&nbsp; kinds of issues. One issue has to do with the use&nbsp; of weapons. That's what you were first raising.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the second thing you're raising is the issue&nbsp; of the permission of humanitarian assistance to&nbsp;&nbsp; go in in the quantities that it should have&nbsp; been permitted. On the former, I think what&nbsp;&nbsp; the State Department was finding was that they&nbsp; were looking at the totality of the people,&nbsp;&nbsp; the numbers of people killed and said almost by&nbsp; definition, we draw a conclusion that this must&nbsp;&nbsp; have been done, force must have been done in a way&nbsp; inconsistent with international humanitarian law.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, we don't have specific&nbsp; instances of what that was done. I can understand&nbsp;&nbsp; that duality. The other issue you’re raising about&nbsp; the permission, the provision of international,&nbsp;&nbsp; of humanitarian assistance, I share that view. The&nbsp; fact that it is not popular here with the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp; body politic who have suffered greatly from&nbsp; October 7th and who every day see what Hamas&nbsp;&nbsp; is doing by holding hostages, increasing numbers&nbsp; of them no longer being alive and there the body&nbsp;&nbsp; politic here is not feeling very sympathetic&nbsp; to the Gazan population who they see somehow&nbsp;&nbsp; being in league with Hamas. My own view is&nbsp; the Gazan population is the victim of Hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp; not in league with Hamas and Israel's&nbsp; approach to the war needed to separate&nbsp;&nbsp; Hamas from the population of Gaza. of US-Israel relations. Are they now as bad as&nbsp; you've known it during the course of your career? I think it's... We're certainly at a low&nbsp; point, but I wonder how much it's US-Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; and [how much] it's just the leadership. I do&nbsp; think that there is enormous frustration with&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister Netanyahu. I don't think&nbsp; that extends necessarily to all Israelis&nbsp;&nbsp; and not necessarily even to everyone in the&nbsp; current government. But I do think there is&nbsp;&nbsp; growing frustration with him. President Biden,&nbsp; who's always had a good relationship with him,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think has become very frustrated for a&nbsp; variety of reasons. One is on a number of&nbsp;&nbsp; occasions Prime Minister Netanyahu has&nbsp; made promises to him and not fulfilled&nbsp;&nbsp; those promises. And I think that has contributed&nbsp; greatly to the frustration that he feels. Do I&nbsp;&nbsp; think this is something that can be overcome&nbsp; at least between the US and Israel? Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; because I don't see this necessarily as extending&nbsp; to the two countries right now. I think there's&nbsp;&nbsp; a problem between the two leaderships.&nbsp; We'll have to see how that plays out. On the limiting of weapons supplies to&nbsp; Israel, you called it a mistake, what&nbsp;&nbsp; the administration had done, saying it took all&nbsp; the pressure off the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar,&nbsp;&nbsp; and pressure on him was the key to a&nbsp; hostage deal. But President Biden is&nbsp;&nbsp; someone who's all but accused Israelis of&nbsp; war crimes by saying they've been bombing&nbsp;&nbsp; indiscriminately. If he goes on giving them&nbsp; those same American bombs to continue that&nbsp;&nbsp; indiscriminate bombing, it makes him&nbsp; look weak, doesn't it? And complicit. Well, I think, you know, you can, I think you can&nbsp; kind of present this however you choose to present&nbsp;&nbsp; it. The fact is, I think he's trying to strike a&nbsp; balance. He wants an outcome where Hamas, who not&nbsp;&nbsp; only committed terrible atrocities on October 7th,&nbsp; but continues to do it with the way it brutalizes&nbsp;&nbsp; the hostages that it holds. There's almost seems&nbsp; to be kind of international indifference to&nbsp;&nbsp; what Hamas is doing to the hostages. Obviously&nbsp; there's not that indifference here in Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp; where for all the families, their life was frozen&nbsp; on October 7th. In the case of President Biden,&nbsp;&nbsp; he wants to be sure the outcome is an outcome&nbsp; where Hamas is no longer in control of Gaza,&nbsp;&nbsp; where Gaza can no longer be a platform for&nbsp; attacks against Israel. And he's trying to&nbsp;&nbsp; strike a balance between how do you achieve that&nbsp; objective and at the same time conduct the war in&nbsp;&nbsp; a way that tries to minimize the level of damage&nbsp; and destruction done to the Palestinians who live&nbsp;&nbsp; in Gaza. It's a very hard, very hard balance to&nbsp; strike. One can, one can try to be pure in one&nbsp;&nbsp; direction or the other but then you're not going&nbsp; to achieve what is the most important objective.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think the, it's very important to find a&nbsp; way to end this war, but this war also needs to&nbsp;&nbsp; end in a way where Hamas is not in a position&nbsp; where it has any possibility of recouping. Another reason surely for withholding weapons to&nbsp; Israel is that American taxpayers are funding an&nbsp;&nbsp; Israeli offensive that the majority of them&nbsp; now appear to be against. Some of the latest&nbsp;&nbsp; polls show 55% of Americans against 36% who&nbsp; support Israel's conduct of the war. Don't&nbsp;&nbsp; you think that the prospect is pretty worrying&nbsp; for the Biden administration six months away&nbsp;&nbsp; from a presidential election? Is&nbsp; that one of their calculations? I'm sure, all the things being equal, [if]&nbsp; you're the president of the United States,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in an election year, this is an&nbsp; issue that almost by definition is not&nbsp;&nbsp; helpful. So you would undoubtedly like to&nbsp; see this over as soon as possible and while,&nbsp;&nbsp; and yet at the same time, while the president&nbsp; wants to see this over as soon as possible,&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't want an outcome where somehow Hamas is&nbsp; able to recoup and re-establish itself. If it is,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is not the last time we'll see this. Hamas&nbsp; has shown not the slightest bit of interest in&nbsp;&nbsp; developing Gaza, not the slightest bit of interest&nbsp; in doing and providing well for the well-being of&nbsp;&nbsp; its own public. It built 400 miles of tunnels&nbsp; underground. All the materials that it did and&nbsp;&nbsp; it used in in building those tunnels, all the&nbsp; materials that it used in building a military&nbsp;&nbsp; industrial base underground, all that could&nbsp; have been used on the surface to advance Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp; and the well-being of the people there, it did&nbsp; none of that. And if it had a chance, it would&nbsp;&nbsp; do this all over again. So you understand, of&nbsp; course the president wants this over. It would&nbsp;&nbsp; be much better for the president, especially&nbsp; in an election year, if this was no longer an&nbsp;&nbsp; issue. But he doesn't want it over in a way where&nbsp; Hamas can do this again or it can reconstitute&nbsp;&nbsp; itself and subject everybody, Palestinians and&nbsp; Israelis alike, to another round like this. This is also a time when Israel's human&nbsp; rights record has been under some of&nbsp;&nbsp; the most intense scrutiny, not least&nbsp; because of multiple cases of settler&nbsp;&nbsp; violence against Palestinians in the West&nbsp; Bank. How concerned are you again that,&nbsp;&nbsp; despite repeated international warnings about&nbsp; that, very little has been done to curb it? Well, look, I think one of the challenges&nbsp; again with this Israeli government, you have&nbsp;&nbsp; a couple of very extreme ministers, one of whom&nbsp; is the Minister of National Security, Ben-Gvir,&nbsp;&nbsp; and he often imes looks like he turns a blind eye&nbsp; to what extremist settlers do. Israel presents&nbsp;&nbsp; itself as a rule of law, and it has to act that&nbsp; way. And with many of the extremist settlers,&nbsp;&nbsp; including those right now who are trying to block&nbsp; deliveries of assistance to Gaza. The law needs&nbsp;&nbsp; to be enforced on them. There needs to be&nbsp; more demonstration of that and if there isn't,&nbsp;&nbsp; the administration is right to single out&nbsp; and sanction some of those individuals. A year-long investigation by the New&nbsp; York Times, published in recent days,&nbsp;&nbsp; claims to reveal how violent factions inside&nbsp; the settler movement have been protected and&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes abetted by the Israeli government&nbsp; and now pose a grave threat to Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp; in the occupied territories. We found the Times&nbsp; said "a government shaken by an internal war,&nbsp;&nbsp; burying reports it commissioned, neutering&nbsp; investigations it assigned and silencing&nbsp;&nbsp; whistleblowers, some of them senior&nbsp; officials”. Did you know about this?  I did not. Does any of it surprise you? Over the years, I've always had a sense&nbsp; that there was some protection. One of the&nbsp;&nbsp; things that always was troubling is that it was&nbsp; very hard to ever find the exact expenditures&nbsp;&nbsp; on the whole settlement enterprise, as if the&nbsp; Israeli government knew if it was exposed,&nbsp;&nbsp; it would actually produce a reaction&nbsp; within Israel. So I'm not surprised&nbsp;&nbsp; at one level. The scope of it,&nbsp; I have to say is surprising. Mr. Ross, on the ground in Gaza, heavy fighting&nbsp; around the southern city of Rafah despite the&nbsp;&nbsp; strongest possible warnings from the US, has&nbsp; Israel stopped listening to the White House?&nbsp;&nbsp; The Biden administration said multiple&nbsp; times it wanted to see a credible plan&nbsp;&nbsp; for safeguarding civilians if the Rafah&nbsp; offensive went ahead. By May the 15th,&nbsp;&nbsp; at least, it was still saying it hadn't seen&nbsp; such a plan. Is there anywhere a red line&nbsp;&nbsp; which in the, which under no circumstances Israel&nbsp; would be allowed to cross by the administration? I think that the president has made that&nbsp; clear that if they go into Rafah City,&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a red line that's been crossed&nbsp; without a credible evacuation plan. With consequences. There would be consequences? That's right. Well, there, Israel is operating&nbsp; all around Rafah, but not within Rafah City. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; and right now about 800,000 people actually&nbsp; have left. You still leave probably another 5&nbsp;&nbsp; to 600,000 who are there. So they're still not&nbsp; in the city. I think for the administration,&nbsp;&nbsp; if they were to go into the city, there would be&nbsp; consequences. I think the president, President&nbsp;&nbsp; Biden is someone who when he says something,&nbsp; he tends to mean it. So I suspect, and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the reasons I suspect the Israelis have&nbsp; not gone in, is because that is something that&nbsp;&nbsp; they understand is going to trigger a response and&nbsp; with a price that they probably don't want to pay. The Israeli Prime Minister has made it clear&nbsp; that the prize of a Palestinian state is not&nbsp;&nbsp; on offer to the Palestinians, particularly&nbsp; after what Hamas has done. Is there any way&nbsp;&nbsp; that a Palestinian state can, in your&nbsp; view, emerge from all this conflict?  Well, not in the near term. First of all, the&nbsp; Palestinians are divided between the West Bank and&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaza. You're going to have to politically reunify&nbsp; them. Look, I, my own view is the Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp; people have a right to self-determination and&nbsp; whether that's a state, if they choose that's a&nbsp;&nbsp; state or there's some kind of confederation, that&nbsp; should be their choice. But by the same token,&nbsp;&nbsp; with rights come responsibilities.&nbsp; When we talk about a Palestinian state,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can't have a Palestinian state that's going to&nbsp; be led by Hamas. That's certainly not a two-state&nbsp;&nbsp; solution. That's a guarantee for continuing war.&nbsp; It can't be a Palestinian state that becomes a&nbsp;&nbsp; member of the Axis of Resistance, what I call&nbsp; the Axis of Misery, being aligned with Iran,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's also a guarantee, that's a guarantee&nbsp; against two states. It can't be a Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp; state that doesn't have institutions, so it'll be&nbsp; a failed state. So you need, you need to create&nbsp;&nbsp; rights and responsibilities. I would like to see&nbsp; some benchmarks created, some milestones created,&nbsp;&nbsp; all with the, all under the rubric that&nbsp; Palestinians have a state in the making&nbsp;&nbsp; and they have to fulfill their responsibilities to&nbsp; be able to achieve their rights. Now, obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp; at the same time, if you're creating that kind&nbsp; of set of standards or milestones or obligations&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Palestinian side, you have to impose some&nbsp; responsibilities on the Israeli side, including&nbsp;&nbsp; among other things, they cannot act on the ground&nbsp; in the West Bank in a way that makes it impossible&nbsp;&nbsp; to have a Palestinian state. But everything I've&nbsp; just said, this is not something you can produce&nbsp;&nbsp; overnight. We have to start by having both sides&nbsp; even begin to cooperate in a functional way again,&nbsp;&nbsp; And we're at a very low ebb. You asked me about&nbsp; "was this as difficult a time as I've ever seen&nbsp;&nbsp; in terms of US-Israeli relations?" I can tell you&nbsp; this is worse between Israelis and Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp; than at any point on which I worked on this&nbsp; issue, including during the Second Intifada.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have to get back to some kind of a baseline&nbsp; so we can move from there and move in a direction&nbsp;&nbsp; of peace becoming possible. Right now, we're not&nbsp; dealing with a conflict that is seen in political&nbsp;&nbsp; terms. We're seeing conflict that's almost seen&nbsp; in existential terms and we're going to have to&nbsp;&nbsp; get back to creating a sense of possibility&nbsp; again, and we're quite a ways from that. Can I just raise with you briefly the death in&nbsp; a helicopter accident of the Iranian President&nbsp;&nbsp; Raisi? Any sign of an opportunity or&nbsp; a danger emerging from this accident? I don't think it changes things very much. I&nbsp; mean, it creates uncertainty within Iran. But the&nbsp;&nbsp; Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, is a decision maker.&nbsp; Raisi was not the decision maker. He might be the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision implementer, but he wasn't the decision&nbsp; maker. My guess is the Supreme Leader will&nbsp;&nbsp; emphasize the importance of people participating&nbsp; in the election because he likes to portray that&nbsp;&nbsp; as being an indication of legitimacy. The fact&nbsp; that turnouts are so small right now is an&nbsp;&nbsp; indication of how the Iranian public really feels&nbsp; about the Islamic Republic and the regime. But I&nbsp;&nbsp; think in the near term, their focus will be&nbsp; much more on trying to work out this election,&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to maximize the numbers of people who&nbsp; vote and much less adventures on the outside. Dennis Ross, it's been good to&nbsp; have you on Conflict Zone. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you very much indeed for your time. Thank you. Good to be with you.
