well the United Nations says 45% of all homes in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed with more than 2 million people largely dependent on foreign aid the UN says only 74 Supply trucks have been allowed into Gaza since the fighting began that's down from 500 a day before the Hamas attacks on Israel the Gaza Health Ministry says more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel air strikes many of them children an uncle picks up his nephew's body shrouded in white and takes him to the Grave another young victim of gaza's worsening humanitarian crisis this is one of my nephews my brother's wife and children were all martyred my nephew was injured two weeks ago and because all the crossings are closed from medical evacuations he passed away there's no medicine for efficient treatment no fuel but the doctors did their best the situation in Gaza has turned to one of abject misery with shortages in everything from water to food and Medicine gaza's hospitals have been particularly hard hit victims of Israeli air strikes continue to pour in Israel says it's targeting the terrorist group Hamas as the number of wounded civilians Rises the UN says nearly a third of hospitals have had to close due to damage or lack of fuel fuel which is needed to pump water and power hospitals is in such short supply that the UN has warned it may have to Halt humanitarian operations if more doesn't arrive soon but Israel says any fuel they allow in could be seized by Hamas and rejects un claims that Gaza doesn't have enough we responded to un's Claim by referring them to where Hamas which governs the Gaza Strip stores fuel both diesel fuel and uh other types of and Benzene and other types of of fuel it's all inside the Gaza Strip and there's enough for many days for hospitals and water pumps to run only the priorities are different Hamas prefers to have all of the fuel for its War fighting capabilities leaving civilians without leaders around the world are debating what can be done to help civilians who are the ones paying the heaviest price well let's go directly to Gaza now where journalist ham baloa joins us on the line ham Gaza is receiving only a trickle of the humanitarian Aid it needs describe to us what conditions you and other people there are facing now it's so hard in Gaza it's getting harder day by day um lack of of everything lack of food lack of water lack of drinking water um above all that no power no electricity no internet no communication um um the transportation is is hard mostly the connection between the cities is very limited uh people are hardly communicating with with each other uh there are lines on everything like bakeries um uh grocery shops um um where is like some drinking water places people go and rush to uh we see people like have galloons and have everything bags to fill it with with washing or drinking water um some people um um shifted to to cooking on fire instead of of of cooking gas because it's not available as well um all the aspects of Life were affected in during these um uh 20 or 21 days the UN says nowhere is safe in Gaza they point out that 45% of all homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged where do you go ham where do you and your family go when the bombs start falling this is the big question among all Ordinary People here or civilians there is no place to go I know personally many people who evacuated to the South uh when they asked to evacuate from G City or the northern part to the southern cities but um I mean many of them return back to the to to to to to Gala City because it's like continued of air strikes in the South we I mean according to the statistics like issued Yesterday by Ministry of Health we are talking about over 2,600 were killed in the South cities um while about four or over 4,000 were killed in in in in in Gaza and the north so um people always wonder where where where is the the safe place um uh and uh where to go uh many people have no places to go I know literally people are sleeping industry or in their cars in the street ham thank you very much journalist ham baloa in Gaza thank you European union leaders meeting at a Summit in Brussels have called for a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas to get desperately needed Aid to civilians in Gaza the common declaration calls for the establishment of humanitarian corridors and pauses rather than a ceasefire EU leaders had struggled to agree on the statement's precise wording Let's cross to Brussels now to speak with our correspondent there b Li B what did it take for the European union leaders to find a common position on the Israel Hamas conflict well it took the leaders 5 hours of intense bargaining and bickering about the wording of a declaration that might not have much impact on the ground actually now they talk about pauses in tarian corridors but not defining what that actually means how long these paes should be um the effort is designed to get humanitarian Aid into Gaza and also to get hostages and foreigners out of Gaza to win some time and as a compromise the EU also suggests now to have to hold an International Peace conference soon also this wording is very fluffy it's a French proposal um that was also ventilated during the visit of imanuel macron in Israel um but but diplomats here have doubt that this declaration will have much impact because neither Israel nor the terrorist organization Hamas will give much about the words from the EU the role will be to to finance humanitarian Aid further but the EU has in this conflict not much political Cloud Ben thank you very much that was our correspondent van leut in
