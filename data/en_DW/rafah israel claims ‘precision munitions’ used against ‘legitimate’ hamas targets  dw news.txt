the health Ministry in Gaza says at least 35 people have been killed and dozens more injured in an Israeli air strike on Rafa the Hamas run Ministry says the strike hit an area where thousands of displaced civilians are Sheltering Israel confirmed its military did carry out an attack on Rafa and says the strike killed two Hamas commanders it also said it was report investigating reports that civilians were harmed as a result the strike came just days after the international court of justice in the ha ordered Israel to stop its assault on Rafa homes of displaced garans burned to the ground after an Israeli air strike in the southern city of Rafa Israel's Army maintains it was targeting a Hamas compound and Ed precise weapons against legitimate targets [Music] however Israel says it is reviewing the incident Hamas has called it a heinous Massacre we were safely sitting at the door of the House suddenly we heard the sound of a missile we ran and found a street covered in Smoke we couldn't see anything when we checked over the wall we found a girl and the young man who had been cut into pieces we got are clear gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry said dozens are dead the International Red Cross also confirmed that hospitals were seeing an influx of wounded people earlier on Sunday Aid Sirens rang out in Tel Aviv sending people running down into bomb shelters until the danger passed the Salvo of rockets fired from Gaza left debris outside of a school today Hamas terrorists in Gaza fired eight rockets at Central Israel from Rafa sending millions of Israelis to bomb shelters Hamas launched this Rockets from near two mosques in Rafa Kamas has been attacking Israel from Rafa and Hamas has been holding in our holding our hostages in Rafa a Hama spokesperson said the barage was a response to high civilian deaths at the hands of the Israeli military I asked Marina who's a military expert at King's College London to give us her assessment of Israel's strike in Rafa good day Ana well the situation is very difficult so so from an Israeli point of view there was a military necessity to conduct that strike now the problem is that military necessity is not the only consideration that should be made proportionality for one is another very important aspect in the international law of war is that proportion of the damage that that strike would create and I think this is a crucial question here could Israel have used other means for instance using troop snipers perhaps in order to eliminate those two commanders of Hamas without damaging the civilians and Israel has been repeatedly criticized for these indiscriminate attacks and I think that this is of course um playing into the hands of Hamas and now displaying what atrocities Israel is Comm committing in Gaza uh yesterday Hamas fired several rockets at Tel Aviv in Israel tell us what this um tells us about hamas's military capacity well there have been some reports about hamas's military capabilities and throughout this war from October 7th onwards both sides have been fighting an information war and both sides were trying to portray themselves in a specific light um According to some reports at least 13d of Hamas Fighters has been eliminated by the IDF but as we see Hamas still has capabilities and I think the strike they have conducted after so many months of war is also symbolic to show to Israel that Hamas is not being close to being defeated and I believe um Hamas might not have any more of advanced weapons because of the difficulties of importing spare parts but I do think that they still retain some um long range rockets and therefore I assume that we will be seeing more of these strikes in the coming weeks as the operation unfolds in Raa and what about the Hamas infrastructure I mean does the network of tunnels in Gaza for example still play an important role in this War I think it absolutely is because the issue with the tunnels has never been completely resolved by the IDF um some tunnels have been discovered and um have been taken under control or at least um out of operation however it is estimated that some 50% of tunnels are still functioning and this is a way that Hamas still can move underground uh what we're seeing now is that it's trying to regroup and recover in the north for instance a territory believed to have been under control by the IDF so they they will continue using this tunnel infrastructure which is giving them a certain leverage over the idea okay now Israel says that hamas's last remaining battalions are in Rafa but there have been reports that Hamas is regrouping in the north is Israel getting any closer to achieving its military goal of eliminating Hamas correct um so what we have to understand here is that the size of Hamas is very flexible so the size of this grouping and this leads us to the first question about the incident um at that refugee camp because for every single terrorist killed there will be another 10 perhaps willing to join the organization and I'm talking in theoretical terms um one man's terrorist is another man's Freedom Fighter so it's all a matter of perspective and from the Palestinian perspective from the perspective of the gazin whose family members get killed by Israeli forces even if they were not on the side of Hamas before October 7 um now they are seeing this destruction and racking hav obervation in Gaza they will be much more inclined to join Hamas to join their ranks because they share that ideology so in other words you can destroy Hamas militarily probably that is possible but you cannot destroy them ideologically and indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks which risk uh severe civilian casualties even if it's considered as a collateral damage risk um perpetuating the cycle of violence creating even more Fighters so I think we're not getting any closer a political solution it should be thought about because militarily you cannot resolve this conflict Marina Maron military expert from Kings College London Marina thank you so much as ever
