German Chancellor Olaf schz is in Egypt and says Germany wants to support Egypt's mediation efforts and help to deescalate following Hamas Terror attacks on Israel Schultz and the Egyptian president Abdel fat alisi discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza the chancellor traveled to Cairo following a visit to Tel Aviv where he expressed Germany's solidarity with Israel now let's uh listen into what he said at a joint press conference with the Egyptian president together we are working on humanitarian access to Gaza as soon as possible people there are in need of water food and medication I can assure you at this point we will not leave the people alone the German government will continue its humanitarian efforts for Gaza to ease the suffering of the civilian population Egypt is key to the humanitarian Aid Chancellor Schulz mentioned there with the Israeli border closed the only way in and out of Gaza is the Rafa border crossing with Egypt mediators are already working to let desperately needed Aid pass in through Rafa and allow foreign Nationals and the wounded out Egypt said it was forced to close the border after Israeli strikes on October 10th and 11th and is working to reopen it trucks carrying eight are heading to the Border but it's still clear if they can cross now let's take a closer look at Egypt's complex role in the current crisis neighbor to Gaza and Israel Egypt holds a strategic and historical place in the conflict Cairo opposed to the formation of Israel in 1948 and the two states have fought several Wars sections of land passed back and forth between flareups Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip when its borders were first drawn in 1949 but less than 20 years later Israel claimed it during The Six Day War at the same time seizing the siai peninsula in 1979 Cairo was handed back the peninsula and the two states signed a peace deal Egypt became the first Arab country to recognize the state of Israel the two Nations have had mostly peaceful relations since and have cooperated on issues like security past governments have mediated between Israel and Hamas which has historical ties to Egypt the militant islamist group began as a Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood which was founded in Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood briefly held power after the Egyptian revolution in 2011 but was ousted by current president abdal fat CI in a coup the group has been outlawed in EGP Egypt despite cooperation with Israel sentiment amongst Egyptians is largely for the Palestinian cause and crowds in Cairo have been rallying against Israel's bombardment of Gaza with an election due in December the government is standing firm on borders and security and says it will not allow a mass movement from Gaza Egypt fears it could become responsible for millions of Palestinian refugees like leanon and Jordan before it Cairo has said Palestinians should not be forced to flee their land and has advocated for a two-state solution the government said it rejects the killing of any civilians it has urged restraint and said Israel's response to hamas's terrorist attack now amounts to Collective punishment Egypt is working to mediate along with other International partners and to create a humanitarian Lifeline for civilians in Gaza Let's cross over to Cairo where a journalist bahir Amin is standing by but here earlier in the show we heard the German Chancellor reiterating Israel's right to defend itself does Egypt agree Egypt has in general not contradicted that but the difference in what Egypt has reiterated in the cycle of violence is that Israel has gone beyond its right to defend itself into Collective punishment um so that incl Israel targeting civilians targeting Health Facilities depriving 2.4 million people of essential needs including food water electricity and fuel now um Schultz was expected to push for the rougher crossing the only border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to be reopened has there been any progress on that um we were expecting that it's the same level of the same line of communication that's happened between KIRO and every European beader um and we did get that President reiterated Egypt's commitment keeping ra open said they had never closed it on the Egyptian side but that Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian border post had for it had forced its closure at this point hundreds of trucks full of a still waiting on the Egyptian side of the Border uh pressure for them to be allowed in uh is reaching of Crescendo but with Egyptian leaders reiterating that it's the air strikes and they still working on it they're still collaborating with the UN with Israel with allies that there doesn't seem to be any Focus humanitarian workers at say they still don't have any kind of timeline now several International leaders have now visited Egypt asking for its intervention and what role does Cairo hope to play here so Cairo has been very clear um during the current violence uh on its role which can be think which can be thought of in three ways um first it maintains its historical role as a key mediator between Israel and Hames um urging restraint pushing diplomacy inviting world leaders to a peace Summit next Saturday second it sees itself as the guarant tour of humanitarian Aid um the world is treating it as such it is bowed to secure Aid through the ra Crossing again the only passage in and out of Gaza not controlled by Israel um Egypt's foreign minister has said yesterday that once the crossing is safe humanitarian and medical cases will be allowed into Egypt um third and the most telling part of CT speech today um has Cairo positioning itself in refusing to admit larger numbers of refugees as the champion of Palestinian statehood and the keeper of regional peace um he warned that the danger that Force displacement of Gaza um the for of Gaza into Egypt would would equate the force displacement of the bank into Jordan and bring an end to the goal of Palestinian statehood um he also said that a mass Exodus into Sinai would make the peninsula a new base for armed operations against Israel which would cause the Region's most fundamental peace treaty between Egypt and Israel to fall apart now if we're looking at public opinion in in Egypt and also how politics might be influenced how has the Hospital blast in Gaza affected the efforts at a diplomatic intervention um on the humanitarian front it is definitely amped up pressure um the humanitarian situation in Gaza was already catastrophic um with every massive loss of life it gets pushed further over the edge um victims from the hospital last night for example were transferred to another hospital that was already hosting some 30,000 displaced people um diplomatically we've seen that am men that men meeting was canceled Biden has PRS to be in contact with Arab leaders he was meant to meet there um but there's no further information on what that will actually look like um in terms of public opinion it Remains the Same um in Egypt there's a there's discourse among charity workers and civil society that we do have an obligation to both let Aid in and let those in need um to be treated in Egyptian hospitals but not support the force displacement of Palestinians but remind me why is eg Egypt not opening the uh Rafa Crossing there into both directions um so first of all there was um an agreement earlier this week fell through between Egypt us and Israel uh because Egypt refused to let foreign Nationals out through rafah if Aid was not allowed in um and now we're seeing this um especially today in CC Speech he warned again that the danger of Gins being displaced in to Egypt would therefore lead to uh the receivement of the West Bank Palestinians into Jordan um Palestinian president abz has also warned that Gaza is facing a repeat of Thea in 1948 the mass displacement of Palestinians in the creation of the state of Israel um it also not wor to note that most of the population of Gaza are refugees who were driven from their homes um in 1948 um and then so there is the fear that once Palestinians flee their homes in search of safety those homes are gone forever um so CC also said that that propos um that proposal holds immense risk to the Region's most fundamental peace treaty as you said Egypt was the first Arab state to recognize Israel in 1979 B here Amin there in Cairo for us thank you very
