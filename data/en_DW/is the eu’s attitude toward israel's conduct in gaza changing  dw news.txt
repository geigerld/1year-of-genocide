meanwhile EU foreign ministers have called on Israel to respect a ruling by the top United Nations Court ordering it to stop its military offensive in Rafa at a meeting in Brussels the official said Israel needs to explain how it's going to comply with the decision DW's Rosie Berard has more these protesters rallying outside the venue in Brussels say Israel has crossed a red line with strikes on Rafa despite the world Court's order to Halt operations there words of condemnation are also heard insight there is no safe place in Gaza touching and refugees scam and killing and burning more than 40 people among them many childrens you can imagine how horrified we are all of us for this set events for the first time since the October 7th attacks by Hamas and the ensuing bombardment of Gaza EU members decided to demand details from Israel on its compliance with its human rights obligations and an explanation of how it will comply with the recent ruling on Rafa these provisional court orders are binding and of course they must be followed we are currently experiencing the opposite International humanitarian law applies to everyone and this is also valid for Israeli Warfare some ministers have been pushing for tougher measures I would say we have an ultimatum of 5 days a week or 10 days maximum where you have to fulfill this and this and this and if not then we have to take sanctions this is for me what would be my proposal on the table but that's unlikely to happen due to EU unanimity rules and its unpopularity with Israeli officials as regard to the EU member states who might want to put some sanctions on this topic again why would you do that why would you reward terrorism in the face of what is happening right now we have seen yesterday Rockets from r going into Israeli territory all the way up to Tel Aviv so I really want to see who cannot justify going in there EU members also approved a plan to revive their Rafa border assistance Mission seen in this footage it was suspended in 2007 after Hamas took over Gaza Monday's move takes the EU a step closer to supporting simpler border crossings but they can't become a reality without backing from Israel Egypt and Palestinians for now the block will keep shipping Aid toward W the Rafa border from afar with little guarantee it will get to gazin in need and the author of that report Rosie Berard joins us now from Brussels Rosie are we seeing a shift in the eu's attitude towards Israel's conduct in the Gaza War well listen this is a shift of sorts if only because the EU has really struggled to agree on any sort of action in response to this conflict ever since those Hamas attacks on October 7th and that's because the block is divided between members who on the one end of the spectrum tend to really be seen as in solidarity with the Palestinian cause so that includes for example Spain and Ireland that recently recognized Palestinian statehood and at the other end of the spectrum countries like Hungary and czechia that are really tend to be seen as staunch supporters of Israel and somewhere in the middle Germany obviously with its historic what it sees as a historic responsibility to protect Jewish life so moving forward the fact that they have decided on something decided to call for what they is called an association Council that does seem to be a shift to me and it certainly has seems really in response to this icj ruling the un's top court and the eu's Foreign Affairs Chief yose Vell even said on his way into these talks here in Brussels on Monday that he felt that presented a dilemma a dilemma on how to ensure enforcement of that ruling and respect for international law the agreement to call that meeting to call official talks with Israel that was quite unexpected it was the first time since October 7th so how exactly did we get here Rosie so this is something called an association Council it sounds like Brussels jargon but what it really means is that the EU and Israel have something called an association agreement it's a broad agreement a core deal which governs things including trade so that is of course a potential key leverage the EU may have now in terms of what that means going forward it means that the EU can call on Israeli officials it could be for example the prime minister to come to Brussels to explain how it complies with the human rights obligations which are spelled out in that agreement that Association agreement Israel doesn't have to necessarily respond but we know that there was an association Council held back in 2022 and it's not the first time that this talks format has been politicized there was in fact a decade of a Hiatus in these official talks when EU Israeli relations were very St right up until 2022 and of course now given the ongoing humanitarian catastrophes the EU sees that in Gaza those relations are very much strained again yeah we heard it in your report there are a lot of ifs and butts here how much leverage does the EU really have how much ability to act quickly if you can well the ability to act quickly is very much confined by these divisions because the EU could have significant leverage over both sides it's a major trade partner of Israel is also a major donor to the Palestinians but because of these divisions what we've seen so far is that the Diplomatic weight has really laid with Washington on this this agreement that we had however on Monday to potentially move forward with reactivating the eu's border mission at Rafa that could be something where we see the EU trying to move from being a bystander to be more of a broker and trying to take center stage but I should say we are still very far off that there really needs to be a lot more negotiations to achieve that first as DW correspondent Rosie Berard in Brussels many thanks always great to get your input the health Ministry in Gaza says at least 45 people have been killed and dozens more injured in an Israeli air strike on Rafa Israel says it was targeting two Hamas commanders there Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the strike on civilians a tragic mistake and said it was being investigated the attack came just days after the international court of justice ordered Israel to stop its assault on Rafa the aftermath of an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in Rafa Hamas officials in Gaza say the attack killed dozens and injured many more survivors described what they' just gone through we pulled out people who were in an unbearable State we pulled out children who were in pieces we pulled out young and elderly people the fire in the camp was Unreal most of the displaced here didn't survive for the Salman family the strike means displacement for the eighth time what am I supposed to do where am I to go tell me and for how long will this go on Israel should pinpoint a place for us and tell us to live or die there this way does not work how long will we be disgraced like this for the Israeli Army said it was targeting two senior Hamas commanders Israel's prime minister Benjamin netan who said the incident was a terrible mistake despite our atmost efforts not to harm non-combatants something unfortunately went tragically wrong we were investigating the incident and we reach conclusions because this is our policy for us every combatant that is hurt is a tragedy for Hamas it's a strategy this is the whole difference those injured in the attack were taken to a hospital in central Gaza and for now Israel continues its operations in Gaza and that's despite a ruling by the top United Nations Court to stop our correspondent Rebeca ritters is following the story for us from Jerusalem Rebecca what can you tell us about the situation in Rafa after the attack what about the civilians there well it's obviously a very difficult situation Nicole it's really difficult to get real time information out of ruer at the moment I have put in some calls and some messages to the gazen civil defense I've not been able to get uh reply but what we do know is that after this attack we were seeing the images some of the most horrific images that I've seen uh covering this War I must say uh some that are just simply too graphic to show on the news to show on our social media channels some really horrific images and that is basically what has been happening there today the cleanup uh has been going on and been been continuing um civilians have also been trying to move obviously away again to safer areas but as we've seen there are really no safe areas for them to go this was allegedly uh where this strike happened or near where this strike happened was allegedly a safe Zone that's something that Israel has denied uh it's difficult to get clarity on that as well exactly where it happened as I said this is being investigated um and and civilians obviously trying to find just safer places to go the IDF has reportedly launched an investigation to find out what exactly happened there prime minister Neto has acknowledged that a tragic mistake had been made what are he and other Israeli politicians saying about this well within Israel uh obviously this is big a lot of the coverage though the media coverage hasn't been showing the same images as we've been seeing internationally it's not being discussed in quite the same manner we have seen that statement or or seen those remarks from prime minister Benjamin Nyah who calling this a tragic accident though he said that this would not change the course of the war that they would continue to fight Hamas that they would continue to search for the hostages uh they of course have said that they are going to investigate this preliminary investigation say that the bomb sparked a fire they said that uh their preliminary uh you know looks look into this when they were preparing to make this strike to carry out this strike uh the military says that they did not believe that any civilians would be harmed uh of course the investigation will be going on and the US is also calling for uh that investigation that they are also trying to assess what's been happening with the help of the IDF the international outcry over this has been huge Rebecca are there any fears that this might further isolate Israel it certainly has been huge Nicole really across the board we seeing condemnation the UN has condemned this and called for an independent investigation uh the White House has come out saying this is heartbreaking uh that it is engaging with the IDF as I just mentioned to assess the situation we've seen U Emanuel macron of France calling this he was outraged we've seen Ireland's foreign ministers saying this is a barbaric barbaric Act Norway Spain's foreign minister uh both of those foreign ministers I should say coming saying that after uh the icj rolling of just a couple of days ago where it ruled that uh the Israelis needed to stop their bombardment of Rafa that this uh makes the gravity of the attack the gravity of this attack all the more higher we are seeing this across the board words like horrific barbaric um now we have seen similar outrage to instances in the past particularly uh in the wake of the deaths of of those um world Central kitchen workers Aid workers who were trying to deliver Aid uh inside the Gaza STP and they were killed by an Israeli air strike we saw days of condemnation but we haven't seen that play uh any effect as to how Israel is conducting its War there and as we've seen uh in the wake of that icj ruling also not having an effect on the way that Israel is conducting this war so it certainly seems that more than condemnation it's going to take more than Global condemnation for us to see a change in the course of this war that was DW's Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem any thanks
