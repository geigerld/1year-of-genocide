the Israeli Army has urged all residents of Gaza of City to leave it's dropped leaflets showing Escape Routes from the city Israel has been stepping up its ground assault and air strikes on Hamas militants with often deadly consequences for civilians the human cost of another Israeli air strike in Gaza Palestinian medical officials say dozens were killed after missiles hit the tents of displaced families camped outside a un run School in abasan a town near Khan [Music] yunes we were by the school Gates I went out to get things for my children when the strike happened a huge explosion people were flying in all directions there were no ambulances they took about an hour to arrive Israel's military told the Reuters news agency it was looking into the incident it says it was targeting Hamas forces in the area those at the scene of the strike stressed that the victims were civilians suddenly and without prior warning Rockets were fired towards a few people who were using the internet signal there they weren't Fighters they didn't have weapons and they weren't involved in any resistance operations they were civilians and mostly children these pictures show the extent of the devastation in Han Yunis after Israel's campaign in the area part of its response to the Hamas October the 7th terror attack on Southern Israel that authorities say killed around 1,200 people and saw hostages taken this latest air strike has come as the two sides resume efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release Hamas has warned that Israel's renewed ground assault and bombardment could jeopardize talks the journalist Kar algi joins me now from Cairo um Egyptian media are reporting that talks will continue in Doha and in Cairo this week yet Hamas is warning that the latest Israeli strikes could jeopardize those talks of course uh all what you just saw in this report before is putting the talks into danger but uh the talks are until now ongoing and we have really uh shuttled the more problems you know right now between uh Egypt the gulf Emirate ofq and Israel uh with the US involved yesterday for example we had talks in Cairo with the head of the Egyptian intelligent abas camel the Israeli delegations headed by shim bit and also um CIA director Bill Burns and uh Joe Biden's special Middle East advisers advisor Brett mcer involved and this talks mainly turned around uh border management Egypt wants the Israeli Army to withdraw from the border towards Egypt Israel and the US say they want to make sure that there are no weapons delivered to Hamas from the side of Egypt especially underground Israel in that case wants to remain the right to military intervene in the Border area so that's what the talk in Egypt were about on the table there is some kind of sound barrier that might have been might have been come into Construction in the first days after the ceasefire in Gaza with us cooporation so the talks in Egypt mainly about the Border management now we are back in Israel and qat so it's an ongoing shuttle diplomacy now Hamas still wants a permanent ceased fire Israel has rejected any deal that would force it to end uh the war with Hamas left intact uh that's a vicious circle is it not it is it is really the sticking point Hamas wants to have this guarantees for permanent ceasefire Netanyahu wants to keep the end to the war open especially with his stated goal of the destruction of Hamas Hamas dropped now it seems their demand for a permanent ceasefire as some kind of prere request pres it as a precondition for the whole process of exchanging hostages and prisoners uh a process that should go in several phases but Hamas still Demands a commitment to a permanent ceasefire before this whole process of exchange really will end so the understandings of the details here are very difficult some sources say that the talks are very constructiv other says that they are facing difficulties and they are very complex and that they will take several weeks but as I said the shuttle diplomacy is in full swing so it seems all sides still hope to advance their positions in this talks the journalist K AI in Kyo thank you very much Karim you're welcome for more we can cross over now to our correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya Kramer Tanya Palestinian officials say at least 25 people were killed in the air strike on that school the Israel Defense Forces say they're reviewing reports that civilians were harmed what more do we know at this point well we know from the Israeli Army that's what they usually put out in a statement they put out overnight that uh basically they're saying they targeted a Hamas militant who took part in the October seven attacks among other uh things and saying as you said that they're looking into the report that civilians were harmed in this strike now we know from the GAA Health Ministry that among the victims there were women and children uh they were taking shelter uh at this school it's also not the first time a school or a 10 City where you know people are taking shelter seeking shelter uh has been hid and uh they also said Health Services there that uh casualties uh are expected uh to rise from there in addition to that we are seeing heavy bombardment in G City uh in the where people in the Eastern parts and in central Gaza were asked or ordered by the military to uh leave the area moving further west uh the Palestinian red cresant has said they have difficulties to reach uh the wounded and injured people also some hospitals have uh evacuated to other hospitals of course they're all not fully functioning so it's not an easy task for them now the military has indicated uh earlier in the year that they had Gaza City under control but clearly not they're saying that Hamas and other militant groups from their point of view are regrouping so that means that thousands are again are displaced many have stayed in Gaza City moving from neighborhood to Neighborhood but some are saying they're staying put where they are because it's simply too dangerous right now uh to move somewhere else in Gaza City because any safety there is illusive what about ceasefire negotiations Tanya Egyptian media are Doha and Cairo this week but could these latest Israeli air strikes end up jeopardizing those talks well we heard from Hamas they have been saying that these latest development especially also what is going on in Gaza City could and could return the negotiations to point0 and as you said those negotiations are uh underway at the moment we're expecting today a four-way meeting in Doha in qat between the Israeli American cat and Egyptian officials in Doha we also have Hamas to have a bureau there now this meeting is seen here as crucial it comes after meeting in Kyo because they're saying from what we're hearing from sources here that this is a meeting to take stocks what are the uh disagreements still we heard there's some progress but we also heard uh from Israeli officials now uh saying that Egyptian optimism uh is a bit premature and that long and complex and difficult negotiations are are uh ahead in the coming weeks and of course also domestically we have to say uh we have been hearing from prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu ambiguous uh statements he had put out uh five principles that are non-negotiable which have been seen by some as further complicating those talks and also his power right Coalition Partners have said they don't want to see such a agreement and they would leave the government if such an agreement would be closed Tanya thank you very much our correspondent Tanya Kramer there in Jerusalem
