now to Israel where smaller exchanges of fire are continuing near the country's northern border with Lebanon a day after militant group Hezbollah and Israel traded aerial attacks Israel claims to have destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launchers in southern Lebanon Israeli military said its preemptive strikes would prevent a wider escalation of the conflict asbah has launched more than 300 rockets at Israel in response to the killing of one of its senior commanders in Beirut last month there have been near daily crossborder clashes between Israel and Hezbollah since the October 7 Terror attacks committed by Hamas ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas over Gaza have so far produced no results let's work our way through some of those issues with Shalom lipner he's the Atlantic Council non-resident senior fellow for the Middle East uh for the Middle East programs and joins us uh from New York City Welcome to DW shalom Israel as we just um outlined there fighting Wars on many fronts including Gaza Lebanon and Iran against Iran and its proxies how long can Israel withstand such a prolonged series of conflicts be with you um like anything else I think it's a question of degrees obviously the you know the goal of Israel's adversaries is to overwhelm its defenses the same time I think we've seen in practice that you know Israel maintains a formidable mounty layer defense system has been effective in stopping pretty much to a large extent you know without stopping all tangible damage we see having done by incoming attacks over the past the past many months um also Israel's not alone in this we saw you know most uh most poly in April when the United States Regional allies French Germany as well a bunch of people together put together this coalition to repel and ranian attack of hundreds of of incoming projectiles and missiles so you know clearly it's demonstrated success in being able to withstand these you know these uh these assaults the same time it you know very much depends on what what is forthcoming I mean the Iranians hasb you know hisb says that there'll be a second phase to their attack the Iranians just still waiting for you know on Deck arguably to to launch a strike as well theis as you say so I mean you know much of it depends on what it is that we see coming but you know clearly if we're judging from from previous previous experience so far Israel's been able to withstand most of the most of the damage that these these parties have tried to inflict and and as you say degree is everything when we're talking about the the size of this conflict and it's weird that everybody keeps shooting but everybody says we don't want this to turn into allout war very much so but I mean I you know I think you you put your finger on you know on the uh you hit the nail on the head I think that uh all the parties are concerned about what could happen if this thing escalates beyond control um you know we've seen just uh in the inent over the past couple 48 hours I guess more or less that um you know after Israel preemptively struck saying that they had intelligence indicating that his Bala was about to attack that morning um after after that particular you know chip for Tat scal down we saw both parties sort of declaring Victory and moving on Israel saying they were able to repel this attack um hisb saying you know we were able to go through with it as you know maybe not to the extented plan but you know both parties were very happy to declare mission accomplished and move on aware of the dangers that could you know come to pass if this thing got very much out of control so you know we are seeing those messages that that that very much people do not want this to escalate to a point where you know they could lose control of what happens next so that built-in Paradox a word about then ceasefire talks on Gaza Israel and Hamas still seem to be far from each other especially regarding control of the Philadelphia Corridor on the Egypt Gaza border and the net sarim Corridor that's the the zone of occupation that Israel has set up to separate uh the north uh of Gaza from the rest of the territory these sticking points seem to be non-negotiables for both sides so are any further talks therefore pointless well I don't know that they're pointless If Only from you know to take off on your your previous question I mean since neither party wants us to get out of control one way to be able to maintain that space is for these talks to continue having said that you're right they are hobbling um we do have high level engagement it goes forward it goes backwards um neither neither party it's almost like a game of chicken neither you know party wants to be declared the ACT you know the person who the actual spoiler who scuttled the entire process um but there are in fact interests in all parties of the table some want this to succeed some do not want it to succeed um you know and that complicates the dynamic here the the one the silver potential Silver Lining is just as we have this sort of negative spiral there's also a potential for a de-escalatory cycle as well that if in fact we reach a point where we get to a ceasefire it could actually radiate to the other theaters as well create you know a better sense of calm but uh but you know the the negotiations have been very much two steps forward one step back if not the reverse okay thanks for guiding us through that Shalom lipner from the Atlantic
