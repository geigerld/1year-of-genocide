Israel says it is not expecting any hostages to be released by Hamas before Friday officials say the exchange has been postponed so that further details can be ironed out an agreed pause in hostilities in Gaza is also on hold with heavy fighting continuing across the strip meanwhile Israel's Israel's military rather is yet to confirm reports that the director of gaza's biggest hospital has been arrested along with a number of other medical staff we'll go to our correspondent in Jerusalem in just a minute but first let's speak to Lieutenant Colonel Peter lner he's a spokesperson for the Israeli military the IDF welcome to you uh can you start by confirming that Israeli troops have arrested the director of the alifa hospital and several other doctors thank you I have uh heard this news this morning I can't confirm it officially I'm still waiting from a an update from the field in order to understand exactly if that has happened and under what what circumstances but after our Revelations yesterday and over the last recent days of the extent of hamas's tunnel Network beneath uh the shifa hospital I think it's only logical that he should be questioned to ask how did this happen do you know what they are accused of as I said I can't confirm it I'm still waiting for confirmation from the field I'm just speaking logically what you know that needs to be some questions asked after he denied it extensively and what we revealed yesterday I'm sure DW is showing the extensive footage of the extent of the terrorist tunnels that exist beneath shaer hospital um and used by Hamas so I think we we need some questions he is the manager of the hospital he should be able to answer those so we can say clearly that you are claiming that hospital staff knew about the extent of the network and concealed it from the public no that's not what I said I said that it there's a reality on the ground that we've revealed extensively uh covered extensively by the world media showing the huge amount of network of tunnels that exist beneath the shifa hospital um he should definitely be questioned in order to answer what exactly he knew and what he didn't know and that there's not I'm not saying that he's been charged I'm not saying that he's been arrested as I said before we're still waiting for that confirmation from the field but just logically it makes sense you know that he answers some questions as we're looking at IDF pictures Peter another major Hospital in Northern Gaza the Indonesian Hospital says it has received a warning from Israeli troops to evacuate immediately will Israeli troops enter this Hospital next so I won't comment specifically on immediate operations that are happening but yes indeed we have seen throughout the last month the extent of hamas's concept of operations to embed itself beneath in and around hospitals this is the challenge that Hamas have chosen to intentionally locate themselves in these places putting the people in the hospitals at risk so if we are calling uh people to evacuate from specific locations it is in order to get them out of Harm's Way if we've learned anything from the incidents around shifa that when we are instructing people to evacuate the hospitals they should listen the World Health Organization and other un institutions have repeatedly called for medical personnel to be protected in this war as in any other conflict are you at this point interested in what the who says I'm interested in hearing the who condemn hamas's use of hospitals the extent of the the tunnels and we've not heard one word from them about this this is what really concerns us it it it it makes them actually complicit in hamas's abuse and action against uh the humanitarian Mission against medical staff and the presence of the medical uh uh patients themselves so I would say the wh have to be part of the solution not part of the problem and By ignoring hamas's involvement in this by ignoring hamas's entrenchment beneath hospitals By ignoring the abuse that Hamas has clearly um uh created around hospitals and Hospital staff at they are not being a contributing party to solving this issue um when we are engaging with the who that is what we expect a very clear message that not about only the protection of medical staff because that is what we're doing or the the patients themselves when we're asking to evacuate hospitals but also the abuse by Hamas of this of the medical infrastructure that should be at the the top of their concerns that should be the most worrying thing that the who have because it has been systematic a concept of operations that Hamas have intentionally laid out the foundations of all of their Subterranean activities this needs to concern not only the who but the world of completely all of us we need to be concerned about how this terrorist organization has manipulated the situation into such a devastating reality Peter larner spokesperson for the Israeli military thank you good day we can now speak to marinaa Miron she's a military Analyst at King's College London Marina are there any signs at this point the isra military have started to move back from positions inside of Gaza or or does it appear that they are keeping the pressure on Hamas as the clock ticks down to an expected truce good day Anthony well at this point it seems like the operation is still in full swing because um as we have heard the exchange of hostages will be postponed at least until tomorrow therefore the military operation is continuing as before and as a matter of fact According to some reports uh we have seen some of the fiercest fighting going on right now the Israelis are previously rejected calls for for a truce Marina claiming it would benefit Hamas what can Hamas really do inside of four days is that going to be enough for them when they're backed into the corner that they are now can they exploit at truce in any way to their own Advantage well it seems like Hamas has taken the hostages knowing exactly that will be attempts to rescue these hostages and the best chances of getting these people alive is by initiating a ceasefire and um Israel has promised to extend the ceasefire by 24 hours for each additional 10 hostages released so we have to do the math here if Hamas releases 50 hostages now they still have some 200 hostages that they can use to bar for time and to to get more time in order to regroup and recover and 4 days might seem like little time however from a military perspective at the Tactical level the clock is taking much faster and that might just be enough time for Hamas to relocate to regroup and recover to get new supplies in and whatever they need in order to strengthen their position therefore um even four days can benefit Hamas and conversely for the Israeli military now the campaign has been highly kinetic uh stopping for 4 days might risk losing the momentum do we know how much is left of Hamas militarily at this point I don't think that uh we have a very clear estimate we have seen reports that some high level military commanders have been eliminated however it's very difficult to say how many fighters are left um that being said we also have to bear in mind that because because of the ongoing campaign and because of its brutality it might push people to join Hamas Hamas is doing uh a very good job of um using the fact that Israel is responding with so much force in order to attract more supporters for its cause therefore it seems like for uh a few Hamas Fighters that Israel eliminates there will be 10 or 20 more joining the cause so it it it it is a very difficult situation and any estimates at this stage might might not reveal the the the real picture of what is happening Marina from a a military point of view how complex is the exchange of hostages and prisoners well it is complex from the perspectives that you have to pause your operations keeping your troops in those positions and you all also have to understand that there is not as much trust as one might think even if other countries are mediating this prisoner exchange uh and hostages exchange so therefore for the military they're still waiting there and thinking that Hamas might break the ceasefire any minute so they have to be ready for the threat on the one hand on the other hand is how long does the ceasefire last will Israel extend the ceasefire and will the military have to redo what it's been doing in order to regain the momentum how will the military operation look after that after Hamas had had the time um to relocate the other aspect of this is of course releasing 50 hostages means that uh there is less risk or one would assume there is less risks that uh whatever um military action is taken that the hostages might be harmed however we're still talking about 20 100 plus people um being held by Hamas so if all hostages were released it would certainly make the military operation easier for Israel but it is not the case Marina Miron military Analyst at King's College London thank you thank you for having me well our have reporter Muhammad khut has been near the NASA Hospital in canun asking people what they thought of the deal the four-day pause is simply not off we want something longterm we want stability we can't be in a state of rushing away with our belongings living our homes and being constantly running we are tired we are tired we want a permanent ceire we don't want a war we don't want anything else we just want to stay in our homes even if we have to eat sunand we can't bear this misery any longer it's too much I need to see a psychologist because of this it's an absolute Injustice our children are displaced our entire lives displaced is this acceptable who is listening to us to the UN I say have mercy on what we are going through e enough we are fed up in my opinion the 4day pause is not enough we want a permanent truth we are fed up of Wars we are exhausted can't be at War forever no one could ever imagine what we are going through it's extremely difficult 4 days are not enough to those who negotiated the pause what's for days we going into the second month of the war it's not enough we want a permanent end to all this we are not happy with this ceas fire we want a longer more permanent one we don't want to hear bombing or Screaming we don't want to hear we have lost a child I have lost my husband we don't like this ceas fire we want all people in the north to go back and find stability we don't want to live in fear it's enough we want to to go home enough everyone should be able to look after his business to get back to their lives to Jerusalem now and our special correspondent there a Ibrahim a the hostage release is now not expected to begin before Friday why the delay we heard from a a White House spokesperson that the final details are still being ironed out so it does here that this is due to uh some logistical uh uh challenges um this uh delay of course this delay comes as a huge disappointment to the families of the hostages who have been in agony for over a month over their loved ones and for Israeli society as a whole at the same time we were we've been told by officials and experts ever since this um hostage came into play that there are a lot of moving parts and it's not over until until it's really over even when the deal hopefully starts being implemented we won't see all of the hostages coming home all 50 hostages coming home at the same time they will be released in batches over a number of days and even then even when once we reach that process hopefully there could still be disruptions so U everyone's holding their uh breaths here in Israel but they also know that you know we're by no means um you know this by no means over how important is this deal what's at stake here for both Israeli government and Hamas the deal is crucial for the Israeli government which has come under huge pressure over the past uh six weeks or so for its perceived in action to bring back the hostages to their families we saw protests just uh over the weekend we saw a huge March thousands who walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem uh to call on their government to do more to bring the hostages back and so this really uh the Israeli government really needs this to to to to calm down uh the people who are just absolutely infuriated at how long it has taken to bring back the hostages for Hamas this could be an opportunity to regroup and recalibrate that certainly the criticism that's been mounted against this uh host hostage deal by some right-wing members of the government a small minority but a very vocal minority nonetheless there're also the people of Gaza who really stand to benefit from the ceasefire after you know we're now in the second month of non-stop bombardment the humanitarian situation is by all accounts catastrophic and with the ceasefire there will also be more Aid flowing into the strip much needed aid for the civilians in Gaza Aya what if anything do we know about the people involved in this exchange well the 50th Israeli hostages um men pardon women and children are going to be released we don't have their their their names yet which is of course causing a lot of anticipation and anxiety among hostages uh their families here in in Israel part of the deal will also be the release of 150 Palestinians in Israeli prisons uh Israel has said it will not be releasing any convicted murderers as part of this exchange deal uh but uh there will be people that have you know minor offenses like arson uh or uh throwing rocks um or U you know attacking a policeman not quite you know these are still violent crimes but not but no murderers will be released we know that the majority of the Palestinians that will be released are between the ages of 16 and 18 so these are still cons considered children according to the UN the special correspondent a Ibraham in Jerusalem thank you I'm joined Now by Salim ofis a Communications officer from unicef's Middle East office uh Sim welcome as we just heard the people in Gaza T they're tired and they do not think a truce of 4 days will be enough what do you think will eight organizations realistically be able to achieve anything meaningful in such a short period of time well yeah for sure we wel come uh the announcement of this of this pause but definitely it's not enough we're talking about getting eight into Gaza for over 1.6 million uh displaced people uh plus all those who are still in their in their uh original homes this operation is is huge and 4 days of of RIS pite is good but it's not enough to deliver uh what is needed it's not enough to deliver even within uh the Gaza Strip because we know we know that uh the most important part maybe for at least for uh us as humanitarians is to get the aid from the border to the different places in the gust strip and it's really it's going to be a a huge challenge in the coming days to to do that and to reach every child and every family but what we need is as as we've been advocating for so long and calling for uh a ceasefire that's more permanent that's more uh uh uh structured and we can deliver more Aid uh inside of Gaza soim just logistically of all the aid you have waiting to get into Gaza does this pause in the fighting mean you can just get everything that you have waiting at the border quickly and efficiently into Gaza and distributed to those who need it so as I said it's not enough to get uh everything that's needed but uh of course we're planning to get as much as possible inside uh UNICEF is planning to get uh 30 trucks a day uh if this choose actually or pose uh actually takes place um 10 of which would be for water and we're planning to get uh over 7 million liters of water during during this period uh we are focusing our efforts on uh the main uh really the Necessities water medicine uh um hygiene kits but also now winter is uh is already here uh in in this region and uh we're going to try to uh prioritize blankets warm clothes uh all that can um help people during this tough time after weeks of bombardment and street fighting how much of a challenge is it going to be simply moving these big trucks around inside the territory well it's it's been a challenge especially with the lack of of fuel and uh uh We've we've seen other un agencies um declaring that it's really uh impossible to move around and that has been the case for Unicef as well and uh for all humanitarians especially with um the lack of guarantees of safety our colleagues on the ground they are really uh challenged uh with their families to be safe uh with access to food and water so it's it's been really challenging to get around and get the aid around so that's why aose is really good that we can move but uh that's why we need a um a real humanitarian ceasefire to to be able to move and to deliver Aid and we need this guarantee of safety of not only the supplies but humanitarians as well SIM obis from unicef's Middle East office thank you so
