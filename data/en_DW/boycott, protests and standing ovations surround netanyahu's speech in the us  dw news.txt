we stay in the US where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has addressed a joint session of Congress he promised to continue the war against Hamas in Gaza and called on the United States to Stand United with Israel in his speech he also defended his country's conduct of the war which has left some 40,000 Palestinians dead and as he made that speech thousands of protesters gathered outside to demand an end to the conflict a standing evation by us lawmakers for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his address to a joint session of Congress Netanyahu defended his country's conduct in the fight against Hamas in Gaza and urged for more us support today as Israel fights on the front line of civilization I too appeal to America give us the tools faster and will finish the job faster not everyone has welcomed netanyahu's visit to Washington dozens of us lawmakers boycotted and a Palestinian American congresswoman Rashida Talib silently expressed anger over the number of Palestinians killed in [Applause] Gaza outside the capital building large number of protesters gathered to call for an end to the war and the humanity Arian crisis in Gaza several were arrested after clashes between police and protesters he doesn't belong here we're going to see a free Palestine and we're going to keep fighting want this war to stop and we would like us arming of any war crimes to stop it's uh disgraceful that they invited him this prime minister doesn't not represent Israel anymore 70% of the popul thinks he should resign he's responsible for uh a lot of the issues Israel is facing now and his government is completely incompetent and they're not able to handle the situation inside the house chamber Netanyahu blasted the demonstrators well I have a message for these protesters when the tyrants of Teran who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising promoting and funding you you have officially become Iran's useful idiots this is netanyahu's first visit to the us since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel and he is due to meet with President Joe Biden on Thursday and earlier I asked DW's Jerusalem correspondent Tanya ker if the Prime Minister speech to the US Congress is likely to persuade his critics in Israel well I don't think so because there has been a lot of criticism even ahead of him traveling to Washington with his critics saying among them also many relatives of the hostages that are still being held captive in Israel saying he shouldn't go to Washington he should work on a deal and at least if he goes to Washington he should announce that a deal a ceasefire deal that would see the release of those remaining hostages uh would be close and this certainly didn't happen now we have of course his DieHard supporters uh they have been saying in reaction to that that you know they highlighted the many standing ovations he got for his speech where he struck a bipartisan tone at times but also saying you know our enemies are your enemies uh to the Americans but at the same time we just heard it also in the report a majority in most of the major polls uh that have been conducted here in recent months a majority of Israelis want him to resign as prime minister over the failures that led to October 7 and they also want to see progress in uh uh this hostage deal uh hostage deal but the speech didn't give any indication uh where this is at and uh you know also disparaging uh some of the protests some of them were relatives of hostages and supporters from Israel traveling uh there so I don't think uh you know his critics uh will uh will appreciate what he did there in Congress in these negotiations over a hostage deal are set to continue rather set to resume in Doha will this trip have an influence on the outcome of those negotiations well this is still to see because from what we understand on on last Sunday the prime minister's office said uh uh this week there will be uh uh a delegation leaving on Thursday uh today uh to Doha to continue those talks this as far as we understand uh trip has been postponed because uh first today uh US President Joe Biden and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet in Washington so there a lot of eyes on this meeting where it's expected that both are talking also about uh the uh the ceasefire deal uh you know there there is a saying by officials that the main framework has been agreed upon but there are many many details that remain in gaps uh remain open so for the moment we don't know exactly where those negotiations stand about that meeting between President Biden and prime minister Netanyahu vice president kamla Harris is also expected to be there there today Biden did not invite Netanyahu to Washington he was there at the request of congressional Republicans is that likely to be a tense meeting well I mean it will be interesting to see uh both leaders uh meeting uh in this context right now because both have rather strained relations that doesn't say Joe Biden is a very strong support supp his support for Israel also during wartime is iron glad and we have heard uh Netanyahu trying to make an overt to Biden thanking him for his efforts uh uh for uh Israel but he also thanked uh uh former president uh Donald Trump uh for all what he has done for Israel and we're expecting those both leaders to talk about uh several issues among them we heard uh that's probably from the Israeli side prime minister Netanyahu who said that he wants uh you know more arms shipment uh faster and more uh Supply we could uh think that the Americans would rather talk about uh humanitarian Aid to Gaza also obviously about the hostage deal and Israel's conduct of war and that comes after netan said in a speech to Congress yesterday he claimed basically that there were almost no civilian casualties in the offensive in Rafa so I think both have a lot to talk about but uh again it's also to see what leverage uh uh Joe Biden has and now that he's dropping out of the presidential race you know how much pressure he will exert on Benjamin Netanyahu we'll leave it there for the moment DW's Tanya krer in Jerusalem thanks so much uh quick look now at some other stories making news around the world Australia says it is sanctioning seven Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank because of their involvement in violent attacks against against Palestinians Australian prime minister Anthony albanesi says settlements in the West Bank are an impediment to a two-state solution the EU and the US have already sanctioned some Israeli settlers
