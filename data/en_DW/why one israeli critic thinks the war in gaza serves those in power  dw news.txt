Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed International accusations that Israel is deliberately targeting and starving civilians in Gaza Netanyahu described the killing of at least 45 civilians in a refugee camp near Rafa earlier this week as a quote tragic mistake the Israeli military said it had targeted two Hamas leaders at the location Israeli troops have pushed further into the southern city of Rafa in defiance of international pressure Netanyahu insists his government's goal is to eliminate Hamas after the group launched the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel John Mina for more is Edgar Kret he is one of Israel's most prominent authors and a vocal critic of Benjamin netanyahu's government welcome Mr krro thanks for making the time you recently wrote in an article and I'm going to quote from it but I've shortened this slightly there may be no clear Direction but there is one goal prime minister Netanyahu wants to avoid being convicted in the three criminal cases against him for corruption unquote so this is all this war is all about saving his skin I I think that in we are caught in a in a very strange situation in which the two people who have the greatest in initi initiative that this war will never Never End are sin as the head of theas knows that the moment that the war will be over he will lose his power you know maybe lose his life it depends on the circumstances but for sure will not control Gaza and knows that the moment that this war will be over the moment that there will be some kind of a break you know the demand for election the demand for a government that has is widely supported by the public you know I I read in some of the post that only 20% support netan as a prime minister at the moment at the in the moment of War where everybody should be gathering around him so it feels as if like this momentum of War it's something that kind of slows down a democratic processes that keeps away some questions that you say okay we're going to ask them on a quieter day and that's a a very dangerous situation when when the people in charge are basically holding the the society in captivity they're basically kind of leveraging reality for their own end and in and hundreds and thousands they have to pay for that you know in in their lives they being uprooted from their homes right you know it's more apparent in Gaza but this happens in Israel too where people who who were living in the northern part of the city you know didn't visit their home since the 7th of October when they were evacuated this this war has been on for a little over seven months I think uh has prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made Israel safer since the 7th of October ER for sure it didn't and I'm saying for a few reason one one of them is that this government keeps inciting except they against everyone you know the Prime Minister himself tweeted in the beginning of the war against the chief of staff and the the head of the Secret Service you know and all this idea of this government we didn't know anything it just everybody else's fault it's it causes a a Rapture in the society instead of us being in a situation where people will say okay here is a guy who acknowledges his mistakes who think he did something wrong and wants to fix it but what we have is a government that basically accuses everybody else for what's happening and doesn't assume responsibility which rips the Israeli Society apart apart from that you know it's a right-wing a government with many mic and racist representative in it that basically you know you go to hug and you hear ministers saying things that I want to believe do not represent the Israeli Spirit and the Israeli people they they're just kind of like a hijacked you know our democracy into that direction and they they're putting Israel in isolation from the the Western R by taking actions like entering Rafa attacking in Rafa in the in the ways that they they've attacked refusing American demands all those kind of things are are creating a situation in which basically we keep attacking in Gaza with no strategy with no thought of the day after you know with no h thoughts of how this kind of a a Palestinian Society will get up from a this war and be able to create something that that can live by Israeli side and basically aspiring for Palestinian state but we're not doing it because in this government there are a few members who can take this government down who do not want a Palestinian state so it seems as if like a the the political extremist are kind of waging the dog netan end has to bend and to go on with their demands you know basically this has an effect of about of the kidnap not being able to return of course Hamas is Playing Tricks and he's unfair and he's doing everything badly but I think that as a citizen I don't have a feeling on the other side that there is a government that its first in initiative is to bring those citizens home it seems as if the first initiative is to keep fighting Hamas you know you have these views against prime minister Netanyahu and you were saying a little earlier there's only 20% of the population that that support venam in Netanyahu but the Israeli public doesn't think the same really does it because it is just on Wednesday that the respected Channel 12 ran a snap survey and found that the majority of respondents think Mr Netanyahu is a more capable leader over his rival cabinet minister Benny Gant so there is sizable support for Mr nanaho isn't there yeah but but I I but I think that what can be tricky about that is that when first of all it's the first time in a very long time you know when you do enough spins then in a certain day you can rise a little bit over the people who are against you but you but you must remember that the alternatives to netan are a few so when you see how those percentages break the question is not if he gets more than another person but how many people actually support him and you know and I'm saying we are in situation where the majority of the public in all the poll says that this government should resign you know even among the people who supported theud you know you have more people who are critical of the way of the that this government that function and is functioning than people who are supporting it so I think that Theos that you're talking about shows what a a critical lack of leadership Israel is in that Nan gets more than his rivals because you don't recognize any charismatic Alternatives that can get people around it but the one thing for sure the majority of the people do not want netan you know so if some of his supporters still stay with him and help him beat this little poll it's okay the the important poll is that the majority of the public wants him to resign and that you know at some stages you know 80% of them thought that he was unfit to be a prime minister you know Mr Carrot you're one of Israel's most well-known authors you're internationally acclaimed and you write about the human condition in sometimes surreal and dark situations I wonder do you have some words that describe the situation with the war right now well for me it feels more anarchistic and chaotic than anything you know all my life being a left Wier I found myself a fighting against a different ideology but right now I don't feel that as if I'm facing an ideology there is no ideology it's just a bunch of people that each of them has their narrow interest you know helping the outra Orthodox helping the the settlers a I don't know advancing homophobic agenda it doesn't matter what it is it's a cluster of of Bandits you know that are basically snatching and changing whatever they can and the even move in a very unpredictable and inconsistent manner they can say one thing they can say the other but what stays behind it is very very narrow goal and all this thing is breaking the Israeli Society apart because you don't have any figures that you can look to and say here is the person you know who leads me and who really think of all of us as a society not only of helping his supporters and punishing the people who didn't vote for him we'll leave it there for the moment but thanks so much for joining us today from Tel Aviv Israeli author edar KR pleasure talking to you sir
