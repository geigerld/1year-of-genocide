Israel's offensive in Rafa has put relations with its neighbor Egypt under severe strain Egypt has for decades co-operated on security Arrangements along its border with Gaza but Cairo suspended that cooperation when Israeli troops took over the gazan side of the Rafa border crossing the move could have far-reaching implications for both countries and for the people of Gaza Israeli soldiers in Rafa the biggest Crossing for Aid coming into aaza now shut off Israel has opened other Crossings further north but this one has special significance the other side of the Rafa Crossing is Egypt the country shares a 206 km long border with Israel but it's the 12 km where Egypt borders Gaza that are now in dispute for decades Israel has relied on Egypt to help Implement security Arrangements in Gaza as well as for delivery of food and other necessities that cooperation all dates back to the Camp David Accords which came after years of conflict including three Wars signing the Accords was a major strategic step changing the Dynamics in the region Egypt's substantial military was no longer a threat it also resulted in a shift in US policy Egypt became a major recipient of American foreign aid but Israel's cooperation with with its closest partner in the Middle East is over for now Egypt says the IDF takeover of the Gaza side of the Raa Crossing violates treaties that say the Zone should be demilitarized in addition Egypt has now announced it will join South Africa's case against Israel for genocide at the international court of justice adding to Israel's International isolation Us Media have also reported that Egypt May downgrade its diplomatic ties with Israel however Egypt cannot afford to alienate the US it's also worried about a possible Palestinian Exodus into Egypt itself so there are reasons to resume cooperation with Israel at some point in the future tww Middle East analyst J Shani rosanis can tell us more welcome shanie so we have relations now uh between Israel and Egypt at their tensest since the Camp David Accords were signed and despite this Israel determined to continue its operation into into into Rafa explain to us why why is Rafa so important to them well for Israel Rafa is basically the last strong hold of Kamas they for Nan he has built the last months Rafa is the only thing stopping Israel from the Victory and the total elimination of Hamas so he needs to do that for his political standing but also technically the The Crossing in Rafa has been hamas's main getaway uh point you know that was the place where they got most of their supply from through Egypt it's also what caused a lot of tensions once October 7th uh you know the catastrophe has has unveiled itself and Israel slowly realized how much uh arms Hamas has been holding through you know been Gathering through the RAF Crossing um and starting to be a bit more before that Israel was more trusting of the Egyptian handling of that border and suspicion has buil up since so Rafa um is is just the point where everything boils down to it's now the main crossing point for aid but also has been uh for many years the crossing point from other Goods that not necessarily what Israel wanted to be see to see going into the Gaza Strip okay so Israel goes into Rafa despite uh the United States the United Nations the the UK and so many of its allies saying don't do this what happens after Rafa well that's the million-dollar question it's always there you know we've been having this question in our minds you know when it comes to Gaza and what happens you know what Israel's plan for the day after in so many aspects and we've see we're seeing very little answers um technically about dealing with the crossing and and the the transfer of goods between J uh Gaza and Egypt Israel is planning to have some other neutral forces not the Palestinian Authority uh which was actually we know refus to do that as long as Israel is in control of Gaza um but rather a private company who deals with that but there also there's a lot of legal um elements connected to that if that if that company is is is a foreign nationality does what does it do when you know there's there's something happening at the border is Israel shooting at British or American or whoever you know will be maintaining that what would that mean so Israel doesn't really have a very good concrete plan for the day after and this is partially why we we're seeing this pressure for the Americans they're saying we don't see where this is heading we we don't see what's the end game and and we're trying to you know Steer Israel away from that but so far with no not much luck okay so talk to us change of Direction talk to us about Aid flows into Gaza at the moment well it it's you know it's always been a topic and you know blocking the RAF Crossing which is the Egyptians have decided basically they do not want to cooperate with Israel once Israel took over the um Palestinian side of the Border because of the symbolism of Israel taking uh over this part of land and sort of taking over Gaza and the fear that they might seem complicit with Israel taking over that part um but also we know that the economy the the money that is um the that Crossing has been generating for Gaza was was quite big especially knowing that um the suat canal trade has been cut off because of the houthi uh threat and so on Egypt has taken a very big uh toll to its income in the last months and sort of trying to kind of uh make Rafa kind of help to to to do that um the problem now is that as long as as there is no uh Crossing from Egypt a lot of the goods that have been sent to Gaza were going to Elish to the Egyptian uh Port ports and now they have no way into Gaza and this is part of the leverage that Egypt is trying to use against Israel journalist Kareem El guari has been following this story for us he joins us now from Cairo Kareem both Israel and Egypt blame each other for blocking aid from entering into Gaza what's actually preventing that aid from entering through the Rafa Crossing well first and foremost on the other side is an active combat zone right now with the Israeli Army on the ground fighting um nobody of his same mind will drive a truck into this area right now uh the second reason is of course the both of them remained closed and there is right now as you mentioned in the report the Egyptians stopped the security cooperation with the Israeli Army in the immediate border area and that's another reason while there is no coordination for this Aid coming back into the Gaza Strip which is of course important for the entire Southern Garden strip the border that opened by Israel is in the north so far away from this area which is a big problem for them in the Rafa and also in the central Gaza area now Israel has seized control of the Gaza side of the Rafa Crossing kareim why is that such an issue for Egypt well Egypt war Israel since weeks not to do an incursion into Rafa they pleaded to the Americans to make sure that this is not happening now that is happening Egypt is reacting to this stopping the security cooporation uh and also wanting to join the case of South Africa uh in the international court court of justice in the where Israel is accused of committing genocide and there's now talk about downgrading uh the relations there's maybe talk about D drawing the Egyptian ambassador from Israel um the Egyptians are also mainly arguing that this uh incursion into the into the into Rafa and the Takeover of the border crossing violates existing contracts between both sides existing treaties between both sides where it stated that this area should be a demilitarized area where there is no heavy weapons um allowed so that's the official reason why Egypt is so angry and this reacting so uh decisively to this new incursion and to the Takeover of the water post of Fara more on this from DW special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem welcome Aya let's start with Israel's offensive in Gaza how deep into Rafa is the IDF so we're hearing from I witnesses that uh the Israelis are uh going deeper into that southernmost uh part of the strip Rafa now approaching the Eastern side of uh Rafa and we're told about uh 450,000 so almost half a million people are on the Move uh to try and Escape uh uh this um this incursion into rafah if you will but of course there are many difficulties there uh we're talking about uh people trying to move uh probably not for the first time since the War uh began after 7 months uh of constant bombardment they may not have the equipment they may not have the means to get to a safe place and at the same time uh the IDF has said last night that it is attacking Gaza from the uh South north and uh Center so for many of these civilians uh trying to escape it's it's it's difficult uh to know where to go even with the um the the the so-called safe Zone uh that is Israel has has outlined for them well meanwhile the US and the United Nations have been pressing uh Israel to reopen the Rafa border crossing for Aid deliveries why has there been so little progress there um that is unclear although yesterday we heard a statement by the Israeli foreign uh Minister saying that uh the opening of the RAF Crossing uh Now lies in the hands of uh of Egypt and this uh state has uh caused sort of a a spat now between Egypt and Israel Egypt of course being the country with the oldest peace treaty with Israel among its Arab uh uh neighbors uh with the Egyptians saying that well it's the Israelis who have now um you know occupied if you will the Palestinian side of the crossing which some experts have said is actually in violation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel so there seems to be a bit of confusion and perhaps even a of deflection on Israel's responsibility there with that statement but unclear why that opening is not open yet certainly something that uh many in the International Community would like to see as hunger and and Desperation are are spread inside the Gaza Strip okay thank you for that a DW special correspondent Aya Ibrahim in Jerusalem
