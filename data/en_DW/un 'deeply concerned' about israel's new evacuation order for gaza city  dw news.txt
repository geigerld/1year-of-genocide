to the Middle East now and the United Nations says it is deeply concerned about a new evacuation order issued by Israel on Wednesday for the second time since the start of the war with Hamas all residents of Gaza City have been told to leave Israel says it is now targeting several areas where it believes the remaining Hamas militants have regrouped smoke seen over Gaza City just hours after Israel dropped lifl lets telling all its residents to flee the order sent thousands of Palestinians on the run again I'm South because of the blocking of phone services and the harsh living conditions and also the lack of food and water dozens of Palestinians were reported killed across Gaza over the past few days after the Israeli Army once again stepped up its operations against Hamas Israel says it main goal is to destroy the remaining militants we have no interest in harming civilians in Gaza City or anywhere else we're trying to get to the terrorists where the terrorists uh attack from or where they have uh set up base the Israeli military says it has pulled out its forces from Gaza City's Shaya District after they completed a two-e operation there some of the residents went back there to to assess the damage after the first incursion we came here and repaired our houses and in order to shelter ourselves we fixed the windows and covered them with plastic sheets we have returned to Shaya after 15 days you can see the destruction they spared nothing even trees there was a lot of greenery in this area what is the guilt of stone and trees and what is my guilt as a civilian as Israeli soldiers return to some area that had previously been declared clear of Hamas civilians in Gaza continue their search for a safe place we're going to cross to Gaza now and bring in Scott Anderson who's the director of Affairs in Gaza for unra the United Nations relief Agency for Palestinian refugees Scott thank you so much for making time for us what can you tell us about the impact of the evacuation order uh for Gaza City where are people heading thank you for having me on this afternoon and what we've seen is a population of about 250,000 people in Gaza City that have been displaced again uh almost all of that population has been displaced at least once if not twice and many is seven or eight times and they've been on the move trying to find safety uh they moved West the IDF has reported they pulled out and they came back East some have come South uh we spent a lot of time recently just trying trying to figure out where people people are moving uh we do know that thousands have come across the checkpoint um into um the south of w Gaza into the middle area and we're trying to ascertain the condition of these people what their needs are while at the same time trying to figure out where people are in the north what their needs are and how we can meet them I understand that you are in conun at the moment that's further south than Gaza City can you tell us what the the current situation is there I mean are people there relatively safe I mean nowhere in Gaza is completely safe uh we've seen that unfortunately throughout the nine months of this conflict where innocent civilians have suffered from the ongoing operations uh the ongoing battle between Israel and Hamas what we're seeing here in conun is people still trying to recover from an operation or battle that took place here toward the end of uh last year um and people are just trying to remove Rubble uh find safe places for them and their family and most importantly people are trying to access clean drinking water uh clean drinking water is one of the bigger challenges it's very hot here in Gaza at the moment people don't have access to electricity or air conditioning and it's very hard for them to cool off so at a time when we need more access to clean and cool drinking water what we have is people have about 10% of what they should every day um you know that and the close living conditions always make us concerned about about a possible outbreak of disease but for the most part people spend all day every day just trying to their basic needs and keep themselves and their families safe Scott Israel has struck several schools in recent days including of course one run by your organization in central Gaza the Israeli military says terrorists were operating from the unra Run school and in the unra headquarters in central Gaza where and I'm quoting here it says operational activity is continuing could you give us your response to that accusation yeah certainly I mean we've been calling for independent investigations into what's happened at the installation since the beginning of the conflict um that's something we would re reiterate a call for similarly we've called on all parties to the conflict to respect the sanctity of un installations to respect the sanctity of hospitals um so that people that are innocent of civilians can seek refuge and be safe and while the the war between Israel and Hamas continues um the only other thing I would offer about our headquarters is we left there in October we have not been back since so it's almost impossible for us to ascertain if there is any truth to the allegations or what is happening uh in Gaza City okay so you can't deny that there may have been activity in your in the unra um properties in the unra buildings I can't State one way or another because we aren't there we haven't been north of waza with an overnight president since October uh when we left and everyone moved South um so there's no way to respond to the allegations uh one way or the other Scott Anderson andr director of Affairs in Gaza Scott thank you so much for your time today thank you very much bye
