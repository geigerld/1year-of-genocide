I'm Phil Gail welcome to the program the UN Security Council is trying to reach a compromise to pause the fighting in Gaza a vote is expected shortly an initial draft resolution called for an urgent and Lasting cessation of hostilities to allow the unimpeded access of humanitarian Aid negotiators are now seeking a compromise acceptable to the US which has blocked previous calls for a ceasefire International pressure on Israel to end hostilities has grown as faces a deepening humanitarian crisis our correspondent Janelle Duman joins us from Washington welcome Janelle why does this vote keep getting postponed indeed now this vote has been Pro postponed from yesterday to this morning to noon to mid-afternoon now to late afternoon eastern time it might not be the last postponing uh hard to tell at this stage but essentially negotiators are looking for language that would keep the US from vetoing a ceasefire resolution in Gaza now if you recall earlier this month the US did just that it vetoed a resolution in contrast to the other un Security Council Members who overwhelmingly supported the resolution but the US position has always been that a ceasefire only helps Hamas however this time around although the White H house has said that it can't support any reference to a sensation of hostilities it has pushed for watered down language calling for the suspension of hostilities now this latest draft resolution that was made available had both phrases in it so first it called for the Urgent suspension of hostilities and then urgent steps to be taken towards the sustained cessation of hostilities but this word cessation it remains a sticking point for us negoti ators another sticking point is that the US wants to see text in the resolution specifically condemning Hamas uh for its actions on October 7 the text did not have that it had a more General condemnation of Terror terrorist acts in the world but especially the negotiators negotiating on the behalf of the Arab states uh they've said that they don't want to introduce any more changes in the draft unless the US promises not to veto and that is how we got to the waiting game that we find ourselves in now right and so the the we have sides that seem quite dug in and the us being the hold out what are the chances that the US will vote in favor of something in the end well the protracted nature of these negotiations kind of make it hard to tell on the one hand as you say it shows that there's a really big gap to bridge between especially the Arab negotiators and the US negotiators on the other hand the fact that they are talking and it's taking this long that could also mean that the US is willing to negotiate at least on some points remember that you the US's options here aren't limited to voting in favor or vetoing the us could also abstain and because you only need nine votes and no vetos for the resolution to pass that would then be a scenario where this resolution passes and just the fact that the US has indicated a little bit of flexibility now with regards the language is already that already represents some movement from its previously very very tightly held position and that in turn could reflect growing impatience with Israel uh let's not forget that pressure is mounting on the Biden Administration to push Israel to do more to protect civilians and as uh the death toll in Gaza approaches 20,000 according to the Hamas run Health Ministry it's clear that us urging isn't doing that much and the US is now in a position where it really has to review all the options it has on the table okay thank you for that Janelle Janelle dumal in Washington well the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 100 Palestinians have been killed by the latest Israeli air strikes in the last day several countries including Germany classify Hamas as a terrorist organization entire buildings reduced to Rubble in Rafa many civilians were killed in the strike despite the city's designation as a safe Zone by Israel a Survivor pulled from the rubble Mourns her younger sister and says she now narrowly escaped death herself a wall collapsed towards me there was maybe just an inch left between me and the wall I held it there it was so heavy I started screaming for help hoping someone anyone could hear me after being freed from the rubble another Palestinian woman is taken to al- NASA hospital where she consoles surviving family members wrapped in white are the bodies of her two grandchildren we were sleeping safely in our home those are kids kids and us women there was no one else my two grandkids were killed Amir here she was just 2 weeks old her birth wasn't even registered yet she doesn't even have a birth certificate Palestinians here say they are left to deal with the insufferable pain of loss alone straight to our correspondent Rebecca rits in Jerusalem welcome Rebecca if Israel's president Herzog says his country is ready for another humanitarian pause people are bound to ask well why is the fighting continuing well Phil I can only assume that the fighting is continuing because Israel hasn't met its military aims yet those military aims of eliminating Hamas it is it is promised it is going to continue until those aims are met and we know that of course the fighting we did see the fighting stop for several days for that temporary ceasefire to allow for the exchange of hostages but those negotiations broke down and since then the negotiations haven't been going on as you rightly mentioned there Israel's Israel pres Israel's president Isaac Herzog has said that Israel would would be willing ready to go back to the negotiating table and over the weekend there were reports that Israeli negotiators and Qatari negotiators met in Norway to discuss the resumption of those talks and that that will continue we're seeing the US defense secretary uh Lloyd Austin now in Qatar also trying to to get those talks back up and running but so far uh they haven't begun and we've heard from the other side there has to be somebody to negotiate with and Hamas saying that they're not not willing to come to the negotiating table until there is a complete ceasefire so at the moment uh those talks stalled uh and and not looking to resume anytime soon though we know that in the past uh they were also from both sides saying that they weren't going to join the talks and in the end they did and they were successful in getting out more than 100 hostages and releasing also some Palestinian prisoners and seeing a pause in that fighting so the Hope Still Remains that that will continue again soon but at the the moment we're just seeing the fighting continue so if no pause in fighting uh is Israel likely to scale back its ground offensive as the United States has been calling for we've certainly seen no sign of that uh or any even indication from Israel that they're willing to do that we know that the fighting continues we're not International journalists are not on the ground we're not able to see exactly what is going on we have to take accounts media accounts from from the from the ground from local reporters and also what we're hearing from the Israeli military uh and from all accounts the fighting continues we know that air strikes killed uh 13 people in a strike in jabalia Camp that's in the very north of the strip we also know that 28 Palestinians were killed in the south in an air strike and that a hospital in the north was also raided by ground troops we know that the ground uh operation continues so uh definitely no look of a let up but as you mentioned the US really pushing for Israel to move to another phase of this war a less intensive phase as they call it they're really uh urging Israel to try to diminish the civilian casualties to diminish the amount of Palestinians that are dying we know that the death toll is nearly at 20,000 uh so you know huge amount of people dying in the effort to eliminate Hamas and the US really pushing for Israel to look towards a more targeted approach to try and put in small specialized teams that will go into the cities and and Target specifically Hamas leaders and Rebecca the Israeli Army says it suspended several reservists as a video showing the mocking Palestinian detainees were circulated online what more can you tell us well it's not the first video of its kind that we've seen circulating Phil since the beginning of this war there have been numerous videos of IDF brutality and IDF humiliation that have been circulated of often times on the soldiers own social media accounts that they're actually uh you know like presenting this themselves uh on this occasion and we've seen in other occasions earlier in the week also in Janine there were soldiers that went into the mosque in Janine and and were singing Hanukah songs over the Lou speaker they were also reprimanded uh and taken out of service that situation is being investigated and this uh this new video that has emerged showing uh the idea of soldiers sitting there with some Palestinians bound and blindfolded on the ground smoking shisha and eating chips and laughing about what they hope for Gaza uh that is the latest video to cause an uproar and as you rightly mentioned that the IDF have they are investigating the situation and they told DW that the behavior of those soldiers in the videos is deplorable uh and they said that it stands in STK contrast contrast to the values of the IDF the Israeli military and that there will be a disciplinary hearing and the reserve OB erve Duty soldiers that were on uh that were in that video were suspended until further notice so they're definitely at least trying to take these uh accounts very very seriously um but we don't know exactly what will happen to these soldiers whether whether there really will be a major investigation or whether this sort of presents some kind of culture within the Israeli military that they're sort of tacitly allowing this but certainly these incidences are being investigated and and the soldiers being potentially punished for these acts thanks for that Rebecca Rebecca rits in Jerusalem let's pick up some of those points with Doren spilman who speaks for the IDF the Israeli military welcome to DW we just heard there from Rebecca about the possibility of Israel Defense Forces taking a more targeted approach is that something you're looking at and what would that actually look like thank you for having me uh you know from the very beginning we've tried to be uh very targeted and very precise in what we're doing what we have to understand is that we're dealing with perhaps the most difficult uh Urban landscape that has been approach from a military perspective perhaps in the world you're dealing with very close Alleyways buildings very closely situated next to each other and Hamas which has embedded themselves amidst those civilians and are keeping them there and so this is an almost an incredibly difficult battle for anyone to fight certainly for the idea of to fight and despite all of this we are trying with our aerial support to gather intelligence we try to choose our Munitions very carefully we have called off numerous flights and we're open to ideas on how to do this better okay so can can I just interrupt you there so does that mean that um you're going to proceed as carefully as you already have or does that mean that when um the US uh defense secretary says you can do this in a more targeted way in an even more targeted way that he's talking nonsense look we are always open to ideas uh certainly from Lloyd Austin who's the US defense secretary has an enormous amount of experience as do the generals that are leading Israel and how to be more precise when you're dealing with this type of difficult Urban landscape you know we also heard uh from the defense minist the defense uh secretary spokesman Kirby who said just the other week that he doesn't know if even the US would take the precautions that Israel is taking to try to protect civilian life I mean again with the the at the end of the day you're dealing with Hamas who is purposely holding these people hostage their own civilians and putting them in the line of fire okay if anyone has an idea of how to do this better we want to know because that's our goal you say you're open to suggestions okay I'll play you a short clip now a comments from the US defense secretary and your own defense minister and then perhaps get your reaction soon we will be able to to distinguish between different areas in in Gaza in every area uh where we achieve our mission we will be able to uh transition gradually uh to the next phase and start working uh on bringing back local population we also have some great thoughts about um how to transition from high-intensity operations to a lower intensity and more surgical operations okay so Doran Spelman you you you said uh more surgical operations is something you can look at but no changes yet let's pick up the your defense um Minister's comments about the 1.9 million Palestinians who are displaced in Gaza does that wait wait I'll ask my question and then you can come back to me so we have nearly two million Palestinians displaced in Gaza does that mean that many of them from what we just heard from your defense minister does that mean many of them will soon be able to return to the rubble of their former homes first of all I want to correct something that you said I am not saying that nothing has changed up till now I never said those words what I am saying is that we're dealing with incredibly difficult fighting in an incredibly difficult difficult Urban setting one of the things that we've done we've provided proof as I mentioned earlier is that we've called off aerial attacks specifically because we recognize that there are civilians in that area however at the end of the day Israel is an autonomous sovereign country our first role is to protect Israeli civilians in order for Israeli civilians to go to sleep at night and I think the same would be true of England Germany France or America or any other country in the world they would not tolerate a massive terrorist entity that is calling for their destruction to exist so Hamas has to be destroyed how they're going to be destroyed in the time frame we are constantly flexible and constantly trying to learn how to do this better none of that addresses the question I I asked you um let's move on though CU I'd like your reaction to this latest video that has surfaced on social media it shows Israeli soldiers in the West Bank laughing and eating snacks in a room with at least seven detained and blindfolded Palestinians how did this video come about and what do you think of the behavior of your soldiers the I thought you were going to play the video in Li of playing the video what I can tell you is that again I would have to see the video that you're speaking about an unconfirmed video here we go so your reaction again I can barely see what's happening in that video and the videoos unconfirmed and I from what I understand you're you're you're perhaps trying to speak about the behavior of IDF troops IDF troops we have a very strict code of conduct and anybody who violates that code of conduct is held up to a very high standard I think it's extremely important to not lose sight of where we're going with this if IDF troops don't act correctly they're reprimanded Kamas Fighters are told to rape kill and maim Israeli civilians they are holding right now 129 Israeli hostages and I haven't heard you mention anything about this talking to H I'm talking to really think that worldus are raping killing and not even giving food to these people as opposed to Israeli soldiers 350,000 of which what I see in that video is Israeli soldiers sitting around with detainees on the ground I don't know what to make of it I do know what to make of Hamas terrorist all right and and and if I had a spokesperson from Hamas I would be asking them I'm asking you because you're from the ID about a a video that the IDF has confirmed is genuine you've said that that as far as you can tell um This falls short of what you would expect from your soldiers but the people would look at this and note that this is just one of several videos and images that have emerged in recent weeks showing IDF soldiers abusing or humiliating detained Palestinians and then last week IDF soldiers shot and killed killed Israeli hostages who were believed at that time to have been waving a a red flag and the question becomes are your soldiers out of control again I'm first of all did not say that this video represents anything because I don't know that video it has not been confirmed by the IDF nor am I able to understand what's happening there a bunch of guys sitting around with people sitting around and detain these on the ground idea of soldiers are detaining Hamas terrorists who are trying to kill them at all times and as I mentioned to you earlier the IDF has a very high level of Integrity that it demands and of the 350,000 soldiers who are now in reserves that were called into reserves as a result of an imminent threat against the Israeli population if any of them are out of control or act incorrectly they are called to task for it and they are punished however I'm trying to find out how are we are we looking at this as some type of contrasting to the behavior of a murderous teror regime I'm not let me just stop you there because we're not comparing love to hear are not comparing and contrasting anything uh Doran Spiel but what we are doing what I am doing is speaking to you as a representative of the IDF about the activities of the IDF thank you so much for joining us have a good day you
