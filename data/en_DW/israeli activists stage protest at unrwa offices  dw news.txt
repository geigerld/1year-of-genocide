protests are taking place in Jerusalem outside offices of the UN relief Agency for Palestinians anra dozens of Israelis are demanding the return of hostages and are accusing anra of involvement in the hamas-led terror attacks on October the 7th now this comes as an independent review of those charges first leveled in January by the Israeli government is due earlier Israel denied anra Chief Philip lazarini access to Gaza he's warning that the territory faces a man-made famine his agency is trying to win back funding that was suspended by donor Nations after Israel made those accusations of anr's involvement and for more on this I'm joined Now by DW's Rebecca ritters who's uh at anra headquarters in Jerusalem uh re Rebecca there are these protests underway uh where you are what is it the people are demanding exactly well an you can see behind me I am outside the headquarters and this is where for the last couple of hours protests protesters rather have been Gathering though it's really dwindled now to just a couple of dozen uh at its biggest I'd say there were were certainly less than 100 people here so it's a relatively small protest much smaller than protest organizers were expecting and also the media who here it sometimes outnumbered the protesters uh but when you speak to the protesters they say despite its size they really are speaking for a broad spectrum of Israeli society and we have indeed been hearing horns of of support being honked as as drivers pass by but that hasn't really resulted in a huge turnout here today but these people are calling on unra to release the hostages as they've been chanting they say that unra equals Hamas so they're really putting a lot of blame into the United Nations Organization for Palestinian refugees saying that it is a mindset that they have been perpetrating that uh or or um have been allowed to have been encouraging over the decades that have really set the mindset for an attack like October 7 they're placing a lot of blame they had uh you can possibly see behind me they have a display here of body bags and they've created a un vehicle as though those body bags are inside the vehicle being taken outside placing blames fair and square on the unra organization but as I say it has a very small protest uh and though uh some of what these people are saying does have broad spectrum support it remains to be seen just how much that is U you know more of a a widespread opinion here in Israel so this interim report on the uh role alleged role of unra in the October the 7th Terror attacks on Israel is due to be released can you just tell us a little bit more about that yeah this is an independent report that was commissioned by the head of unra in fact Philip Philip lazarini just shortly after those accusations were made by Israel in late January that 12 staff members of onra were involved in these uh in the attack of October 7 uh the the report was commissioned and we're expecting the interim the report today the preliminary report that isn't expected to be made public it's just going to be going to the member states that we can expect that perhaps some leaks will come out of uh of the report we hearing some of what's in it but we can expect to hear the final report that is going to be released to the public uh later in uh sorry next month towards the end of April now it it was its remit is to look at the neutrality of unra how they hire their staff and of course how they reacted to the accusations uh after they were revealed at the end of January that some employees were in fact involved in the attack so not so much more information that we're going to be able to tell you today but hopefully uh in the next coming in the coming week we'll have a lot more information about that independent report Rebecca thanks so much that's DW's Rebecca RS reporting from
