the truce between Hamas and Israel ended after seven days now in that time Hamas and other militants in Gaza released more than 100 hostages mostly Israelis in return for the release of more than 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails extensions of the truths were negotiated with International help first and foremost from a tiny Arab Emirate whose unique influence over Hamas has attracted International attention citizens of Israel break into cheers as a convoy brings a 79-year-old hostage home Joy also in the West Bank as Palestinians welcome women and children who were released from an Israeli jail to get to this point required a flurry of diplomatic activity involving three key International Players Number One Qatar the country's leadership has direct contact with Hamas since 2012 it's hosted an overseas office for them Hamas Chief isma hania and several other Top members live in the Gulf Emirate and Qatar has used this fact to exert influence over the EU and US designated terrorist organization well we in Qatar uh have a unique uh position that a lot of countries around the world don't have uh since the United requested that we open this Channel with Hamas we have a working relationship with them and we are hopeful that through the abilities that we have that we can do things that others can do around the region and to be fully honest we have been attacked for being able to speak to Hamas being able to speak to Iran being able to speak to the Taliban being able to speak to uh to Russia at at times but somebody has to make these difficult discussions somebody has to be able to say I'm going to cross the line and make the discussions that will bring about peace peace doesn't happen unless there is dialogue peace didn't happen but a paus and fighting did also through dialogue with Israel a country with which DOA has no official diplomatic relations behind closed doors qatar's prime minister has hosted the chiefs of both us and Israeli intelligence agencies and last weekend a jet carrying Qatari officials made its way to Israel an historic first and extraordinary moment for the two countries the talks in Israel are said to have been instrumental in Saving the original truce and extending it mediator number two the United States Israel's most important Ally has facilitated dialogue with Middle Eastern mediators and has been pushing hard for further extension to the ceasefire on Thursday morning the US Secretary of State touched down in Tel Aviv for the fourth time since the conflict escalated his stated goal a longer term solution for Israel and Gaza this process is producing results it's important and we hope that it can continue the weight of Washington's influence has been evident from the start the first two hostages who were released long before the hostages for prisoner steel took effect were US citizens but blinken's latest trip wasn't enough to prevent a resumption of fighting mediator number three Egypt the country has opened its border with Gaza to receive hostages released by Hamas and allow trucks to deliver humanitarian Aid to Gaza as part of the truce in front of the cameras and behind closed doors Egypt has also been involved in diplomatic negotiations analysts say that Egypt's influence on the Israeli Palestinian issue isn't what it once was but its interest in ending the fighting in Gaza remains Cairo doesn't want to take in the hundreds of thousands of people the war has dis for more I'm now joined by Hans yakob Schindler he's a former German Diplomat and a Middle East expert he's currently a senior director at the counter extremism project Mr Chandler it's good to have you here in the studio with us tell us more about the communication channels between Israel and Hamas in these negotiations nothing is official here right good evening thanks for having me no there is not direct contact so this goes via Qatar of course we've seen Israeli officials including high ranking intelligence officials traveling from and to Doha um but really Gat is here they go in between between Israel and Hamas and and so who's talking to whom then Gat talks to Hamas Egypt parallel and not in Doha also talks to Hamas how difficult is communication between Israel and Hamas with with all of these negotiators involved I mean do you have almost too many people whispering in in the background well this is the same challenge you have always when you have indirect negotiations right you need to be sure that your intermediator is a absolutely trustworthy and on the Qatari side I would say there is a lack of that one uh whether you actually get told the truth of what the other side wants and also you need to make understand you make to make sure that the other your intermediary understands what you want the other side to understand and vice versa so it's it's more complex but as as Israel how could they talk directly to Hamas unless it's on a very operational very direct uh intelligence level one very important Middle East player with a lot of influence on Hamas is is missing it seems and and I'm talking about Iran why is that Iran really is taking trying to take advantage of this situation right you've seen what hisbah does in the north but it just does enough to keep Israel busy but is Iran who could with one word set hisa loose on Israel because hisbah is beholden to Iran is uh essentially preserving its asset on the other hand the huthis in Yemen also a proxy of uh uh Iran is uh also doing the little that is possible to keep everyone busy so Iran is trying to position itself to get maximum benefit out of this particular situation when we talk about proxies I mean how should we understand that does Hamas um do they look to tyon for maybe deao permission to do things for example or or is the connection not quite that stringent I mean if you look at what happens on the 7th of October it really has the handwriting of Iran right what Hamas did until this pogrom like attack was very different methodologically as far as the terrorist attack is concerned it was smaller scale Terror attacks suicide bombings but not a concerned multi-hour multi-day military style terror attack that killed everyone that was inside so that is really the classic tactics that Iran has taught the militias in Iraq that has taught the isbah how he's operating in Syria so absolutely Hamas is beholden to Iran not only for the supply of weapons and and ammunition but also for money and and what is going on inside Gaza I mean Hamas is not the only player I'm thinking of Islamic Jihad for example um is Hamas does it have to make sure that all of these players are on the same page I think there's two levels here right so if you're talking about who holds more hostages and how can you know the next level of the negotiations uh be achieved and how could that go yes then Hamas has competitors in an inverted comma chiefly the Palestinian Islamic Jihad who is a much smaller self structured terrorist organization but who has no political sway in Gaza of any significant size and then there are some of these quasi criminal groups that also hold hostages but when it comes to military decision making in Gaza there really is only Hamas the the first deal between Israel and Hamas is is now his history fighting has resumed the US they've made it very clear that they expect Israel to protect Ordinary People in Gaza more than than we've seen in the past I mean that pressure is definitely stronger than before how much leverage does Washington have right now uh Washington I'm pretty sure is the only one who has actual leverage over Israel and you've seen um a few more additional attempts by Israel to demonstrate that it's trying to uh protect civilians the IDF the Israeli military released a map in which the entire Gaza Strip is divided into zones and they will announce the number of the Zone where the attack happens unusual for military to tell his adversaries publicly where they're going to attack next the price uh that they're willing to pay in order to make sure that the little as little as possible civilians going to be affected by these attacks of course that also means Hamas Fighters are not going to be necessarily in these areas anymore let me ask to look into your crystal ball how long do you think that um that the fighting will continue until we have another ceasefire another agreement in place that is really hard to tell it was very clear that this was just phase one I always said this is the confidence building phase can you actually do a deal and operationalize a deal both sides have kept their word until the very end then Hamas played around with a number of hostages went down it had a terror attack in Jerusalem now unfortunately Hamas had to end this because Hamas wants more from Israel than just three Palestinians per prisoner final question for you who is in a stronger position now compared to when the the ceasefire started Israel or heras it's really hard to tell that I don't think the relative differences have uh really militarily shifted to a great deal Israel is in a very good position to fully control the north of Gaza soon but Hamas as we have seen the last couple of hours is still able to hit back Mr Shaner as as always good to have you here in the studio we appreciate your analysis thank you thank you so much gash and Basin is an Israeli Peace activist and Middle East analyst and he helped negotiate the release of Israeli soldier gilad Shalit in 2011 and he joins us now from Jerusalem now the fighting unfortunately has resumed what does that mean for the people still being held hostage in Gaza and their chances of being released it certainly makes it much more difficult to negotiate people being bombed in Gaza and Hamas is on the Run Israel is after the Hamas leadership Israel is also certainly uh beginning search and rescue operations to find the hostages being held probably underground in Gaza in the south of Gaza it it doesn't farewell for the hostages that more negotiations and more ceasefires are not active right now to we are having a bit of trouble with the audio line there let me ask my next next question uh do negotiations even continue under these circumstances there are negotiations that are continuing this is what we've been told they are taking place in katar and in Egypt they're at a slower Pace as the fighting has resumed and I guess everyone's trying to see what will happen now what will hamas's reaction be to the renewed fighting the deal ended because Hamas stopped providing Israel with a list of hostages it was ready to release the fighting could have been postponed the deal could have continued more hostages could have been released and more Palestinian prisoners could have been released but this was a choice of Hamas not to continue with the deal and they are suffering the now with a majority of the elderly women mothers and children among the Israeli hostages released mostly men and soldiers are now left in Gaza uh does that set the bar for potential further agreements even higher there are still 17 women in children left amongst the Israeli hostages certainly when we're down to young men who Hamas considers Soldiers the price will be much much different than it was until now which was three prisoners for every hostage how M has already said that their goal is to empty the Israeli prisons from Palestinian Prisoners the latest count I've heard is that there are 7,600 who were serving life sentences for murder who were captured in Israel on October 7th it will be a very difficult if not impossible negotiation to conduct with hamas's demands being like that Israel is very unlikely to agree to them although I imagine that Israel will want to pursue the negotiations while the military actions and search and rescue operations are on Gan Basin there an Israeli Peace activist and Middle East analyst thank you very
