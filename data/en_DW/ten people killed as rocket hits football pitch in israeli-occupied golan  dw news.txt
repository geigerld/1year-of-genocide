Israel says at least 10 people have been killed in a rocket attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights the Israeli military said Hezbollah militants fired the rocket which struck a football pitch in the town of majal Shams Hezbollah has denied involvement in the attack which comes after an Israeli strike on Southern Lebanon killed several members of the militant group Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the United States Germany and several Sunni Arab countries let's get more on this developing story with a journalist balik sladin in Tel Aviv so Israel here is blaming Hezbollah for this Hezbollah denying any involvement what are we to make of this yes uh just moments ago the of spokesperson Daniel hagari said that 10 people were killed all of them are between the ages of 10 to 20 which which means we're talking about kids teenagers and blaming of course hisbah that's after the security assessments that said that hisbah fired a rocket that landed at that soccer field inside Maj sham again it's a Drew Village well in The Narrative of hisb belongs to Syria actually and we're talking about an Arab Village of course most of them don't even have any Israeli IDs now hisbah is denying their responsibility although that just like uh at 1929 um so 7:30 p.m. they took responsibility for an attack with a felic one missile uh toward a military site that is actually just a few kilometers from Maj Shams now I'm not saying that this is the same attack but it's just weird that we're talking about the same timing and only a few uh like half an hour after the attack and we're talking about the same uh incident which is one missile that landed in that area they're trying to say that it's actually an iron Dom missile so Interceptor actually that went wrong and hit that soccer field the iron D missile is an surface to air missile of course and not a surface to surface missile so different narratives here and maybe if they are denying responsibility it could also be other fractions in Lebanon maybe Hamas and Lebanon or other fractions that fight Israel alongside hisbah that could be also case but for now we're seeing that the IDF is blaming hisbah for that so a lot of open questions still the big one of course is whether this could lead to further escalation what is the risk now that Israel will launch retaliatory strikes here that will definitely happen just um um the Israeli foreign minister ISAT just said that there will be a reatory attack and it will be unproportional now that's again what everybody was afraid of that that such an incident would happen with lots of people civilians that would be killed and then Israel will have to actually uh respond to this and uh in that case uh the assessment in Israel that we are facing a few days of heavy fighting on the border um maybe different situation I don't think that we are going right now to a full thrown out war in lebano because I think the two parties has nothing to achieve here but at least least a few days or maybe weeks of a different um equation on the north from the one that we've used to uh uh since October 8th when the hostilities started so not only targeting the towns and communities that are just 5 kilometers from the border maybe we'll see that Israel would actually hit more strategic more deep inside Lebanon into hisbah infrastructure and not only uh the equation that we've used to it well thank you so much for that update that is journalist balik sedine in Tel Aviv
