the Hamas militant group together with Islamic Jihad has handed another 10 Israeli hostages and two foreign Nationals over to the International Red Cross as part of a truce deal with Israel the Israeli military says the hostages are now back on Israeli territory in exchange Israel has released 30 Palestinian prisoners who have arrived in the West Bank this comes on the fifth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas the group is considered by many countries to be a terrorist [Music] organization Ben fulin is in Jerusalem and has more Ben what's the latest on the release of hostages and prisoners hi Nicole the latest we've also received is that hamus and Islamic Jihad has handed over uh this latest group of hostages to the international Committee of the Red Cross the neutral Swiss based group uh two Thai Nationals who were uh workers here foreign workers here in Israel and then 10 Israeli women among them uh a German Jewel National according to the German foreign minister analina babok and a teenager as well Mia libag um hamus released uh a video just a short time ago of Mia being released and escorted by m militants along with her dog who'd also been captive uh taken captive on October 7 uh We've also receiv received information that the 30 Palestinian prisoners have now been transferred uh from both prison in the West Bank and here in Jerusalem 15 women and 15 minors um a lot of these prisoners who've been released over the past days have been uh jailed for attempted murder stabbings throwing of petrol bombs uh throwing of stones at Israeli soldiers and Hamas has been celebrating this as a major victory uh dozens of prisoners having been released but you have to remember that Israel has arrested an extra 3,000 Oro Palestinians just in the past weeks in the West Bank Ben is there any fresh information on this truce possibly being extended even further we're still being told that it's very unclear this uh Tuesday was the first day of the extended truce it was a wobbly day uh there were violations reported by both sides but only minor and uh minor injuries involved in those altercations according to K these were minimal breaches noted by both but they did not uh breach or harm the essence of the deal hmer says it's still committed uh we've heard tonight though that the security minister the far right security minister of Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet has been urging him to end the truce because of these violations he wants Israel to get back to war but there is so much pressure from abroad on benan Netanyahu to stick to this truce and extend it there have been meetings today in Doha uh the capital of Qatar among uh the Egyptian officials involved the mediators Qatar and also the US and Israeli spy Chiefs they're trying to get men included in these hostage releases the big question being though whether or not Hamas wants to hold on to these hostages the rest of these hostages as a bargaining chip uh Israel is not going to get them out if it doesn't extend the ceasefire but Israel also uh says that the only reason Hamas is releasing these hostages is because of so much military pressure that's it's applied both from the sea the air and the ground DW's Ben fulan reporting from Jerusalem great speaking to you and for more I am joined Now by Yan eligant the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former peace negotiator who helped draw up the Oslo agreements between Israel and Palestinians in 1993 welcome to W Mr eigel and thanks so much for your time today we're seeing a deal right now between Israel and Hamas it seems to be working so far there's a possibility of more extensions what do you think this could lead to well it could lead to a longer pause with more freed hostages more freed prisoners and to more of Gaza getting the aid it desperately needs but it could also end I mean in in a day or two and that would be catastrophic so we are urging for a prolonged ceasefire we do not think that continued Warfare would make Israel safer and it will certainly made uh make uh Gaza unlivable for 2.3 million people the best majority of them completely innocent with what H the horrors of the 7th of October at the moment we have a situation where Qatar is acting as a as a mediator between the two sides they won't speak to each other directly is this the right way to proceed in your opinion at this stage definitely yes Kat also with help of Egypt and others are bro and the United States are brokering these deals and it just shows then that yes the two sides can make agreements it's they have done so also in the in the past uh Israel have always regarded Hamas as a terrorist organization they have still broken deals uh what we hope is that the deals with expand to really do something about the siege of Gaza remember gas is a very small place I mean it's it's half of the M Municipality of Osa where I live 2.3 million people live there There Is No Escape they cannot go it's not like they have Poland like the ukrainians or or any other place to go so The Siege has to be lifted and there has to be an end to the bombardment and there has to be a release of all of the remaining hostes of course can I ask you what role you potentially see Europe play playing in the situation in any potential negotiations well Europe would be an important uh player in reconstruction in in humanitarian agreements Etc I do not necessarily see Europe in mediating an end to the occupation and the final status issues that were left unresolved with the Oslo agreement where we got Mutual recognition and we get a start of a Palestinian uh Administration and a few other things H it has to be the United States they are the only ones who can really influence Israel with Qatar Egypt Gulf countries that can in influence the very split Palestinian site you've made the urgency of the situation very clear um we've we've heard very strong rhetoric though haven't we from both sides um over the past week given this very complicated situation heated atmosphere I mean is it even possible that this could lead to more formal negotiations given the sensitivity of this I I think it has to lead to I I think the rest of the world will also demand that it has to lead to a more final settlement of this very long Israeli Palestinian conflict I don't think Hamas as an organization will be part of this Palestinians will have to be part of this I don't think the Israeli government with the that is the most extreme government in the history of Israel really with the with the people there who are who are organizing settler violence and whatnot it has to be the International Community that has to push push this really the United States Qatar Egypt Gulf countries they have to push this you've mentioned the Israeli government led by uh Benyamin Netanyahu uh the Prime Minister he has said that he is committed to Res resuming the war to ending Hamas Rule and crushing its military capabilities um what's your take on that very clear strategy in that it's not very clear the strategy is not very clear what what does that mean it it means to kill Palestinians until the last fighter is killed uh the L member of Hamas there is a lot of it's it's it's it's a it's a movement doing so social work etc as well as having the military Wing the Kasam Brigade that they want to take those killers from the 7th of October I very much understand but they have killed thousands of children now with their own bombardment the rest of the world doesn't really accept that war on terror would mean killing thousands of innocent children I wanted to ask I mean is there any way that the people in Gaza can be prot protect protected if the truce ends and fighting intensifies across all parts of the territory no I fear it will be even worse uh because more people are crammed together in a smaller area in the South if they're now coming after cunis which is the the central refugee camps where many of my colleagues my organization which refug Council has 53 colleagues inside they are Palestinians they've also fled for their lives they were told to go to the South now they've told leave the South because we're coming coming to bombard you there as well that it's meaningless to continue the war as it has been so we hope the United States and the United Kingdom and Germany that are naturally friends and and allies of Israel can convince them to Shield the civilian population which means an end to this uh bombardment which is indiscriminate Mr egland you say that you are an optimist are you still hopeful even in in these days of Crisis I'm generally an optimist that we will come out of all of the enormous crisis we have short term I am actually pretty pessimistic U remember also what you're covering here now is is is actually something deeply problematic one is selling people for for for Commodities here he has 10 hostages he has 150 prisoners he has some trucks we trade here all of this should be should not be traded about hostages should be released all of them those who are arbitrarily detained by Israel teenagers for stone throwing that sit forever in jail without Law And Justice should be released our Aid trucks should not be negotiated access we should have a right and obligation to provide uh humanitarian relief across gasa we need to resume to some sensible Humane methods here and not continue with this Yan egeland Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you so much for your time today we appreciate it I now speak to Oliver murnan in London he's a former hostage negotiator and the director of Forward Thinking and organization addressing issues related to the Middle East peace process welcome to DW now the current deal between Israel and Hamas which is of course classified by multiple countries as a terrorist organization seems to be working so far do you think this could pave the way for further negotiations well I hope so um I think anyone who is concerned about the humanitarian situation both for the hostages and their families and for the 2.3 million people in Gaza we would wish to see this temporary ceasefire become permanent because I think the only way to secure the safe release of the rest of the hostages is to have a a permanent not just a temporary ceasefire but a permanent ceasefire because from the beginning I felt the is OB the first of all to elimin and then to release hostages I think they were incompatible and hopefully now this momentum of having a truce will evolve into a permanent ceasefire and then a political negotiation um you're breaking up there I don't think your internet connection is holding up uh let's talk with our technical staff to see if we can keep it going it looks like you're back up now what do you make of the process so far with the US and Qatar acting as mediators because the two sides won't speak to each other directly how much of a hindrance is that yeah well I think I have the greatest admiration for the qari um negotiators because I can't imagine the difficulties there have at least five different um points of reference that they have to go through in order to reach agreement when I was involved with the chalit agreement it was a very simple thing of having a designated group of negotiators on the Israeli side on the Hamas side and you went between them the other thing I think that complicates the negotiation process is this constant um press conferences um in the five years that I did the Shalit deal no one knew what was going on or no one knew who was involved and I think that makes it much easier um but as I say I have the highest praise for the qari negotiators being able to deal with such a complex process you have been in touch with Hamas officials since October 7th what did they tell you about their goals in all of this well by chance I was in Doha two days after October 7th and I think it was recognized that what happened to civilians indiscriminate killing and the hostage taking a civilians wasn't right and the message I was given then was clearly that all the civilian hostages could be released without negot without negotiation or without any preconditions provided that there was um a ceasefire that would enable the coordination and the whole process to take place I communicated that message but obviously and understandably And I stress that I think Israel was very much in a traumatized situation and I think it still is and therefore needs good friends to be able to guide it in a time like this but the message wasn't heard and now what's happening I think could have happened um much earlier now Israel says they will not stop until they have crushed Hamas they also say they want all their hostages back for now both sides have only released women and children from your experience and and from what we're seeing from the Israeli side this reluctance towards a a durable ceasefire do you see any way men and and soldiers could be freed as part of a deal as well well if I may explain and in explaining I don't in any way endorse it and I'd like to stress that but the reason why um soldiers were taken was that they were seen as a leverage to ensure the release of Palestinian prisoners who otherwise would die in Israeli jail so the soldier I think is seeing in a different category from the civilian hostages I think the negotiations over the soldiers will be much more difficult and um I just sincerely hope for they too have families they too have loved ones that want them see reunited just as much as the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jail are wanted back by their families I sincerely hope that we will understand now there is no military solution to this process I think the the the reality the horror of what has happened the infliction of real hurt on both sides this is a moment when I think that we should see that it's only a political process that will find a durable solution I come from Ireland the Irish had to learn that very hard way as did the British that you couldn't have a military solution to the Irish um problem that it had to be a political process but what is essential that process has to be inclusive all the significant people with constituency need to be involved in the negotiations in the desire of what they want to see happen in an independent Palestine otherwise I fear the agreements reached as we saw with Oslo will not stand the test of time oler MC turn and a former hostage negotiator and director of Forward Thinking thanks for
