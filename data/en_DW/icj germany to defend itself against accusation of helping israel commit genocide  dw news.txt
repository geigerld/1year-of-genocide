German government lawyers will argue at the un's top court that Berlin's support for Israel does not breach international law this on the second day of a hearing at the international court of justice in the ha the case has been brought by Nicaragua which accuses Germany of quote facilitating genocide in the Gaza Strip by supplying weapons to Israel the head of Germany's legal team calls Nicaragua's case grossly biased Nicaragua's case against Germany has two main goals to Halt Berlin's military exports to Israel and to restart German funding for the un's Palestinian refugee agency their argument that Germany's actions are in breach of the genocide convention Germany is failing to honor its own obligation to prevent genocide or to ensure respect of international humanitarian law Germany's supply of arms to Israel is a central pillar of Nicaragua's case Germany is Israel's second largest armed supplier behind the United States accounting for about 30% of all Israel's weapon Imports Nicaragua argues that by continuing to provide these weapons Germany is enabling Israel to commit acts of genocide in Gaza the international court of justice is currently examining whether Israel has committed genocide in a separate case launched by South Africa in bringing this case before the court Nicaragua says it is acting on behalf of the Palestinian people I mean this is a very important case obviously for our Palestinian Brothers but also for the people of Nicaragua as you may have heard in our expression in Nicaragua we have enormous sympathy with the Palestinians with the suffering the Palestinian people are going through and that's why we felt that we had to do something obviously the only thing in Kwa can do is use the few recourses it has and one of the few things that Nicaragua had is some experience with the international court of justice close ties between Nicaragua and Palestinian organizations date back to 1979 when Palestinian groups supported the Sandinista Guerilla forces that overthrew Nicaragua's dictatorship Germany's staunch support of Israel goes back to just after the second world war the German government sees support ing Israel's security as a historical responsibility for Germany's actions in the Holocaust Berlin categorically rejects Nicaragua's accusations Germany does not and never did violate the genocide convention nor International humanitarian law either directly nor indirectly Germany will get its chance to make its case in court on Tuesday for more let's bring in the W correspondent Luc Schon she's at the icj in the ha good to see you again Lucia now yesterday Nicaragua claimed Germany was quote facilitating genocide today it's Germany's turn to take the stand how will the delegation respond to these accusations yeah so it is expected that Germany is going to reject these allegations we've already heard yesterday from the German agent that Germany is saying that this Nicaragua presentation was grossly biased that Germany does and did not violate the genocide convention and international humanitarian law and that it is on the contrary committed to upholding international law uh in the in the international um uh in in its international relations and it is going to show today in detail how it does this and how it lives up to its responsibilities Germany has said so in about 2 hours um Germany will start with its defense and um we will then see what are the main arguments Germany is going to make to um show on the legal side uh how it is doing that and that it does not do or how it says how it's going to prove that Nicaragua's um accusations are not valid in their opinion and those are grave accusations that Nicaragua is Raising what evidence are they building their case on so Nicaragua has been mainly talking yesterday about um weapon deliveries of Germany to Israel um Germany is indeed uh after uh is after the United States uh one of the main support is with weapons there is um C pre numbers um that Germany does provide 30% um of the weapons uh to Israel and um this is the main argument I would say that um we have heard yesterday here from Nicaragua they have been giving numbers official German numbers to prove that and um it is expected also that Germany will answer to this and give their take um of what they're delivering and what that actually means okay so after today's session the court will have heard both sides what's going to happen next yeah what is really important at this stage to mention is that we are at the stage of provisional measures so at this stage Nicaragua is asking the court to order Germany to mainly stop sending military Ed to Israel as well as to start funding unra again for these provisional measures it is there is another test so to say then for the main case so these provisional measures are expected to come relatively early within weeks some people even say within two weeks this might already be the case that we have a first answer a first decision by the court and then it might move on to a latest to the latest stages uh to possibly a case on the merits but this is expect expected to take much longer L Shelton in the he thank you so much well Pro Palestinian protesters gathered outside the German Embassy in Washington to show their support for Nicaragua's KC W's Benjamin Alvarez reports these protesters are supporting the case brought before the icj accusing Germany of facilitating genocide stop this genocide different NOS have called for protest is not only here in front of the German Embassy in Washington DC but also in front of the German un mission in New York and several other consulates they say that Germany is the second biggest exporter of weapons to Israel is facilitating genocide in Gaza supporting the claims by narwa and they also handed a letter over to diplomatic stuff here saying that Germany should stop sending weapons to Israel immediately Germany is supporting uh Israel no matter what they are complicit in the crimes that Israel is committing and I feel deeply ashamed about it as a German this sets precedent for us to then turn and go back to our government and say stop arming genocide stop breaking both our domestic laws the foreign assistance act and stop breaking International humanitarian law we're here today to um let them know that we're we're aware of what of their complicity in the genocide after handing over the letter at the embassy organizers Express disappointment with the response they got from diplomatic stat Germany rejects Nicaragua's accusations as baseless and will present its argument on the second day of hearings in the Mela lski heads the human rights Hub of the fan Foundation For Freedom a foundation affiliated with Germany's free Democrats one of the parties in Germany's government Coalition Mela good to have you on DW now you say Nicaragua's case is a political red herring but if the court were to determine that Israel is indeed committing genocide it is currently still deliberating on this separate case in the Gaza Strip would Germany has the second biggest weapons supplier to Israel not bear a certain responsibility well good morning first of all Germany has always a responsibility as a weapon supplier of course that's true but Nicaragua argues that Germany violates its legal obligations of the genocide convention what Nicaragua did successfully if I may say to point a finger towards Germany and naturally people follow the direction of the finger but we should turn around and look into into the direction of the arm so that means that actually it was not a coincidence that Nicaragua submitted the application exactly on the 1 March of 2024 against Germany because the day before in the late afternoon of the 29th February here in genev at the UN Human Rights Council the experts of the UN Human Rights group on Nicaragua presented their report on grave human rights violations in the Central American country we we do want to talk about the direction the finger is pointing though because you know Israel of course has a right to defend itself against tamas Germany is assisting them in this endeavor um but providing 30% of all arms to Israel with all of these uh allegations of the rules of War being broken in Gaza is Germany downplaying its role in this no absolutely not I mean it's a legal accusation that's true and Germany as you've said in your report will reject Nicaragua's accusation and respond this morning before the court in the he but what we have to know is that Nicaragua does not allow access to justice to all its citizens so this is really an important is issue here because Nicaragua gets the media attention and it's not about genocide it's not about Israel and Gaza it's about Nicaragua putting itself on the stage of international Justice in the he today all right and Nicaragua um once again they also accuse the UK and the Netherlands and Canada of abetting genocide I do want to look at the case at the icj today it's very interesting what's happening in Nicaragua but but just to focus on what is happening today how big could this case become well I suppose that the outcome of the case today it's not a case yet so icj has not adopted it accepted it as a case it's really a first hearing today and yesterday was the hearing by Nicaragua so the outcome will probably that the Court decides it will not accept the case before the official in main case South Africa against Israel will be decided so I do not expect the case to become biger um well if they do not throw the case out um how do you think it could affect or if if the court ended up let's say ruling in favor of Nicaragua how could it affect Germany's policies in the Middle East well I cannot uh really say something about the effect because from my point of view and I'm a legally expert and I'm an expert political expert on International Justice and from my point of view they will not be an outcome it's really the case is really from Nicaragua side is an awareness raising and getting media attention really and putting itself on the case and on the stage of international Justice in the all right that was M lisovski head of the human rights Hub of the fish nowan Foundation For Freedom thank you so much for your time thank you very
