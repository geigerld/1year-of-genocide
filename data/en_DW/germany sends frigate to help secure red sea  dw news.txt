a German warship has set sail for the Red Sea to join an international mission to secure shipping in the region this comes after European Union member states gave their preliminary approval to uh European involvement uh in the mission which is aimed at eliminating the threat posed by Hy Rebels the group has been launching rocket and drone attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aiden the hooti say they fire at ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza the hooti rocket and drone attacks are disrupting one of the world's busiest cargo routes through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aiden raising worries of damage to the world economy us and UK warships have been firing back with attacks on hooy positions trying to destroy their ability to threaten shipping in the area now Germany aims to contribute to the mission to help secure the Red Sea sending this frigate the hessen with over 200 crew on board the hessen is equipped with Advanced anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems and will help in aerial defense the US the UK France and Italy already have warships in the region the hessen must make its way from all the way up here the German port of vhms halfen on the North Sea to join them so far all attacks on hooti Military sites have been carried out by the US and UK okay the EU ships are meant to intercept attacks but not take part in the assaults on hooty positions on land but even as the other warships in the area wait for the hessen the German government still needs an official mandate to participate in the mission both the European Union and Germany's Parliament must give their approval here to guide us through this story are Simon young in Berlin and Luci Schon in Brussels welcome both let's start with you uh Lucia what is the eu's stated objection uh sorry objective of this uh Mission yeah in one word it is to protect Merchant vessels or trade ships um that want to cross the Red Sea uh you can already see by the name that they're choosing for this Mission it is aspis which means shield in Greek um that the the goal is to protect these ships um the the decision right now um that has been taken today is a first step it is important to to know that there is a second step following which will be a vote um by the foreign Ministers of the European Union which is expected to be uh on the 19th of February and only then the mission will be officially launched and Simon young why is Germany taking part well I think one of the key things is because of the effects of the attacks by houthis are on German uh business when you think that 90% of globally traded goods go by sea and some of the big shipping firms are now avoiding uh the Red Sea route through sez which is the quickest way uh between Asia and Europe they're having to go around Africa instead the German uh Chambers of Commerce and Industry are warning that that means empty warehouses it means longer delivery times and it means ultimately higher prices and it's having an effect already on some German businesses one example uh Tesla which has already had to wind down uh production at its German manufacturing plants so it could uh this is already having an effect and it could get worse so Lucia Walton Simon makes a point that this uh this action in the the Red Sea having economic impacts around the world yet all 27 EU member states don't appear to to be on board yeah we have heard from the high representative Joseph Burell that not all 27 member states are on board um or not willing to participate more to say but that he's not expecting them to block the decision so there's a difference in that what you have to also take into consideration there is that um you need a certain equipment to be part of this Mission because you need a frigate you need um naval military assets and not every country in the European Union itself is a naval has a marine is a naval power so to say there are quite some countries which are landlocked so that might be part of the explanation why not everyone there is on board we have um heard from some countries that they're interested in joining uh for example Italy but also France Germany of course so you have to see that a bit in that context that not everyone has these powers and I think that gives it away um why why the member states are taking their decisions but as I have said we will have to also wait a bit longer to really see um wait for the 19th of February to see um if the vote passes and then also at a later stage the member states will really make their pledges and say um what they're going to contribute to the rsy mission and it is on a voluntary base okay uh Lucia Shulton in Brussels uh Simon young in Berlin thank you both
