the Hamas Le Health Ministry in Gaza says 500 people have been killed in a blast at a hospital in Gaza the facility was filled with Wounded patients and people seeking shelter Hamas the islamist militant Group which governs Gaza says an Israeli air strike hit the hospital but Israel says the blast came from a rocket misfired by another Palestinian militant group Islamic [Music] Jihad shocked and wounded survivors of the explosion at the Ali Hospital in Gaza City were transferred to the nearby shifa hospital where doctors are doing their best with limited space and resources to treat them hundreds of people died in the Blaster allei a hospital where many Palestinians had been seeking refuge in recent days from The Continuous shelling by Israel the terror organization Hamas blamed Israel for the attack but the IDF is denying responsibility intelligence from few sources that we have in our hands indicates that the Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza I repeat this is the responsibility of Islamic Jihad that killed Innocents in the hospital in Gaza but the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad say they are not behind the explosion Palestinians in the West Bank also blame Israel for the hospital blast anger boiled over into protests in rala just hours later protests in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza took place in Jordan and [Applause] Tunisia we won't remain silent this is a message for all Arab and non-arab countries Muslim or not we will not be silent we support the Palestinian cause and we're against what's happening in Gaza the hospital explosion also prompted Palestinian president m Abbas to cancel his meeting in Jordan with US President Joe Biden he says he needs to be in his homeland during this big ordeal well the blast came just hours before US President Joe Biden is set to touchdown in Israel as part of a diplomatic push to prevent the war with Hamas from spiraling into a wider conflict in a statement Biden said he had directed his National Security team to gather information about the explosion the president added I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ali Arab Hospital in Gaza and the terrible loss of life that resulted the United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients medical staff and other Innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy but a planned Summit in Jordan was cancelled even before the US president's jet left the tarmac Jordan's King Abdullah II and Palestinian president muhmmed Abbas pulled out after a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds of people as we mentioned the Aman Summit was meant to bring together the leaders of the US Egypt Jordan and the Palestinian Authority DW's senior International correspondent fny FAA is standing by in Tel Aviv Fannie as we heard there the US president has directed his National Security team to investigate that hospital Blast how difficult is it going to be funny to establish exactly what happened there well the question is not only just how difficult is going to be to establish any information here but also once their results beat by the United States or by Israel because Israel is claiming that they have intercepted for example communication ahead of this blast of Islamic Jihad that they blame for the attack and that they also have surveillance footage that they are likely to publish the question is regardless what's being published who is going to trust that here in the region and how that is going to influence how the conflict is going to evolve further on I have to underline here something very important right after the attack in Gaza for which Hamas militants and Israel blame each other for for killing at least 300 people but the number according to Gaza Health officials goes up up up to 500 uh people before all of this H sorry right after this it was Egypt and the United Arab Emirates among the first countries to blame Israel for the attack now one has to know that before October 7th before the attack by Hamas militants here in Israel these countries pretty much the key players for Israel when it comes to Friendly relationships with Israel so how is that going to evolve if these two key players see Israel behind the attack it's a really really difficult situation and obviously it is appending the visit by US President Biden here in Tel Aviv who is expected to meet prime minister nanyu in this hotel here right behind me later today we're talking about Biden's visit Fanny uh how does all of this complicate his diplomatic efforts to stop this conflict from spiraling out of control a really good question because prior to his visit in fact the goal for President Biden to come to Israel but also obviously to H meet p uh the the head of the Palestinian Authority Mr Abbas King Abdullah of Jordan uh the the the head of Egypt in Jordan was away trying to show that the US is still somehow under control of the situation it will be able to somehow deescalate the situation but now it's really just unclear especially after that Summit has been cancelled uh first of all uh the head of the Palestinian Authority abas canceling the the the meeting with with Biden and then uh the head of Jordan calling that meeting off cancelling that Summit completely so now it's unclear just what message the us is going to send from Israel as as it seems now as it appears now the only person they will be able to talk to here is the head of Israel now it may deescalate in one way or the other because we're hearing that the White House is saying that Prime that President Biden wants to ask some tough questions Israel is regarded as a friend but they will want to know more about what's going to happen in the coming days and weeks ahead also it could uh serve as a breakthrough in some way if the US is able to achieve here uh some relief for the people in Gaza and and have an impact on opening the Rafa border crossing with Egypt to help and make sure that Aid gets into Gaza Strip Funnie thank you so much that was our senior International correspondent fny fatcha
