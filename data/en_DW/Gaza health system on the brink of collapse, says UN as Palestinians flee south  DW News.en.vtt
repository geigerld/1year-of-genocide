so<00:05:29.960><c> I</c><00:05:30.039><c> mean</c><00:05:30.199><c> all</c><00:05:30.319><c> of</c><00:05:30.520><c> this</c><00:05:30.840><c> together</c><00:05:31.160><c> but</c><00:05:31.319><c> I</c>

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I mean all of this together but I
 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.390 align:start position:0%
so I mean all of this together but I
think<00:05:31.639><c> the</c><00:05:31.800><c> main</c><00:05:32.120><c> issue</c><00:05:32.600><c> right</c><00:05:32.800><c> now</c><00:05:33.080><c> for</c>

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
think the main issue right now for
 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.469 align:start position:0%
think the main issue right now for
people<00:05:33.880><c> in</c><00:05:34.080><c> in</c><00:05:34.240><c> these</c><00:05:34.479><c> areas</c><00:05:34.800><c> and</c><00:05:35.000><c> also</c><00:05:35.199><c> in</c><00:05:35.319><c> the</c>

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
people in in these areas and also in the
 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.510 align:start position:0%
people in in these areas and also in the
South<00:05:35.840><c> there</c><00:05:35.960><c> have</c><00:05:36.120><c> been</c><00:05:36.280><c> still</c><00:05:36.520><c> air</c><00:05:36.800><c> strikes</c>

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
South there have been still air strikes
 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.990 align:start position:0%
South there have been still air strikes
so<00:05:37.720><c> is</c><00:05:37.919><c> to</c><00:05:38.280><c> to</c><00:05:38.479><c> find</c><00:05:38.759><c> some</c><00:05:39.000><c> kind</c><00:05:39.160><c> of</c><00:05:39.319><c> safe</c><00:05:39.639><c> space</c>

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
so is to to find some kind of safe space
 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
so is to to find some kind of safe space
but<00:05:40.160><c> there</c><00:05:40.360><c> is</c><00:05:40.639><c> basically</c><00:05:41.039><c> no</c><00:05:41.280><c> safe</c><00:05:41.560><c> Zone</c><00:05:41.840><c> in</c>

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
