uh we start in Gaza where the number of people fleeing South is surging as Israel intensifies its military operations against Hamas Israel's military says 50,000 people left the north on Wednesday alone adding that gazans believe Hamas has lost control there hoping for the protection of the white flag in the few hours allotted by Israel for safe passage thousands of people headed south on G 's Main Highway the Israeli military have been telling people to get out of Northern Gaza since the beginning of their air campaign against Hamas we left the area due to the intense bombardment we'd been holding on there for 32 days yesterday we made the decision to leave because the bombing was very intense women and children were terrified and we couldn't bear it any longer may God help us but even on the road dedicated for safe passage the bombardment is not far away the situation is devastating and Aid organizations such as Doctors Without Borders say nowhere in Gaza is safe for the Palestinians displaced from the north this is what awaits them in the south of the strip in KH Yunis an air strike brought down a mosque several other buildings in the residential area were also destroyed we were sitting there when all of a sudden an F-16 air strike landed on a house and blew it up the entire block three houses next to each other without any warning people were just coming and going all of them civilians an old woman an old man and there are others still missing under the rubble still haven't been found yet for the First Responders giving up hope of finding survivors is not an option but for many here there's no hope and no Escape tw's Israel correspondent Rebecca rers joins us now from Jerusalem Rebecca the Israeli military says thousands are fleeing from northern Gaza because Hamas has lost control there what's the latest on the offensive well we know that it is intensifying Gard we know that for a couple of days now troops have been surrounding Gaza City and they're starting to push into the closer to the center of the city uh which they believe is Hamas you know head the headquarters basically the stronghold uh we know that all they've also split the uh the strip in two having North Gaza and South Gaza and that they say that Hamas has lost control in the northern part of the strip though it is there are still ongoing battles in the whole of the in the northern area now we've seen those really dramatic pictures of those people trying to get from the north to the South Israel has said that it's open open up these corridors uh some 50,000 people it's thought were move moved South yesterday you saw some of the pictures there in that report holding White flags and the very few belongings that they have left um whether or not that makes them any safer of course remains to be seen the entire strip is being bombarded and even areas in the South that Israel have said you know people should move to for protection are also being bombed so there really doesn't appear to be anywhere in the strip that safe for civilians um we know that um as well this earlier this morning the Israeli military saying that they've taken control of another Hamas stronghold in the jabalia refugee camp as well so that uh offensive intensifying as they continue their battle to try and Route out Hamas completely Rebecca Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected a CE far and also dismissed reports that direct talks are underway on the potential release of hostages in return for a temporary pause in fighting what more do you know about that well it's really difficult to get accurate and up to the minute you know this information on these talks are obviously uh very secretive um and Israel isn't in direct contact with Hamas they're not part of the talks they're working through intermediaries particularly Qatar and Egypt who've been working hard they've also been heavily involved in the the hostage releases that we've seen so far now we know that before before this offensive began there were talks to get quite a number of the civilian hostages uh released but pretty much the talks broke down when that ground offensive uh began and now we do believe that these talks are ongoing and they're for around 10 to 15 hostages that could be released if uh Israel were to agree to a temporary ceasefire to allow for humanitarian Aid as you you point out that's something that Israel are not willing to agree to at this stage so the talks uh we believe are continuing thank you very much Rebecca riches there reporting from Jerusalem well for more now on developments in Gaza we can speak to Peter Lana he's a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces and joins us from Tel Aviv welcome to the program Mr Lana Israeli armed forces are now in the heart of Gaza City I understand tell us what that battle looks like uh Terry good morning indeed the NF is continuing to pursue Hamas wherever they are hiding in order to dismantle and destroy their terrorist capabilities and make sure that they never have the power to govern Gaza again as a staging ground against uh for terrorism against Israel so what we've seen over the last five or six days is a continuing uh advance in towards uh Gaza City in towards the surrounding areas of the Gaza City and it is close combat Urban Warfare um RPGs being fired at our forces terrorists coming out of tunnels that they pre-prepared and built an extensive network of tunnels uh they're using explosive devices uh but I would say that in almost every engagement with our forces the terrorists are being killed we will continue to seek out and um engage them and hunt them down it sounds like you're up against some pretty Fierce resistance there in Northern Gaza uh we're hearing reports that the Israeli military is now fully in control there are you in control in the North so I have not not aware of any announcement of us saying we're in control I would say Hamas is definitely not in control and I think that is uh what we highlighted yesterday in all of our statements and this is where we are today one thing is for certain Hamas are being pursued and they have no idea what is going on they're in a state of organizational disarray communication communicational disarray and in disarray between the leaders and their terrorist uh terrorists that are conducting the attacks so of course as expected they're they've been preparing for the war with Israel and after they launched the war in Israel so they ran into their defensive positions in the tunnels and they've been preparing for these days so of course it's going to be fierce but we will be be Victorious and we we are determined to make sure that they cannot use this the the the Gaza Strip as a staging ground this is precisely what we're up against um no surprises there from our perspective indeed it's not easy it's Fierce um door too uh house to house and yes indeed they are coming out of tunnels and we are pursuing them we've killed uh We've destroyed over the last uh few days 100 over 130 tunnels we're finding um terrorist we've seized 4,000 weapons and Munitions um we are finding the rocket launchers whether they're in the backyards of houses or in kindergartens or schools wherever they've hidden them and this is our effort to to dismantle and Destroy hamas's war effort Israel has ruled out humanitarian pauses until hostages are freed and Hamas is defeated uh Mr Lena is it not possible to provide Aid to civilians and continue your military operations against Hamas so we are continuing our activities and at the same time we are maintaining at this hour um for day five I think U consecutively a a evacuation corridor from north to south because in the South it is safer in the South there is food being delivered there in the South there is running water in the South there is medication of course it is a war situation so it's not easy for anybody in Gaza today in the Gaza Strip but the south is safer from the north and we are up to about 100 a a trucks coming in uh per day now and that number is expected to continue to increase um yes the humanitarian component is a component of our effort we are operating in under the principles of distinction between the civilians and the terrorists the Hamas terrorists um and that is why we continue to call for the people who have remained in the north over the last four weeks to actually evacuate to the South where it is safer and where Hamas are are also operating but their Hub of operations their Beating Heart of terrorism is in the north and that's why our focus is is on the in the north currently uh humanitarian organizations of course say that there is a massive lack of uh of clean water and health care in the South as well just to be clear about that uh but the question of the hostages I just wanted to come back to that so far the Israeli military has succeeded in in extracting and freeing one hostage there are well over 200 there can you tell us more about your progress in getting the others out so our updated number of hostages being held by Hamas unlawfully in uh God knows what condition is 239 those are 239 people Stories the youngest of them is 10 months now when he was abducted baby kir was 9 months old so this is the challenge that we are facing of course I can't because of the sensitivity of the issue I can't elaborate much on the issue of hostages and other than that they need to be brought home we've demanded that the international Committee of the Red Cross have access to assess their wellbeing but Hamas are ultimately responsible for their wellbeing we are utilizing all of the operational tools that we have and it is a national priority and a priority of this war Peter Lana from the Israel Defense Forces thank you very much for talking with us good day Terry well the United Nations Secretary General Antonio GIS has once again condemned the Hamas attack on Israel last month that left 1400 people dead he's also criticized a high number of Civilian casualties that the Israeli Army offensive is causing in Gaza the Hamas run Health Ministry says that more than 10,500 people many of them children have been killed by Israeli strikes there are violations by Hamas when they have human uh Shields but uh when one looks at the number of civilians that were killed with the military operations there is something that is clearly wrong the highest number of killing of children by any of the actors in all the conflicts that we witness is the maximum in the hundreds we have in a few days in Gaza thousands and thousands of children killed and we come back to the situation in Gaza now where fears are growing at the deteriorating conditions the World Health Organization has warned that disrupted healthc care facilities poor water supplies and sanitation have created fertile condition s for the rapid spreading of infectious diseases surrounded by rotting waste and stagnant water and with no access to clean facilities thousands of gazin who have fled their homes now live in this Camp operated by the United Nations Agency for Palestinians unra in the southern city of K yunes facing new threats to their health there are no proper bathrooms the situation is horrific the health conditions are really bad a catastrophe the garbage and the diseases are affecting the children diseases are reportedly spreading quickly in Gaza the World Health Organization says cases of chickenpox scabies diarrhea and respiratory infections are rapidly increasing especially among young children and the situation is getting worse as the number of people seeking shelter continues to rise in the conun training center where 22,000 displaced men women and children are of salt shelter the space per person it less than is less than 2 square m and there's one toilet for 600 people um our colleagues at unoa said that the worsening sanitary conditions along with the lack of privacy in space pose great risk to the health and safety of those Sheltering there the hospitals still in operation in Gaza are already stretched to capacity and these new outbreaks of infection and disease are adding more pressure with vaccines and treatments in ever shortening Supply earlier I spoke with Toby tricker from the UN children's relief agency UNICEF I started by asking him how the lack of Water Sanitation and healthc Care in Gaza is impacting children there yeah you're right I mean the um you know if you surviving the hostilities is one thing but also then now you know the massive concern over that lack of access to Safe Water uh sanitation uh hygiene uh is absolutely critical now uh what we've seen is of course with these you know 1.5 million probably more now people displaced around the Gaza Strip is people living in even more densely populated areas than they were before um and then of course you have an increased risk of the outbreak of diseases um and at the same time that access to Safe Water uh is really so hard people are getting you know three lers per day maximum and and often that is contaminated water that's not clean yeah UNICEF we have a deselenation plant that we are able to provide some safe water but it's nowhere near enough it's still functioning but at minimal capacity so this is a huge concern you've seen uh the UN talking about you know outbreaks of of diarrhea we've spoken to to colleagues and staff who have been talking about you know increasing outbreaks of of diarrhea dehydration and other issues and and this is obviously a massive concern in terms of that it could get worse not better and that's why it's so important that we need to get life- saving supplies in as as quickly as possible to improve the conditions particularly in these very densely populated shelters given the conditions in Gaza what if anything Toby is your organization and others like it able to do there to protect and help the children yeah I mean well firstly don't you say obviously it's extremely difficult extremely dangerous uh the UN Palestine Refugee agency have now lost what over 90 uh staff members who have been killed uh UNICEF staff members have had families killed and of course they're trying to protect their own children at the same time but we are still operating uh inside the Gaza Strip we're trying to do whatever we can it's not enough but we're trying to so Aid is coming in slowly there a trickle rather than a flow which is what we need urgently and we've been moving supplies so medical equipment uh water supplies to shelters to hospitals just the other day there was a delivery by the un uh to a hospital in Gaza City um so there there is some supplies moving around and we are providing some support to children in shelters such as you know just recreation activities to provide a little bit of childhood back uh to Children give them an hour or so to forget about all the horrors around them so there are things happening we're trying to do whatever we can to scale up massively given the immense needs that are on the
