the United Nations has described the renewed fighting between Hamas militants and Israel as a return to Hell on Earth for the people of Gaza hostilities resumed this morning after negotiators failed to extend what had become a 7-Day ceasefire officials from the Hamas ran Health Ministry say dozens of gazans have been killed in the hours since then after a week of relative calm the sound of War has returned to Gaza explosions rang out Across The Enclave dashing hopes that the truce would again be extended Israel said it resumed combat after Hamas violated the terms but Hamas which the US and the EU have designated a terrorist organization blames Israel for the breakdown in talks in the southern city of Rafa Palestinians raced to find survivors in the rebel this is just a house with civilians people who fled from another area they're all young and children there were similar scenes in nearby Han yunes where a hospital was inundated with Wounded civilians we were at home listening to the news when the bombing started the aircraft bomb destroyed our this is the second house of ours that's been destroyed and this is the nature of the Israeli enemy what more can I say people have now started fleeing hunis a city tens of thousands had fled to in recent weeks seeking Refuge from bombardments in the north Israel is warning gazin to follow evacuation orders for what it calls the next stage of the [Music] war the IDF has been sending messages and announcements to the people of Gaza calling on them to evacuate from specific areas that are being used by Hamas for terrorist activities in the areas of what are of course legitimate military targets that will be destroyed in response to the October 7th Massacre as Hamas continues to vow another October 7th a sign that Israel could be expanding ing its incursion leaving gazin with fewer places to seek shelter DW correspondent Ben fulin joined us earlier with more details Gad it's been a day of Rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel mainly in the South also uh some pockets in the north of the country Hamas and Islamic Jihad uh taking responsibility for those attacks the government here blames those rocket attacks on the breakdown in the ceasefire along with the hostage terms which it says Hamas is not meeting uh refusing to release women at the same time Hamas says that Israel has persistently failed to meet its terms it has been offering dead bodies in exchange for Palestinian Prisoners the dead hostages it claims died in uh Israeli air strikes we haven't been able to confirm those deaths yet though but it's also been a day of air strikes in the North South and center of the Gaza Strip that death toll Rising by the hour according to Palestinian officials and Hamas now more fighting means no more release of Israeli hostages at least for now uh what's the public opinion in Israel on this people here are absolutely terrified that the fighting is underway again they're worried of course that their relatives who could be held hostage in the tunnels that Hamas is said to operate in uh which are targets of the Israeli military that uh they will perish in those targets uh 137 hostages we're talking about still in the Gaza Strip according to the Israeli government 117 men 20 women including two children uh it's even more horrifying of course for those above ground the Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire they are believed to be mainly in the South but the Israeli campaign having uh now turned to the South according to Israeli officials those civilians are now going to have to move to the north uh it's not safe wherever they go according to humanitarian bodies uh there are no there's no Aid getting into the Gaza Strip now that this ceasefire has fallen apart and hospitals are near to collapse now Qatar says negotiations to restore a truce are still continuing in the background also so Hamas officials say that uh the group would be ready for negotiations do you think a new truce is realistic well Gart up until now we had a 7day truce who could have believed that I mean getting together these two uh groups which are so different in ideology and Method Hamas which is meant to have tens of thousands of Fighters but then at the same time a much bigger Israeli Force hundreds of thousands backed by the US whereas Hamas is backed uh by Iran uh that is not an easy feat and also getting the Egyptian officials and the US to the table um Qatar is the mediator in all of this is also home to some hamus officials and managing to get that 7-Day ceasefire in place uh was a huge thing but Israel is very keen to get back to the fighting it says that's what's going to pressure us to release the hostages and that was the pressure it claims uh got those hostages out in the first place so it's going to be very tricky going ahead now uh Ben what is known about the strategy of the IDF in this next phase U as it seeks to achieve its goals as I mentioned the IDF the Israeli military says it wants to uh launch a full uh ground offensive in the South not just the North and that's where all the civilians are at the moment that's the big problem we're talking about over uh 15,000 civilian and combatant deaths according to Palestinian Authority so far the pressure is on from the US for Israel to make more um uh precise strikes uh and precise targets and ensure that less or fewer civilians are hurt in the crossfire but uh and we can now talk to Juliet tumar who speaks for unra that's the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees and she's just been to Gaza herself and joins us now from Jordan's capital Aman Juliet what has been your reaction to the resumption of fighting in Gaza when we are um Beyond worried at this stage um for the bombardment and air strikes that have continued across the Gaza Strip including in the South where we have teams on the ground and also the lack of any deliveries today any deliveries of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza trip now were humanitarian organizations prepared for this renewed fighting look we do have some supplies uh in the Gaza Strip but we continue to deliver those supplies and the supplies run out fast like we've seen in the early days of the war so the lack of resumption of that humanitarian flow which we've seen during the pause is extremely worrying and it should resume as soon as possible including the much needed deliveries of fuel now what can you tell us about the humanitarian situation there in Gaza at moment at Andra only at Andra we are hosting more than 1 million people who were forced to flee their their homes and they are in Andra shelters across the Gaza Strip I visited one of those shelters in the South uh it had 30,000 people in it uh overcrowded people lacked the very Basics uh and this is before this uh um short pause began um we could hear the sound of bombardment people were still arriving to the shelter when we were there even though it's been uh almost 50 days to the war people lost everything and they needed everything one man was forced to sleep on the concrete ground because Andra had run out of mates some kids were going around wearing their open shoes um because when they moved to the shelter the weather was still good when I was there it had just rained and the temperature has has dropped so people are missing out on everything this is exactly why the resumption of eight flows into into the Gaza Strip is absolutely critical and do you still think that you can bring more Aid into Gaza of course we we can we are ready to bring Aid in uh like we have been over the past weeks Andra is there at the border we will pick up those uh trucks of Aid and then we will distribute them to people in need like I said 1 million people in our shelters huge and overwhelming humanitarian needs in Gaza Aid must continue to flow into the Gaza Strip Julet Tuma there from unra thank you very much thank you lieutenant colonel Peter Lerner speaks for the Israeli military and he told us earlier why Israel resumed the fighting Hamas chose to violate the ceasefire when they chose not to release the women and children um this is a very clear violation um it was absolutely Apparent from day one that it was only a matter of time until Hamas decides not to transfer the hostages we've been saying since the 7th of October since that ruthless day uh uh merciless day against of attacks against Israeli people that there are two goals for this war first of all to bring home all of the hostages every last one of them and second of all to destroy and dismantle Hamas as a governing Authority in the Gaza Strip now he TB is West Bank and Gaza country director for care that's an NGO fighting poverty and social injustice she joins us from Raa in the occupied West Bank welcome to DW um could we start please with your reaction to the end of this truce I uh I don't have even honestly some words to describe how we all feel as humanitarian actors as human beings we had the chance to take a short period of breath but now we are holding it back unfortunately everyone is really afraid with the fact that what happened in the North might be expand extended to the South uh where already people were overcrowded now the new platforms of communicating with people asking them to further evacu um um makes Gaza uh or the south of Gaza divided into small blocks and this will mean that people are going to be over and overcrowded and this will H H make what the situation that is already announced as catastrophic by the UN agencies to be even more catastrophic with high potential of famine and wider spread of diseases at a scary scale that we are so uh um worried about as humanitarian organizations right so are you still able to operate are you still able to bring in and distribute Aid my dear Phil we used every second every moment of the last seven days and we were able to distribute water we were able to distribute hygiene kits we reached to the people of course limited numbers but now with the truth being ended with the sides of shelling that is taking place and the geog graphic covers covery of of the different places where the the air strikes are are operating we cannot we cannot risk the very scarse the very of course the the lives of our humanitarian colleagues and also the very scarse uh um humanitarian uh Necessities that we have very limited ones that we have so we stopped our operations in the current uh understood so you you've you stopped your operation you've withdrawn your people uh from from the Terr have you no no no they are in the South my colleagues are are most of the all of the colleagues from from Care International in Gaza are from Gaza all of them are in the South they are still putting they are they are willing to help and to continue supporting the people even even in those very very hard and harsh moments of course we also operate through our partners who are also willing to support the people during the truth and even some sometimes we are ask them them we are asking them not to continue be Beyond uh Beyond now in the in the current very risky uh moment so we ask them to stop but all of them are in the South ready to jump to contribute to the help okay let's hope that there is then another pause in fighting for now though thank you so much for joining us aiba T from care let's see if we can pull all this together with DW's Middle East analyst shaie rzan so welcome back to the studio sh we'll start with the ceasefire why do you think this this uh this latest extension failed well we've seen in the last 24 hours an erosion of the trust the very little trust that was there um so far between Hamas and Israel um already last the night before I mean the 24 hours before this the last release were very contentious a lot of back and forth between de sides on what exactly does the list include because Hamas was suggesting maybe to release some some bodies of dead victims Israelis and Israel was pushing back against that claiming the priorities first to release live hostages um and and so this back and forth was was clear that both Sid are toughening up their positions and then yesterday also we saw an attack in Jerusalem the Israeli Capital by Hamas militants in a uh in a bus stop uh leading to the death of three Israelis and several more uh severely wounded it's very hard for Netanyahu you know to be talking truce and uh with Hamas um in Gaza but at the same time being you know the by the very same organization uh not seeming Tough Enough when other attacks happen in Israel so that was putting a lot of pressure on the Israeli government it's it's It's Tricky for for those of us who who don't follow these matters uh clearly so we have a truce but we know that within the the the truce even as it was operating for the seven days there were skirmishes and there was there was um uh um uh rocket fire so where how is the line drawn between those sort of skirmishes and okay this is enough that's that's a great question nobody really know when do you go past the line you know when you cross it uh we have seen trickling of little bit of exchange back back and forth but the general frame was framework worked because it was there was a belief that both sides need it Hamas needs more time needs more Aid coming into Gaza needs fuel need humanitarian support and Israel wanted to bring as many hostages home as possible you know and there's no no better day way than the deal um however both sides we've been seeing in rhetorics and in statements in the last 24 hours were eager to show that they are not afraid of resuming the fire whenever needed this is also part of the of the game of this back and forth between the sides some of it has manipulation or psychological warfare elements some of it is the genuine hostility between the sides um we still see a lot of pressure Qatar is still hoping to be able to resume you know some sort of Truth before we see escalation it goes out of hand um it's the next couple of hours will be quite crucial for that uh it's too soon to see if that is even possible we just heard from uh Peter larner from the from the the IDF and and he repeated the the Israeli line that this is because not only did Hamas um uh break the ceasefire but they will not release the the women and children as we as um uh as we have insisted so we've dealt with the breaking of the ceasefire this notion of women and children having to come out first is that Bec is that a deal that was agreed and that Hamas and that Israel believes that Hamas has violated or is has that been part of the negotiation and this is a term that Israel wants but Hamas has said no to well no the the framework that was established over eight years eight days ago was about the children and their mothers you know women and children because so men were always out of correct because we also need to remember part of the truth was also release of Israeli prison Palestinians prisoners held in Israel and that was also under the same category minors and women so because the way Israel sees it the way Hamas sees it whenever you start talking about men elderly men on you know hostages in Gaza you would have to also discuss elderly men prisoners held in Israel that would be harder for Israel to release because the men that are kept in Israeli prisons Palestinians on are usually those who have been convicted of Terror attacks and some heavy crimes unlike what we've seen so far in release of prisoners uh uh so far so the the minute you change the the the consistency of the the the kind of people you release the category of people being released you got to open the deal and renegotiate all the terms and that's where both sides are too far from each other this is where the distrust is too big and this is we've seen this collapsing okay shie thank you for thank you for walking through us that so clearly sh ranus is DW's Middle East
