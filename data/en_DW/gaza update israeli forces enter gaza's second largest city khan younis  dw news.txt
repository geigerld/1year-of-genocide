Israel says that its troops have entered Southern gaza's largest city the military says its forces have now reached the heart of Khan yunes and have the city surrounded following what it describes as the most intense day of fighting so far Israel says it has expanded its offensive into Southern Gaza to eliminate Hamas which is classified as a terrorist group by many countries speaking on Tuesday night Israel's primee minister Netanyahu said his country's forces have so far killed around half of Hamas commanders in the Gaza Strip our Fighters are expanding the ground operation against Hamas in every place in the strip including the South tonight we operated there with massive Force the Earth shook in hanun the earth shook in jabalia we besieged both of them there was no place beyond our reach we took control of the General Security command of Hamas our brave soldiers are fighting powerfully against the killers they are conducting Close Quarters battles they are eliminating terrorists Around the Clock we have the upper hand in every battle meanwhile the World Health Organization says that the security situation in Gaza is getting worse by the hour as Israeli troop storm Khan Unice in pursuit of Hamas there's little hope for the hundreds of thousands thousands of Palestinian civilians caught up in the crossfire 10 cities are now a common side in cunis many Palestinians set up camp in the city after fleeing Israeli air strikes in Northern Gaza but being here hasn't been safe either and it's getting worse it's even difficult for people to speak safely to reporters [Music] MS oh God all the Arab world is looking on and cannot stop the Bloodshed what have they done why are they being killed what crime did they commit to die this death Israel's military has relased footage that it says shows its Fighters pushing deeper into Southern Gaza 60 days since the beginning of the war our forces are surrounding Khan Yunis in southern Gaza we are operating with professionalism clearing the population ahead of time from the combat areas gazans have been told to move further south to Rafa what awaits them there there is more T cities and a long queue to get drinking water we're talking about the only desalination plant in Rafa that is providing inhabitants with clean water it's powered by solar energy and we're in winter so if that stops we will not be able to provide people with any water the United Nations says more than 80% of gaza's population have been driven from their homes and space on this small coastal strip is running out many simply don't know where they can find refuge and join me now for more is Marina Morana military analyst and research fellow at the defense studies department at Kings College London welcome Marina uh Israeli forces said yesterday they've been engaged in their heaviest day of fighting since the start of the military operation in Gaza is this a new phase of Israel's military operation that we're seeing here good morning Ana yes it is a new phase after the ceasefire or after the the end of SE the ceasefire the mil military operation had to be recalibrated and now it seems like the northern part of Gaza City is under control and cleared so this new phase um even more destructive than the previous one is about one of the strongholds of um Hamas according to the Israeli side which is Han unun and so the operation here is very similar to what we've seen uh with the Gaza City namely the the troops are trying to surround and control the area control all exits to the city you you say that this is uh even more destructive than the first phase we know Israeli forces are now in the heart of Han uh Unis can you give us a sense of what fighting in in such a dense urban area would be would be like not to mention the number of civilians who have fled there from the north it is an absolute nightmare for any military to fight an urban fight against a force that doesn't wear any Insignia so essentially you don't know who the enemy is and you have a lot of civilians as you correctly stated there so the risk of collateral damage of shooting the wrong person is very high and Israel tried to get the civilians out but the problem is of course where do they go and so they have now to operate among these civilians going uh literally house by house um trying to clear it because Hamas also enjoys a very extensive tunnel Network which is believed to be Benise H Unice and so this is a very important stronghold for Hamas and this will be very difficult because Hamas will be using the tunnels and is able to surprise the Israeli military at any point therefore the Israeli military is trying to eliminate as many tunnels as possible but it's um not a very precise science in the sense that they're trying to bump the tunnels on the one hand on the other hand they're filling them with liquid explosives so it's it's a very um combersome operation which carries a very big humanitarian risk I mean speaking of the the tunnels we've been hearing reports that Israel is considering flooding uh the Hamas tunnels um running under with seawater I mean is this something that's likely and and and what do we know about the IDF strategy for the coming days going forward well there are indeed considerations to use seawater to flood the tunnels um now the US um hasn't clearly positioned itself um towards this idea it's still not clear whether this operation will be conducted or not uh on the one hand you have humanitarian considerations and we have heard in the report how little drinking water the Palestinians have and that could further undermine water supply if um the IDF were to use this strategy to flood the tunnels and the other problem is military because nobody knows the extent of the tunnels and what effect seawat will have on them whether the strategy will work so the humanitarian risk is huge and you don't know if you will get a military Advantage from using that so I assume combat engineers will be busy um trying different Technologies and how to best uh literally flat out Hamas and possibly the hostages because um there are also hostages somewhere in those tunnels about 100 of them so you are risking killing the hostages which uh would of course damage Israel's reputation on the international stage so it it is quite a tricky operation I don't know if they are going to go ahead with it or proceed further with liquid explosives and bombardments Marina thanks so much for that analysis that's Marina from King's College London thank you so much and DW senior International correspondent Fanny Fatar joins me now from Jerusalem hi Fanny what is the aim uh of the Israeli troops now that they are in khun the aim is to crou Hamas to take out Hamas but in especially take out those Hamas officials that are presumed to be behind the terrorist attacks on October 7th that is uh the hamas's chief uh Mr SVA he's believed to be in the second largest city of Gaza Strip in runis but while this is going on while Israeli forces are pushing deeper and deeper into the City and circling it that also means obviously pushing out people who have been finding Refuge there over the past couple of weeks who have been pushed basically from northern Gaza because they've been told that the south is safe or at least safer but that's not the case apparently obviously as uh we are not just talking about Ground Forces uh uh encircling the city but also about continued Relentless bombardment from air and this is what makes this entire situation so difficult because as Israel says it is doing what it has to do to take revenge on what happened here in Israel on October 7th it also means a humanitarian consequence and that in numbers Accord according to uh the numbers that we hear from Gaza more than 16,000 people killed so far civilians many among those civilians are children and women we cannot exactly verify this number but the what we can for sure say that the humanitarian situation is growing disastrous by the hour as this fighting continues and there is increasing International pressure on Israel to reduce the number of Civilian uh casualties in Gaza do we know if this is having any effect at all on its tactics on the ground well really if you look at what's happening there that people are trying to leave on foot trying to leave hand units towards the rougher border which by the way is also not safe there's been a bombardment there uh in in in Rafa as well so if you just look at what people are going through right now and for weeks now really uh in fear in desperation trying to find a safe shelter and by safety I don't only mean a place with a roof on the top of your uh above the top of your head but also access to safe and clean water and food if you look at that on the ground you do not actually see any Improvement uh whatsoever and in fact uh the human rights organizations are saying that the only thing that can help right now is a ceasefire uh but that's exactly not what we are uh seeing we are seeing calls we hearing calls by the United States one of the biggest Ally of Israel saying that Israel yes has to defend itself but it also needs to make sure that it limits the casualties on the ground but uh how is that supposed to work obviously as Gaza Strip is being H is is is facing this constant bombardment that's the big question the uh Israeli Prime Minister has said that the military will have uh security control over the Gaza Strip long after uh the war against Hamas ends do we know at all what that might look like it it's really up to anyone's guess what's going to to happen once this ground offensive is over once the fighting is over because controlling is one thing governing is another and even if Israel is succeeding to take out the the the the hamus fighters one has to understand that this organization that is being described a as a a terrorist organization is not only a militant organization but it also is a social movement it's completely unclear really just after this war how much Israel is able to win over the hearts of people and that's going to be very difficult after what's playing out there the violence and really the Bloodshed DW senior International correspondent funny feta in Jerusalem thanks so much
