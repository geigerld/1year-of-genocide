Israel has repelled a massive Iranian aerial attack but warns the campaign is not over it's called for vigilance Iran's First Direct attack on Israel despite Decades of hostility utilized more than 300 missiles and drones there's been calm over Israel in the wake of the barrage this is the live view of Tel Aviv Israel had support in intercepting the weapons from its allies including the US UK and Jordan those that got through had minimal damage US President Joe Biden has said he wants to coordinate a United diplomatic response to Iran's attack at a meeting of the G7 group of wealthy Nations he intends to convene tomorrow fleshes in the sky of [Music] Jerusalem this footage shows the interception of missiles and drones launched by Iran Israel says its defense system shot down most of them in the Sky last night Iran attacked Israel with more than 300 weapons but our technological and air superiority meant that we were able to fend off this assault together with a strong Coalition we intercepted almost all of these threats after the first ever direct military attack on Israel from Iranian territory US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Biden reaffirmed what he called America's Ironclad commitment to the security of Israel and announced plans to convene G7 leaders for a coordinated diplomatic response in tan prover Iranians took to the streets to celebrate the wave of strikes towards Israel the Islamic revolutionary guard Corps says the overnight assault was a response to a deadly air strike an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month which killed several of its most senior commanders Iran's mission to the United Nations wrote on social media that its attack on Israel can be deemed concluded of course Israel will react to this attack but whatever they do our brave men in the Revolutionary guard will anticipate it I do not think Israel will have an answer to the attack if they respond Iran will definitely also respond but Israel says its confrontation with Iran is not over and the overnight escalation between two longtime fors has once again increased the threat of a fullscale regional War Let's cross over to nofar galami from DW's FY Department this is the first time in a long history of Confrontation that Iran has directly attacked Israel as I mentioned before as opposed to using proxies why would tan take this step now yes it is unprecedented because uh so far there has been no direct confrontation with Israel at this level and one of the reason for this attack was the regime's need to convince is uh supporters who asked uh when will you respond to the consulate attack in addition uh since the day ofman the the death of sumani the regime had not taken any harsh Revenge that they were talking about and um that caused them to be ridiculed by a large part of the people and uh many questions from their supporters so of course there was no Revenge at all but the type of the attack um was similar to the attack on anal Assad uh base so that is they had informed about the uh this attack and even White House was informed about it but the regime wanted to calm down uh their supporters questioning them they think the US will not enter the conflict but conflict but I think uh this is a big gamble due to the current situation uh and the condition after the October 7th attack by Hamas uh Israel must give an aggressive response and everything depends on this response and it may also bring the US uh into uh into the war another reason according to many was the appeasement uh of the West with the Islamic Republic uh experts believe that the dispute mechanism must be activated uh before and the irgc must be designated as a terrorist group by the EU and um adding to that with the policy of the Biden Administration the isamic Republic had an opportunity to uh sell oil and save Financial Resources to create more chaos in the region and we saw for example uh that Iranian drones were used in uh in the war um between Russia and Ukraine and the regime continued its attacks through proxy forces and now it has attacked the um Israel territory in an unprecedented way so the vest should know that the Islamic Republic will continue to destabilize the region as long as it is allowed and at the same time uh it will uh suppress anyone opposing their strategy in inside the country uh and this is why Iranian pro-democracy activists have been warning for years that peace and security uh in the Middle East will depend um on the destruction of the Islamic Republic and the establishment of a democratic uh regime in Iran well Iran's leadership is now saying that any Reckless Israeli move will prompt a stronger response tell me how prepared Iran is for this conflict to escalate um yes Iranian officials including um Ali and irgc commanders uh constantly warn Israel in their statements um today and days before and threaten the us for any possible interference and it is certain that Iran is vulnerable to Israel due to the long distance between the two countries uh and uh we have to consider that Iran's internal condition should um uh be also considered that economic and social situation is critical uh and the legitimacy of this regime has been questioned for years so in addition the Israeli front will not consist of just one country but will be an International Coalition against Iran and the Islamic Republic uh will not have the slightest chance I would say um but this question is highlighted here to what extent does the West uh sick confrontation with Iran we must remember that Russia is now at a war with Ukraine and Israel is also fighting Hamas terrorist group Army from DW's FY Department thank you thank you for having me I asked Middle East analyst Sena spetlova what she thinks is behind Iran's attack well I think that it's quite clear that Iran is basically in the same game just like Israel it wants to project power and it afrs that if it will not retaliate for uh this incident in Damascus where its top generals were killed uh then uh in the eyes of the rest of the Middle East uh where it tries to build its proxy and its Camp uh it will look weak so while uh Israel had to act also to achieve uh you know this projection of power uh so was there the Iranian answer uh and we saw that it was well you know massive but also rather Limited in scope uh if they wanted to inflict pain on Israel they could do it through their Proxes in Lebanon Syria in other countries so a whole lot of military posturing here is is what you're saying you you served in the canes as opposition until 2019 how far is netanyahu's government willing to go in a reaction well you have to remember that Netanyahu is not alone right now uh in his place of decision- making uh there is uh uh a quite popular and rather strong Minister of Defense uh you have Galan who already proved time and again Independence uh and there is also Minister Benny Gans who basically is a part of the opposition who joined Nano only after the tragic events of 107 uh so uh the decision that he will be making he will be making it along with this people and therefore uh it's not only Nano and his right-wing members of his Coalition uh that will be deigning what will be the scope of reaction if at all and uh I assure you that uh it seems that uh uh coordination between Israel and the US is back on track uh and in this regard we are expecting of course negotiation in regards to any form of Israeli reaction uh in Iran what about when it comes to Israel's allly calls for restraint though well uh it's natural that now you know the whole of the Middle East uh is um very worried uh and uh we know that even uh sometimes uh simpler steps you know they can bring along major Wars uh I just have to remind that the killing the assassination attempt on Israeli Ambassador in London in 1982 uh caused the war in Lebanon uh June 1982 uh so therefore I think that Israeli uh allies uh at the same time while you know they were fighting uh shoulder-to-shoulder along with the Israelis uh Israeli Fighters Israeli Jets uh and they proved resilience of this uh Alliance uh yesterday at the same time nobody is interested in this large Regional War uh not the Iranians themselves but of course uh not partners of Israel and I think that Israel of course should be attentive uh to the voices of its close allies that again uh proved that the nature of their relations Is much stronger that it sometimes look through the TV screens but so far prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been listening to his allies um tell me then how dependent is Israel on its allies can it afford to continue to ignore well I think that uh you know we are entered into very different territory uh than until recently you know while Nan feels that he is perhaps not obliged to listen to basically anybody not only Middle Eastern allies but also strong International allies such as United States Germany and the UK uh when you know we enter this Uncharted Territory uh the direct blows between Israel and Iran uh this is a whole different story and uh we know from the past uh that uh you know while n it's point maybe was inclining to some kind of blow against the Iran he knew that it's impossible to be done without strong American support and involvement uh so therefore if we are talking about you know further escalation that can bring alone you know this Regional War uh I think that even for Nan and again he's ready to go very far uh in many different spheres such as Gaza of course but not for example in the north where Iranian proxy kbal is involved uh and we see that for the last six month there is this very delicate game of the balance act uh that is going on and the same I think will happen right now also Vis A Iran tya then tell me how worried are you about a possible escalation well uh as an Israeli as a mother who spent last night it was a sleepless night I was uh not affected by myself you know by the uh attack in my area in the center of Israel there were no Sirens going on but of course you know I was following up and we prepared our shelter and I was thinking how I going to drag three of my kids uh to the shelter in the middle of the night I am very worried uh and uh I am very worried about everything that is happening in our country uh since the barbaric attack of Hamas of 107 I worried about our further relations you know with moderate Palestinians because we should be uh promoting them and focusing on the relations with moderate Ians moderate Arab countries and strengthening the alliance between all of them and for now it seems as almost impossible task but we should not give up on that t thank you for being here on DW thank you Mark Kanan is senior adviser with the center for strategic and International Studies an unprecedented Iranian attack here but limited damage to Israel is this a major escalation or a symbol of of sorts then well it's really both uh on the one hand the fact that that Iran has directly struck Israel um is unprecedented uh it has always in the past acted through proxies so that's an escalation that's something quite unusual on the other hand of course there has not been very much damage so that puts less pressure on the Israelis the uh this is not a situation like October 7th I think that the Israelis will feel the need to do something in response but nothing as dramatic nothing as large as of course what they've done uh in Gaza so what damage could Iran do well Iran has a lot of missiles and particularly they have ballistic missiles which are harder uh to stop now the Israelis have a complete set of air defense weapons and missile defense weapons they've been expecting this kind of attack for 20 years but ballistic missiles are more difficult to intercept they have maybe a high higher uh probability of getting through and causing damage so the the Iranians do have some capabilities that they could employ drones as well and of course they have drones yes but the drones have been shown uh to be susceptible to air defenses how isolated would you say Iran is when it comes to its Arab Navy well Iran is clearly quite isolated now the there Arab n neighbors have always been nervous about Iran you know this is a tension that goes back centuries between the Persians and the Arabs uh the aggressive stance of Iran uh against Arab countries they've struck several of them in the past uh so this is uh just increasing their nervousness where do you stand on Israel's uh next response if there's going to be retaliation or not or or a step back well what we've heard from the previous commentators is two themes one is that the Israelis will probably do something uh that's very typical of Israel you hit them they'll hit you back on the other hand the damage has not been very significant so I think they might go after some targets where they're well not many casualties certainly not civilian casualties a military Airfield would be CL a classic one maybe the production facility for drones they might have to go might go after some of the Iranian Naval capabilities the Iranians of course have captured a ship in the uh Gulf and uh the Israelis might go after some of those uh Naval capabilities is also been a Iranian ship in the Red Sea that has been giving targeting information to the houthis they might go after that also and Mark what sort of response would those options draw it's hard to say you know if the uh you know the hope is that the Israelis make you know their counter and then both sides sort of step back the Iranians as we've heard don't want a larger War uh before this they had been talking about deescalation they had pulled the houthis back a bit for example so one hopes that whatever the Israelis do uh you know it's limited and the Iranians can sort of walk away that's certainly what the United States is saying the United States has been very clear that it will not participate in any any um attacks on Iran or any counters but it's likely giving both advice and maybe some intelligence to the Israelis to help shape this response and I'd like to get more on what's happened overnight from Marina Moran from the war studies department at King's College London welcome back to the show Israel has said that Iran fired 170 drones can you tell us what kind of drones we are dealing with here good morning well we can only guess here um the fact that some drones U came allegedly from Iran that they would have to fly about 2,000 kilometers so those could have been the moer 10 drones and then there were other drones coming from Iraq coming from sou Lebanon and coming from Yemen it could have been another type maybe some of them could have been the Shahid 136 the drones that the Russians are using in Ukraine but there is no certainty in terms of whether it was one kind of drones or several kinds of drones and which specific drones Iran has used is it possible to say if they had hit their targets what kind of damage they would have been able to do again and here we have to speculate it depends on the target how well the target is protected on the one hand and you know just just to um talk about Shahid we see that the kind of damage that they can do in Ukraine but they don't hit the target by one usually they are in pairs and again it depends on the target if it's a civilian building or if it's a military installation which will be much uh better protected to withstand such damage and the moer 10 for instance has about um 300 kg of explosive so that's the the payload of that drone so it would be much more powerful and in other words some of the drones coming through might have done just enough damage to military installations but I don't think that um you know speculating again there would have been serious damage given that Israel was prepared and actually managed to neutralize together with its allies most of the drones and missiles shot yeah let's talk more about that so we understand these were intercepted by Israel and the United States can you tell us a little bit about the logistics of of how they would have gone about intercepting this attack well the Israeli used obviously their air defense system the Iron Dome then um ARF so Royal Air Force from the United Kingdom was also helping to shoot down RS and missiles from the air the US has um deployed its warship so one warship was already there another warship was was rerouted and the warships have the egis um system in order to intercept um targets so those were used to intercept drones so the Israeli IDF worked in coordination with the United States and um the UK and also allegedly France FR and some other countries like Jordan were also involved and um some say that Saudi Arabia was also helping to neutralize some of the drones so it was a joint effort in order to defend against the drones and missiles that came in now Marina you mentioned that after these drones were launched it took several hours for them to reach their targets let's take a closer look at this timing how important do you think it was that we had this time frame in order to provide is Israel and its Partners enough time to intervene I think it's a critical point because if you're launching an attack which you want to succeed you certainly don't give any prior warning and you don't give your adversary that time frame so the the effect of surprise is completely taken out of the equation here and what I'm thinking is that Israel raised the stakes um in a certain way was the Damascus strike and some us officials indeed confirmed that that that was an Israeli strike and Iran had no choice but to respond so there was mounting pressure inside Iran itself to respond from its own soil not to use its proxies or maybe to use its proxies as well but to demonstrate clearly that Iran is not happy about Israel attacking it on on what is considered be its territory so what I'm thinking for Iran Iran doesn't want a regional war and is it do Israel so you have to raise the stakes just a tiny bit in order to basically do something so show a response show your willingness to respond but in such a way that the other party doesn't have a lot of good options to retaliate and so now um Iran has launched his barrage of drones and missiles along with its proxies but Israel intercepted them all because they knew well ahead they could prepare and coordinate with the Allies so from from both perspectives everything is satisfied Israel can claim that they have successfully defended against the Iranian attack and that makes it very difficult for Israel now to raise the stakes what will be the next response to Iran will Israel actually strike the U military sites in Iran and um the US Administration is very afraid of this so it's a very interesting strategic game here and I I think this was more of a show of force more of kind of a gunboat diplomacy rather than an actual attack aimed at destroying something and we can get some analysis now from Mike Martin War studies senior fellow at Kings College London welcome back to DW what do you think last night's attack reveals about Iran's evolving military capabilities actually Claire is pretty much what we'd expect so large part of the attack was Shahed drones we've seen lots of those in Ukraine the Iranians gave load to the Russians and then on the ballistic missile front the cruise missile front we've got a pretty good idea of what capabilities Iran has from various tests that they've conducted and so actually what we saw last night was pretty much exactly what we expected in terms of falling within Iran technological envelope if you like what they're able to do now given the relatively limited damage do you think that Iran's attack was then calculated to cause uh relatively limited damage while displaying strength or could this Force Israel to retaliate I I I think you've hit the nail on the head there you as you said in your package this was in response to the Israeli attack on the uh Iranian consulate and Iran had to respond to that and the question was how it responded and actually Iran could have done much more damage to Israel uh perhaps by using some of its proxies nearer to Israel but as it was launching quite slow moving drones that were able to be shot down in Jordanian airspace and as well signaling the attack for up to a week in advance this was for the Iranian domestic audience and to its proxy allies in the region to demonst that Iran wasn't going to be pushed around but equally both Iran and America have signaled that they want to consider the matter closed now they do not want to escalate this any further does this also have to do the successful Downing of of what an Israeli military spokesperson says was 99% of the drones and missiles fired does this also have to do with Israel's uh capabilities here why else would it have been so successful so it wasn't just the Israelis right the the Israelis shot down a lot of the missiles once they entered Israeli airspace and we've seen the photos in your package just then but actually a lot of the slower moving drones and in numerical terms the drones took up the large part of the attack they were shot down predominantly by the US Air Force uh and also other allies Jordan and potentially the UK as well now the Americans have got the most the large and most technologically advanced Air Force in the world and the Israelis have the most advanced air defense system in the world so I actually don't think it's that surprising with an attack that they had a week's notice of that they were able to plan prepare preposition air frames get the defenses ready and then deal with the attack in a fairly comprehensive manner I think to be honest both sides Iran and America and Israel as well really what happened last night was to be expected I think all sides were expecting to happen what happened and then it happened and now I think we're going to go back to something slightly more steady state between the two sides because nobody wants to escalate Beyond really what was a demonstration last night so Mike just briefly before I let you go what do you think then Israel might be considering in terms of a possible response what options would be on the table for them well it is the wild card because Netanyahu um is more Reckless than the US and Iran but if Iran is being sensible sorry if Israel's being sensible what it will do is keep its response within the way America sees the region so perhaps attacking Iran's nuclear facilities and that will enable Israel to keep its response within how the Americans see the region thank you so much as always that is Mike Martin War studies senior fellow at Kings College London thank you so let's get into some specifics of what Iran has used in this attack Arthur Holland Michelle is an expert on drones with the Carnegie Council for ethics in international Affairs we've just heard there that drones did form a large part of this attack could you tell us what kind of drones Iran has in its Arsenal and whether it's clear what was used in this particular incident sure good morning it's great to be here so um Iran actually has a very diverse uh drone program they have I believe about a dozen different types of drones that can be used in sort of weaponized missil suicide styled attacks um unfortunately I I've been on the road and I haven't been able to um you know look into any of the analysis of the actual attack um and the evidence that we have which is presumably very thin from last night but uh keeping in mind the ranges of these attacks it was probably some of the larger suicide drones so these are faster moving jet powered in some cases propeller powered uh systems that have a warhead of anywhere between sort of 50 to maybe like 200 um pounds tell us a little bit more if you can about Iran's drone program has the threat from it been increasing in recent years it certainly has an important thing to know about Iran's drone program is actually it's one of the oldest drone programs in the world Iran has been making drones since the 1980s and in that respect they got a a big head start over a lot of other countries including some of uh their ad adversaries um the threat has definitely been increasing in in recent years as a result of recent technological advances in things like sensors miniaturization of Power Systems uh they're able to produce more sophisticated more precise drones and to produce them in higher quantities but an important caveat to that is that each time Iran carries out uh an attack especially an attack on say US forces or uh uh in this case on Israel that gives uh The Defenders information about how to better counter this threat I think that if we had seen an attack of this scale 5 years ago we wouldn't have seen the same numbers of shootdowns that we saw last night you know these amazing figures of 99% interception rate and so that is a kind of counterweight to this idea that Iran the the Drone threat is sort of going to only grow exponentially in in the years ahead it's always a cat- and mouse game so the attacks themselves revealing its capabilities I guess my next question would be then how it was possible for Iran to become such a a global drone Powerhouse despite Western sanctions well again it's um you know it was this early bet that they made to get into the you know to get into the the the field of Technology um really before people were actually taking it uh very very seriously also keeping in mind that drones as compared to say missiles don't necessarily require incredibly sophisticated components you know you you don't need NE necessarily like a very expensive rocket system the kind of system that might be subject to sanctions or trade restrictions um you might just have a propeller something that is as simple as what you can buy for a hobby plane and in that regard they sort of made this very very um presant bet that going low going small you know going simple could actually be a payoff because a lot of the defense systems that were developed were for you know Big Rock ET powered systems aircraft and such and so being able to fly under the radar was a bit of a hole in that Arthur thank you so much for joining us today that is Arthur Holland Michelle senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for ethics and international affairs
