Israel says it's under direct attack by Iran a military spokesman says drones are on the way but they could take several hours to arrive tyon has repeatedly threatened retaliation after this month's strike on its Consulate in [Music] [Applause] Syria I'm Michael welcome we begin this hour with some breaking news the Israeli military says that Iran has launched an attack on Israel army spokesperson Daniel hagari says that dozens of Iranian drones are headed towards Israel he says that Israeli defenses are ready to shoot them down and told residents to take shelter if they hear sirens Iran Iran has launched drones from its territory towards the territory of the state of Israel entering the threat in the airspace it is a threat that takes several hours to reach the territory of the state of Israel the IDF and the Air Force are carrying out the plan we have prepared now just a short time before the attack was officially announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released this video message Israeli citizens in recent years and even more so in recent weeks Israel has been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from our defense systems are deployed we are prepared for any scenario both in defense and attack the state of Israel is strong the Israeli Army is strong the public is strong again it Bears repeating uh Iran has launched an attack on Israel by drone according to the Israeli military US DW correspon Tanya Kramer joins us now from Jerusalem uh Tanya what do we know about this attack well as you said it has been confirmed there were first uh media reports uh in Iran that drones had been launched and it has been confirmed by the Israeli military that those drones are on their way apparently also in several uh waves now they're slow moving as we have heard um their scope is still uh unknown but there are more than dozens as we are hearing here from uh sources also here in the Israeli uh media and of course also destination their targets rather uh whether they will uh be destined to hit military or softer targets like a civilian uh targets now the Army and the whole country have to say had been on high alert already uh for days and again today it it has become I know in the afternoon emergency uh new emergency guidelines were issued as well and now of course tonight this uh attack has been launched it's unprecedented of course to see this now uh unfolding here tonight T of course we've heard from some of the uh Israeli leadership but how else is Israel responding well the country is uh on high alert this is not entirely entirely a surprise attack I mean the uh threats by Iran uh had been there since uh the attack on the consulate on April uh 1st with the Supreme Iran supreme leader is saying um that um this has gone too far a red line had been crossed and that there will be retaliation uh so the country has been put on high alert we have the fighter jets in the air the naval forces are on high alert and of course the aeral defense systems now the question is of course uh how many of those drones uh Israel can intercept they will certainly also get the help of uh the United States they also have moved uh some of their defense systems uh here in the region and of course there's also the question um will it be just drones uh some military analysts here are saying they could be followed by U missiles or ballistic missiles uh or uh other weapons we understand authorities are calling on the public to follow instructions of the um the home front command have any instructions been given yet and if so what are they saying well the home front this uh late uh this afternoon or early evening issued uh a guideline um asking you know people first of all there would be no educational activities in the coming days there was already an indication uh that there was you know maybe something uh uh coming but they said as well that once Sirens will go off in the country people have to take a shelter uh I came here through a Jerusalem this evening um it is very empty at the moment there's still some people uh of course in the street but uh there's a lot of you know uh worry now of course what will happen here in the coming hours but certainly uh people anticipate uh you know um that they will have to take shelter when the sirens here went will will go off we don't know yet again what's the scope of this attack uh where those drones where they will be going uh the tar targets uh there is the hope that they will go rather to military targets but this is a very very tense situation right now here in Israel very tense we understand and the immediacy of this is the news right now but I want you to indulge us just for a moment Tanya and give us sort of a larger perspective here how have we reached this point where the reality on the ground is Israel not facing increased aggression at the border from one of Iran's proxies but rather a direct attack from Iran well all of this uh came I mean Iran and Israel have been involved in what was called here or described here often as a shadow War um through uh the proxies but uh on April 1st uh there has been an attack and Israel has not taken direct responsibility for it uh on the Consulate in Damascus uh killing uh High uh and high Irani commander and uh ever since uh the uh Iranian regime has said this cannot go unpunished as will uh uh there will be retaliation for it and ever since there has been uh the uh anticipation that actually Iran will retaliate but still it wasn't clear whether it will go through its proxies like the houthis from Yemen hasah from Southern Lebanon or from some militias in Iraq and this could also still be coming that there could be a multif front War but right now we are seeing uh these multiple drones being on their way to Israel and we have to wait and see you know when they arrive and how Israel will intercept them and how they will deal with it you've touched on this a little bit already Tanya but G give us a sense of how prepared Israel is to combat an attack from Iran well the Army says they have all the plans ready and they have been readying for this uh certainly for a long time but certainly uh since April 1st uh as I said it was it's not entirely coming uh as a surprise so it has its different uh um air defense systems among them the Iron Dome but also others and we also heard from the US that Israel will not stand alone so that indicates they will also probably get help uh in uh intercepting those drones it will become more complicated uh military analysts here saying when you know there will be a multif front War don't forget we have a war in Gaza we also have uh border cross border fire uh and high tensions at the in southern Lebanon and Northern Israel between Hezbollah and uh Israel of course and it could still you know go further than these drones but that alone it's an attack from Iran on Israel this is unprecedented we haven't seen this so uh we have to wait and see in the next hour how this will unfold our many thanks to Tanya ker in Jerusalem Tanya we may see you later many thanks Let's cross over now to our correspondent in Washington uh Stefan Simons Stefan uh the US President Joe Biden has cut short a weekend trip to Delaware to return to the White House we also understand his defense secretary Lord Austin earlier spoke to his Israeli count apart what has the US publicly said about this attack thus far absolutely right President Biden is way on his way back to the White House to meet with his National Security Council staff National Security Count Council and advisors um as you're right also defense secretary Austin Lloyd has talked to the his Israeli counterpart but also to other uh partners and allies Arab countries and Arab counterparts uh secretaries of defense in Arab countries over the last few hours so the US is and was as you may remember yesterday warning that this could be happening very soon that Iran could um come to those strikes uh uh rather sooner than later the president said yesterday doing a press conference he also said don't don't do it Iran but of course um those calls for restraint have not been hid by uh Iran now now what is uh going to happen now here in the US they will analyze what's going on right now as of as you said before and as the guest said before um there is a drone strike going on those drones are traveling very very slowly um and Israel Israeli Defense Forces should be able to take those out if there's more that's a problem that's a problem all of this is a major problem for the United States and for the white house because it was the de will of the White House to deescalate to not let this happen and that Iran now strikes directly direct strike or effort to strike Israel from Iranian soil is at as unprecedented and historic it is and therefore constitutes a big problem and challenge for the White House yeah we've all been anticipating this for days but it's in the details where things get sticky Washington has pledged to support Israel's defense how will it do that well in the last few uh days I want to say weeks the US has moved parts Military Parts defensive in defensive nature in the region um a high-ranking military official was in the last few days in Israel to discuss actually exactly that what happens if uh how are we prepared how can we help how can the United States help uh Israel in case Iran uh strikes Israel and the the problem there is if if it if it's all drones and nothing else and it is as we also pointed out before well publicized by Iran that's a sign and the US took it that way a sign that Iran wants Israel to know to be prepared that some retaliation comes now how uh far these very tight rope they are walking Iran with adding more retaliation measures that's a problem and that is what the US is prepared for with military assets when I say this that means defensive nature that doesn't mean US troops on the ground no boots on the ground the president was uh keen on this so I would say intelligence radar early detection and all of those kind of assets let's walk back a little bit Stefan and and and get a full perspective on this what steps has the US been taking to prevent this situation escalating into a wider Regional War well as you know the UN United States has no direct diplomatic relationships with uh Iran the Swiss handled this but of course there is communication through back doors and back channels and the US was always very very clear to say and to warn Iran from anything that could really blow this up blowing this up means widen this conflict make this a uh significant bigger significantly bigger regional conflict now what has the US done in terms of being prepared it is only in One Direction and that is militarily defensive militarily and to the benefit of Israel so the president said the White House said despite our difference with Benjamin Nan and the current prime minister in in in Israel and about what's going on in Gaza and the lack of Aid and so on uh we will be Ironclad cladly support Israel our support will be Ironclad we will stand by our Ally Israel uh no matter what um but that's the gist of it that's the most of it so there is a declaration us will help Israel whatever comes and we don't know what comes yet if the Iran is launching more than just slow moving drones which can be um taken out and anticipated fairly easily by Israeli or even us assets air defense assets um then this is a really different picture and then we there is we have to all wait and see and there's time to pass before we can actually say like okay what is the US actually now doing but again right it it it it serves us all well to remember and I'm sorry uh if I take an extra second here that this is an ongoing situation that we do not have all the answers or a clear picture of what is going on but again the US says whatever happens they're staying with Israel and will do anything they possibly can to defend Israel from any attack by Iran or anybody else our deep thanks as always to DW correspondent Stefan Simons in Washington
