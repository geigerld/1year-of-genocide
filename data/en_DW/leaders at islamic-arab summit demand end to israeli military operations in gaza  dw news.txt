now Arab leaders have called for an immediate end to Israeli military operations in Gaza rejecting Israel's justification of its actions as self-defense the Islamic Arab Summit hosted by Saudi Arabia has urged the international criminal court to investigate war crimes it accuses Israel of committing in the Palestinian territories the leaders have called for an end to the siege of Gaza and a halt to Arms exports to Israel but the leaders did not approve Collective economic or political measures against Israel let's get more on this with Sara bazuband a fellow at the German Institute of global and area Studies Institute of Middle East studies uh welcome the closing statement from this Riyad Summit has condemned Israel and called for a ceasefire can you tell us more about what was agreed on uh concretely thank you uh yes um several proposals were uh discussed uh especially some radical ones that were proposed by uh the Iranian president including putting an oil embargo on Israel or freezing diplomatic relations with Israel or um opposing presence of American forces in the region that are in support of Israel um and all of these proposals were rejected so and the vote was Anonymous so we don't know who voted against them and who voted in support of these proposals but some of the uh sort of older positions of both the um Islamic organization and the Arab League because as you mentioned this was a joint meeting most of the points that were previously endorsed by both organizations were agreed upon uh for example two-state solution uh or uh protection of um the right of civilians um so there is uh still quite whil in my opinion whilst this meeting was quite um a big gesture and an important symbolic event but in the content of it there wasn't really something new that we did not hear uh prior to the meeting now it is interesting that Iran was at the table at this meeting what does that tell you well Iran is a member of the um Islamic cooperation organization and uh for that reason Iran was invited but um there were if you look at this footages of of the event the way that uh the Saudi Crown Prince uh welcomed on the red carpet in the big grand hall in Riyad um presis RI um it was quite um a new gesture you know Iran and Saudi Arabia until very recently were considered staunch rivals in that part of the world and now um this was I think a very strong gesture again very strong symbol um again position of Iran wasn't something surprising um I follow Iranian media in fary very closely I follow the senior officials senior members of clergy inside Iran and uh they there have been really uh strong statements made and prison R's points were very similar and in line with those um so presence of Iran wasn't something that Iran was specifically invited to the Arab League it was on the side of you know the second Summit that both Summits were by the way Jew and that's why they decided to merge them uh and so his presence wasn't wasn't particularly unique but the way that he was received and the points that he made were quite um worth paying attention now just briefly can you tell us also about Saudi Arabia because it was pursuing potential normalization with Israel ahead of the Hamas attack yes I think Saudi Arabia is still going to pursue that but is trying to position itself in a in a very uh careful manner to maintain its position of a leading Arab Nation um but Abraham Accord and um Saudi desire to Norm and to establish diplomatic relations with Israel is a part of a bigger plan to change Saudi Arabia and that's not going to change with this attacks Sarah thank you so much for that that's Sarah Institute of global and area studies we really appreciate your
