there are different critics and questions concerning the role of Germany in the war in Israel and Gaza today my guest is Germany's foreign minister analena Bok and I'm going to ask her a lot of your questions Mrs bbok it's a pleasure to have you here with us today at DW hello hello good day we have lost a great many lives since Hamas terror attack on Israel and Israel's resulting war on Hamas h on the Israeli side according to the Israeli Army 1,200 killed and 240 hostages and in Gaza according to the health Ministry which belongs to Hamas 13,000 killed including some 5,500 children nevertheless Mrs bbok you do not support a ceasefire why first I don't believe that anyone sitting here in quiet secure Berlin can truly imagine the scope of what it all means there on the ground I spoke with the father of a hostage family with German passports who described how his wife and his two little daughters were abducted and I have two children myself it is nearly unbearable to think about what it would have been like if it had been one's own children who were suddenly attacked and brutally humiliated on October 7th thrown on a truck and not to have heard a word from the Children s and I had the same feeling when I was in mamala a week ago there too I spoke with a man whose wife and only son had lost their lives in Gaza just a couple of days earlier and the thought of what that means for someone of having to imagine one's own kids as we keep seeing in pictures sitting on the rubble of their former home their parents buried beneath it it makes it that much clearer this awful suffering must have an end every human life has the same value no matter what passport what religion what background parents children all of us in this world we mourn the same and why don't you just call for an immediate ceasefire now if you have seen all of this suffering yourself because in order to relieve that suffering and to attempt to ensure that right now especially in Gaza people can be given the most essential humanitarian assistance water food it doesn't help to act impulsively and say the guns Must Fall silent that is not the responsibility of politicians they need to work towards really getting that humanitarian assistance into the region for a ceasefire Israel and Hamas would have to agree to stop shooting at each other that would mean Israel would no longer be able to defend itself amid the ongoing barrage of missiles every day Hamas makes it clear that it wants to wipe Israel off the map that means they want to annihilate Israel and in such a situation Israel has the right to protect its population at the same time I am we are working with our International partners with the Americans but also with many Arab countries to do everything possible to ensure the people in Gaza have safe places where they won't be killed where they can access clean drinking water and medication my objective when I was in Israel to make clear to the Israeli government that the people in Gaza must be protected their fight is with the terrorist organization Hamas who want to destroy Israel and not with civilians in Gaza women and children innocent Palestinians let's say on the topic of the humanitarian situation the UN Secretary General says Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children the wh speaks of the catastrophic situation on the ground and has called for an immediate ceasefire and not temporary cease fires in order to save civilians you yourself have spoken a lot about the suffering there hospitals 26 have been forced to discontinue their work in Gaza where schools are being bombed and the civilian population is buring the brunt of the suffering what else has to happen as I said at the top 13,000 dead what must happen before you will say stop stop I believe need to be cautious that we don't simply demand commitments that in no way reduce the human suffering in this awful situation we are in a terrible situation in which a terror organization Hamas is abusing children families hospitals and schools which are actually protected civilian sites to run a war a war to wipe out Jews and in this situation where terrorists and we saw this in Northern Iraq for instance and in Syria where Islamic Jihad did exactly the same abused the civilian population for their terrorist fight against humanity and when raqqa and mosul were liberated we also saw what it meant when terrorists abuse people as human Shields and at the same time as stated Israel is a democratic State that's what differentiates Democratic states from Terror organizations to do everything in the war against Terror to best protect the civilian population and that is a dilemma and we have to confront that dilemma and that's why we can't just say stop because no one will stop but rather we must make sure that humanitarian assistance gets into the region that Israel can have enough trust that at the moment the humanitarian Aid arrives pauses which I have always called for that many Europeans are calling for that these pauses in the fighting are not misused the Hamas does not use those pauses to carry out new Terror attacks on Israel or against its own people against the pales Ians because we have seen that at the moment people in the north of Gaza wanted to flee Hamas started shooting at Palestinian civilians you often talk of destroying Hamas military experts expect that an ongoing ground offensive will create a breeding ground for further radicalization the radical islamist bosses running Hamas are headquartered in Qatar and turkey and not in Gaza experts also say it will be very difficult to destroy Hamas ideology militarily some point to the war in Lebanon and Israel in 2006 when Israel wanted to destroy the islamist militia Hezbollah but Hezbollah has been part of every Lebanese government since then and expert say it is far from weakened thus my question to you do you believe that military operation is the only way to attain security and peace in the region right now one can never just fight terrorism militarily the US president made that clear don't repeat the mistakes that we as Americans made after September 11th the idea that one can simply fight terrorism militarily but rather it's about security it's about people's freedom and that's why I and Germany along with other partners also with Arab countries are in such intense talks What could a political solution look like one that would allow Palestinians in Gaza but also in the West Bank to live in safety and freedom in their own Palestinian State free from terrorism the solution looks like this that it can only work for two states at the same time only when Palestinians can live in Peace and Freedom and when Israelis can live in peace and security free of terrorism can there be a sustainable solution there are no easy answers that's why I want to underscore again with an eye to terrorism it is not only directed toward Israel we saw when Hamas came to power after 2007 how they themselves went after Palestinians maybe some still recall the images from back then how they threw fata critics from rooftops shot regime critics in the kneecaps the death penalty was carried out against Palestinians in Gaza if they were critical of terrorism and that makes it so clear that it is our responsibility as an International Community there has to be security for Palestinians to finally have prospects for the future and development opportunities they need what every family seeks security for their own children you have been traveling in the region three visits since October 7 what do you consider to be a concrete solution what kind of solutions do you put forth when you speak with Partners on the ground there solution what does that really mean there has been talk of a two-state solution for years but what does that mean today how should it be implemented it has been talked about for years but nothing has happened during that time and I believe we the International Community are in a situation in which as I have said the Palestinians like every people in this world have the right to live in peace in Freedom in safety but also to be given a chance to develop but that can only happen if they can govern themselves when they can set their own agendas and that is why for instance Anthony blinkin and I made it clear at the G7 Summit in Tokyo that Palestinians must be able to manage themselves free from terrorism on the other hand that means Israel's right to exist that Israel's security must be guaranteed that Gaza will not be made smaller so that over 2 million people in Gaza can live in Freedom and safety with no expulsions and to work toward that end is now the obligation of the International Community even if the Horizon seems so far away to contemplate how a two-state solution in which the International Community provides security and protection how can it be set up but the part that gets us there is missing of course there is no chance of that happening right now first of all the incredible suffering in Gaza must be ended and the Israelis must be able to live in security they cannot do that now and the 240 innocent hostages the women the children must all be allowed to return to their Israeli home you often speak of the hostages what is the current state of negotiations who are you negotiating with to secure their release there too one can see how important it is that even if everyone of course looks differently at this awful conflict naturally from their own experience their own suffering from the outset several Arab countries made clear not only are we distancing ourselves we condemn in the strongest possible terms the brutal way Hamas treats its hostages Qatar is negotiating a few minutes ago you said Hamas political leadership is in Qatar and other places but we also see that's been the game terrorists have played in recent years their structures are increasingly decentralized political leadership may not be giving instructions to military leadership in Gaza and that there are individual Splinter groups among them jihadists who have the hostages in their hands and that is why all sides Arabs Israelis the entire International Community are doing all we can to see that the hostages are brought together as one large group that can be released and to do that there has to be a pause in the fighting that's why it's so important to finally be able to implement these pauses for humanitarian assistance and at the same time to free the hostages media Outlets have repeatedly reported that there could soon be an agreement on the fate of the hostages what is the latest information as I said these negotiations are ongoing and here too it is so important to remember the families when your own child a 12-year-old is in the clutches of Hamas in order to protect your child your relatives you do not want to discuss everything publicly because that could also endanger the host's release as I said negotiations are going on around the clock and my Earnest appeal and that of all people who see humanity is that these innocent people finally be set free you previously mentioned the two-state solution Israel's settlement policy is seen as a major point of contention between Israel and the Palestinians when it comes to the chances of a two-state solution humanitarian law deemed Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegal decades ago what concrete steps is the German government undertaking in order to deal with illegal settlements and settler violence in the Israeli occupied territories I repated and clearly addressing that as a government and not just now but rather for the past several months over the last few years what I'm trying to do now I would like to elaborate because it is so complicated is to put myself in the others place what would I do if it was my family if it was my country and that's why in my view it is not enough to say that one can only look at this from one perspective that's why I told the United Nations General Assembly as well as the Security Council always be prepared to put yourself in the other's shoes and the prerequisite for that is human rights Universal human rights that's why for instance from day one in my post as German foreign minister on my first visit to Israel on my first visit to the West Bank I made it clear that this settlement policy that it was not supported from our side that it would not be tolerated but instead that we condemn it that is why told the Israeli governments in the strongest terms to end it and I made it clear on my visit last week in rala and in Tel Aviv in front of Israeli journalists that the Israeli Prime Minister must condemn settler violence it must be criminally punished that is an Israel security interest especially with an eye to Security in the West Bank Israel is responsible for making sure the situation does does not escalate further um there are a lot of humanitarian demonstrations around the world calling for a Seas fire there's also a un Security Council resolution one that is binding in international humanitarian law that obliges Israel to abide by International humanitarian law by ensuring compliance with longer poses each lasting for more than a day due to the humanitarian situation part of the resolution was the release of hostages by Hamas which is labeled a terror organization in Germany and Europe Israel has rejected the resolution explaining there would be no pose in fighting before the hostages are released is Israel breaking international law what you just cited in the security Council that is exactly what I always said so to those who would say that Germany is hypocritical I say no not in least we have fought for those same pauses in the fighting because we know they represent the only chance to incrementally ease the humanitarian situation it is unbelievably important that the security Council just agreed to that and that's why we are working non-stop to bring it about Israel is not adhering to it you speak of how important it is do you believe Israel is violating law like I said the situation is complex if only it were so easy to distinguish black and white in a situation when a terrorist organization is abusing International humanitarian law by using civilians as human Shields this situation violates international law that's why Germany and Europe designate it as a terrorist organization then there's the UN Security Council and of course Israel wouldn't that mean it would have to adhere to international law Israel is doing everything to protect civilians to the best of their abilities we are working with the Israeli government around the clock to ease the humanitarian situation in Gaza as well as possible G like I said it's an ultimate dilemma trying to get humanitarian Aid into a situation in which a terror organization is misusing schools and hospitals as military grounds but I have stated clearly several times that the German government that I as the German foreign minister in the past weeks have done everything possible to ensure longer humanitarian pauses pauses lasting several days they haven't taken place yet have they and yes that's what's so complex and difficult about this situation is so difficult about it if it were easy we would have already mitigated the fact that missiles from Gaza are constantly hitting Israel I've been there several times now and in Tel Aviv I had to take shelter in a bunker because the rocket fire was continuing key actors are continuing to make clear that they want to destroy Israel in the very moment when humanitarian Aid is let in nevertheless humanitarian ceasefires are needed that is our urgent appeal also to Israel's government um when many of our viewers listening especially in the Arab world say that Germany because of its own guilt and responsibility for the Holocaust is handing Israel a blank check with no regard for whether Israel violates international law or not how do you as Germany's top Diplomat want to negotiate when parts of the Arab world view you as biased perceptions are also human you can't say that perceptions are right or wrong you can only try to explain I'm very irritated by those people because to me it sounds like the complete relativization of genocide the worst crime this world has ever seen my country the former Nazi regime in Germany is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jewish men and women the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Europeans in Europe we have committed ourselves as an International Community and that's what international law is built on that is the lesson we have learned from the horrors of World War II now people are criticizing the fact that we are talking about the lessons of World War I international law was built upon this foundation so that a genocide never happens again so I find that extremely unsettling our position is we are committed to international law and we are committed to our German responsibility and that means giving Jewish men and women who Germany tried to annihilate under the Nazi dictatorship a safe country that is the state of Israel and that's why Israel's security is Germany's reason of state to me that in no way contradicts standing up for international humanitarian law and for the universality of human rights that is why I have been making it so clear that each life is equally valuable that the Dreadful images of Palestinian children keep me up at night just as much as the thought of Israeli children having been kidnapped playing one side suffering against the others I find that not only malicious but also painful to watch as a human being and as a mother what good does it do a Palestinian mother who doesn't know what she can give her children to drink because all she has is brackish water if Hamas abducts other Israeli children and the Israeli children will not be released just because the Palestinian mother is suffering and that's why it's so important to me to name the suffering of both sides and to try to do everything possible to end the suffering for Israelis and Palestinians and yes that is Germany's responsibility the conflict in the Middle East U particularly in Gaza and Israel also has an impact here in Germany anti-semitic crime has been on the rise the Federal Criminal police office reported some 3,300 crimes related to the conflict in the mid East since October 7th what must be done to combat anti-Semitism we were just talking about how terrorist ideology can't be erased by military means instead we need to change people's minds when it comes to terrorism the same goes for ideologies that show no respect for human beings such as anti-semitism racism islamophobia or other inhuman theories this is another one of our International lessons when people want to destroy others based on their Jewish faith or their Muslim faith or based on their gender as we've seen the Taliban due to women in Afghanistan or when they are excluded from daily life the way we've seen in Germany where children aren't safe to go to Jewish daycare centers then we as a society have a problem and it's a political task to fix it so what do we do criminal law needs to be applied to its fullest extent this is why in Germany burning the Israeli flag is forbidden and is liable to prosecution that is also why let's say for example if demonstrators announce in advance that the burning of the Israeli flag is intended to symbolically call into question Israel's right to exist then these demonstration will be banned that doesn't mean we are Banning freedom of expression but it violates the Constitution and goes against humanity when people use symbolic flag burnings to call for the annihilation of an entire country and that is currently the case let's talk about the impact on our fellow Jewish and Muslim citizens in Germany president schin meire and your party colleague economy Minister habek have called upon Muslims Palestinians and Arabs in Germany to distance themselves from Hamas and not to let themselves be instrumentalized that's the gist of what they've said some people with Arab and Muslim Roots feel as though they are being unfairly accused that brings me to my question many Muslim citizens and people living here ask how can one find anti-Semitism without promoting islamophobia and racism by living according to article one of our Constitution and expressing it human dignity shall be inviolable and that means we do everything to protect the Dignity of every person living in our country anybody who denies the right of human beings of Jewish men and women to live or who says their country should be destroyed is attacking human dignity we need to state that clearly but not fall into sweeping statements or thinking just because Mr Meyer or Mr tubal or Mr odir said that so for instance if it was a Muslim citizen who said that that does not mean it comes from a whole section of the population but in situations like this the same thing goes as we see with other topics not in my name for example there are so many situations where people declare ins solidarity with others we condemn terrorist methods in the strongest possible terms condemning for example the actions of Hamas that's why this bothers me and I've made this clear to International Partners but I've been very clear about it in Germany as well yes I'm very disturbed by the fact that Muslim associations did not condemn the actions of October 7th in the strongest possible terms for what was namely a barbaric Terror situation an act of Terror against Israeli human beings but not only against them you know that many Arab people were also killed many International citizens German citizens died and there are associations that clearly condemn that Muslim associations but others did not and I ask these associations why not but what about the people fellow citizens who currently feel like they are being unfairly accused they feel they need to take action and distance themselves from something that they are not even affiliated with what would you tell these people who currently feel unsettled because they are being asked to do something that they feel wouldn't be demanded of other German citizens they'd say they are German citizens just like any other I think any human being who saw what happened on October 7th has the urge as a human being at least this is how I've experienced it with many Muslim friends Jewish Friends Christian friends or people like me who don't believe in any God to make clear that this was so barbaric and abnormal that it must be condemned in the strongest possible terms to distance oneself as a human being I think that should be self-evident in a situation like that the same goes for any human being who is willing to look at what happened on October 7th or willing to look at what is happening in Gaza they wouldn't see a child sitting on a pile of rubble and say I don't care I've got nothing to do with it I think it's a question of humanity and that's why again yes I absolutely don't understand how the raping of women and some have seen the awful videos of what happened in a number of kbut I watched a very long video of it in Israel hard to describe a woman being raped of course it's all pixelated you can see she's half alive covered in blood and then a man comes you only see men in the video he comes and gouges out her eyes with the broomstick that happened in this situation I think it's essential to keep speaking about these things question about Gaza I'm sure you're also speaking with your partners about what will happen in Gaza after the war there are several scenarios being discussed one is that Israel occupies Gaza another is that Arab units are stationed in Gaza or the Palestinian National Authority takes over or Gaza is placed under International control which scenario do you support as a for a start we cannot make decisions without involving Palestinian men and women but while I've been deeply saddened by accusations from the arabic speaking World I'll be honest about that that Germany does not care about the suffering I have been as clear as I was at the G7 Summit no not only am I not indifferent to the suffering I am doing everything to make clear to everybody willing to stand up for peace and Security in the region that this can only work if Palestinians have their own State and Israelis have their own State and that's why I clearly laid out a five-point plan while I was there along with Anthony blinken which addressed some of the things you've just mentioned for example in order to ensure security we need International responsibility we've learned this from the terrible Wars in Europe's Western Balkans there too the International Community assumed a responsibility to protect it was also a situation where the worst crimes had been committed and actors in the had simply lost all trust I see the same thing there what do you mean with International responsibility do you mean International troops stationed in Gaza or what do you mean exactly I mean taking International responsibility for security whoever that may be we have un peacekeepers blue helmet in Gaza I'm not saying no that's why I said International responsibility because there's the question whether peacekeepers work it requires actors that the Israelis trust and and actors at the Palestinians trust that's why it would need a mix of players to ensure that terrorism can't rise to power once again it would also need to see to it that Israel's security is guaranteed in addition I've made clear that this means there can be no expulsions this is why there can be no occupation of the Gaza Strip by Israel instead there must be International responsibility in the future Palestinians need to be able to make their own choice administrative structures must be strengthened so that hope and an economic perspective can finally arise we've seen similar elements in East teamour as well as in the western Balkans if I understood you correctly that means that you are in favor of international troops in Gaza do you think Palestinians would go along with that will the Israelis what is the information you received after proposing that like I said that is the perspective that we must speak about International Security and a certain presence if I'm serious about this it can't be without the people's involvement I can't just say this is the way it will be part of negotiations right yes and in order to even realize that Prospect we need various countries from the region International countries close to Israel thinking about this problem that's what we're doing right now and yes whether I am in the Palestinian territories or in Jordan where I met Refugee families or in Israel I can sense that this is very urgent all these people ordinary people living in different countries share the same desire for peace and security so yes I also sense a lot of support for international responsibility what international responsibility include the Gulf States you're in touch with Saudi Arabia and with the United Arab Emirates are they prepared to send Saudi troops or emirati troops to Gaza like I said right now unfortunately we're not at that point yet that political Horizon is still far away at the moment Hamas Terror against Israel is continuing uninterrupted and we're seeing unbelievable suffering in Gaza that's why so many actors are currently saying we can't discuss the political Horizon just yet but I think if we don't show now that there can be a solution then they'll win the upper hand or if the Playbook of Terror is successful then people will think there is no solution that's why those who live in security and freedom as we do here need to think about a solution along with Arab countries that's why yes I also speak with the Gulf States and it's not just me speaking with them together we speak to all of those who feel or bear responsibility not only for security in the Middle East but are also committed as of today and this is the bitter truth to taking small steps to reduce humanitarian suffering and to prevent a further escalation in the region which would then push this political goal even further into the Horizon unfortunately our time is up one last question about the conflict in the Middle East president erdogan was in Germany then he went back to Turkey and according to the media called Israel a terror State again what do you say to that during the Turkish president's State visit the federal Chancellor made it very clear that we not only stand for Israel's right to exist it is our responsibility as an International Community and as Europeans I believe worldwide we are currently watching a strong desire to cater to certain sentiments within Society the way I see it now is the time when everybody with political responsibility must ask themselves whether they will succumb to sentiment or take responsibility in a world that is already falling apart or for putting an end to this horrible war in the best interest of Israeli and Palestinian security we see it as our German responsibility to do everything we can to strive for security in the Middle East even if at times that means that all we can do in this traumatic situation is move forward one millimeter at a time but every millimeter is worth it because it's about every single person in Israel and in Palestine thank you very much Mrs barbok for being with us today of course we have many questions but our time unfortunately is up I hope we meet again and that things on the ground will be different by then thank you same to [Music] you
