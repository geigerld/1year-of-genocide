Israel says it has delivered enough polio vaccines for more than a million people in Gaza the vaccine shipment started after the first case of the deadly disease was found after a quarter Century it's unclear how the vaccines would be distributed and administered in the war torn territory Aid groups plan on vaccinating more than 600,000 children and have called for a ceasefire to allow them to start their vaccination campaign immediately it's bringing Dr John Kaylor he's the co-founder of the NGO met Global and a pediatrician who's visited Gaza multiple times this year already Dr Kaylor welcome to DW now how dangerous would a large scale polio outbreak be in a war zone like Gaza well first of all thank you for the thank you for the invite uh a large scale outbreak of polio would be a very very significant event it would be both a significant monitor of a bad Public Health event as well as a medical catastrophe uh there hasn't been a case of polio in Gaza in 25 years and for 20 years before that the cases were diminishing so there's very few people there that have experienced this and when they did they experienced it at a time when there was a better Public Health uh infrastructure there is zero Public Health infrastructure now yeah are the amounts of vaccine available enough to contain a major outbreak if there's a million doses of vaccine it's it's it's enough to contain a contain an outbreak the issue isn't amount of vaccine there's plenty of vaccine in the world and there'll be plenty of people to give it the issue is the safety in giving it how you're going to give it uh and then the repeat doses uh because it's not an issue of one and done it's an issue for those kids who have not been vaccinated it's an issue of two doses separated by 6 to 8 weeks so to what extent would a successful vaccination campaign be possible if fighting continued at its current intensity then well I can't estimate that but certainly the issue is uh an issue of safety if you've got a group of people that are afraid for their lives and you tell them there's a potential of a disease that may harm them if they come to a certain area to get the the vaccine most people are going to opt to stay safe so it's going to be an extremely difficult situation both from a public health messaging standpoint but also a very very scary situation for for those Personnel that are there to administer the vaccine uh given that they will be uh depending on this whole concept of deconfliction and we know how how fraught that is with mistake yeah can you explain to us how the war and the humanitarian situation are making it easier for diseases like polio but others as well to spread in Gaza so um most contagious diseases are um a function of congestion um there are some that are easily contagious such as respiratory diseases like covid measles uh and then there are some that are contagious because of breakdown in hygiene and that's oral feal that's hand the mouth um there is no adequate hygiene in Gaza zero um so people even when they clean their kid they clean their kids diaper and stuff like that they won't be washing their hands they'll be touching their own mouth they'll be spreading it polio vaccine is also a type of vaccine that can live off the body so it'll be in the soil it'll be in the water um um and easily spread with lack of with with poor with poor gastrointestinal hygiene because it goes hand to mouth now many countries spent decades trying to eradicate polio and doing so successfully now if it really gained a foothold in Gaza how easily could it spread internationally well it can the the there's no question that the virus will go internationally that's not a question um anybody who's been in the Gaza Strip who has worked intimately for any period of time um uh with the patients that have it some of those people will carry it the it's an extremely contagious disease meaning it goes it's easily spread but the good thing about it is that it can be broken by by uh um what's called herd immunity and most countries most countries in the world other than a certain subset of them have our have HT immunity one of the worries is for vulnerable populations so there are populations that for religious reasons or ethical reasons or whatever reasons don't get their children uh vaccinated all of those children will be susceptible if the virus gets into that sub Community those communities are usually pretty localized so if you can keep it out of those communities you'll be all right the general population the general population will be pretty well protected around the world that is Dr John Kaylor he's the co-founder of the NGO met Global thank you so much for your time and those very interesting insights you're very welcome and thank you so much for having me
