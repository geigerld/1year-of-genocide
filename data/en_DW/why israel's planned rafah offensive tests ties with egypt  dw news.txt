now the US President Joe Biden says that he is hopeful a ceasefire deal for Gaza can be reached by next week talks are happening in Qatar right now their aim is to secure a pause in the fighting in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages who were taken during the Hamas Terror attacks on October the 7th speaking to reporters in New York President Biden said an agreement was Within Reach well I hope by the the beginning of the weekend I mean the end of the weekend at least my my my National Security advisor tells me that we're close we're close it's not done yet and My Hope Is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire okay thank but a Hamas official speaking to the Reuters news agency says Biden's comments don't match the situation on the ground he said there are still gaps that need to be bridged before a ceasefire agreement can be reached Israel says any letup in the fighting will only be temporary and that ground operations in Rafa are the only way to eliminate Hamas fighters from suspected positions there the Israeli military has reportedly shown Israel's war cabinet its plan for evacuating civilians from combat areas but no details have been released on where those displaced people could actually go these women and children are among the victims after an Israeli air strike hit a building in southern Gaza some survivors are still looking for their loved ones they were targeted with a missile there was a huge explosion and the building collapsed we recovered people including women and a child who was 7 years old there are also injured people including my sons Israel has been carrying out air strikes in Rafa for for weeks despite some 1.4 million Palestinians seeking safety in the city there we go Israel says its ground invasion of Rafa is inevitable it's convinced Hamas leaders are hiding there and that it's necessary to push into Rafa to achieve its goal of eliminating the group but International organizations warn such an advance would have catastrophic implications for civilians there all the Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestinian civilians Sheltering there it would put the final nail in the coffin of our Aid programs according to un figures the amount of Aid delivered in recent weeks has decreased mainly due to the regular closures of Crossing points and military operations the drop in Aid comes amid a deepening hunger crisis across the territory and my son is supposed to have milk as a newborn be it natural milk or formula but I wasn't able to get him milk because there's no milk in Gaza and the circumstances are tough there's no milk and no food in Gaza Jordan parachuted much needed supplies into Gaza on Monday but many fear the aid system could collapse entirely if Israel ground troops entered the last limited refuge for Palestinians in Gaza our Middle East analyst shie rosanas is here in the studio with me hi hi shaie so um shaie um we're seeing quite a lot of movement here aren't we in terms of sort of talk about the the ceasefire um but there are a lot of details still in the air aren't there there are many um and we've he the qataris just talking this morning saying um there's nothing that's been finalized yet between Hamas and Israel we know that Hamas spokesperson also said there's still many gaps that need to be bridged and one of the key issues is how do we even what is it on the table uh we're talking about a ceasefire or a truce but Hamas Demands a a stop to fighting he wants Israel to make a commitment that it's not going to resume uh ground operations and gods of something Israel is refusing to do so this is still very much the heart of the matter and still disputed um and of course there's all the back and forth regards to how many prisoners will be released in exchange to how many hostages these are more of the Minor Details but still there's a lot still to be worked through okay and meanwhile Israel seems absolutely intent on sticking uh to its plan to start this sort of full scale offensive in Rafa despite the um you know the growing chorus of international criticism well Israel wants to be seen like that at least you know for Nan it's important to send that message that the IDF is ready and can go on into the next phase of the ground operation meaning going into Rafa because he feels that that's his only leverage if he wants to get anything uh for the Hamas to to agree to concessions he feel like Rafa is the one thing that he has still that he can use and therefore he tries to portray this this image of this is what we're do doing next we know however that technically there's still many stages to be uh before that is even possible there's more than one million uh Palestinians who found refuge in Gaza from all other parts of of the Gaza Strip and they need to be evicted this is something Israel has committed to so that would be the first step before anything else happens okay Shany stay with us for just a moment because we're going to get an update on uh Rafa now with fighting so close to the Egyptian border it is testing Israel's friendly relations with its neighbor take a look right on the border with Egypt it's Rafa it's crammed with around 1.4 million people many displaced from other parts of the Gaza Strip conditions there are dire with shortages of food and water Egypt has warned against an Israeli Grand defense of there saying it would result in more civilian casualties Egypt has had peaceful relations with Israel since a peace treaty was signed between the two countries in 1979 but Egyptian president abdal fat Ali has been vocal in his condemnation of is's operations in its war against Hamas with displaced gazans having nowhere else to go it could lead to intense pressure on them to escape the Enclave into Egypt Sinai Peninsula a situation Cairo wants to avoid Egypt along with several other Arab countries fear Israel wouldn't allow them to return under the terms of the 1979 Peace Treaty the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza border are a demilitarized zone since the October 7th attacks Egypt has been beefing up border security with more troops at the Gaza Frontier with Israeli consent Egypt also appears to be building a Fortified Area there Cairo has for the past decade already been creating a massive buffer zone as part of its security coordination with Israel part of that has been the destruction of tunnels from its territory into Gaza which were used for smuggling another issue testing relations between the two countries is a narrow demilitarized strip of land that separates Egypt and Gaza known as the Philadelphia Corridor a suggestion by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu that he wanted Israel to take control of the corridor has angered Cairo despite the current tense relations between Egypt and Israel any attempt by Cairo to walk away from its peace Accord with Israel could prove very costly Egypt's economy is struggling and it would risk losing the billions of dollars of us Aid it receives as part of the 1979 treaty our Middle East analyst shanie rosanis is still here with me shaie tell us what is it that makes Rafa so uh important especially for Egypt well Rafa is a city that is divided for many years the majority of which isn't a pal part of Gaza a little part of it is in um is in Egypt and for the Egyptian president right from the start this was the red line he you know there's a a big Crossing uh of the Border there and any breach um into uh Egyptian territory that's that's a red Cline that the the president has said the Assisi president said he's not willing to to see happening there's a fear that it means that the ter you know knowing this region and the Dynamics in it anything that is temporary can end up very much being you know a permanent solution for the Palestinian uh problem which is something something the Egyptians do not want to see happening because they're afraid that would be you know clearing out the mess for Israel instead of of Israel itself um we know that the tensions are so high that the Israeli head of the military and the head of the shinb the Secret Service have made it to Egypt last week to uh ease up tensions and assure the the Egyptians that there's not going to be as far as Israel is concerned uh trying to push Palestinians um refugees into Egypt is nothing that they're planning on or or at least not anything that they're going to be intentionally pursuing M okay we know that Ramadan the Muslim holy month is just weeks away now um what what role does Ramadan play here I mean you know Israel is weighing its options in its war against Hamas where to go next how important is Ramadan in these calculations well very much I mean officially talked to netan you talked to other people in his cabinet they say you know we're not going to we're going to disregard Ramadan because we were attacked on October 7th on our holy days so the Hamas itself has shown zero respect to religious uh uh needs however uh when we talk about real politic if we're talking about this region we're talking about other fronts that Israel is dealing with when it comes to Israeli Arabs uh within Israeli territory for talking about the West Bank it's clear that fighting through Ramadan will be Crossing some sort of a line and the very delicate balance that is there and might bring Israel more problems of course the International Community is against that and so the Americans right from the get-go of this round of talks set up Ramadan as a deadline hoping it will help all sides to sort of deescalate come down and and see that as a as a as a beginning of of entering a new phase of deescalation and some sort of relief to this terrible trategy that we're seeing unfolding in Gaza every day ew Middle East analyst Shan rzan thank you so much shannie Dr Sanam vakil is director of the middle easn North Africa program of the London based think tank at chattam house welcome to DW um I'd like to start with with that that uh Egyptian threat to uh walk away from its 1979 peace treaty with Israel if the Rafa operation goes ahead and I guess my first question is in two parts what effect would that have and why is Egypt so concerned thank you for having me uh well um Egypt um is not making this threat lightly um it sees the displacement of Palestinians um as very dangerous um as a precedent uh it doesn't want to see the repeat of uh the 1948 displacement of Palestinians that took place um as a result of the uh War at the time secondly of course um a displacement of Palestinians um could uh of of course pose challenges for Egypt's own security um and the Egyptian government is using the threat of break uh diplomatic ties with Israel ties That Egypt has maintained since 1979 as leverage um for the Israeli government to take Egypt's position um on Palestinian displacement seriously we have seen however that that that Israel is determined to take uh to to to plow its own Furrow if I can put it that way uh not even heeding advice from its closest Ally the United States uh quite often is this threat for from uh Egypt likely to be taken seriously by Israel well since Egypt has made that um threat very public and and and has been quite persistent in um pressing uh this Avenue of escalation there have been um revived uh talks um uh to get to a temporary ceasefire and Egypt has been a very important interlocutor mediator um alongside Qatar and the United States um in Paris but also in the region um in order to get to this ceasefire uh before ramadon which begins on March 10th um so uh it it does look like um the carrot and stick approach if you will um might be getting some traction and the mediators um including US president uh Joe Biden um have indicated that they're um getting close to an agreement which is a a very positive sign and and what should we read into Israel's use of Ramadan a Muslim Festival um as a military deadline well I think it's um everyone's deadline not just um Israel's deadline I think it's important um to achieve a ceasefire as as soon as possible it's important obviously to release hostages but above all um to also address uh the massive humanitarian disaster that's taking place in Gaza um with so many lives lost over 30,000 at this point um a ceasefire needs to happen yesterday um and delaying it to the start of Ramadan I don't think is a positive um or productive outcome for for all sides um but Ramadan is seen as a deadline because there are deep fears uh across the region that uh this war could escalate um that violence could spread into the West Bank and East Jerusalem where the Israeli government has not allowed Muslims access to the al- AA mosque and during Ramadan at a time of a deep um uh religious meaning uh for um Muslims across the region being deprived of the opportunity to pray at the alaa mosque um would be uh very dangerous and and could it lead to um violence as well okay that's very clear thank you so much for joining us and outlining that for us Dr samam vakil from chat M thank
