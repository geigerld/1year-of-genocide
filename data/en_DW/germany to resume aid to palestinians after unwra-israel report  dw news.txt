Germany will resume its cooperation with anra that's the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza several countries halted their funding temporarily during an investigation into the agency's staff Israel had accused dozens of the agency's employees of being involved in the October the 7th Terror attacks more than a dozen donors including the two largest ones the US and Germany suspended their unre funding as a result now the recent investigation says that Israel has not provided evidence that certain UNR employees were members of terrorist organizations earlier DW spoke with Germany's development Minister about the anra investigation she had this to say about the agency's work that report shows very clear that anra is uh able to do the job here that it's not part of Hamas that is separated from Hamas and I think this report um we will analy this analy anal this report in detail but the first what we see is that this is very important um report to to show that Anar is doing a very good job here Jonathan Fowler is the spokesperson for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees anra welcome to DW Jonathan thanks so much for your time today can we begin with your reaction to the news that Germany will now resume cooperation with your organization I mean this is of course a very very positive development um and I do want to stress that the Germany uh last month had already come forward with fresh funding of 45 million euros for our work in the West Bank um Jordan Syria and Lebanon um so what we're talking about today specifically is a kind of unlocking of the the remaining suspension on funding for Gaza um which at this critical moment of course given the the the absolutely enormous scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is absolutely essential did Germany and other donor countries act too hastily when they uh suspended payments to unra without waiting uh for a thorough examination of Israel's allegations well well of course I mean I'm not in a position to to sort of be be sort of inside the room in terms of the decision making but I mean what what this did cause was was a huge risk of an absolute unraveling of our operations in in Gaza but also um across the rest of the region and our agency of course is the primary humanitarian agency in Gaza but also working with Palestine refugees across the region so the the decision when it made I mean it looked like we were we were basically going to have to close up shop in February but because we've had a number of returnees and Germany of course is not the only government which has listed suspen lifted suspensions um we've been able now to to sort of push our operations uh kind of protected through to the end of June and we the basically the the kind of guillotine has been postponed over and over over recent months that others have come back but that doesn't mean that the situation is perfect beyond June okay I wanted to ask you Jonathan um the independent investigation concluded that while you have robust measures in place to ensure the neutrality of the organization there are still neutrality issues uh what will the organization do to address these issues well absolutely I mean we we take fully on board the the the outcomes of of this investigation I mean this was an independent review that in fact we had asked for before allegations against a dozen of our staff even emerged and it's important to emphasize that so this was something we were aware that we needed to do um because we'd over the years faced a number of um allegations against you know our our neutrality of our staff but the investigation did include that we have the robust Frameworks in place and in fact more robust than any other other part of the UN system and many um International NOS um but what we we we we are um working on an action plan currently to to take on board various recommendations you know related to the work of our staff unions for example um or indeed you know how we deal with donor governments our internal governance on these issues um you know an organization with 30,000 people are functioning in a very very politicized context which of course was flagged by the the the Colona report um that's you know it's inevitable that that things won't be perfect um but I think you know this this is a case more of of of the glass being half full than half empty when it comes to the outcome of this review okay the US your most important donor has decided not to fund unra for another year um how will this affect you how will you compensate for this shortfall well this of course is extremely challenging because um I mean with the return of the number of donors we we've reduced the the sort of financial hit on our organization but um yes indeed you know with the the remaining suspensions of nine um member states we're still looking at a 31% loss of our income and that's 267 million do and and the United States makes up around 80 n yeah 87% of that that shortfall almost 90% um the uh the Congressional decision to to to to decline to fund unra until March of next year is um is problematic we do need to make up that shortfall but I do want to emphasize we've had a ground swell of support um so not just the returning suspending member states but as soon as the their suspensions were decisions were made we faced a ground swell of public support we raised record amounts of money um from Individual and private sector donors in the order of 50 million we've had uh governments traditional donor governments come forward with extra exra money you know Spain Ireland for example staunch supporters of our agency um but we've also um had uh non-traditional donors and the government of Iraq for example came forward with money so this doesn't make up the shortfall but it does it it has enabled us to reduce the dent but of course the the issue of U us funding is extremely extremely serious and we are hoping that they will also make a decision in our favor Jonathan Fowler from unre Jonathan thank you so much for your time to today thank you
