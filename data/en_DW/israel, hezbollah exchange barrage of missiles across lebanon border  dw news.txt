we begin with breaking news in the Middle East Israel and the Hezbollah militant group based in Lebanon say they have launched attacks against each other Israel says its Armed Forces struck thousands of missile SES to prevent a large-scale attack on its territory Hezbollah says it has launched a large number of drones against Israel in retaliation for the killing of one of its commanders in Beirut last month the Israel Defense Forces say they launched preemptive strikes against haspa Targets in Lebanon a short while ago the IDF identified kisala terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles Rockets towards Israeli territory in a self-defense act to remove these threats the IDF is striking Terror Targets in Lebanon from Rich kisala was planning to launch their attacks on Israeli civilians for more let's bring in our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya what more can you tell us well at the moment this is uh you know what we can tell you is that uh the Israel military said they had uh struck with about a 100 uh war planes in the early hours of the morning around 5 a.m uh what they call these uh rocket launching uh sites uh and we are hearing from Hezbollah they had launched over 300 uh uh uavs drones and uh Rockets uh towards uh Northern and Central uh Israel now this is this is where it stands right now they said this was the first phase of their attack and retaliation for the killing of the hasbalah commander uh last month in southern uh Beirut and Israel says they took these preemptive strikes to prevent such a large attack there were some reports that those Rockets could have been directed uh towards uh uh military uh basis um at the moment there's still an assessment uh going on not so much yet what the actual uh targets were there has also been a security cabinet uh convened in the early uh morning hours and uh this is now what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to say then we are determined to do everything to protect our country return the residents of the north to their home and continue to follow a simple rule whoever hurts us we hurt them isra Israel of course that shares a border with Lebanon to the north what's the situation like there early morning hours around that time you know sirens were being heard across uh uh the northern uh area the Army says they're still right now assessing um the damage and injuries that happened there what you have to know we heard it now in this uh what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also uh said that uh over 60,000 Israelis or people living in the North had been evacuated so they not have been able uh to go home we had since October last year uh crossborder attacks between Hezbollah and Israel so the situation in the north has been tense and there has been some expectation uh after these targeted killings in Beirut but also in Teran last month that there will be some retaliation so this was somehow expected but right now of course uh it is of course again a different uh situation this crossborder fying has now intensified and of course now everybody is now waiting uh what will happen next we're hearing also that hasb LE Hassan ASA will speak later today that go that could give us an indication how hisbah sees that situation Tanya half a minute but I am curious how prepared is Israel for a major escalation well Israel says they are prepared for anything and this is why they launched as what they described as those preemptive strikes they have been preparing for this now for a long time also preparing the public here uh that this is coming and that they have to do something to to change the equation also at its northern border but of course this all comes while a war in Gaza is continuing and also today there were scheduled uh some talks again uh in CYO about a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal now everybody has been rather pessimistic about uh that these would yield uh some uh positive results but still it was being seen as trying to calm down the situation at least that is what the mediators and Qatar Egypt and the US have been trying to do not to open another major here um between Israel and Southern Lebanon or hban Israel but we have to wait and see now what the next hours will bring as always our thanks to DW's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem turning to Tel Aviv now where we're joined by journalist sladin balik saladine what's the situation where you are well um there was no Sirens here in Tel Aviv or in the the uh uh Center of Israel in general the only thing that happened here is the meeting the cabinet meeting in the kirad the AR headquarters in the center of Tel Aviv where some security assessments has taken place but uh according to the latest reports there was some intention from hisbah to strike Targets in the center of Tel Aviv mainly According to some reports Thea itself as a symbol of uh um the uh um the the place that the decision to take down shukur the top Commander was taken in but that didn't happen and it's because of the 100 fighter jets that struck the south in Lebanon and maybe um did um just made this whole thing a failure that's what we are hearing right now from the uh Israeli uh public from the Israeli media and also from the Israeli uh um IDF and the military so uh we're thinking that currently at least uh there will be no strikes against Tel Aviv because that itself might mean that hisbah uh is opening a new frontier and a full-blown out War something that according to the estimation is not what hisbah is intending for right as you surely know the is military says this was a preemptive strike are you hearing anything else from them well they are saying that about 100 fighter jets struck Targets in southern Lebanon in about 40 different locations 40 different launching sites uh um but I would cast doubt on the analysis of this that uh Hezbollah wanted to launch 6,000 Rockets according to the New York Times toward the uh area of central Israel because that itself would mean actually opening a full BL War full-blown at war with Israel something that as I said is not estimated in Israel uh and also the other um assessments to this would be or they are actually that hisbah like wanted to at some point launch uh or use these launching sites against Israeli targets but not um imminently and not um as a result of the or as a retaliatory attack to the Sher assassination so um the preemptive strike came to um try to uh um to jeopardize this whole operation but it's not necessary that they meant to launch 6,000 Rockets as the reports saying uh just today against Israeli targets especially in this of Israel understood that's journalist sladin balik in Tel Aviv many thanks our correspondent Muhammad sha joins us by phone from Lebanon Muhammad what can you tell us about this attack from where you are well there has been many indications this week that we were heading towards this escalation mainly The Stumbling negotiations about a ceasefire in in Gaza and the increased number of military attacks by hasah Israel and in the the intensified Israeli attacks Earth strikes on Lebanon over the past few days uh also which may indicat that Israel has been detecting hezbollah's preparation uh for the attack uh this morning and was was uh striking um uh preemptive strikes uh towards Southern Lebanon you know the conflict between Israel and hisbah has been uh instilled by a deterrence formula and obviously by striking the southern suburbs of beut last month Israel scored a point and by this retaliation this morning hasah is aiming to regain the det the deterrence and safe face after the huge loss it received by the killing of its senior Commander for aruk what's been the reaction in Beirut well it's early very early in on a Sunday in Beirut to capture reactions from the street but it looks like and despite the big escalation that the situation is um quite contained and is gradually backed to the daily routine of intermittent crossb shelling between hasah and the Israeli uh Army hasah issued a a follow-up statement minutes ago um saying that the operations uh for today was complete was um uh finished and more information on this operation will be released in a speech by its uh Chief Hassan nah early later uh uh this day so everyone here in Beirut is um just anticipating the speech and watching the developments DW's Muhammad sha joining us again there by phone in Lebanon really appreciate it Hezbollah says it's a aerial attack on Israel is in response to an Israeli air strike at the end of last month that killed its senior Commander fuad Shakur on the same day Israel is believed to have assassinated Hamas leader ISM hania in tyan both Hezbollah and Iran have vowed to retaliate to guard against such attacks Israel relies on a multi-layered air defense system April 2024 Israel sustains a massive missile barrage from Iran more than 300 drones rockets and missiles form a coordinated attack for Israel's air defense systems it's the greatest challenge yet Israel claims it intercepted 99% of those hostile missiles and drones so how does it achieve that kind of success it's down to a multi-layered air defense approach comprising a number of moving Parts in some cases quite literally truck towed missile units form the innermost layer the Iron Dome it tackles short-range threats such as rockets and mortars and was developed with help from the US it has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was instituted in 2011 and Israel claims it has a 90% success rate next comes David's sling for mid-range threats that is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles farred from between 40 km to 300 km away again it was developed in collaboration with the US and the outermost layer is the arrow for the longer range ballistic missiles it operates outside the Earth's atmosphere in space which allows for the safe dispersal of any non-conventional Warheads regardless of the method intercepting Rockets is a costly business the cost of one Arrow intercept a missile is between 22 and $3.5 million according to Media reports 110 of them were used to defend against the Iranian attack suggesting a cost of $385 million the mid-range Rockets from the David sling system are about $1 million each estimates put the cost at 550 million to $11 billion just for the April operation there is another important layer too Israel's Air Force a key part of its defense picture and in addition to all this there are new tools coming online such as the laser powered iron beam set to be integrated into Israel's multi-layered and seemingly successful air defense system
