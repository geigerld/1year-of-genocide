Ukraine's Parliament has passed a new law making it easier to call up new recruits it requires all men between 18 and 60 years old to carry documents showing that they have registered with the military new troops are desperately needed a general told lawmakers ahead of the vote that Ukrainian soldiers are outnumbered 10 to one in places the parliamentarians also dropped a clause from the law placing time limits on service earlier versions had allowed for demobilization after 3 years and that omission is a bitter blow for battle weary troops some of whom have been fighting since the War Began we're at a training ground near keev in just a few weeks time these soldiers will head back to the front lines where they've been since Russia invaded two years ago last year I got five days off lots of guys in my unit have families who've gone abroad some have even become grandfathers and have never met their grandkids perhaps they never will this isn't Alexander's first experience of War he served in the Army after 2014 when Ukraine was fighting Russian back separatists in donbass he left in 2020 to start a business and a family his wife and his three-year-old daughter have barely seen him since he went back to his unit after the fullscale invasion if you were told you'd be serving until 2025 you'd know that if you survive you'd be going home if people can't make plans they get depressed and then they start making mistakes Alex Ander tells us it's not a question of wanting to leave straight away it's about feeling some kind of control being able to plan your life that he's convinced would boost morale demobilization after 18 months on the front lines or a total of 36 month service were both discussed when this law made its way through Parliament it was Central to the rationale for the new law calling up new soldiers to give veterans a chance to recover in the end any mention of demobilization was dropped with little prior warning only returning prisoners of War get an exception Russia is preparing to mobilize at least 300,000 men over the next 6 weeks that's in addition to 150,000 doing their military service there could be another wave of mobilization in the autumn in this situation demobilizing experienced soldiers would be suicidal these soldiers wives and mothers protesting near Parliament don't expect their husbands to come home right away what they want is Clarity our husbands are being punished for their patriotism for volunteering to fight when the war started my husband told me I can't just sit around I have to serve someone needs to defend this country if I don't go who will my husband's exhausted is only 29 and he's already gone gray for now no one in Ukraine's military or politics wants to make promises to these families that they know they'll most likely have to break what they can do is make sure it's not just those who volunteered in the early days of the war that are left defending Ukraine's front lines let's get more on this from Mike Martin a war studies fellow at King's College London and a military expert Mike good to see you again can you tell us why Ukraine has made this change to its mobilization law now at this stage well I think it's two things one is is you know the war has been going on a long time and it's not obviously the number of killed but there's probably three times as many injured and so they're running out of soldiers and at the same time we can see that Russia is mobilizing large number of troops continually you know the Russian population is probably three times the Ukrainian population so there are much bigger reserves on the Russian side and what this law is doing is enabling Ukraine to to basically dig in for the long term it enables it to know that it will have a pipeline of soldiers for the next few years so that it can can continue to fight so tell us a little bit more about what exactly has changed here from previous uh policies on the issue what what are some of the key provisions of this new Ukrainian mobilization law yeah so it was pretty controversial it's pretty difficult to get it through the Ukrainian Parliament but essentially there are two or three key changes one is to lower the age at which people are conscripted from 27 to 25 you know previously they were trying to protect the Youth of Ukraine and obviously that's less protected now they are also after three years you you are no longer demobilized there was discussion about whether that should be brought in so effectively when people get conscripted now you're in indefinitely until the war ends um with a few exceptions and then uh they are also slightly loosening the criteria for which people can be called up so medical exemptions and previously anyone with any criminal record would be Exempted but the serious crimes still Exempted but you know if you get caught for theft or something you you'll be going into the military that doesn't exempt you from military service and what this does is this just boosts the number of troops that they can call upon I understand that some of these measures were were quite controversial um how effective do you think that this law will be in addressing Ukraine's Manpower uh capabilities on the battlefield it it will work because coupled with all of those criteria loosening that I just described to you there's greater enforcement so people have to carry their papers now when they leave the country or whether they get their driving license renewed um people will be checked much more often as to their military registration status and so there is a much greater level of enforcement going on in the first year of the war I think 20,000 ukrainians fled illegally to escape conscription and they're trying to stop that drain going forward with some of the tightening measures that they put in place Russia has claimed capture of the Ukrainian Village of Pera in the Donetsk region the Russian defense Ministry said that they troops had liberated those living there just days ago the Ukrainian parliament passed a law making it easier to call up new troops which are desperately needed a general told lawmakers ahead of the vote that Ukrainian soldiers are outnumbered 10 to one in places the new mobilization Law requires all men between 18 and 60 years old to carry documents showing they've registered with the military and drops a clause placing time limits on service let's pick up on those issues with Marina Ron who joins us from the war studies department at King's College London welcome what does Russia's capture of this Village first of all tell you good day well what it tells us and we have to understand where peray is it's west of of divka so the Russians have been pushing along the line west of of divka around doning ber perom now perom has fallen and it used to be a strong hold for Ukrainian Armed Forces there and it seems like the the Russian forces managed to push the 59 um motorized mechanized Brigade out of perom meaning that the Ukrainian forces have not been able to gain a um foothold on the defensive line so I assume that the slow push will be continuing westwards and at the same time we're seeing advances on other directions such as robotin in zoria such as again chivar south of bahmut so it seems like the Russians are trying to complete the capture of donet so they're working very hard on the donet region but this is not a counter offensive by Russia it is yet to come and it seems like they're preparing the ground for that and it is of course very costly for the Ukrainian Armed Forces because in peram Ukrainian for um sources admit that it it was very costly in terms of Manpower and none of that sounds good for Ukraine what are its prospects after passing this new law well the mobilization law still has to be signed by President zansky possibly miday as expected and the problem with the law is now that everybody will have to um every male will have to carry their military registration documents with them and will have to update their details so they will have 60 days from when the law um is signed to update these details and that includes those living abroad so there is a possibility that more people will be called up and of course there are some penalties expecting those who do not comply with the law they could lose for instance their driver's license in in some cases and not be able to travel abroad they will be denied um pass issuing passports and again the question is how is Ukraine is going to pay and uh is it able to outfit them with kit and train them on time in order to send them to the front in order to stop the Russian advance and an important part is what is not included in the law and that is demobilization of those who have been fighting at the front until now some of them have been serving for 3 years their prospects certainly don't good either do they no absolutely not not and general CI understands very well that um the Ukrainian Armed Forces those fighting at the front need a rotation there are huge losses for Ukraine we don't know the exact numbers but again from the reports and from The Vicious fights that we have seen uh for AA for instance now chivar and even with examples like such as cron Peri we're seeing that the Ukrainian armed forces are lacking troops and lacking troops with experience so what it means that even if the Ukrainian Armed Forces get the Western technology they're still having that Manpower Gap that needs to be resolved and this mobilization law will most likely have a negative impact on the Ukrainian society that seems not to have the same amount of will it used to have in March 2022 to to stop the Russian so that could also make the internal political situ ation much more complicated and create a crisis in the Ukrainian command the latest there on Russia's war in Ukraine from Marina thank you thank you for having me
