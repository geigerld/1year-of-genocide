00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
If you want to drive from Tel Aviv

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.540
almost to the end of the West Bank it’s supposed to take you less than an hour and a half.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.720
But this pops up on the map: "

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.750
This route may cross country borders."

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.504
That makes sense: according to international law,

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:16.260
this is a Palestinian territory.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.725
 But Israel maintains the West Bank is “disputed” territory and often

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:22.383
calls it Judea
and Samaria,

00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:23.508
in reference to the

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:25.350
region’s Jewish history.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.820
This tiny piece of land is home to possibly the most complex conflict

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.693
in the world:

00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:33.110
 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:38.255
And it escalated further in early October 2023 when militants

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:38.600
from

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.768
the Palestinian terrorist
group Hamas

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:41.530
 crossed into

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.050
Israeli territory, killed people, took hostages.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.504
Israel reacted with massive
airstrikes on Hamas,

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:49.190
which also

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.020
killed civilians and displaced

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.850
hundreds of thousands more.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.460
And it's not only
a regional conflict.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.380
The whole world seems somehow involved.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.190
Your own government may
be part of trying to negotiate

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.530
a peace agreement.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.230
Part of your taxes may
go to humanitarian aid in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.134
the region

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:13.340
- or weapons.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.230
And – everyone seems to have an opinion on it.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.194
The conflict has a long history

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:21.406
– of wars, of violence, oppression…

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.310
and failed peace negotiations.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.459
That has left many people hopeless.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.483
 And yes, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict it’s hard to know where to start.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.750
We won’t have time to look into every detail – such as all

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.400
the international players involved.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.470
That’s why we want to focus on the solutions that have been

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.100
proposed over the years. And find out what the sticking points are.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.794
This is Israel,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.490
shown here in solid blue,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.570
 the only majority-Jewish country in the world.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.591
It was established to offer
Jewish people a safe haven

00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:58.376
in
their historical homeland,

00:01:58.376 --> 00:01:59.438
which

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:04.500
many saw as essential after Germany’s systematic murder of more than six million Jews in the Holocaust.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.090
Israel has a population of around 10 million.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.430
About a fifth of its citizens are Arabs of Palestinian origin.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.840
Then there are the Palestinian territories:

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.150
More than 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.610
It has been under Israeli military
occupation since 1967 and is partly

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.850
governed by Fatah,
a Palestinian political party.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.429
Then there’s the Gaza strip, which is controlled

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.080
by the terrorist group Hamas.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.000
The entire population of Gaza has
been living under blockade for more

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.290
than 15 years, which rights groups say is illegal but Israel says is necessary for its safety.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.928
And there’s Jerusalem. But we’ll get to that in a bit because

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:53.750
there’s really

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.010
a lot to unpack.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.280
Basically the conflict is about land and who has the right to it.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.060
But how can this decades-long conflict be solved?

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.377
The most talked about idea is a two-state solution:

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:11.174
An Israeli state, and a Palestinian state – that would recognize

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:12.050
each other and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.700
co-exist in peace.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.102
To dig deeper, we’ll take a short trip

00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:16.970
to the history of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.260
the two-state idea.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.139
In 1947 Britain wanted to end its control of the region.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.680
 The UN proposed a Partition Plan which would have divided historic

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.040
Palestine between Arabs and Jews.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.421
The Jews accepted it, the Arabs didn’t. Israel then declared its independence in 1948.

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.010
And was attacked by a coalition of Arab nations.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.795
Israel won and gained territory.

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:43.190
During the war and the foundation of Israel,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.951
an estimated 750,000 Palestinians

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:49.340
fled or were driven out of the new state.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.340
Palestinians remember this as the Nakba or "catastrophe."

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.780
Israel and neighboring Arab

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.080
nations who said they were supporting the Palestinians fought many more wars since then, changing

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.660
the map multiple times.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.690
The first face-to-face peace agreements between Israel

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.177
and
the Palestinians came in the 1990s

00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:10.110
 in what’s known as the Oslo

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.790
Accords.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.280
This handshake kicked off
years of intense negotiations over

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.190
a possible two-state solution.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.450
Here’s Nimrod Rosler—he's the head of the International Program in Conflict Resolution and

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.730
Mediation at the Tel Aviv University.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.476
That was the point of time

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:27.600
where there was a peak for hope,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.300
for peace among both sides.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.980
And they got really close to
a solution at Camp David in 2000,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.350
but ultimately didn’t make it.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.460
So, hang on a second.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.589
There was never a final peace treaty.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.550
Why?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.620
Let’s take a look at some of the sticking points.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.020
Here’s the first one:

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.410
Jerusalem.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.270
It’s a city sacred to the major monotheistic religions: to Jews,

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.980
Christians and Muslims.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.890
Jews gather to pray here at
the Western Wall, the only remains

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.310
of their ancient temple,
the holiest site in Judaism.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.300
For Muslims the very same site is considered the third holiest place

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.079
in Islam because the Prophet Mohammed

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:14.136
is said to have transcended to heaven from the

00:05:14.136 --> 00:05:14.443
spot where

00:05:14.443 --> 00:05:17.774
the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock is situated now

00:05:17.774 --> 00:05:19.439
- known to Jews as the Temple

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.180
Mount.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.330
And because this place is so holy to both Jews and Muslims, it’s

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.720
a trigger for both sides
and the scene of tensions and

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.040
provocation.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.870
All that’s because the status of Jerusalem is so disputed.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.363
Israel occupied the Palestinian part of Jerusalem, East Jerusalem,

00:05:38.363 --> 00:05:44.376
during the 1967 war, ultimately annexing East Jerusalem in 1980.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:49.110
Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.770
What does that mean in the present?

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.170
Imagine you’re a Palestinian who was born in East Jerusalem.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.460
You might feel Palestinian but

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.150
cannot have Palestinian documents. And you generally also don’t have Israeli citizenship which makes daily life difficult

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.820
– for example, your residency status can be revoked which can

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.210
eventually lead to the loss of
health care and even the right

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.880
to enter Jerusalem.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.904
We mentioned that Jews gather at

00:06:16.904 --> 00:06:19.221
the Western Wall.
But it’s not only that.

00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:23.865
Jerusalem is the holiest city
for Jews, and the most significant

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:29.390
sites for Jews are located in East Jerusalem which is why Israel wants to hold on to the whole city.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.210
But to the Palestinians, East Jerusalem is the capital of

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.017
a future Palestinian state.

00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:37.560
That’s been essential to proposals for

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.100
a two-state solution. And most of the international community

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.470
supports the idea.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.020
So it looks like a deadlock here.

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.436
This is peace advocate

00:06:46.436 --> 00:06:48.270
and
Palestinian East Jerusalem

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.910
resident Adeb Joudeh.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.050
He argues that, because Jerusalem is so special, it cannot be divided.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.030
Jerusalem leads us to the next contentious area:

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.870
The West Bank, the largest Palestinian territory.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.022
The number of Jewish settlers here
and in East Jerusalem has continued

00:07:22.022 --> 00:07:26.376
to rise since Israel
captured the territories in 1967.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.689
The settlers are living
here illegally

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:29.210
according

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.440
to international law.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.280
Why did that happen?

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.790
Many settlers argue with religion.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.640
For Jews, the West Bank
is home to many sacred places.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.280
Others are here for benefits like cheaper housing.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.060
And there’s the political level.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.130
The West Bank has a strategic meaning for Israel.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:54.620
Israel sees it as a buffer zone to defend itself against any attack from the east.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.940
That’s one reason why the Israeli government actively supports

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.420
these settlements and
sends soldiers to secure them.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:09.670
Many Israelis are against the settlements but the recent Netanyahu government has stepped up its settlement policies.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.800
Over the last two decades,
the number of Israeli settlers

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.764
living in the West Bank

00:08:15.764 --> 00:08:16.674
has increased to over 700,000

00:08:16.674 --> 00:08:19.663
 - if you also count settlers in East Jerusalem.

00:08:19.663 --> 00:08:20.870
Remember: 3 million

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.730
Palestinians live here.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.280
In theory Israel has said it wants a two-state solution. But

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.210
the illegal settlements in the West
Bank make it less likely to happen.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.162
Take this Israeli settlement

00:08:35.162 --> 00:08:35.511
in the West Bank

00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.243
 - administered by Israeli authorities.

00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:40.067
 On the other side of the street:

00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:42.660
a Palestinian neighborhood in Ramallah al-Bireh,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.410
administered by

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.250
Palestinian authorities.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.420
This example really shows just
how intertwined the situation is.

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:55.330
A two-state solution would mean Israel at least partly withdrawing

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.003
from the West Bank
and giving up that territory

00:08:58.003 --> 00:08:59.970
for
a Palestinian state.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.130
And we haven’t even talked about Gaza.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.330
The humanitarian situation in

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.199
Gaza was already dire

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:10.383
– even before the October escalation.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:15.640
According to the UN, the Israeli blockade of Gaza and its 2.3 million inhabitants, has led

00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:17.070
to extreme poverty

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.750
 and
very high unemployment rates.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.170
Nearly 80% of Gaza
residents rely on humanitarian aid.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.760
And by the way: Egypt also participates in the blockade —

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.170
controlling movements in
and out of Gaza from its border

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:32.410
with the Strip.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.910
Usually in proposals for a two-state solution, Gaza was going to

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.900
be part of
an independent Palestinian state.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.290
But in 2006, the militant
Islamist Hamas was elected

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.140
in Palestinian territories.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.860
One year later, it took complete control of the Gaza strip.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.738
It is deemed a terrorist

00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:53.703
organization by the EU and the US.

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:57.187
And is responsible for multiple terrorist attacks.

00:09:57.187 --> 00:10:00.340
.
Hamas doesn’t accept Israel’s right to exist.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.649
For Pnina Baruch, a security researcher

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.900
and former colonel in the Israeli army,

00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:09.340
peace negotiations are only possible once Hamas is disarmed.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.754
You have to beat Hamas,

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:12.165
you have take away

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:14.280
its military capabilities

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.381
and
then hopefully they will be

00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:18.540
too weak to continue to control

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.230
the Gaza strip.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.230
I believe that we could do business with Fatah, again.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.220
Just a reminder: Fatah is the main Palestinian political party

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.290
in
the West Bank.

00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:29.940
Fatah and Hamas are rivals.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.610
Fatah recognizes Israel’s right to exist.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.350
Hamas doesn't.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.800
Civilians in Gaza are suffering under the rule of Hamas, too.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.105
And yet — Israel’s siege, the bombing, and killing

00:10:42.105 --> 00:10:46.522
has led many to believe that for Israel it’s not just a war on Hamas

00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:48.123
but on the Palestinians.

00:10:48.123 --> 00:10:50.500
Although Israel insists it tries to

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.830
minimize civilian casualties.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.083
This is Amjad Shehab, he is a political scientist

00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:04.530
based in East Jerusalem.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.717
What he’s talking about here reflects

00:11:06.717 --> 00:11:07.290
what many

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.059
Palestinians are thinking

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.820
– the conflict can only come to a resolution when the rights of

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.880
Palestinians are respected.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.595
Some people say Palestinian
rights would be

00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:18.640
more respected in

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.530
a one-state solution.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.006
There are different kinds of one-state solutions

00:11:23.006 --> 00:11:24.720
that
are being discussed.

00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:29.440
One idea is a unitary state,
meaning one democratic state where

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.800
both Israelis and Palestinians have equal rights.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:41.615
Another idea could be a federal state in which Jewish and Palestinian regions would have wide-ranging powers.

00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:46.929
Or: A confederation would involve two territories with open borders, with a joint Israeli-

00:11:46.929 --> 00:11:48.250
Palestinian government

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.410
 responsible
only for a few issues,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.440
such
as foreign trade and external security.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.309
Mahmoud Abbas, the president of
the Palestinian Authority, put it

00:11:58.309 --> 00:12:02.525
on the table on a political level, when he talked about it in 2021

00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:02.840
— to

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.660
put pressure on the
Israeli government.

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.766
But let’s remember what we talked about earlier:

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:29.170
In all of the official peace negotiations

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:32.840
the only proposed solutions were two-state solutions.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.390
Ideas for a one-state solution have always been just ideas.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.790
My analysis even before what happened...

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.880
She is talking about the Hamas October 2023 terrorist attack.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.097
...was that none of them work

00:12:46.097 --> 00:12:48.361
because of this immense hostility

00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:49.160
that exists

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:50.438
and this friction

00:12:50.438 --> 00:12:52.960
 that will lead eventually to violence

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.059
and I think now it's just strengthened my opinion

00:12:56.059 --> 00:13:02.570
that one state with open borders is not something that

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.500
will work.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.820
And yet: support for a two-state solution has fallen on both sides.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.526
So, will Israel and the Palestinians ever agree on

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.350
a way out of the cycle
of violence and trauma?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.860
For now it seems the only thing people can agree on is that peace

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.800
is still out of reach.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.429
In order to continue to live here,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.975
we have to find a solution

00:13:39.975 --> 00:13:42.070
to the conflict.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.050
It has to be on both sides, but I
believe it will be very difficult

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.730
and therefore there has to be also an international support.
