00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
want to ask you about those spaces
 

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.550 align:start position:0%
want to ask you about those spaces
because<00:09:22.320><c> it's</c><00:09:22.959><c> it</c><00:09:23.160><c> is</c><00:09:23.320><c> incredible</c><00:09:23.760><c> to</c><00:09:23.920><c> me</c>

looking at this from outside that people
 

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.590 align:start position:0%
looking at this from outside that people
would<00:09:26.720><c> actually</c><00:09:27.040><c> get</c><00:09:27.240><c> in</c><00:09:27.480><c> those</c><00:09:27.800><c> trucks</c><00:09:28.440><c> and</c>

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
would actually get in those trucks and
 

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.150 align:start position:0%
would actually get in those trucks and
drive<00:09:28.839><c> into</c><00:09:29.160><c> to</c><00:09:29.399><c> what</c><00:09:29.560><c> is</c><00:09:29.760><c> clearly</c><00:09:30.399><c> a</c><00:09:30.600><c> war</c><00:09:30.880><c> zone</c>
