current in well Germany's top Diplomat has returned to the Middle East in hopes of bringing about a ceasefire in Gaza foreign minister analina Bach arrived in Cairo where she's expected to hold talks with her Egyptian counterpart she'll fly on to Israel and what will be her sixth visit to the country since the Hamas Le Terror attacks on October 7th she's also expected to visit the Israeli occupied West Bank and meet Palestinian Authority leader Mahmud Abbas well joining me now in the studio is DW's Middle East analyst shaie rosanis shy Germany's foreign minister is visiting the region at a time when efforts to secure ceasefire in Gaza are intensifying uh anel Bach is currently in Cairo what can we expect well the deal of the hostage deal that we're talking about a ceasefire hostage deal that's very much the center of attention right now the whole region is expecting if this deal will go through to have some sort of of of of a break for a couple of weeks probably 40 days that will maybe bring a new momentum because we've seen the dire situation in Gaza the humanitarian crisis the famine we also know that militarily Israel is not making much progress and and need might be regrouping and might use that time to come up with a better plan for what's going to happen in Gaza and this is probably part of the center of the talks for analor in Egypt also we know that Egypt and Germany have very strong defense ties so that's also part of that of course um the needs for uh more defense for uh the Egyptians have very much uh escalated following what we've been seeing in Gaza Egypt being you know a major uh partner for the uh uh Palestinians as the one having a border with Gaza other than Israel now barbach will travel to Israel later today uh she and many others have voiced concern about Israel's plans to launch an offensive on the Rafa the city of Rafa in southern Israel more than a million Palestinians are Sheltering right now uh is prime minister Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister Benin now is he showing any willingness to reconsider his plans to launch that assault on Rafa no not officially at least uh he seems very adant in still going through a very massive ground Invasion military operation into Rafa that that city that is on the border between Egypt and Gaza which also affects very much Egypt as a great concern for the Egyptians what happens in case that the over 1 million uh Palestinians that had to flee there will try to find Refuge are they going to cross the border what that might mean what that that could also have risks for the Egyptians that's one part of that but there's also the issue of Rafa itself the the Israelis seem to be pushing forward uh for more uh uh military operations there they claim there are four battalions of the of Hamas of the terror organization that are still there the world the Americans also we've seen uh the the chancellor Schultz there last week we see Bok this week are saying maybe there are other means to achieve your goals of eradicating Hamas of of of building something new for the Palestinians without this operation that might bring many more dead people into Gaza we've already seen 32,000 Palestinian Dead uh how are you going to manage uh in RAF now with over a million people that are there big diplomatic efforts underway uh as you say Germany's chancellor was in Israel just last week now we've got uh the foreign minister heading there from from Germany as well how is this increased pressure from Germany on Israel being seen in Israel we're seeing great concern Israel's isolation feels you know going growing bigger and bigger um and Germany and the Americans are the top allies of Israel they're also the top uh aid provis providers to Israel and that means that there's also leverage there's possibility for both both the Americans and Germany to decide that they condition supply of weapons or maybe uh put any sanctions in Israel and limitations on the uses of uh weapons being provided by these two allies if that happens Israel ability to complete its operation the way it plans it right now in Gaza is going to be very limited um and this is a great concern in Israel definitely okay shaie we'll leave it there our Middle East analyst shaie rosanis thank you very much welcome sir journalist Karim Al Gori joined us from Cairo tell us more about bok's meetings in Egypt well what we hear from the Egyptian sites there were meeting and there were three main topics uh the first topic uh concerning the fear the Egyptian fear of an Israeli incursion into Rafa which is right at the Egyptian border the Egyptian foreign minister said that would be a situation that would be a catastrophe and that would be extremely difficult uh to control something I think uh beook is also agreeing with the second topic is the also Egyptian frustration about the aid coming into the Gaza Strip also from the Egyptian side everything has to be approved by the Israeli side and that is very slow there needs to be more Aid coming in also something the Egyptian and the German side basically agreed on and the third one is of course the Egyptians briefed the the foreign minister German foreign minister on where negotiations are standing with the Egyptians and the the kataris are mediators between Hamas and Israel and the last thing the Egyptians made it again very clear to for bebook that um they want to have and there needs to be an unconditional ceasefire now Karim the UN Security Council votes on a ceasefire today the US warns that that could hurt hostage negotiations what's your take well the US put their own resolution in lately and it was trying to link the ceasefire with the hostage release uh other states were saying that this kind of a pick and choose situation where which would not end the war immediately and this is why we have now a second attempt today brought in by other states asking for an immediate ceasefire for the rest of the months of Ramadan and that should enter into like a more sustainable longer ceasefire and there's no connection to the relief release of hostages in this resolution and the UN describes the situation in Gaza yet again as catastrophic dozens of Aid trucks are waiting at the Egyptian border with little access especially to the north what are you hearing from the people there yeah I mean just yesterday got a message a voice message from the north from a family that is there's a lawyer he's living in Gada City with his three kids at the age between 4 and 11 his pregnant wife is taking care of his two elderly parents and he is describing it was 26 minutes a voice message of total misery he explained uh the situation of food is catastrophic they said at the beginning they ate their stock then they started to uh do less meals then there was less food during the meals and now there's really no food he says they're eating greener they find which they cook and then put it on the plates they looking through other destroyed houses by Palestinians who left the northern Gaza trip in the hope that they find some food there also he said the the water situation is also difficult he takes he walks every day for about five kilometers to get some kind of water which is actually not really drinkable because it's kind of mixed with sewage water and it's very salty and he he describes it there's all kinds of living beings swimming in this water so very difficult and uh the last situation he really explained was the psychological situation of his children he said like all his children are right now too scared to go to the toilet on their own and he describes the psychological situation of his four-year-old which basically he says he's sitting all night on my lap and he makes all kinds of he stops talking he made all makes all kinds of strange noises and uh he's afraid that uh his kids basically are losing their minds so it's a very very miserable situation when it comes to food when it comes to water when it comes to the mental situation of the people who are right now in the Gaza in the northern Gaza Strip and that is underlining I think the need that is also discussed today in the UN Security Council about the immediate ceasefire for humanitarian reasons especially in Northern Gaza kareim thank you very much for bringing us up to date on the situation both in Gaza and from The Talk there in
