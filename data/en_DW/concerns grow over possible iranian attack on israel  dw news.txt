German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has appealed to Iran's new president masud pesan to do everything to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East Schultz wrote on X formerly Twitter that the spiral of violence in the Middle East must be broken now any alternative untils unforeseen risk for the countries in the region and their people in it follows up saying uh in my phone call with the Iranian president I urge that everything be to avoid further military escalation joining us now is benam Ben talbl in Washington DC he works for the foundation for defense of democracies and focuses on Iranian security and political issues welcome to DW news now when do you think Iran will respond pleasure to be with you Tony that really seems to be the question uh of the hour or really we should say the question of the past 10 to 11 days uh there's no doubt uh in my mind that both the Islamic Republic of Iran which is the patron as well as some elements in this proxy Network like Lebanese Hezbollah are benefiting from the fear and the uncertainty and the doubt caused by the potential delay or dragging out of this response but I still do see this as a matter of when and not if particularly given that on April 13th and April 14th the regime launched a historic First Direct overt and kinetic attack from Iranian territory uh against Israel uh just for the the listeners and viewers out there that's anywhere from 900 to 1400 kilometers in distance depending on where projectiles are fired from so I do think their leaders mean what they say uh I think right now they're enjoying much of the world trying to come to them and and call for a deescalation in the tensions uh but make no mistake they're looking to find a way to to essentially say what much of the Hardline press has been saying in tan for the past week and a half which is to engage in blood lust uh after the killing of isma hania in tan and do we know what form this retaliation will take I think I mean there everyone's uh guessing right now it based on what's been said in the Iranian press so far I think the April 13 April 14 missile drone uh barrage is likely going to be a price floor rather than a price ceiling for what we saw uh in the past uh meaning um Iran is likely going to be able to employ uh different projectiles in a layered fashion some which are low and low flying some which are high and fast flying uh as well as benefit from potentially proxy fire uh many Hardline Outlets have been talking about a 360 degree attack Vector Iranian government officials particularly military officials have not confirmed this uh but I do think you're either going to see a change in the volume so different numbers of projectiles or different amounts of projectiles fired at the same time in the same direction or The lethality a more capable system potentially a harder to intercept system uh and then of course the multidirectional threat factor and will this kind of planning be affected by the presence of the US beefing up its military posture in the Middle East one of the interesting things about the changing us Force posture in the region and this is an observable Trend going back I think a decade and a half if I'm not mistaken uh which is that sometimes even at the peak of having two US carriers for example in the Persian Gulf the Islamic Republic of Iran was still undeterred and this is the larger challenge both Israel and America faces in the region which is that while it's essential to send a strong signal uh to Showcase military capabilities to both uh intercept weapons as we be able to respond to potential strikes the Islamic Republic is betting uh that the political will to respond uh is not there and that's why you've seen it engage in a whole host of risky behaviors over this past decade and a half that has led us precisely uh to the moment that we're now in I think if some uh Force deployments had worked they would have worked well uh in the past when the regime had a potentially different and less sticky and less negative uh perception of us resolve but nonetheless this is all stuff that the US needs there for logistical purposes to make sure there's an integrated air and missile defense architecture and if God forbid uh there is a mass casualty incident to be able to potentially respond but that's something the Islamic Republic is trying to wager against okay benam Ben tblu from the foundation of defense foundation for defense of democracies we appreciate your insights thank you
