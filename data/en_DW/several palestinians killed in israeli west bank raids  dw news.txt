at least nine Palestinians have been killed in a coordinated series of raids and Strikes carried out by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank the Israeli Army says the operations carried out in four cities were designed to quote thwart terrorism in Janine and tcam in the northern West Bank tearing up roads as they come Israeli soldiers have descended on refugee camps Villages and cities across the north of the occupied West Bank according to Israel's foreign minister these troops have gone in to destroy Terror infrastructure while Israel has been carrying out near daily raids since the Hamas October 7th terrorist attacks this operation seems to be significantly larger experts say it's the first time since 2005 that Israeli forces have attacked in so many places at once in the West Bank the city of Janine long known as a militant strong hold is one of the focuses of the raids Palestinian media says that Israeli troops here have sealed off several roads and blocked access to medical facilities by building Earth barriers in the streets Israel has been attacking from the air as well carrying out drone strikes on targets including this car that was hit near Janine the Israeli Army released this footage of another strike on the Farrar refugee camp that it said killed four militants this man was wounded in that attack which he said killed his family members my wife asked me what happened I told her and asked her to go and check on the children on the rooftop when she moved to the Rooftop she found three of our children two may they rest in peace and one was injured they took him to the hospital and hopefully he'll be okay it's not yet clear how long the Israeli operation in the West Bank might last the Palestinian Authority has condemned it as a serious escalation and urged the US to intervene let's bring in DW's Felix Hut who's in Jerusalem for more on this Felix these were as we just heard the biggest Israeli raids in close to two decades uh in the occupied West Bank can you tell us more about what Israel is trying to achieve here well the hope that the uh Israeli government and the Army uh have is that they they hope to uh as they said themselves through our terrorism and uh basically look for uh what they believe is terrorism in infrastructure there in the West Bank it is a large scale operation or at least larger than what we have seen so far uh in the past uh several years there's also the there's also been the use of uh aircraft uh in the West Bank which uh in the past few months has become some sort of a normality um and uh given the scale of the operation uh it doesn't look like it's going to die down anytime soon Israel's foreign minister has called for the temporary evacuation of pal Palestinians from the West Bank as part of this operation can you tell us more about that why why is he calling for this well first of all it needs to be said that the uh that the strategy of uh temporarily evacuating uh civilians from an area has become some sort of a uh talking point in Israel um due to the fact that it it has become sort of strategic Point strategic use of it during the Gaza War um at the same time it needs to be said that the Israeli foreign minister Israel cuts um has become somewhat known for his controversial um takes I would say when it comes to the war and it needs to be said that there are no such plans in place as far as we know at the moment at least okay and just quickly let's talk about timing cease fire negotiations are supposed to restart in Doha today could there be any link to these two things well there isn't there isn't any apparent link but we can say that the longer this operation lasts the more casualties uh the Palestinian side will have uh the more likely it is to influence the negotiations in one way or another uh it needs to be said that the negotiations are currently in a very delicate situation uh that there are talks that um that uh the uh disagreements uh still remain um so given that this is the situation every single such uh hindrance of the uh attempts by the negotiations to reach a solution um is bound to be to become ever more difficult Felix thank you so much for that update there that's DW's Felix tamso reporting from Jerusalem and myav zunshine is a senior Israel analyst from the international crisis group in Tel Aviv welcome to D thanks so much for your time today now these were the biggest Israeli raids in close to two decades in the occupied West Bank weren't they tell us more about what Israel is trying to achieve here well there's nothing really new about what Israel is doing it has been doing pretty much daily raids in areas like Janina nablo um not just since October 7th but for several years now although the intensity has risen and as you said at the outset the claim is to thwart prevent or root out Terror uh but what we don't really hear from the Israeli side is the fact that much of what Israel does in the West Bank including the phenomenon of settler violence and increasingly settler violence and collusion with army uh violence is something that has obviously radicalized Palestinians and makes life there almost impossible for them um so this is something that you won't hear much about from the Israeli side um and also the popularity of Hamas since October 7th has risen and the fact that Israel has pummeled and destroyed and killed over 40,000 people in Gaza certainly hasn't made the situation any more calm or moderate in the West Bank I mean the places might be geographically separate uh but these are the same people that we're talking about I should just mention to our viewers that these are live pictures that we are seeing right now um Israel's foreign minister has called for the temporary evacuations of Palestinians from the West Bank as part of this operation talk to her about this I mean does this mean this is going to be uh a longer oparation um I don't know if it's going to be long uh I think you know Israel basically does what it feels it it wants or needs to do on a daily basis so we could see an intensity for a few days and the foreign minister said something that I think he's trying to model what's happening in the West Bank and what's happening in Gaza which is that Israel transfers Palestinians as if they are you know cattle that could just be moved around when need be I don't know if he actually has any say in what's happening he's not not a defense minister he's not in the defense Ministry so I'm not sure exactly how to understand what he's saying uh but what is clear is that Israel does as as it pleases with the Palestinian population in all these areas and unfortunately the outcome has not uh provided more security for Israel in any way if we could talk about timing ceasefire negotiations are supposed to restart today in DOA could there be any link here at all I mean I think what's important to understand especially for the viewers is that these ceasefire talks have for a very long time now been uh kind of a sham a facade there hasn't been any real uh breakthroughs the the issue has been the same from the very start which is that there needs to be a permanent ceasefire obviously Israel has legitimate security concerns but everybody in the security establishment um the people who actually deal with a day-to-day of the military in Israel have said to Netanyahu that he needs to get a deal the hostages and the families of the hostages have all called for a ceasefire deal and Netanyahu has refused to enter one this is even as we see that people are dying in captivity even though there's nothing about what he is insisting on regarding the Philadelphia Corridor uh which is the uh border between Gaza and Egypt all these areas that he says are sticking points is something that the defense establishment has said are not an issue not something that the hostage deal should be um you know halted on or not made on so essentially we have a facade between Israel and the US of ceasefire talks to keep up some kind of what I consider to be now a false hope of a ceasefire because I think if they're was interest in a ceasefire it would have already been reached by now my R Sunshine a senior analyst from the international crisis group in Tel Aviv thank you so much for your time for your insights today sorry I don't have better news thank
