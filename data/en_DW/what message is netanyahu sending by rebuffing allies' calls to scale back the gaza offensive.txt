we begin with the war in Gaza where Israel is pressing on with its offensive in the territory South after rejecting calls from the United States to scale back in a televised address prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would not stop fighting in Gaza until it has destroyed Hamas which is considered a terrorist group by Israel and the US now Netanyahu also rejected calls by the US to facilitate a post-war Palestinian state as the fighting in Gaza rages on Israel's increasingly at odds with its closest Ally the war in Gaza is still backed by the United States but the intensity of operations has come under us scrutiny Israel says it won't cave to American pressure prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu stresses Israel won't scale back and appear to reject the idea of creating a Palestinian state state in any Arrangement whether there is an accord or not the Israeli state must have security control over all the territory west of the Jordan River it's a necessary condition but that clashes with the principle of Palestinian sovereignty so what can I say I've told our American friends this truth I've also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security and Israeli Prime Minister should be able to say no even to our best friends no when necessary yes when possible but the US has reiterated Palestinian statehood is the only path to Lasting peace will we do believe that this conflict as all conflicts do will end at some point and that there needs to be a political path forward for the establishment of a Palestinian state that is the only way not just to answer the legitimate hope streams aspirations of the Palestinian people but it is also this is critical the only way to provide lasting security for the Israeli people and it's not just the us trying to push the Israeli government in a different direction in Tel Aviv protesters accuse the government of pursuing aggressive policies what we ask for is a different politics a politics that can bring both people who are living here also the Jewish people and the Palestinian people peace Liberty and security many fear an outright rejection of Palestinian state Hood now will only worsen Regional tensions and trap Israel in Endless conflict and let's get more from London with Yosi meckelberg he is with the Middle East and North Africa program at the think tank chadam house welcome to the program and thank you for joining us this seems to be the furthest that Netanyahu has gone in rejecting a two-state solution publicly how much of this is him playing to his domestic audience and how much is he sending a message to to you know allies and Beyond abroad it's a difficult question a good question but because netan flip flops for many years according to political needs mainly his own political needs to stay in power and and survive in power and if he sense that the mood in in Israel is against the Palestinian State that's exactly what what he says when for instance he he talked about annexation of parts of of the West Bank and then it stopped the Abraham Accord it stopped the idea of annexation and and signed an agreement on with with the UAE and bahin the Abraham Accord a normalization with these countries there there are no principles in the case of netan anymore and there are no strategy anymore with netan because he's facing corruption try because he failed miserably to to protect the people and defend the people of Israel on on on October 7 It's All About Him staying in power but you know he sends a message to the United States and it's time for the United States to send the message back and and we've seen the United States they have steadily been ramping up pressure on Israel um regarding how this war has been progressing and especially the the human toll that it has taken it appears as if the United States keeps getting brushed off at least publicly how much influence does Washington still have over is iseli policy especially given the support that the US is providing financially and otherwise yeah I think actually the United States should take nany's advice you just said the clip that you that you showed that good friends should sometimes say no to to a close friends and that's exactly what they should say to Israel not to VTO assist fire in in in in the security Council not to support unconditionally war in Gaza that claimed more than 24,000 lives many of them civilians not to support a government that is actually blocking a peace agreement that as the spokesperson the state department spokesperson said is the only way to guarantee long-term is SEC that that that that's your own personal policy prescription for the United States but but ultimately I mean does the United States have that sort of influence over Israel do you think that it could get it to change tact of course it can yeah it's my my opinion but at the same time we know the kind of close relations between the United States and Israel and The Leverage at the United States it from day one not only from 7th October for long before for decades isra the United States politically diplomatically economically militarily supports Israel it means it also has a leverage V VIs the Israel at at this point not only Israel behaves in a way that that harms its own interest it harms also American interest at the same at certain point the United States the Biden Administration and I understand this election here also to think about us interests Regional interests Global interest and also in this case help Israel to look after its own interest because we saw that it's failed timing again so then let's let's let's broaden it out a little bit um more into the region because we've seen some Arab states working on a plan to bring the war to an end and a long-term solution um the comments that we've heard from Netanyahu what message does this send to them specifically you see if you want to B in the and you're right for too long you know the the Israel and the Palestinians and the region and the International Community tried to manage this conflict they believed in this fallacy of status s and this fell apart within few hours on October 7 in the most horrific way and since then we see a war that has no end when netan talks about destroying Hamas we see that this is becoming an impossibility not only politically and ideologically but also but also but also but also militarily at the same time we are not closer into bringing the hostages back while the war is exping to other fronts whether it's with in Lebanon we see that now Iran and Pakistan the H is in the Red Sea and so on and so forth It's actually bring to the surface a lot of the other conflicts in the region that's why CIS far is so important and a un security resolution the only thing that blocks a resolution on the CIS is actually the United States Yosi meckelberg thank you so much uh for joining us to share your view on the political situation in the region we appreciate it thank
