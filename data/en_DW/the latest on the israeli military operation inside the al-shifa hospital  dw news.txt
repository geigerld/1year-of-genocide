we begin with the latest developments in the conflict in the Middle East Israel's military says its forces have entered gaza's biggest Hospital alifa the site of a long standoff the Israel Defense Forces say specially trained troops are carrying out a precise targeted operation against Hamas in a specific area of the hospital both sides say Israel gave it a warning that it would raid the hospital Israeli officials also said they are taking steps to avoid civilian casualties earlier we spoke with Peter Lana of the Israel Defense Forces he told us more about the operation it is an operation that we are carrying out uh based on intelligence information it is a precise targeted operation in a specific uh part of the shifa complex and indeed we are uh conducting this operation as part of our broader efforts in order to destroy dismantle Hamas and its terrorist infrastructure and uh also uh retrieve and bring home the hostages uh so we're conducting this operation over the overnight in order to achieve those goals um uh indeed it is a huge challenge within the hospital complex we have conducted extensive efforts over the last few days in order to evacuate the hospital in order to um get people out of Harm's Way and that's despite hamas's efforts to keep People In Harm's Way as we uh went into the compound the complex we instructed people the uninvolved to keep away from the windows and to take cover uh indeed the operation is ongoing we are conducting our operations in order to distinguish the civilian component keeping the civilians out of Harm's Way uh uh Trying to minimize the effect of our operation on them but there is a military necessity and nevertheless because of how Hamas has utilized hospitals yesterday we shared with with the world how they turned uh the rantisi hospital into a command and control position perhaps even holding hostages there um and this goes and this is just another part of that operation in order to degrade destroy and dismantle hamas's terrorist infrastructure now let's uh get more on the humanitarian situation in Gaza we can speak now with James Denzel he is the head of conflict and humanitarian policy at save the children UK thanks for being with us first of all tell us what you make of the Israeli military operation inside the alifa hospital in Gaza City well I think all eyes are on shifa hospital and to see the scenes that we're seeing from hospitals that do have protected statuses under international law to see Mass graves in these hospitals to see neonatal units shut and newborn babies premature babies taken out several have died and I think think in a way the fate of those babies is a litness test of the international order our ability to get Aid into them an ability to protect them and an ability to save their lives so I think all eyes are understandably on shifa hospital this morning but let's not forget there are tens of thousands of Palestinians tens of thousands of children still in the north of Gaza who have been uh cut off from even the small amount of Aid that has been managing to get into Gaza since the 7th of October and the horrendous of that happen then so uh it's a really desperate time and we're hearing about a Public Health crisis which is adding of course to the the high death toll and injury toll which hasn't been updated since Friday so we don't really know what the consequence of this are the alifa hospital in Gaza City is the largest Medical Hospital in Gaza I understand uh is it possible for medical personnel to provide care in this situation well the wh has said that AA hospital as well as half of gaza's hospitals have ceased to function as hospitals and I think the key question which goes back to one of your previous interviews Terry with an IDF representative is the question about if you can evacuate hospitals where do you evacuate them to uh I remember in the mosal operations several years ago there was a lot of field hospitals close to the front line so that once civilians came out of Isis controlled areas they could be treated there but if you evacuate very injured people from hospitals but do not take them to other medical facilities or other hospitals then you're essentially uh signing a death warrant to them so uh there's there's a huge kind of missing question there about what happens when you evacuate gaza's hospitals which are under incredible strain as you can imagine from the thousands of of of people who have been injured and these are serious injuries Crush injuries blast injuries life-changing injuries for children uh loss of Limbs loss of organ function that will carry they will carry for the rest of their lives James if if you could sit down with the Waring parties yourself at a table what would you say to them directly well I would try and explain to them that the heaviest burden of this conflict is on the smallest shoulders of the one million children in Gaza let alone uh the children that have been taken into Gaza and are being held hostage uh children are paying the ultimate price for this conflict and all I could try and hope for is that adults see in the despair of children the need to deescalate and find a way towards an effective a humanitarian ceasefire that allows us as Aid workers to do our job to reach children with clean water with food with medical help uh with all the protection services they so desperately need because that isn't happening at the moment and of course the toll is absolutely devastating we know that children are the most vulnerable me members of society and and in Wars they are extremely vulnerable but in this particular conflict children seem to be disproportionately affected how do you account for that well unlike other high-intensity Urban battles that we've seen over the last decade uh the key element to the protection of of children has been the evacuation of children the movement of children away from the front lines of a conflict whether that's in bmud or in Aleppo or in in most uh that has not been possible in Gaza because the population is is trapped gen more or less I mean there's been a few people come out dual Nationals a few injured but very small numbers so the majority of the population a very large child population of over a million uh Gaz and children has not been able to leave uh an area that has been completely unsafe there's no safe place in Gaza there's no deconflict space and of course when you see the largest hospital uh being raided as it is that is Testament to that so I think that explains the uh the high high numbers of children who have been uh caught up in this and that again should be a a real claring call to action uh from the International Community James thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today that was James denel at save the children UK Let's cross over now to Jerusalem correspondent Samy suckle is standing by there Sammy what's the latest on the situation at that hospital in Gaza well we know that the forces entered the uh the Gaza shifa complex now it's it's quite a large complex this is the the largest hospital in Gaza City and in the Gaza Strip and the operation is taking part in certain areas of this hospital and from what we know there's been no exchange of fire that means uh there has been no resistance to the entrance of the Israeli soldiers Hamas is saying this is just a proof that there are no Fighters over there uh yet we also heard that there have been some explosions in the complex H the report is that in the western part of the hospital the forces have tried to blow up some doors so maybe they're trying to reach a certain area where they do believe that there might be a Hamas Fighters or even what Israel has said that maybe some of the hostages are held there but I think it's we'll have to see uh whether these claims of an existing of a command center of Hamas they will actually find it or not we know that the hospital had not been fully evacuated some people had apparently sought Refuge there there were still patients there what are you hearing about the number of civilians that are still in the hospital we don't know exactly the the numbers for sure we don't have the same we had tens of thousands that were both inside the complex and surrounding the complex apparently those numbers have definitely gone down but I don't have exact figures I mean the only number I can quote is the 630 patients that are being treated inside the the shifa hospital US President Joe Biden has urged Israel to protect civilians at alifa hospital and use quote less intrusive tactics is is that likely to have any influence on military operations Sami well in in Israel they're saying that they're going to continue with this military campaign we're talking about a long military campaign in the Gaza Strip a campaign that will last for many more months this campaign is now in the city of Gaza and uh the next stage will be when the Israeli forces will be going down south and uh we're expected to have a very long campaign and they already saying now and we're hearing Israeli ministers say that we know that the international criticism will grow the Israeli foreign minister said to journalist that he expects there to be International pressure on Israel in two or three weeks and nevertheless the he's also said uh because he was criticized by by others in the government for even talking about International pressure that Israel is going to continue this military campaign in spite of the internation naal pressure and in spite of criticism that will come from the United States having said that the Americans did agree with Israel that inside the aifa hospital there is a Hamas military presence this is of course something that Hamas also reacted to they came out with a statement saying that this is not true that the Americans are actually backing Israel with this attack against shifa and they're inviting the United Nations to investigate and find out whether there are Hamas military presence in the hospital Sami thank you very much for that update that was correspondent Sami Sak in
