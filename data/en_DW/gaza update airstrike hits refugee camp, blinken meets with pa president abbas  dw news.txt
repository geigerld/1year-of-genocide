the Hamas controlled Health Ministry says an air strike has killed dozens of people at alag magazi refugee camp in central Gaza the camp is in the evacuation Zone where Israel had urged Palestinians to relocate to Israel says it is investigating the claim it comes after the United Nations reported that a school it runs in Northern Gaza was also hit by a strike Gaz and health authorities reported 15 people were killed and dozens wounded with thousands of displaced Palestinians Sheltering in the school buildings a sense of anger and despair is palpable in the aftermath of this round of Israeli air strikes they struck a un run school being used as a refugee shelter at jabalia in Northern Gaza I was standing here when three bombings happened I swear I carried the body then I carried a capitated body with my own hands where should we go they hit the shelters people on the street are hit while walking since when has it become normal to strike shelters this is not fair you walk on the street you get hit while you're carrying a dead body to bury they hit us the Israel Defense Forces are conducting what they called targeted incursions into Southern Gaza as well as pressing ahead in the North North we LED hard fights inside the Gaza Strip we finished and completed the encirclement idea forces are operating from south and north of Gaza City and entered populated areas to do so with Gaza City entirely surrounded Israel's military announced the three-hour window in which people could leave along an evacuation route but some of those who tried claim it wasn't possible the road was damaged because of bombings and swollen dead bodies on the street maybe they've been dead on the street for two or three days so we turned back at high speed because we felt like it was a trap Israel claims to have killed several Hamas commanders and says it is making significant progress Israeli authorities are also still telling people to move South where they say it's safer but with no let up in the bombing many Palestinians feel there's nowhere safe to go US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has held talks with Palestinian Authority president Mahmud abas in rala on a surprised visit to the West Bank blinkin told abas that the US was against the force displacement of gaza's residents and committed to getting Aid to them the Palestinian leader repeated his calls for an immediate ceasefire the US continues to push for brief humanitarian pauses saying that a full truce would give Hamas time to regroup for more I'm joined by Boris foran a political scientist from thead college here in Berlin uh welcome to you Boris US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin met with Jordan and Egypt's foreign ministers yesterday and today he's made a surprise visit to the West Bank he's doing a lot of talking what he actually trying to achieve I think a number of things I mean as we just heard and as we know from the media reporting it's a very complicated very difficult situation he's I think trying to first of all prevent um an expansion of the war so deescalate at the same time he's pressing in his different visits for a pause to the fighting so that humanitarian Aid can happen and then I think he's also having conversations with uh with different leaders and and uh they're thinking about what could be a possible post-war uh regime when it comes to negotiating a ceasefire or humanitarian pause how much leverage does the US have on Israel well it's difficult again I mean everything in this in this conflict is very complicated in the US yes there is a relative support for Israel and there has been a long tradition obviously uh the Republic have passed legislation in the house that is supposed to um to bring military aid to Israel but uh under the condition that it's UNF funding at the same time the Ukraine war so there's uh a limit to the bipartisan support at the same time uh Biden is struggling with his own party where you have progressives who are arguing that he should well try and pull out and not support Israel and and support the Palestinian cause instead so it's a very tricky situation and Biden at home I think is facing a lot of push back it's a very tricky situation and it doesn't get any easier next stop for Mr blinkin is turkey its leader president erdogan has recalled his ambassador to Israel Over the war in Gaza and has ceased formal communication with Benjamin Netanyahu why is blinkin going there I think these are two reasons why he's going there at the same time I think he will ask for moderation on the part of erdogan and and turkey erdogan has called the Hamas a Liberation group and so I think there's been a lot of um well a lot of debate about uh that and I think what uh what blinkin is going to try and do is also to talk about the appr with with the EU that Edan had been seeking in the last couple of months also the US is was supposed to deliver F-16 fighter jets so I think there's another debate that he will use probably as leverage to try and get some concessions from the from the Turkish leader Boris Forman thank you so much thank you let's bring in ammed bam he's a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council joining us from the Jordanian Capital Aman um the Israeli Army has once again given civilians in the Gaza Strip a Time window to flee to the South what are conditions like in Northern Gaza and are conditions any better in the South where they are being told to go um thanks for having me uh it's very hard it's it's virtually impossible to move around Gaza at the moment moving from north to south brings with it lots of risks um a lot of people um I've heard have moved to the South only to find the conditions uh just as of falling with overcrowding for with competition for resources with competition for water for food and then they have made that decision to go back to the north again um what we are saying is that um not only there is no place for these people to to to be crammed into because this is what it has come down to um there is no safe space and and homes and shelters um have been actually bombed in southern Gaza as well release suppliers have been waiting at the Rafa border crossing now for days how much Aid is actually coming through to Gaza and how many people can you actually help with that amount of supplies very little I mean Gaza has probably has had less than 200 um trucks coming Crossing from from Egypt Gaza needs hundreds every day uh with the with the pressing needs that we see on the ground um unfolding the crisis the tragedy unfolding by the minute there there are teams on the ground who are equipped and ready to to provide that support whether that is UN agencies whether that is organizations like NRC we have 54 people despite the tragic losses that they have sustained have suffered they are ready to mobilize they're ready to offer support we have been trying to give some cash support for people to go to their shops and get what they can get however the there is very little on the ground and people are telling us that you know um they are down to the last glass of clean water people are drinking contaminated polluted water children are are being given a biscuit um my colleague this morning had to walk hours um to just um catch a c grab some some biscuit for for for children there um it is a tragedy unfolding and I think even in Northern Gaza for example Aid has has come down to virtually nothing really um what we need is not just a humanitarian foruse we need a ceasefire now and we need these trucks to come flowing into Gaza and save people ammed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council thanks so much for your time
