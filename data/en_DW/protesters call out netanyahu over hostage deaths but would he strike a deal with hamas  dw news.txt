Mass demonstrations have taken place across Israel pressuring the government to make a deal with Hamas to free hostages still held in Gaza the protests come after Israel's military said six hostages were killed by their Hamas captors shortly before soldiers found them in a tunnel anger and frustration boil over on the streets of Tel Aviv police clash with demon rators they've come out in the tens of thousands to demand an immediate Gaza ceasefire deal that would allow the remaining hostages kidnapped on October the 7th to come home they accuse prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political gain of putting his own government's political survival above the lives of the hostages in Jerusalem More protest s this rally is taking place outside the prime minister's offices part of a wave of Nationwide grief and anger gripping Israel as the bodies of six more hostages are recovered from Gaza we are here because we can't have the situation anymore every week we get the best terrible horrifying news about another hostages died got murdered you can't play with civilians Liv you cannot do that and we demand we demand the deal to be right now that's why we Marching for that's what we're shouting for there are many families members of the hostages here saying Wars against the government and calling just bring them [Music] home the demonstrations are taking place on the same day funeral services are underway for the hostages their bodies were covered a day earlier in a tunnel under the city of Rafa in southern Gaza according to the military they were killed by Hamas hours before their bodies were discovered for more and more Israelis the blame for this lies with their government because it was unable to secure a deal to bring them home joining their campaign of pressure on the government a powerful new Ally the head of Israel's largest Trade union in the last 11 months I have shown respons possibility no more I call on the people of Israel to take to the streets leave the workplaces I call on all economic organizations in the state of Israel to join the strike bardavid is calling for a one-day general strike on Monday his union represents some 800,000 workers in areas as diverse as Health Care Transportation and banking the strike would also include Israel's benuron airport halting all flights coming in and out Shalom lipner worked for seven consecutive Israeli Prime Ministers lastly as adviser to the ministry of strategic Affairs he's now with the Atlantic Council Think Tank and joins us from New York Shalom these six hostages survived almost 11 months in captivity only to apparently be killed just hours before the IDF got to them can the Israeli government still credibly say that it's fighting to save the hostages good to be with you David well I mean I think clearly the strategy the government has taken has not been effective has been as not been as effective as they would have hoped I mean some of the uh some of the hostages have been brought home as a result of you know through the IDF operations in Gaza right now um but you know the strategically it has not produced that larger deal that the government has attested to be seeking to get the rest of them out and then time is running for those hostages right now so so your question is a valid one and um and you know a lot of the blame that's being placed on the shoulders of the government right now is uh you know that's where it finds its source clearly in the fact that it's been unsuccessful so so far to bring those people home I mean and if we we look at what apparently happened that they were killed uh just hours before Israeli soldiers got there um that combined with this mounting pressure on Netanyahu is all this going to force him to make a deal deal with Hamas or to change his strategy doesn't actually appear that way on the surface I mean Nano continues to be a divisive figure in Israeli politics there is a degree of uh a large degree of sympathy I would say for his you know his attitude towards Kamas after October 7th obviously but at the same time there's broad disaffection with with how he's waged the campaign in Gaza obviously with his inability so far the the in ability of as a government to secure freedom for the hostages um and that's why we're seeing Israelis back out in the streets right now um it doesn't it doesn't immediately look like he's planning on changing his approach and clearly the protesters are hoping that by bringing out these masses into the streets that you know that public opinion will be able to shift that and you know hopefully tilt that balance and we are seeing hundreds of thousands of Israelis out on the streets protesting against the government how much support though does Netanyahu have actually among Israelis to continue the war in Gaza Le trailing consistently in the polls since the beginning of this conflict so I mean it would seem on the surface that there is not a large degree of support but that you know the Dynamics of Israeli politics are complicated um and to be able to unite the opposition in an effort to push to unseed him or to bring together people in the coalition to join with members of the opposition to do that um you know requires almost what seems to have been a superhuman effort so we haven't seen that happen yet um you know and right now after the events of this weekend uh you know clearly people see this potentially as a trigger to maybe try and change that balance but uh they've been unsuccessful in doing that so far so it remains to be seen if you know that can happen right now Shalom lipner thank you good to be with you and our correspondent Tanya ker is following this story for us in Tel Aviv Tanya it seems to be quite a tense situation tell us what's happening at the moment yeah we're here in the center of Tel Aviv who standing here on the bridge bridg is basically the uh Island Highway and we've seen some scenes down there with the police they're pushing back the protest there have been blocking this major highway for uh for most of the evening I have been lighting also some bonfires and you know a lot of chance here I mean people I talk to you know there's a lot of sadness but also a lot of anger and the anger is mainly directed at the government and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu it's also the circumstances now that the these uh six hostages the bodies uh were found because it appears according to the health Ministry that they were uh killed 48 to 72 hours possibly before they were then uh found and brought to be examined and that means they were also killed by uh uh shots uh so people here saying you know they could have been released uh in one of the hostage deals mainly the deal that's on the table right now but it didn't happen happen and this is the main Demand by people here they're saying you know this needs to happen soon no matter what and we will be seeing we heard it in the report now this is just the beginning tonight we'll be seeing tomorrow a general strike one of the most powerful trade unions joins in and there'll be seeing you know also medium to Smalls siiz businesses they have said that they will close or their um employees can go out in the streets and that's what you know people here told me they come out in solidarity for the families and the relatives of the hostages that were now found also in recent weeks uh but also for those that are still remaining in Gaza and they need to uh be brought home with a hostage deal rather sooner than later that was DW's uh Tanya ker in Tel Aviv Tanya thank you
