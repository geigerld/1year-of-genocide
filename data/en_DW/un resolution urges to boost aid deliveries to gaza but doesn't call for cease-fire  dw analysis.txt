we begin in New York where the UN Security Council has just adopted a resolution to boost Aid deliveries to Gaza Russia and the United States abstained on the resolution Paving the way for the draft text to be adopted a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetos in order to pass the 13 other members of the council voted in favor the vote was delayed for several days as us diplomats haggled over the wording of the text for more now let's go to Washington to our correspondent Janelle dealan she has been following the yeah the haggling that's been going on for days now at the UN Security Council and it was about semantics wasn't it Janelle yes uh this was an epic battle of semantics and negotiators worked very hard to find wording that was acceptable especially to the US the US had taken issue with language in the text among them the call for a cessation of hostilities as well as language in the text that provided for putting the UN in charge of inspecting Aid deliveries to Gaza now it took issue with that language around the cessation of hostilities because the US won't support language that sounds like it could be related to a ceasefire it's position is always that a ceasefire only helps Hamas and it did not want to support the creation of a un Le monitoring mechanism because it didn't want to see Israel cut out of the process Israel did not want to give up control of inspecting the cargo coming into the ga into Gaza for uh potentially weapons smuggled in with a cargo or perhaps concrete that would help Hamas build more tunnels but clearly the language was adapted in such a way that allowed the US to accept this version even though it did end up abstaining in the end again over language issues because this resolution did not contain language condemning Hamas for its actions on October 7 but because all you need is nine votes in favor and no veto that is how we got the resolution pass today and Janelle we know the United States had vetoed the last two resolutions why do we see this change this time with the United States abstaining you know this time around we could really see that the US was trying to balance its support for Israel with its reluctance to veto yet another resolution and stand isolated on the world stage it was the US uh that kept pushing for more time and working with the uh with the UAE negotiators uh in order to find a compromise and this is a water down version of the resolution to be sure instead of a cessation of hostilities it calls for the UNH it calls for unhindered humanitarian access as well as for the creation of conditions for the cessation of hostilities that uh push for a un Le monitoring mechanism has turned into the Secretary General a call for the Secretary General to appoint a special coordinator to Monitor and facilitate uh the delivery of Aid to Gaza in consultation with relevant parties so meaning Israel and Egypt but as for the other Security Council Members you know the ation was clearly that that this resolution had to get passed no matter how diluted this language in the end but really the bigger picture to be looked at here is that this was a re resolution meant to scale up Aid to the people of Gaza and meant to protect humanitarian workers in delivering that Aid and the fact that it was so hard to get to this outcome perhaps does not bode so well for the international process in terms of how it is handling the Israel Gaza war and of course it doesn't bode well for the gazans themselves yeah very good point to make there DW is Janelle deal in Washington with the latest on this un Security Council resolution finally passing Janelle thank you all right for more now I want to cross over to journalist Sammy soal in Jerusalem Sammy good evening to you this UN resolution it does not call for a suspension of hostilities so is this even a story where you are I can tell you that in the Israeli public opinion H this is not very interesting there was a recent poll showing that even if there would have been a un a security Council resolution that would have ruled for a ceased fire 90% of the Israeli public they think that Israel should not abide by the security Council now of course those who are in the foreign Ministry and in the United Nation s they are quite content today as this resolution passed without this kind of a strong language that would call for a a stop of the hostilities a the ambassador to the United Nations gadan he thanked the Americans he thanked Biden for his position and for the position of the United States in the security Council and what all the Israeli official are looking at is is some of the language in this resolution that what they believe still lets Israel control and supervise what goes in and what goes out from the Gaza Strip and this is something that many of the humanitarian organizations are concerned about and Sammy I want to ask you about what the head of the UN Gutierrez said after today's vote he said basically that the problem is is and the problem remains Israel's bombing of Gaza has there been any reaction to that in Israel well as I already said the United Nations here is considered to be a hostile organization to Israel uh one of the things that were said today uh by Israeli Representatives is that the security Council has not condemned yet the Hamas attack back on the 7th of October and basically all these statements that come out from the United Nations are disregarded and I think the only player that has some clout here in Israel is the Americans we're joining me now is Michael Link's associate professor The Faculty of law at Western University in London Ontario he was until last year a un special repor for the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories Professor it's good to have you with us this resolution does not include a call for an immediate ceasefire but rather it calls for creating conditions for a cessation of hostilities could you help us understand um what does that mean sure let's let's remember that this is a considerably watered down resolution excuse me uh from uh from what was proposed on Monday by the um United Arab Emirates um there are three aspects of the resolution which uh which we saw on Monday which are not in the final version that was voted upon today including uh a call for what was in the on Monday urgent and sustainable um cessation of hostilities which I think is another word uh for a ceasefire we know uh that a ceasefire resolution was overwhelmingly adopted by the UN General Assembly uh roughly 10 days ago uh and this obviously is the mood of both the Diplomatic world and public opinion around the world what we have through the use of a threat of a un a US veto at the security Council um is a resolution that calls for um the upgrading of humanitarian Aid to get into uh to Gaza um the one of the areas where um the US was negotiating uh with uh other countries had to do with who was going to be the uh monitor of the aid going in the resolution that call for the UN to be the exclusive monitor of the aid going in this is what was a precedent we had with respect to Aid going into Syria uh the United States objected and it's allowing uh and the resolution I think opens the door to Israel also joining the possibility uh of being able to monitor the aid the fear among many is that uh Israeli monitoring will be slow will be laborious and the aid won't be getting in as efficiently as it otherwise could Professor this resolution it calls for things that are already enshrined in international law I'm thinking of for example making it as easy as possible to get Aid to civilians calling for civilians to be protected so you could understand someone on the outside may be posing the question what's the purpose of this resolution actually one may want to well want to ask that uh that question the um the language of the resolution that was adopted earlier today um removed language that was in the original resolution on Monday which would have condemned indiscriminate attacks though that very phrase against civilians that's now gone from the final version of the the resolution um this is a bit of an irony given that that wording itself uh was used by President Joe Biden over the last several weeks with respect to his criticism of uh of the Israeli conduct of military operations there all that the resolution really does is restate the importance and the centrality of international humanitarian law um with respect to protecting civilians which was already on the books which virtually every country in the world have been asking uh Israel to uh uh to keep so we're really in many ways no further ahead uh with respect to uh I guess assigning responsibility or accountability uh to uh uh to Israel with respect to how it's conducted its military operations in Gaza the resolution calls for a un coordinator with staff at the border to do what well this is to monitor uh uh any Aid going in as to whether or not it may also contain materials or weapons that might Aid Hamas um was we know the kareim Shalom um Crossing in uh from Israel into Gaza uh was opened up finally under uh International pressure by Israel uh in the last two weeks some Aid has been going in there not enough nearly to uh to meet the humanitarian needs there but the uh Aid going through there as well as through the Rafa Crossing from Egypt into Gaza will have um monitoring by all parties I think the resolution says which would include Israel so that it U it can be satisfied uh that uh nothing's going in that's going to Aid Hamas and I think that was a huge sticking point over the last four days in the negotiations between the Americans and the rest of the members on the security Council what about violations of this resolution are there consequences or can anyone and everyone act with impunity well I'm what I what worries me in in the watering down of this language we've seen over the last four days and particularly the enormous gap between what the UN Security Council passed 10 days ago sorry the UN General Assembly passed 10 days ago and what the security Council has passed today um is I suppose assignment even an indirect language of responsibility uh for the humanitarian catastrophe that we're seeing in in Gaza and the extraordinary number of deaths of uh Palestinian civilians the civilian death toll in Gaza let's keep in mind is the highest civilian death toll for such a period short period of time and for any conflict in the 21st century we may have to go all the way back uh to Vietnam uh to be able to measure um the amount of Civilian deaths in such a short period of time so there's really nothing in this language which appears to um commit Israel to uh uh to be more mindful in its operation and Israel of course knows that it has uh the solid backing of the United States with respect to the Diplomatic Shield that the United States Wheels as a permanent member with uh veto power for more I want to bring in military analyst Frank leadwich he is a former British Military Intelligence officer he joins us from Oxford Frank it's good to see you we appreciate you staying up on this Friday night to talk with us um the resolution it has passed but we just heard Antonio gues there single out Israel's offensive as being the real problem here creating massive obstacles to Aid shipments this resolution is not going to change that is it yes well there may also be a problem inherent in a terrorist group that murdered close on 1300 people a few weeks ago and that refuses to surrender not withstanding the fact it's being pummeled and will certainly be militarily defeated but there is some truth of course in The Other Well a great deal of truth that the damage created by Israel's offensive whether willfully or otherwise is continuing to cause problems and it does seem to put it mildly and it does seem that most Aid officials are saying that really this will make very little difference on the ground and you can understand why if you're responsible for a team of people uh to going into such a place when you're not at all sure that uh bombs won't be landing either in your vicinity or upon you uh you may be very reluctant to send that team in with whatever Aid they have and those very brave people will have to make that decision over the next uh few days I will say one thing though there is a positive in this that the appointment of a un coordinator will create mechanisms I think should be very very important going forward you know Frank days like today at the UN they are considered a a field day for cynics I mean we've got Israel being judged by the international Community being judged by its peers but in this asymmetrical conflict Gaza is not and I mean it it makes you wonder so what's the whole point of it I mean what do you say to this yeah well Israel is being judged every single day and I think there's a great deal of truth if in the statements of Israel that that people forget why this is happening in the first place and I'm not going to repeat myself about the uh choices that are still inherent in or still uh open to Hamas or the fact that they use their own people as as human Shields and are still uh hiding uh at least 130 hostages uh but you know look the UN can only do what it can do and there are signals I think that they've given today and particularly I've got regard here I think we must have regard to to the signal given by the United States and what what I think would appear to a neutral Observer is that United States whilst offering a bone as it were to to those looking for ceasefire is also sending a strong message to to Israeli commanders and I'm talking here Netanyahu and his team to the effect that you humiliate us at your peril and that our support you cannot guarantee absolute unquestioning support going forward whatever the President says I was quite surprised not withstanding the fact that there was no ceasefire in the in the uh final resol ution I was quite surprised that the U us did not veto this again as they have tended to do over the past few few few years in fact decades on behalf of Israel so uh I think this will have uh provided some form of uh warning as it were to Israel if not even a slap on the wrist uh but something reasonably significant and mean as you said yourself at the in the introduction words do count yeah we are quickly approaching the end of this year um this war is 3 months old I want to ask you as a military man what does the IDF what does it have to show for its efforts the past 12 weeks what the IDF says today is that they're close they said they're close to clearing parts of Northern or they say Northern G I don't think that's the case they're of course fighting as we speak and KH Unice and bombs are dropping no doubt and have dropped in the time that I have been speaking uh they have revealed they say hundreds of tunnels and they've discovered uh headquarters or former headquarters but look the key objectives have not yet been attained they have not killed or captured any of the senior commanders involved in the atrocities on the 7th yet I suspect they will in due course we've had some false Dawns there and they've you know in a sense to to coin a famous uh Roman uh general you know we we we may have Victory but we we preside over ruins and those ruins of course will need to be dealt with in due course which will require a military strategy not only to deal with the relatively unimportant F matter of the buildings but the vital issue of the people and by conducting the campaign in the way they have which some might say at the very best is um verging on The Reckless and others may say well at the very least they're not deliberately and I would very deliberately killing civilians what they are doing is creating a situation over the next few years where they're going to have to be dealing and we all know this with an Insurgency now whether you can call that a success is highly debatable so it's one thing having or attaining your Tactical goals which it prob the IDF probably will over the next month or two or probably three months not withstanding the fact they may then turn north God forbid into Lebanon let's see um but this the Strategic element the long-term political element how many insurgents have they created in the manner of of of Victory uh and without a political strategy something to hang on to something for the people of Gaza and indeed the people of the Palestinian territories to look to as some kind of future they're looking really at uh uh a political Wasteland and I think still the Americans are putting pressure on them to come up with some kind of workable Strate iic solution to this with very limited success so look there are tactical gains they're doing militarily what they what we all thought they would but I think strategically we're still at a dead end military analyst Frank lwi is always Frank we appreciate your time and um you've been with us throughout all the year we appreciate your candid analysis very valuable there's so many flash points around the world thank
