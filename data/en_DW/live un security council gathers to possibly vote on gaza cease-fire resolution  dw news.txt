than you Mr President colleagues finding a way to better support African Union Le peace support operations is a priority for the United States in 2016 we spearheaded Security Council resolution 2320 which cemented the consensus behind the idea of Burden sharing between the United Nations and the African Union to support the deployment and sustainment of these operations that resolution was adopted unanimously by the council with all council members to reach consensus on this draft resolution and we commend the pen holders for their efforts as well and to be clear there are many important elements in this draft resolution that the United States supports but there is one critical element that this resolution lacks an explicit delineation of the financial burden that UN member states will need to bear for these operations as drafted we interpret the draft resolution as not repeat not 100% funding from the UN since it only provides for quote uh quote appropriate unquote amount of un funding but in order to remove any possible ambiguity we believe that the resolution should be as clear as possible on this point not only on principle but because a clear and actionable resolution will pave the way for the timely deployment of a future Au peace support operation and resolving this possible ambiguity is an important step to get us there accordingly the United States is proposing this amendment to include a specific limit on un contributions in clear language in this draft resolution and ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page about what this resolution means we urge all Security Council Members who would like this draft resolution to be adopted unanimously to also vote Yes to include this amendment in the draft thank you Mr statement members of the council have before them a proposed amendment submitted by the United States of America to the text of the draft resolution contained in document s 2023 9996 of the council's provisional rules and

the representative of France thank you Mr President was unfortunately unable to support the amendment submitted by the United States it believes indeed that it was insufficiently clear on the financing of the 25% that would not be covered by assess contributions believe that one of the key elements of today's discussion and this resolution is precisely to ensure that Au Le operations in this context can predictable financing we believe that this does not meet that criteria we want toat we are resolutely committed to supporting through contributions Au Le peacekeeping operations however we wish to see the African contribution be significant as well but we are prepared to discuss the various levels of financial contribution France and the EU are major contributors to un peacekeeping budgets uh representing some 24% of the total we have consistently supported the build up African Peace operations and we wish to see discussions continue so that we can achieve a balanced and predictable funding framework I thank the representative of France v23 999 as amended now the dra resolution to the vote favor of the dra resolution contained in document s stroke 2023

constructively self-critical with regard to the effectiveness of mechanisms and the Prov meis in place we have full confidence in Africa being able to solve its own problems the but insecurity is constantly changing and there are asymmetrical threat to Peace So Many conflicts in different areas of the continent therefore we've been to change our Paradigm not only with regard to our means of action to address these issues but also with regard to the very image of the African continent which is very very often seems to be one war and one crisis ethnic political conflicts displacement of people Refuge counts um misery dependence Mr President the financial resources are also the heart of war and they are the heart of Peace as well for a long time the African Union depended on donations from the International Community Trend ties because the contributions from the are not disinterested or philanthropic depending on the circumstances lead Mercantile and transactional approaches to situations in certain cases we would underscore that Africa still has the sad record of the highest number of peacekeeping operations of the United Nations of the 16 underway at the moment n have been on the African continent words the in that tells you a lot about the instability on the continent but at the same time the continent is facing a number of uh existing threats and future threats today the security Council has been able to address the spirit and the letter of the charter of the United Nations by agreeing to an assential plan M responsibility in the area of the maintenance of International Peace and security Africa peoples are of the world that is stressed at the beginning of the United Nations Charter and finally are going to be able to enjoy the same aspirations for security and dignity as everyone else which means sh addressing the threats to security and uh that the funding will come from the regular budget we welcome the unity around this table to a here and

give the floor to the representative of the United States uh thank you Mr President colleagues two weeks ago Ambassador Thomas Greenfield traveled to Ghana for the United Nations peacekeeping ministerial and while she was in Acra she spoke to a group of young leaders at the kofan international peacekeeping Training Center she told them that Africans deserve a better vision for security a vision that puts African leadership at the Forefront and African people at the center and that as an International Community we have the responsibility to finance and Empower Au missions to that end and indeed the United States is pleased to support this framework resolution which outlines the conditions under which the UN Security Council would consider authorizing a Le peace support operations with access to un contributions we recognize the au's important contributions with respect to the psos it has already deployed and we applaud the au's partnership with the UN in developing common Frameworks on human rights conduct and discipline for those operations as we look to the future we want to take a moment to highlight a few key elements of this resolution first first it underscores the Primacy of politics and the need for a coherent political strategy to guide any op operation second it notes that any support to AUP psos must be in full compliance with the un's human rights due diligence policy third it emphasizes that these operations must include appropriate safeguards for the protection of civilians and fourth it outlines that any PSO receiving unss contributions will be authorized by and ultimately accountable to this Council for implementation of its mandate and to the ga for appropriate and reasonable use of funds and finally it specifies a burden sharing agreement namely that un contributions to Au psos will be no more than 75% of the cost of the operations annual budget We Stand ready to work with Security Council Members and the African Union to determine how the remainder of the budget would be financed whether through an au Financial contribution voluntary contributions in kind contributions or some contribution thereof I want to end by expressing the United States gratitude to the A3 for their flexibility as copens in helping put our shared principles to paper as well as to Ghana for its partnership and Leadership throughout this process as we're

funding of Peace operations conducted by the African Union with assessed member State contributions of the United Nations the framework resolution is a step towards this go and we welcome that it provides clarification Ely clarification with regard to this to these operations there will be robust peace operations limited over time with a clearly identified exit strategy we also the fact that this resolution has a clear decision making process that's reasonable and it clearly recalls the financial regulatory conditions that are applied once the United Nations funding is mobilized as others within this Council we would have liked this text to be more precise with regard to the funding of the uh these operations to be funded by the African Union and its members we made several creative proposals to find a unanimous agreement and those proposals could and should have been better reflected in the text we mustn't lose sight of the fact that discussions on a Case by case b will probably be urgent discussions situations where we will have to respond to crises and unanimous agreement on the cost sharing terms would have allowed us to avoid sensitive discussions in the future so that we could concentrate on the best multilateral response to apply to restore peace France is available to continue discussions on this very important issue for the African Union for the United Nations where everyone that wants more effective solutions to be applied to African crises thank you I thank the representative of France for her statement and I'll give the floor to the representative of

uring peace and Security in the continent in a challenging moment for the multilateral system especially regarding peacekeeping operations this resolution offers Innovative approaches that could Inspire us to think outside of the box in our search for solutions for the many International Security crisis we now face I would like to emphasize that the focus on funding peace support operations should not overshadow other critical aspects in addressing Africa's security challenges effective political strategies especially those aimed at conflict prevention and that addressing the root causes of conflict should be prioritized both by the UN and by the African Union and their member states we sincerely hope that the framework provided by this resolution will concretely benefit Africa and World security as a whole thank you the representative of Brazil for his statement and I give the floor to the representative of the United Kingdom president and I want to start by appreciating the role and the work of Ghana Gabon and mosambique working with the African Union Commission in seeking to develop a framework for un support to Future African Union Le operations and I think it goes without saying that the UK recognizes the important role that African Union peace support operations can play in delivering peace and Security in Africa the UK voted in favor of today's resolution which represents a significant breakthrough as we look ahead we recognize that more work will be needed to ensure that any future African Union Le operation can access the sustainable and predictable financing that it needs and that requires Clarity on financial and logistical burden sharing Arrangements between the UN the African Union and other contributors Beyond elements for which contributors would already expect to receive reimbursement we also want to ensure that the UN Security Council given its mandate for International Peace and security is fully involved and consulted from the outset in the development of any peace support operation this will help us work hand inand with the aupc to design a countable effective and efficient missions of the future and we very much look forward to working with Council colleagues in the coming months to cement today's achievement and to ensure that we have a workable framework that enables African union-led Peace support operations to meet the peace and security challenges faced in Africa and helps to silence the guns I thank you I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for her statement I the floor now to the representative of Mal president Malta voted in favor of this resolution because we believe that a new season in peace operations missions needs to emerge within the security Council with this resolution we acknowledge the

the way to peace enforcement when necessary implementing a clear robust and focused mandate with a limited duration and time and an exit strategy defined from the outset at the same time we collectively affirm the Primacy of politics and the need for coherent political strategies for African Union Le peace support operations authorized by the security Council these strategies will have a holistic approach and address the root causes of of conflict with this resolution we agree on a clear decision making and authorization process more importantly we set a minimum of compliance standards that will characterize all future AUP PSO missions the protection of civilians will always be prioritized we are also pleased to share that the African Union significantly strengthened its International humanitarian law human rights and conduct and discipline compliance framework with the support of the European Union president this framework resolution is a step towards it's a step forward from from Case by case resolutions that provide partial un assessed contributions we support the intention of the A3 to achieve a situation in which predictable funding is secured for AUP support operations we cannot deny that no agreement has we cannot deny that no agreement has been achieved yet on burden sharing having said that we consider the amended text as adopted Ed as a compromise to move forward on this point we must be clear the responsibility for the funding of these missions should not rest with one country or one Regional group alone ambitious actions Demands a collective efforts contributions for future AUP psos must come from All actors as it has been stated in the resolution we voted for President as a European Union member State let me now sh the eu's
