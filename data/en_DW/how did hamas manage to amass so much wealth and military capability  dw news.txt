now the islamist militant organization Hamas is extremely well funded with many of its leaders working to secure cash from abroad let's take a closer look now at just how Hamas gets much of its International Aid people in the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip lived in poverty and cramped conditions even before the latest conflict broke out but while gazans struggled to make ends meet Hamas which seized power in Gaza in 2007 and is designated as a terrorist organization by the US EU and Germany managed to stockpile weapons money and build a vast network of tunnels that alone is believed to have cost tens of millions of Euros after Israel launched its war against Hamas ordinary gazin flood their bombed out neighborhoods but their leaders are believed to be living abroad in luxury Hamas leaders are reported to have accumulated vast personal wealth media Reports say Hamas Chief isma hania and two other top officials Living in Qatar are worth billions so where does Hamas get its money from the US estimates Iran gives Palestinian groups including Hamas $100 million a year Qatar also channels funding private donors including Palestinians living abroad give money to organizations that funnel it to Hamas the group also collects Millions annually from taxes on of businesses and kickbacks from smuggled Goods one way to get around sanctions and transfer outside money had been digital cryptocurrencies but Hamas stopped accepting Bitcoin even before the war due to increased surveillance and there are accusations that Hamas has siphoned off International Aid money but the islamist group denies using the funds for its military Wing stepen Ryman is with the UK defense and security think Tang known as the Royal United Service Institute Stephen how has Hamas managed to evade International authorities and amass so much wealth and Military capability with it what we need to think about in this area is that we have a regime to prevent the financing of terrorism called the counterterrorism financing regime and this is what Hamas has been able to evade so expertly the CTF regime was set up right after the events of 911 and really the objective here was to prevent terrorists from using the formal Financial system which is the way in which Al-Qaeda was able to finance its attacks so Hamas has found really a series of work arounds and just one of those might be the use of shell companies uh which are sometimes um listed in the name of operatives that could be somewhat unassociated with Hamas they're able to move funds through those companies seemingly anonymously but it's also the truth that Hamas is inconsistently sanctioned uh by different countries around the world it's not like Islamic State or or Al Ka who are sanctioned at the UN level meaning those designations have Global applicability um so I think this represents also the case that uh we have a regime to counter terrorism financing that is somewhat ineffective and lots of terrorist groups have really built workarounds around it over the last 20 years or so can you give us more details where is the money coming from so your presenter shared with you a few different modes of Revenue generation for Hamas I think really three major areas to look at here um the first is around donation campaigns uh and really in this area we do have to address the cryptocurrency issue there's been a real overblowing of the degree to which cryptocurrencies have been used by Hamas to raise funds there's been really inconsistent estimates in this area some quoting 90 million us and others saying it's as little as $450,000 analysts that I trust personally I would say um put the figure close to 0.1 or 1% of hamas's total revenue coming from crypto currencies and really there's a worrying Trend whereby policy makers are basing their responses on how to design regulation of the cryptocurrency sector based on these widely different assumptions of how much is actually used to finance terrorism Hamas also of course is extorting people in Gaza and how for many years so long as they've controlled that territory as which they took over in 2007 all legitimate economic commercial activity in the strip some proportion of that is going directly to Hamas whether that's cigarettes cement or everyday activity but we also need to look at the Investment Portfolio that Hamas has been able to develop over the years you know sanctions from the United States have showed that Financial facilitators based in countries like Syria um Algeria Sudan turkia and others have been able to build a portfolio worth millions of dollars and it's that large network of Investments and companies which is controlled by Hass leaders uh which is perhaps going to become more and more important as the war drags on but also possibly a useful place that we can start to Target Hamas finan Stephen do you believe that money is the top priority for the Hamas leadership or does it play a significant personal role is serving garin's uh top of the agenda I think it's safe to say that during all of hamas's existence certainly its control over the Gaza Strip since 2007 military objectives have always outweighed objectives to to potentially um administer that territory funds that are skimmed off of humanitarian Aid that goes into the strip or taxation of the normal economy that's always going to be afforded to hamas's military Wing the alasan brigades first it's definitely not going to Social Services and this is really one of the dangers of a terrorist organization controlling that territory they nominally say they're looking after the people but really we can't expect uh we can't really take come's word at it when they say that for example uh humanitarian Aid 100% is going to um is going to support Social Services that's just unrealistic now in recent days Israeli police said they' Frozen account at barkless Bank said to be linked to Hamas fundraising is this an important moment or is it just a drop in the ocean I think the freezing of the Barkley's bank account was a great development it shows that there's coordination uh between law enforcement and the private sector on trying to shut down the bank accounts and other architecture that Hamas needs in order to maintain its Global Financial system including that Investment Portfolio but really this is likely just one of several such accounts that exist around the world whether they be bank accounts cryptocurrency wallets Etc this financial facilitation network is really vast and I think we should also be careful when the default decision is to close bank accounts it could be potentially useful to watch the transaction action going in and out of an account instead in order to gain useful Financial intelligence about the operations of those financial facilitator networks that intelligence could possibly lead to a more impactful disruption later later down the line Stephen Rhyman there in London with the Royal United Service Institute thank you very much for sharing your expertise with us thank
