today on the program the following three stories about the Israel Hamas War at least 50 people are dead after Israel targeted a senior Hamas leader in a refugee camp the father of a victim of the Hamas terror attack calls for prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's resignation and we ask if the events of October 7 have ended the viability of the two-state solution but first the Rafa border crossing in Gaza was opened on Wednesday to allow some critically injured people to be evacuated to Egypt foreign passport holders were also being allowed to exit Gaza through the crossing the move comes after Qatar brokered a deal between Hamas Israel and Egypt which controls the crossing and we asked journalist Hugh miles in Cairo if there were signs that Egyptian officials could allow more civilians in from Gaza no um the president CC and the uh other senior Egyptian officials have made it repeatedly clear that there is absolutely no way that they are going to allow in uh large numbers of of Palestinians uh into to North Sinai this is a red line for the Egyptian authorities um and they have repeated this um you know for for internal political reasons historical reasons um there is just no way that the president CCE can allow um massive amounts of people to come out and and he's made that perfectly clear meanwhile Israel has bombed one of gaza's biggest refugee camps killing at least 50 people and wounding hundreds more Israel says a senior Hamas Commander was targeted and killed in the strike on the jabalia camp and that some of the militant groups underground tunnel complex was destroyed searching for survivors after Israel struck the largest refugee camp in Gaza the strikes left two massive craters in the crowd of jabalia camp videos from the scene showed more than 45 bodies recovered from the rubble may God have mercy on them to God we belong and to him we will return intercede for us God is great we die as martyrs alhamdulillah may God give me patience the casualties have overwhelmed the nearby hospital a large number of injured have come to us after the explosion That Shook the entire jbala Refuge Camp they were targeted while in their homes children all Martyrs children women elderly we have no idea what to do there are injured people everywhere Israel's military has confirmed it struck the camp which is a shelter for Palestinians displaced after the 1948 War but said the operation targeted and killed a Hamas Commander tonight we eliminated the murderous terrorist Ibrahim barari since the IDF forces entered Gaza barari has been the main combat leader in the northern Gaza Strip he also had a part in the massacre on October 7th in his assassination many terrorists were killed those who stayed with him in the building and in the underground area below the damage to bari's building collapsed additional buildings because there was a wide ground infrastructure in jabalia made to carry out terrorist operations against our forces the entire infrastru collapsed and many terrorists were killed another refugee camp the nsat camp was hit in an unrelated strike the Hamas controlled Gaza Health Ministry says more than 8 and a half thousand people have been killed since Israel launched its war and that more than 3,000 of them are children Gaza has become a graveyard for children it's a living hell for everyone else and yet the threats to children go beyond bombs and mortars child deaths to dehydration particularly infant deaths to dehydration are a growing threat the UN agency says water shortages are affecting access to clean water for more than a million children the World Health Organization has meanwhile warned of critical shortages at hospitals surgeries cannot happen without anesthesia in fact they do happen without anesthesia um it's an imminent Public Health catastrophe that Looms with the mass displacement the overcrowding the damage to water and sanitation infrastructure Aid organizations say the deliveries of vital supplies cannot take place without the security guarantees of a humanitarian pause and DW's Ben fulan in Jerusalem told us more about what Israel has been saying about its strike in the middle of the crowded jabalia refugee camp Israel is justifying this by saying that it has knocked out one of the key Hamas commanders uh the commander who is said to have prepared and also executed the october7 attacks uh hus denies that any uh senior official was in the camp at the time of this air strike uh it also justifies this by saying that dozens of combatants were killed in the same tunnels that collapsed under the air strikes um the IDF uh gave out that statement earlier um say saying that many reports of Civilian deaths were a result of this attack now we're not getting exact numbers from them the numbers we're getting from the Palestinian Health Ministry in the control Gaza Strip is uh somewhere around 50 Palestinians they don't uh usually um say whether or not these are civilians or combatants in this case uh 150 wounded humus itself interestingly enough is saying 400 Dead uh so huge discrepancies here and you can really tell um for the first time when we had this Hospital blast uh just recently the Al Ali Hospital uh there were real doubts about whether or not the health Ministry in controlled Gaza was giving accurate numbers because they came out so quickly after the attack um in past conflicts they have been known to line up with Israeli estimates um in this case today what we're hearing is a huge discrepancy between Hamas and the health Ministry in Gaza and more than a million people have fled to the south of Gaza after Israel warned them to move for their safety thousands are Sheltering in makeshift refugee camps and with very little Aid coming in many in these tent camps are living without basic necessities like clean water clothing and medicines this is their first cooked meal in weeks Muhammad Zaki and his family left their home in central Gaza to head south for their safety they found shelter here at this newly formed camp in the city of Khan yunas Muhammad Zaki has now started selling tea to earn money to live the camp only has a limited supply of water and it has to be boiled to make it safe for drinking thank God we are in our country in Gaza our homeland but the situation over the past 22 days from bombing destruction homelessness hunger is very bad we heat water on Fires cook on Fires find wood here and there we buy water for 50 US cents we don't have mattresses or anything in our tents in our family we have women children and men but without anything this makeshift settlement like many others has no power or Internet Camp residents have to adapt to the limited resources available and find whatever work they can after leaving everything behind I used to own own a shop but it was bombed it was bombed from the second day and after I came to the hospital here I took my kit with me the original kit was broken this is an alternative kit using a phone charger for the razor I connected them and used them thank God for some simple everyday acts have become a source of comfort we've been living in destruction and Bing for 23 days we are here to shave in order to change our mood our beards and hair grew long we are waiting for God's mercy not for Arabs or anyone else to do anything no one will stand by side here for many life has come to a standstill and with no sign of the hostilities ending these tents could be their only homes for a long time influential Israeli entrepreneur AEL valdman is calling on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign the businessman made headlines when his former tech company became the first Israeli firm to hire Palestinian Engineers DW correspondent Ben fulan met Waltman who is one of many Israelis to lose a family member in the attack by Hamas this is Danielle and no and Jesse I'm at the high-rise home of a vman in Tel Aviv his 24-year-old daughter was killed on October 7th with her boyfriend Noam Shay he shared with me their story Danielle and Noam they're amazing kids like really uh loved having fun doing stuff and uh enjoying [Music] life and then on Friday they decided to go to this party of Freedom love and peace the Supernova festival with a lot of music DJs and so on so they brought their dog to her mother said we'll come Saturday morning to pick her up they went down south they were in the party and then uh those creatures came from Gaza and started uh slaughtering raping cutting Parts taking eyes out doing awful things things to all those uh people and Danielle no and her friends got in a car got out of the party they went South which probably would have been smart uh because most the kids turned North and uh it was more free uh but then three terorists from behind show them we saw I we found the car we've seen a Trails of three kalachnikov shells from behind shooting at the car we found like a Gaza SUV a Toyota SUV about 150 M north of them with three buddies one out of the car and two inside and then we found a motorcycle south of them so they really couldn't escape and they were shot out of the five we think one ex hostage and four dead how are you processing things first of all it's difficult um I think losing a son or a daughter is something no one should experience and unfortunately we're experiencing now after the murder of Danielle and her boyfriend n it's uh definitely a very difficult time for my ex-wife Danielle's mother her brother and sister and for me as well but you not only lost a daughter you also lost a a potential son-in-law yes they were talking about getting married and unfortunately that wouldn't happen you know my ex-wife I think two or 3 days ago said that she had a dream of Danielle in a in a wedding dress I was really painful because this will never happen then will never wear a wedding dress and instead of doing a wedding we buried them together we had a funeral your opinion what went wrong from the Israeli side oh we completely messed up I mean just amazingly how messed up we were so our intelligence failed uh our Communications failed so this wasn't just uh a failure of of surveillance but also on a political level obviously there is responsibility on the government on the prime minister no doubt they should definitely resign shamefully and uh remove their places so what's next I hope that after this crisis that we went through after the murder of Danielle and no that is an amazing sacrifice an unbelievable pain we will be able to do something and and create peace but only after destroying Hamas and Islamic Jihad and making sure that the people that have done what they've done are eliminated from this place is what what sort of world would you like them to have experienced you know a world of Peace a world of Freedom you know I think Gaza citizens do not deserve what they're going through now Gaza citizens should be free should be celebrating should have amazing hotels on the beach they have amazing beaches there have been there multiple times they should have amazing agriculture they should have amazing things Hamas and Islamic Jihad are responsible for what Gaza is now in 2005 when we left there were a lot of Agriculture tourism other infrastructure they've destroyed everything and went to war with us I hope now after this they and we will help them rebuild this to really build an area where we can live together in synergistic relationships both economic and tourism and whatever and uh build a great two states for the two people thank you very much thank you a two-state Arrangement has been touted as a solution to the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians it was suggested at the UN in the late 40s and just last week US President Joe Biden reiterated his support for it so what exactly is the two-state solution and what are the challenges around its implementation here's a quick explainer Decades of violence and occupation how could they end an independent Palestinian State alongside Israel has long been considered the solution today the Palestinian territories are largely under Israeli control a Palestinian state would mean full sovereignty and the end of Israeli occupation the promise self-determination for the Palestinians and security for Israelis who have long contended they live under constant threat of terrorism and attacks here are three of the big problems around 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegally according to the UN and international law it's difficult to imagine them leaving without resistance then there is Jerusalem Israel has annexed the eastern part of the city it hosts both judaism's holiest site and the third most important site for Islam Israelis and Palestinians claim the city as their capital and reject ideas like International control 30 years ago there was at least the will to try and get over those problems but the peace efforts were undermined by extremists on both sides violence made new talks impossible so the crucial problems remained unsolved after years of occupation many terrorist attacks and retaliatory strikes only a minority of Israelis and Palestinians continue to believe in a two-state solution since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th 20123 it seems further away than ever Hamas mentioned there controls the Gaza Strip while the Fatal Palestinian Authority runs the West Bank both parties have been Arch Rivals since Hamas violently ousted fata from the Gaza Strip after winning elections there in 2006 fata leader mmud Abbas is recognized internationally as president of the Palestinian Authority but in recent years his legitimacy has been increasingly questioned at home fata is the largest secular Palestinian political party it's also the driving force of the Palestine Liberation Organization or PLO the umbrella group internationally recognized as representing the Palestinian people the current PLO chairman is fata's leader Mahmud Abbas he's also the president of the Palestinian Authority which governs parts of the occupied West Bank the Palestinian Authority doesn't govern Gaza the islamist militant group Hamas took over in Gaza after 2006 elections and kicked fata out of the territory Mahmud Abbas was one of the activists who helped form fata at the end of the 19 1950s initially it focused on militant opposition to the Israeli government however in the 1980s fata shifted towards diplomacy former fat leader and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat became an important player in the Oslo Accords this was a peace deal signed between Israel and the Palestinians that proposed a two-state solution fata still supports this and recognizes the state of Israel unlike Hamas fata's vision is an independent pal Palestine made up of the West Bank East Jerusalem and Gaza this is based on the borders established after the 6-day war in 1967 but there's been little progress on that front which has led to frustration among Palestinians and since Israel militarily occupies the West Bank and has annexed East Jerusalem many are losing faith in the fata controlled Palestinian Authority they see the PA as complicit in the occupation and reject its legitimacy there's also uncertainty over the Palestinian Authority's future its aging leader mmud abbass was elected in 2005 to a 4-year term elections have not been held since his party fata has also been dealing with infighting over who his successor should be frustration has led to Palestinians seeking Alternatives in recent times Hamas has seen a rise in support this is adding to the pressure on fat now questions are mounting over the role it will play as the Israel Hamas War rages in Gaza and joining me now for more is Dr RI kri from mfim the Israeli Institute for regional foreign policies Dr Krick welcome I have one basic question for you and that is this is the two-state solution dead a concise answer no it's not dead on the contrary now even There's an opportunity to to revive it you talk about Reviving it and you you you talk about Reviving it uh who has to take the first step here to try and revive it and how does this revival occur well if Israel wish to um terminate the Kamas rule in Gaza the only one who can take responsibility over the Gaza which is not um um the Israeli uh force would be the Palestinians themselves uh the interest of Israel and of the Palestinians or the moderate one is that the Palestinian Authority or any other moderate Palestinian leadership would take the responsibility over Gaza the only way a moderate Palestinian would enter Gaza and take responsibility and gain legitimization if it becomes it comes with a Palestinian state recognize Palestinian State at the end of the process so there is an opportunity now if you wish to terminate the Kamas uh to revive the two-state pal two- State solution that that's a big step and I know that that's what the stated aim of the Israeli operation in Gaza is but what you're basically saying to me is that Hamas first needs to go and then a moderate Palestinian leadership takes the space in the Gaza Strip and then potenti one has an Israeli one has a Palestinian side that one can talk to is that what you're essentially saying to me actually not exactly because what I would like to say is that you cannot terminate Hamas rule over the Gaza Strip or anyway terminate Hamas as a terror organization without um a political um solution a diplomatic solution at the end of it you cannot do that the only way to uh terminate Hamas rule over Gaza and and its and its strength also in the in the West Bank is by uh proposing an alternative and the alternative at the end of it at the end of the process is a viable Palestinian State who recognized the Israel and wish to live side by side okay you know there has been criticism there has been criticism within Israel already of uh prime minister netanyahu's government and particularly uh that his government has taken steps to well let's say either sidestep the two-state solution or not pursue it in with as much Vigor as potentially people might have expected that to happen if that has been the record so far what leads you to believe that from the Israeli side at least under this government there will be a pursuit of the two-state solution well uh the description is right K's government chose to manage the conflict and uh even to strengthen Hamas in order not to pursue the two-state solution in order to hinder it so this current government of Isel would not be the one who would promote uh a political solution it would not pursue any kind of two-state solution thus it would have to be other forces in the in the arena to promote it International Community the United States the Israel new friends in the in the neighborhood from Saudi Arabia or Egypt Jordan or government in Israel otherwise no you cannot expect that from nany's government but doesn't a lot of this depend on how the current Israeli campaign in Gaza runs as to what uh measures its success and what ultimately happens to the Hamas leadership it does currently the Israel government pushed aside any kind of discussion about the day after thus you cannot even measure the success of the campaign in Gaza because you don't know where you want to go so if you don't know where you want to go how can you measure what you do and how can you decide if what you're doing is is the right thing to do so first you have to decide where you want to go and then you can measure if you if what you do is successful or not uh and this is the situation now so it's it's hard to to imagine and to think if what you're doing is effective if you don't know what you want to achieve at the end how much support is there within the Israeli public to pursue the two-state solution given the atrocities and the horror that we have witnessed on the 7th of October well it it it is hard know because now everyone is shaking but also uh consensual prits are have been shaken as well so if you have an political actors who push narrative and explain the Israeli public that in order to fight Hamas in order to terminate his rule in Gaza and everywhere you have to have at the end a pales inian functional strong State side by side next to Israel then it is something that the Israeli public would be able to hear because that but you have to have an you have to have an actors that promote this narrative and otherwise it would be hard to convince the Republic to go to such Avenue take such Avenue we'll leave it there for the timing but thank you so much for joining us today Dr Ro kri from MIM thank you sir thank you thank you for inviting and that's it for now this continuing updates on the Israel Hamas war on our website I'm bsh pan in Berlin thanks very much for
