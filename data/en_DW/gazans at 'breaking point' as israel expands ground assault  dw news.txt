have broken into un Aid warehouses in Gaza taking food and other supplies amid growing hunger and Desperation gazin make a desperate dash for basic supplies raiding un we houses for flour and hygiene products thousands rush to take whatever they can carry the chaotic scenes a sign of growing [Music] despair we have no flower no Aid no water not even toilets our houses were destroyed no one cares about us we appeal to the people of the world all International powers are against us we needed Aid and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need [Applause] the call for help comes as Palestinians face growing Danger from Israel's ground offensive Israel's military released these images of what it says are troops pushing into the north of the Gaza Strip as they try to eliminate the Hamas terrorist group and rescue more than 200 hostages thousands of gazans are Sheltering at the AL koods Hospital amid the conflict now officials have been told to evacuate here too the number of displaced people here is between 12 and 14,000 the figure changes every day counting the hospital departments and the Intensive Care Unit we have nearly 60 patients as well as 800 injured who are receiving treatment in the emergency department Israeli strikes have already hit the area around down the hospital but some feel leaving isn't safe either and despite the growing risk from air attacks thousands of Palestinians are running out of places to run to let's bring in Toby fricker here he is a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF he joins us from Aman Jordan Toby UNICEF has people on the ground in Gaza what are they telling you about the situation there yeah that's right UNICEF has a team on the ground in the Gaza Strip uh we lost communication for around 24 hours but thankfully yesterday we were in touch again with the staff what they're saying is the situation is is really horrific uh you know we have a staff member called nesma who has a four-year-old seven-year-old girl uh she was telling us about how how petrified they are her four-year-old has been you resorting to to sort of self harm pulling her hair scratching her her thighs because she's in such fear and and the trauma's affected her so so much but at the same time they're struggling to get access to to the essentials for life so Safe Water they've been drinking salty water now for around 10 days um and her children have been saying yeah why can't I have you know clean water safe water again regular water um so the situation is is is horrific for for every child inside the Gaza Strip right now there's a lot of concern Toby about what's happening in Gaza City particularly at the aifa and alud hospitals what can you tell tell us about the situation there yeah well I think the hospitals have been under massive strain I mean even before this escalation uh the resources that hospitals had were limited in terms of medical supplies in terms of fuel and now with this escalation the situation is really horrific first of all they're treating people who are wounded children who are wounded in in in attacks but they're also treating people particularly children newborns in incubators and others for for for diseases and and regular issues that happen all the time um and now we you we're extremely concerned from from what we hear about the situation you know under International humanitarian law let's not forget that healthc care facilities are are protected and that's absolutely critical at this time as the World Health Organization and others said you know moving any anyone from any hospital is essentially a death sentence a UN General Assembly resolution has called for an immediate ceasefire that's among growing demands for a humanitarian pause in the fighting do you believe that we will see the opening of humanitarian corridors anytime soon well we very much hope so uh that we'll see uh increased humanitarian access safe unimpeded access that is not just oneof deliveries but is sustained we really need to scale up the amount of life-saving supplies that can come in some have come in but it's it's certainly by no means enough given the immense needs that are inside the Gaza Strip and that's why UNICEF that's why the UN Secretary General keep calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so that humanitarians can safely move supplies around first of all get them in and then move them around to reach uh people who are in such need at this time the focus of your organization of course is children you described to us uh an anecdote from one of one of your uh employees on the ground there how are children in general being affected by this war because I understand the number of casualties among children is very high yeah I mean the number of casualties is is horrific I mean more than 3,300 children have reportedly been killed you know another more than 6,300 children reportedly been injured you know the these numbers are are immense and and horrific uh so first of all what people are trying to do is protect the lives of their children you know the staff member I spoke about nesma she's been her her first priority is to protect her children's lives understandably of course but she's also trying to do a job a humanitarian job to support other other children to support other families who are also having massive massive needs um so the situation is really horrific and then and then there's the access to to Services you know to Health Services to essential service to that safe water that we spoke about it's so critical to to keep children alive and that's where we're at it's really about life-saving work Toby thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today that was Toby fricker spokesperson for Unicef speaking to us from Aman Jordan thank you our correspondent Rebecca ritters has the latest now on the Israeli ground offensive from ashdod close to the Gaza Border in southern Israel it's very very hard to get access impossible to get access but very hard to know what's happening on the ground in Gaza we've been witnessing or hearing at least a lot of the second phase of this war this expanded ground Invasion we know that that continued to expand the Israeli military telling us again this morning that they're bolstering and expanding in the the scale and scope of this ground Invasion but exactly what's happening on the ground is is very very hard to verify we're getting peac Mill bits of information we we it seems to appear or there are reports that Israeli military ground forces are now around about 3 kilomet inside that periphery of Gaza uh and there's hand to-hand combat going on we've heard that there were uh there was rather a big battle around the arz crossing um but we don't know anything about numbers the Israeli military saying that they uh targeted many Hass militants but seeing in some of the Palestinian telegram uh telegram TR chats excuse me that also some soldiers were killed as well but as I say very hard to verify exactly what's happening on the inside we know that there was a huge internet blackout for nearly 36 hours from Friday uh into Sunday morning and that made tell Communications obviously getting news out even more difficult was such a relief yesterday morning when we were finally able uh to reach some of our colleagues there but you can imagine the fear for the the Garin on the ground not able to get in touch with their loved ones not to be able to get in touch with Emergency Services when in fact there were air strikes in their area so a very serious uh terrible situation happening and just so difficult for us to be able to really know exactly what's happening now Hamas still has more than 200 hostages has there been any progress backa in negotiating their release well that number last night actually was risen uh by to 239 now there's still 40 people missing so that number could well rise again Terry the negotiations We Believe are still ongoing Qatar playing a very big role in those negotiations but we also know that Qatar have said or prior to the ground Invasion K Kat negotiators said that it would make negotiations very difficult if the Israeli military were to go in they have now indeed done so and so we don't know the state of those negotiations there is some thought that perhaps a ground Invasion may put pressure on Hamas while we have other people saying that it's going to have the opposite effect and in fact the fact that the G ground Invasion has started means that getting those uh hostages out alive is almost impossible once again very hard to know look into the crystal ball but uh the lot of pressure on the government from the families of those hostages very upset very on Friday when the ground Invasion began they were very upset they were you know there was a meeting held with prime minister benjam Benjamin met Netanyahu to say that they were very angry that they weren't informed and the fact that this was happening meant that they you know almost had no they were starting to lose hope that their loved ones would come out alive so a very very serious situation also for the hostages you mentioned pressure Rebecca world leaders stepped up calls for desperately needed humanitarian Aid to reach Gaza what's Israel's response to that kind of international pressure well we're slowly starting to see more Aid go into Gaza though nowhere near the amount that's needed for the people there on the ground uh overnight 33 more trucks were allowed in but we're getting eight saying some eight organizations saying that more than 80 a day are required for the needs of the people there and that we're just not seeing anything in those numbers now in the beginning Israel was hesitant to allow any Aid to go through it all when President US President Biden came that deal uh he struck a deal that to be agreed the get the Israelis to agree to start allowing Aid coming in we've been seeing that slowly trickle over but a hell of a lot more is needed for what's the the humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding on the ground though as I say 33 trucks more came in overnight and yesterday the language from the military started to change they started saying that they would be allowing more and more trucks to come through now whether that's because they know that this is going to take a very long time and they simply have to allow Aid in uh so that the humanitarian catastrophe uh doesn't completely explode on the ground uh you know that could really say something about their tactics but so far not enough Aid is getting through but hopefully in the coming days that will be expanded Rebecca thank you very much that was our correspondant Rebecca Ritter there in southern Israel for more on Israel's incursion into Gaza we can talk now to military analyst Mike Martin of King's College London Mike how do you see Israel's ground operation unfolding in the days and weeks ahead morning Terry um I I see it unfolding very slowly because it's it's quite a difficult thing to do to move into an urban area and to try and you know Israel said they want to destroy Hamas that's a very difficult thing to do and so what we've seen so far is Israel's crossed into the Gaza Strip hasn't gone into the urban area but is securing some areas outside of Gaza City itself now Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he's been talking about this being a long and difficult War does Israel have any clear exit strategy that you can see Mike I cannot see an Israeli uh exit strategy um these sorts of Wars unconventional Wars always end with a political settlement so they can't be solved militarily and so the question for Israel is okay it's going to go in there it will take out some Hamas tunnel tunnels it will kill some of the leadership very unlikely to destroy Hamas and then what they've then still got the same problem that they started with but there will be tens of thousands of Palestinians dead and probably thousands of Israelis as well and so the question is what is the political strategy that wraps around this military activity at the moment I see none what about the hostages Mike uh they're more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip uh there's a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to bring them out alive obviously from other countries as well there are many foreign Nationals there uh how can Israel continue with its ground defensive and extract those hostages I I think it's very very difficult and again I I think we can what we can read into the Israeli actions and as you said other other governments who got their Nationals as hostages are putting great pressure on the Israelis but what I think we can read into the Israeli actions is that they don't care so much about the hostages the hostages are not their primary aim here their primary aim is to do damage to Hamas and I think on the side I think Netanyahu is politically in trouble in Israel so a ground offensive is a way of maintaining himself in power I think this the hostages are a secondary consideration I think we can take that analysis from looking at the Israeli actions if you were trying to get the hostages back you wouldn't be launching a ground Invasion what about the signals coming from other players in the region Mike because this conflict has hugely explosive potential for the region doesn't it it does and you know just over the last few days we we've seen eruan of Turkey um making comments to crowds in Istanbul about going into Gaza I mean obviously this is rhetoric is Iran as well with its proxies Hezbollah and others in the region so it it does have great potential for and really what the problem will come is is a mistake somebody will make a mistake there's so many players the situation is very ambiguous it's hard to tell what's going on we saw that with the the strike on the hospital last week but fake news whistles around all over the place and in those environments it's very easy for someone Iran America Israel turkey to make a mistake and then they've committed themselves to a much bigger conflict than than hither to and that's the problem that we face at the moment Mike thank you very much that was military analyst Mike Martin thank
