the Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages trapped inside Gaza overseas family members of innocent people caught in the conflict feel powerless in Brussels where the European Union's headquartered DW's Rosie burchard met some of those hoping and praying that their loved ones will make it out after a moment of silence Israel's national anthem Echoes through quiet crowds outside the European Parliament in Brussels we are here with the president of the European Council the president of the European commission and all of you as one to express our solidarity inside a group of ises bustles between meetings with parliamentarians making the case for more action we meet Noam As She lays out photos of loved ones 11 of whom are presumed kidnapped by Hamas look at this family okay they are not only Israelis many of them shushan she is a German citizen as well we are really asking for the EU to take responsibility and bring their citizens back home after the horrors now the weight is agonizing they burned all the houses they killed everyone and they took them and we are just trying to save whoever is still alive the European Union says it stands with Israel but the block has also warned the country against blocking supplies to Gaza cutting water cutting electricity cutting food to a mass of Civilian people is against international law so yes there are some actions that are not in accordance with international law that's why Leila wafi is terrified too hailing from Gaza we meet her at her home outside Brussels as she frantically tries to get family members out of the strip but there they're trapped where can they hide they've nowh to run to they're starting to run out of milk bread drinking water Lea rejects the actions of Hamas and the Israeli response killing civilians has never Advanced the Palestinian cause we've always said too that killing Palestinian civilians does not make Israel safer on both sides now we are Weeping mothers we are parents searching for our children we are both at the mercy of extremist politics we share the same pain but in opposing camps for now all those watching from afar can do is hold on whether taking solace in a whispered prayer for peace or a song of Hope hanging in the [Music] air Scott Walker is a former hostage negotiator and author of the book order out of Chaos thank you so much for for joining us we are just days into this conflict is it too soon uh to expect negotiations about the release or swapping of these hostages to be taking place I think neither side wishes to be seen to be negotiating that's that's clear clear from the actions that we've seen over the last few days um and with the buildup of Israeli forces is on the border with uh Gaza there's going to be an incursion I think that's that's fairly clear to see and it's imperative that steps are taken in parallel to open up negotiations to get those hostages out safely although the challenge here compared to normal hostage takings is that this is taking place in an active war zone right do you think that those steps taken in parallel will will have begun given the the the that both sides have effectively ruled out talking at least publicly I think it's fair to say that it's in everybody's interest to well sing from the Israelis to get their people back and then from hamas's side to actually if it's about prisoner swaps or whatever it is is to engage in those kind of conversation so it's fair to say that some kind of dialogue through thirdparty mediators whether or not that's the qataris the Egyptians whomever has probably more than likely started yes Hamas says a number of hostages have already been killed in Israeli missile attacks they've also threatened to kill hostages every time Israel strikes so do you think we they the Israelis and Hamas do we all have to accept that there will be hostage deaths either during or because of Israeli military efforts I I think what in every single kidnapping and hostage taking case I've been involved in there have been threats made and on rare occasions some kind of violence and force is being used against the hostages and I think with a sheer number we're talking potentially 150 hostages and I said with the fact that this is taking place in a war zone that there is sadly inevitably going to be some further tragedy there uh which is why I guess it's more incumbent to bring about some kind of negotiation to get the people out sooner rather than later and piled on top of that is the fact that it is likely that these hostages are being kept in one of the most densely populated uh parts of the planet uh and of course Hamas has this network of tunnels to escape into it does and I think right now there' be lots of effort put into coordinating identifying locating where the hostages are being kept as much as possible and of course in the background there's talk of potentially hostage rescue attempts but these are very very uh dangerous options with not always a guaranteed chance of success so trying to locate where those hostages are and to work out who to speak to to bring about their release is a big challenge another complicating Factor must be that Israel will not I'm presuming countenance paying a ransom to get their people back they could not countenance funding Hamas in any way yeah I think that's that's fair to say the the question of why did Hamas take the hostages in the first place again is a is an interesting point you know yes they're been held as human Shields at the moment that's that's clear to see and inevitably they'll want to play some leverage uh further down the line around potentially some prisoner exchanges and we've seen Israel has been consistent relatively consistent in the past of prioritizing the safe return of their citizens even if it does take a while to do so right you've been in the room I presume we're going to spec I'm going to ask you to speculate now how does it work who talks to who how about what yes what happens is normally you get alongside you get in the room with the family or the company and obviously straight away it's about reassuring the family that we'll do everything we can to get them back but there is no guarantees there's no promises that can be made here however all steps will be taken and then it's preparing the family for the call that may come in the call from the hostage takers or even their loved one via the hostage takers it's understanding what is it that we need to say what are our objectives which will be we'll need to reassure the hostage takers yes we hear them we're taking this seriously it's about obtaining what's called a proof of Life ideally we speak to the hostage to make sure that they're alive and well and then it's agreeing some next steps maybe the next time to speak over the phone and exactly what it is that the hostage takers are demanding thank you so much for talking us through that Scott Walker former hostage negotiator and the author of order out of chaos thank you so much the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in qar a day after visiting Israel as part of a series of talks he is holding across the Middle East he's just held a press conference and here's some of what he said United States and cutter share the goal of preventing this conflict from spreading uh we discussed in detail our efforts to prevent any actor state or non-state from creating a new front uh in this conflict we're also working intensively together to secure the release of hostages including American citizens being held by Hamas and Gaza I'm grateful for the urgency that cutter is bringing to this effort I'm going join now by Richard Walker DW's Chief International editor who you've listened into uh this press conference a lot of focus on the hostages and fear of escalation yeah that's right so so the qataris obviously they play pretty important diplomatic role role within the Middle East that they've they've they've often uh coordinated diplomatically with the Americans on other issues such as um negotiating with the Taliban um in Afghanistan um now they're playing a central role in efforts to to try and find a negotiated um kind of swap for the for the um hostages who have been taken by by Hamas into Gaza so that's on the one side that the Qatari prime minister there not raising too many expect a that anything is going to happen immediately I mean he was stressing that this is still relatively early in this into this hostage situation but that he hoped to be able to report some kind of progress in the next few days um and in terms of the fear of escalation of course there it's about hisbah in the north so so the the radical uh uh group based in southern Lebanon the fear that it could Mount more in tacts into into Northern Israel to create a twoof front situation for Israel and also potentially the the role that Iran would play so these two of the really big preoccupations of course not just for the Americans but but for many countries in the region he also did address the humanitarian situation uh in Gaza I believe what did he have to say about that yeah so so the Americans and we heard this from blinkin very much in this press conference they're trying to kind of walk a line here where on the one hand they are saying and blinkin said you know Israel has every right to defend itself against the attacks that Hamas mounted and in fact a duty to defend itself and that there can be no business as usual now in in in dealing with with with this threat from Hamas which which reached such an extraordinary level with these attacks um but at the same time saying that the he said in his words the way Israel does this the way it it mounts these operations it matters um and there's been a lot of criticism from around the region about Israel's warning to the people of uh Gaza of Northern Gaza that they need to evacuate to the south of the region um and he was pressed about you know whether the US kind of gave a green light just go ahead and do that he evaded that question but he did say that so implicitly he is trying to call on the Israelis and say that he urged the Israelis to really respect the right of civilians uh in the Gaza Strip and added that the United States is focusing on trying to create safe zones within Gaza presumably in southern Gaza where people can take refuge um but I think there's going to be a lot of focus of course in the days ahead if Isel does go ahead with this ground offensive how are civilians treated how many civilians start getting killed and this is the line that the Americans are trying to walk on the one hand say is Israel has every right to conduct operations on the other hand to say it must respect the right of civilians as well was it this the last station of this trip or is he going someplace El no this is this is a multi-stop tour for for Tony blinkin and I think it was also interesting he spoke earlier to the King of Jordan King Abdullah who is also anticipating ated here in Berlin next week and uh King Abdullah was very clear particularly on this question of displacing um uh gazans from northern Gaza saying that um he warned against any attempt to forcibly displace any civilians from northern Gaza so that message from um countries in the region that are supportive of the Palestinians obviously getting across to the Americans very much on this trip our chief International editor Richard Walker there thank you very much
