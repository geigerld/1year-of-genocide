US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has begun his ninth visit to the Middle East since the War Began to push a new plan for a ceasefire in Gaza even as Israel carries out more air strikes the Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry says at least 17 Palestinians most from the same family were killed in an attack near the Central City of Dar albala the US remains optimistic about achieving a ceasefire but Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attacks has said any signs of progress are an illusion and accuses Israel of negotiating in bad faith it's a site that has become sadly all too familiar for the people of Gaza another set of bodies carried away in bags as mourners watch on helplessly an overnight Israeli air strike killed a mother father and their six children as they slept through tears the grandfather of the dead children tried to make makes sense of the sudden massive loss of so many of those that he loved my daughter her husband and their six children were safe on Al mazra Street in the DI Al balak area when a missile struck them completely destroying the apartment the mother died and all six children perished the whole family the oldest child was 15 and the youngest a year and a half what was their crime 10 months into this devastating War Gaz is teetering on the brink food is still scarce the health system is on its knees and the UN says nine out of 10 people are now internally displaced some many times over nonetheless the White House has said they are optimistic a ceasefire can be reached between Israel and Hamas though Hamas has called that optimism an illusion and even if a deal can be reached for many people here in Gaza it's already far too late Israeli negotiators have expressed cautious optimism about reaching a fire deal but prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu accuses Hamas of dragging its feet Hamas remains obstinate it hasn't even sent a representative to the talks in Doha therefore the pressure should be directed at Hamas and its leader sinir not at the Israeli government Let's cross now to Jerusalem where we're joined by DW respondent Felix tamsut uh great to see you Felix um so US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin as we've seen has arrived in Israel it's his uh ninth visit to the region since the War Began in October so is he hoping that his in-person meetings will help get a ceasefire and hostage deal absolutely that's the biggest hope uh among the mediators in general not only when it comes to Secretary of State uh the US Secretary of State Vis visit visiting here uh in Israel uh there's this General sense of cautious optimism at the same time it needs to be said that uh Anthony blink's visit to the region has another uh um context I would say uh to the extent that uh over the negotiation there's the issue of Iran and hisbah waiting um waiting to retaliate on the killings of fuoka the his balah chief and um is hania the Hamas Chief killed in tan um and basically this is basically the the whole issue of their retaliation looms over the negotiations uh I think the mediators also have the issue in mind that should a ceas fire be reached uh and all out war in the region could be prevented that's why they're hoping to reach a deal by the end of this week now Felix while these talks are taking place the war in Gaza Contin news we're still seeing many civilian deaths doesn't that weaken Israel's position in negotiations when it comes to Israel itself um the feeling is that it doesn't hurt the negotiation quite the opposite Israel sees its military operations as part of its um whole operation of uh securing the return of the hostages and dismantling Hamas um it needs to be said that hamas's positions have barely changed if at at all uh during the Israeli operation in Gaza um so it seems like uh both sides don't uh see the ongoing operation in Gaza as a big deal obviously Hamas wants the Israeli forces out of Gaza as part of its conditions of reaching a ceasefire deal this is one of the biggest hurdle of reaching such a deal and it remains to be seen whether the negotiators will be able to overcome this big hurdle thanks Felix DW correspondent Felix tamsut in Jerusalem for us
