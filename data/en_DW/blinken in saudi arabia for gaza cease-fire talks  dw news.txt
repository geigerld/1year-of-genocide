US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has arrived in Saudi Arabia as part of a new push to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas he set to meet with leaders of Gulf Arab states who've been mediating a plan for a truce and the return of hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas LED terror attack on the 7th of October at the same time a Hamas delegation is expected to meet Egyptian officials in Cairo for talks also aimed at securing an agreement the negotiations are taking place as the threat of a ground Invasion continues to loom over Rafa where over half of gaza's population is Sheltering the city of Rafa has been the last refuge for families fleeing the fighting in Gaza previously deemed a safe Zone by Israel many here still struggle to get [Music] by we had 10 people living in the same tent and we suffer from from the Heat and mosquitoes we do everything inside the tent cooking cleaning bathing the children I have sick children who cannot tolerate the Heat and we're cramped inside the tent rarely going outside Israel says Rua is a stronghold for Hamas militants and plans to launch a ground Invasion everyone to speaking in Saudi Arabia the Palestinian president urged against it of the palan people we appeal to the United States of America to ask Israel to stop the Rafa operation because America is the only country capable of preventing Israel from committing this crime us has previously said it could not support a rougher operation without a credible humanitarian plan Israel says it is scaling up Aid deliveries into Gaza with plans for a new ocean delivery Corridor together with the United States Central Command we are working on a temporary Maritime Pier known as jots which stands for joint Logistics over the shore Aid deliveries via air continue to bring some desperately needed supplies but humanitarian groups warn it's not enough with Hunger widespread and a looming risk of famine for many in Gaza for more I'm now joined by DW correspondent Rebecca ritters who is in Jerusalem Rebecca good morning US Secretary of State Anthony blink is in Saudi Arabia today what are we expecting from him well this is Anthony blinken's seventh visit to the Middle East and he's fifth to Saudi Arabia beish since October 7 since the War Began uh he'll be bringing with him a very similar message as he has done in previous visits of course the ceasefire talks and this poten Cal hostage deal definitely topping the agenda and coming at a very key time when we're are seeing this crucial phase of the hostage negotiations but he'll also be there to talk to other Gulf and Arab leaders from Qatar UAE Egypt um and and of course Saudi Arabia to discuss a post-war Gaza that's something that is very much in the minds of us officials and of course every time he visit Saudi Arabia he'll also be bringing with him uh on the agenda a willingness or a potential to talk about the ongoing conversation about um Israeli Saudi normalization now that is something that the US see as a potential uh Way Way Forward in this post Gaza era and it's something that's been high on the agenda for the US Administration for uh President Biden's us Administration since he took office before October 7 those talks were already making some Headway uh and they are still in the pipeline though the sticking point being Israel's refusal uh to um talk about any future Palestinian state so it's a very very big agenda that Anthony blinkin brings with him as always from Saudi Arabia then he'll be following on to Jordan and here to Israel as well so lots on the on the plate for Anthony blink there meanwhile ceasefire talks are happening in Egypt as well with a Hamas delegation present yeah we're getting to a point where we're seeing some very positive Moves In This hostage negotiation certainly the closest we've come in certainly several weeks if not months since you know we've been these negotiations have been ongoing and largely stalling uh since the last negotiation was successful back in November now last week Egyptian officials were in Israel to discuss with negotiators here about what they uh would potentially agree to they have sent back with them to Egypt with those officials a counter proposal that Hamas has reportedly been mulling over uh now it is being reported that Hamas officials are heading to Cairo today and could be even giving uh their their answer to whether or not they'll accept this deal there have been some reports that Hamas officials certainly in the polit bureau have been saying that they see no major issues with this current deal on the table so that is of course something very positive but there's always a bit of a split between hamas's polit Bureau and the military wing and of course yayya sinoa the head of Hamas in Gaza and so whether or not they'll be able to agree on what's stipulated in this particular deal of course remains to be seen is never done until it's done bar and we've certainly been SE we've seen it come close many times before so we'll certainly have more details for you today as this is happening pressure is growing from within netanyahu's own government to invade Rafa come May is that reflective of a split in the government and if so what bearing could it have on what happens next well there's certainly a difference of opinion within the the government as to whether or not uh they should take a deal and and take this Rafer offensive off the table we saw remarks from the Finance Minister betel smrc one of the most far-right members of Benjamin netanyahu's cabinet he came out to say that uh if Rafa was cancelled then this government would have no legitimacy he's calling for that operation to take place despite any further talks whether there's a hostage deal or not now we heard from more center right member who wasn't initially part of the government the Coalition but he came in after o October 7 into the war cabinet that's Benny Gant he's a you know um a very senior figure in this war cabinet and he's he said in a statement that entering raer is important but that the campaign against the campaign against Hamas I should say is very important but that the return of hostages is even more so he said if a deal is reached with the backing of the defense establishment but without ending the war and um then the the ministers who led this uh LED this government on October 7 wouldn't be legitimate if they didn't agree to that so you do see a difference of opinion there and certainly what I think we're seeing is that most of the government is uh committed to going into ruer though some members would like to see a hostage deal made in the interim we'll leave it there for the time being DW's Rebecca rers in Jerusalem thanks so much
