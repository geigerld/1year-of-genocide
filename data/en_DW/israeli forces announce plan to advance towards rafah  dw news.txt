now to the conflict in Gaza where fears are growing of a new Israeli assault on the south of the strip Israel's military has suggested it now plans to advance towards Rafa close to the Egyptian border the UN says Rafa has become a pressure cooker of Despair another strike on can Yunis in southern Gaza an explosion followed by gunshots sends people running for their lives fear danger and bombardments are coming from all directions can unise has again become the focus of Israeli air strikes its infrastructure has been severely damaged thousands more displaced gazans are once more fleeing to Rafa further south on the border with Egypt and already overcrowded in recent days thousands of Palestinians have continued to flee to the South uh which is already already hosting over half the gaza's population of some 2.3 million people most are living in makeshift structures tents or out in the open Rafa is a pressure cooker of Despair and we fear for what comes next the new arrivals in Rafa rely on food handouts provided by humanitarian groups or donation centers like this one Aid workers can only feed a small number of displaced we are doing our best to distribute as much as we can so that as many of the displaced as possible can get food there are thousands of displaced people in Rafa and we can't serve them all everyone here is hoping the latest attempts to secure a ceasefire will pay off uh straight to Jerusalem um we can join our correspondent Rebecca rits welcome Rebecca uh let's start with the latest on the Israeli offensive in Gaza yeah we'll Phil Israel has been continuing its campaign in the South uh specifically around hunus as you were just hearing in that report now hunas has been a focus of the Israeli military for some weeks now they say it is a hot bed of Hamas Terror terrorists as they call them it's they say that they're uh a lot of Hamas leaders there hiding underground that there are command centers uh there are manufacturing sites launch pads um so they're really been focusing on their both aerial bombardments and uh also the ground offensive that's while there's still fighting going on in the Central and Northern parts of the strip now this all comes despite the fact that Israel said a few weeks ago that it was going to be winding back uh it's this phase or I should say moving into the next phase the sort of more targeted phase and moving away from this um continuous bombardments and really quite large ground offensive into uh the next phase that would be more targeted as I just said uh that's been at the urging of the us but as we can see from that report there that hasn't been happening uh the Hamas ran Health Ministry reported more than 100 deaths um people that were killed overnight in the last 24-hour period that is of course expected to rise again tomorrow and as you heard there the defense minister the Israeli defense minister saying that they are going to push further south targeting that Rafa border region that Rafa that's Southernmost city where of course more than half of the population of Gaza more than 1 million people are now trying to shelter trying to stay away from the worst of the fighting really not clear where those people will go many of them having already evacuated some several times from the north to the center to the South to to the very south down there in Rafa and really running out of places to go right and the latest on negotiations between Israel and Hamas about a potential ceasefire yeah there has been some cautious optimism particularly coming from the qaris now they're playing uh a very large role in these negotiations as they did with the with the peace or the the ceasefire uh that was that happened in November they had a very big role in that as well now we heard from the Qatari foreign minister or the spokesperson saying that uh people could be cautiously optimistic that something might happen in a couple of weeks though it's still too early to say just whether that will come to fruition and when we we're seeing the negotiations continue as they do and we saw something very similar before that November deal was struck as well they things went up things went down it looked positive one one minute and and not so positive the next so it's really hard to tell when something might happen Hamas still they say going over the proposal it does look like the Israelis have already come to some agreement but that Hamas uh haven't yet agreed to the deal and they are now putting on the table that they want some very high level people to be released from Israeli prisons whether or not Israel would agree to such a measure uh really remains to be seen Phil so that deal uh hopeful cautious optimism as I said but still could be some weeks away okay thank you that Rebecca writs in
