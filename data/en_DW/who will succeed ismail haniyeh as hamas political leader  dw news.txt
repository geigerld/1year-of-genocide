hundreds of people have gathered at a mosque in dohaqatar for a funeral service for the slay Hamas leader Ismael hania and his bodyguard multiple officials and religious leaders are attending the funeral hania had lived in Qatar for many years and will be buried there he was assassinated in what Iran says was a missile strike inside Iran on Wednesday speculation is now rif about who could succeed him as leader of hamas's political wing H whoever replaces isma hania as hamas's new political leader has to decide on how the militant group will continue its fight with Israel and also represent Hamas on the world stage the man accused of orchestrating the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel yashia sinir is considered more radical than hania but senoir is believed to be hiding in the group's tunnel Network beneath the Gaza Strip and he's expected to remain the chief of Hamas in Gaza experts believe a more likely Contender to replace hania to be this man khed mishal a veteran Hamas official he was previously the leader of hamas's political office directing the group from Exile in 1996 he survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan michall is considered more moderate and he has good ties with Qatar and turkey but his relations with Syria Iran and Hezbollah soured over his support for the 2011 Arab Spring protests another possible choice to replace hania is Khalil Alaya a senior Hamas leader who also lives in Exile he was the target of an Israeli assassination attempt in 2007 ala is viewed as a powerful figure within Hamas who was close to hania after hania's death Alaya vowed to make Israel pay a heavy price while Hamas has a record of moving quickly to replace assassinated Leaders The Selection process this time will be more challenging many members of the group's main consultative body the shur Council are in Gaza so a full leadership meeting is unlikely we joining me here in the studio now is Daniel gerlock he's a Middle East expert and the editor-in-chief of zenith magazine Daniel it's good to see you again we've talked many many times about Hamas so let me ask you who do you think is the most likely successor to I think the before mentioned KH could be an interesting Contender um he has been involved in the negotiations he enjoys rather good ties with Qatar but also with other Arab states um the other uh person that was mentioned KH Mash of course is a veteran he had been uh at the head of Hamas for about 20 years I believe uh there was an assassination attempt against him by the Mad in Jordan in 1997 and uh the jordanians at that time arrested the Israeli mad agents and they said we will release them in exchange for the antivenom so the Israelis delivered that and my to my knowledge it's never become 100% clear there was a deal that the Israeli government would not attempt another strike on Khaled mashal again but I don't think if these arrangements are are any longer valid Khaled mhad was also chairing Hamas at the time when there was a huge Fallout between Hamas and Iran and Syria uh in the in light of the Arab Spring and hamas's uh involvement with the Muslim brothers and with some of the Revolutionary forces in the Middle East but these are of course like twoo interesting to be honest I don't want to sound cynical but I think it's the most covered job at the moment most coveted job it's not the most it's not the most coveted job yes what do it what does all of this mean for the future of Hamas in Gaza I mean how do you think Hamas is going to react moving forward at the moment and I think analysts tend to overlook that um Hamas in Gaza is one thing um but there is Hamas ideology and there's also support and the aspirations of Palestinians and uh in in in the West Bank and that is a powder CAG people in the West Bank are not necessarily Pro Hamas but they in the last couple of months have seen due to the failure of the Palestinian Authority and due to the uh constant let's say oppression and increase of violence that Hamas is the only force that somehow is fighting for their cause of course that's somehow somehow a suicidal mindset but in a way uh as long as the war is going on Hamas ideology is going to be there now the question is we we saw the funeral uh images of the funeral of ish in Doha the qataris to my knowledge were ready to expel Hamas from Doha in the framework of a deal but a deal that would have included releasing the hostages and exactly and ceasefire enter war in Gaza um that's not I cannot you know they never confirmed it to me but that's what I what I heard in Doha the only problem is of course if on the other side they see that Israel is is is eliminating a fascinating every negotiator involved I mean also the other people that we hear about here for example of course has been targeted then it's fairly difficult and now I think the qataris may change their mind and say like look we don't we don't we we were ready but you don't force us into any decision for sure Israel did not attack him in Doha that is an important thing and that was also part of a let's say a deal that the qataris had to my knowledge with Israel and with the Americans and Israel had vowed since October 7th yeah to kill him sure so this this wasn't a change in policy no it wasn't a change he was one of the main negotiators right he was the point man for the the hostage it was it wasn't changed in policy and uh for sure not I mean they they made it abundantly clear that every Hamas uh polit buau political Wing military whatever is a legitimate Target and beyond that I mean about 40,000 people have died uh in the war in Gaza so far so the question is of course um and that's what many Israeli analysts but also newspapers and and and and demonstrators on the on the street are asking are you at all interested Benin Nano in the release of the hostages because if at one point you you you kill all the negotiators that can speak on behalf of Hamas and apparently like make this ceasefire Impossible by by of course like sabotaging the negotiations how do you want us to release the hostages and that is a a a a big problem in these so do you think so do you think the prospects of of releasing the hostages the prospects of ceasefire are both of those prospects now dead I mean not dead but you hear uh what President Biden said I mean you know he's usually not very outspoken when he criticizes the Israel government he said like the assassination of is Han was not helpful I mean you know measured by Biden's own standards that's quite a statement um of course there is huge frustration on the other hand what happened in tan is of course could bring the the the region to the brink of of Another War but on the other hand what we heard in the last 24 hours could also say like to point towards deescalation because now there's news and I think that's false news but political opportune news about uh a bomb being being placed pled there right in in ter what's that what does that mean that means there was a there was a terrorist assassination in the uh views of the Islamic Republic but there was no violation of Iranian airspace no attack on Iran from an outside country so if that news I don't think it can be substantiated but it's a political opportune towards the escalation because it allows some sort of a face saving moderated reaction on the Iranian side jiel as always it's good to have you here in the studio good to get your analysis thank you thanks for the invitation let's pick up some of those points with Ali fatah NAD who's from the center for Middle Eastern Global Order that's a think tank based here in Berlin he's also order author of Iran in an emerging New World Order from armag jadad to ruhani welcome to thew this so who is being talked about as a successor to is aania as political leader of Hamas there I think at this point we don't really know I mean um the names that you mentioned in your report are part of the discussions but um uh it's going to be decided uh within Hamas um uh but this also may not be the most important factor here although it's you know the top leaders are important um it's uh not going to change the Strategic direction of any of those organizations uh while the uh targeted assassinations of Israel against top commanders of the so-called axis of resistance May ins still fear um the on the other hand they're not going to uh do a away and uh uh you know destroy um the so-called resistance so it's more a kind of a network uh that is at play here throughout the region in the the Middle East so uh figures alone are not the main story right that's that's that's you make an interesting point there so the Strategic uh the the objective remains destroy Israel so whoever is picked will just slot into that framework and so how directly would the is the Iranian leadership likely to be involved in these discussions within Hamas I think uh ham as opposed to Hezbollah is a different story because uh when you look at you know relations between Iran and hezb those are much more closer and they go back uh you know since the start of the Iranian Revolution and it's basically the uh Iranians who uh uh you know uh created esbah the Islamic revolu guard Corps uh right after the Iranian uh the uh Iranian Revolution in 1979 whereas also what your report suggest that there have been some tensions between Iran and Hamas over the question of how to react to the a spring arriving in Syria whereas Iran was supporting uh the Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad there was a kind of uh you know um estrangement uh between Iran and Hamas uh you know for quite some some time back then so I believe that when it comes to Hamas um Iran is not going uh you know to be able to call the shots um relatively speaking uh if if you compare it for for instance if such a thing would happen uh within Hezbollah but then again also Hezbollah and also Hamas those are organizations although they're heavily supported by Iran uh they're they have to be contextualized um nationally is Hano was involved in ceasy negotiations over Gaza what happens to that process while Hamas blames Israel for killing their Chief negot negotiator and indeed while his successor is still being sought well for obvious reason uh this process that has been under you know ongoing in the capital of DOA has been for now at least de facto torpedoed so it is going to very much uh it's going to be a difficult much more difficult process Ahad it has been a very difficult process up until now what we heard uh more lately um is that uh you know there have been uh quite a gulf between the two sides between the Hamas and the Israel side so um it doesn't bode well uh of course for the continuation of those attacks um to achieve a ceasefire and also to free the U Israeli hostages um so this is um at least for now a heavy blow uh to these negotiations and and just that point then do you think that the the the fact that um if we presume that this was an Israeli killing the the fact that it that Israel went for this guy this uh Senor Hamas leader effectively torpedoing uh ceasefire and hostages uh negotiations does that mean that Israel has put destroying Hamas now above um getting the hostages uh home alive well it could well mean that but um actually this may have been the case already before uh because um you know it is really questionable whether uh Israel's military strategy uh that has been announced from the very beginning uh of the War uh has been adequate uh in achieving the goal of freeing the hostages as you know there is tremendous debate uh within Israel uh whether you know this kind of strategy that is promoted uh very much by the Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to lead to some results and as we know um you know there have been uh of course within this kind of broad-based um you know non-targeted manner of Israel's military operations um uh probably they've been you know hostages who already have been killed uh in in this process so um you know there is a lot of opposition also to this kind of military strategy uh of Israel by the families of the hostages so this is quite a strong uh contradiction uh that has been in play uh well before the Hanah uh assassination in tan fascinating analysis and we thank you for it Ali fella and N Jad from the center for Middle East and Global order thank you let's pick up some of those points with Barbara slaven she's an expert on Iran as well as being a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington DC welcome to DW how do you expect Iran and its proxies to avenge Ismael hania's killing well first of all thank you for having me um I think it's pretty clear there will be a strong response uh when exactly and how exactly not clear actually before coming on air I was just looking at some rather ominous posts on the social media site X from some uh people close to the Iranian government uh with pictures of missiles going off um I would think there might be some sort of coordinated response rocket attacks drone attacks not just from Iran but also from hezb in Lebanon from the houis uh in Yemen who have already fired on on Tel Aviv um it's a very dangerous moment uh if if these missiles are not intercepted if they cause civilian casualties of course it could lead to even more escalation on the Israel side so it's it's one of the tensest moments I think we've seen in the last 10 months and do you expect a direct response from Iran amongst that rather than just leaving it to its proxies yeah very much so uh we saw that in April when the Israelis killed seven Iranian military officers in a diplomatic compound in Damascus uh this strike uh whether it was a bomb that had been planted or something that came from from the air there are conflicting reports uh hit Ismael hania in a very wellu guarded supposedly compound in Teran a place that's used for VIPs for dignitaries visiting Iran so it was it was quite flagrant and a real violation of Iranian sovereignty we've also seen the supreme leader of Iran Ayatollah hame threaten uh revenge for this quite explicitly so we don't know if it's coming tonight tomorrow or a week from now but I think it's definitely coming okay so this um this killing of hania if it was Israel um you you've described it as a violation of Iranian sovereignty uh same words that were used in in that April um attack on um Iranian Sovereign uh territory and what was said then and what was said now is people were talking about the Iranian response being calibrated um big enough to prove a point but not so big that the whole region Goes Up in Flames now you seem to be talking about a strong coordinated response this seems to be that sounds like more than we saw in April yeah it's possible the the April attacks were telegraphed in advance uh many Israel and the United States for example had advanced warning that they were coming uh and were able to coordinate a response along with other countries in the region uh there may not be as much warning this time uh the US is already moving some Naval assets other assets around in the Middle East to be in a position to help the Israelis shoot down rockets and missiles if that's indeed what what is going to happen um I think given the fact that it was in tran and also that it was on the day of the inauguration of the new Iranian president that uh the regime in Iran has to respond strongly and uh more strongly than it did in April okay you you talked about the the the us moving its ships in the in the region around we've heard from US President Biden saying that Han's killing doesn't help the Gaza ceasefire talks we've had countless visits by the US Secretary of State and I wonder is it fair to say that US influence on any of the parties in this conflict appears at the moment to be minimal well clearly US influence over BB Netanyahu is not what we would hope it would be he has shown uh complete disregard for the views of the United States He seems determined to continue this war to expand this War uh he does not seem interested in getting a ceasefire in Gaza uh we have to remember that uh if he stops the war there may be a move to uh bring him down in Israel and he faces charges for corruption so he has personal and political as well as ideological reasons for prolonging the conflict uh just yesterday apparently Joe Biden spoke again with nanyo uh and said the United States was very concerned not just about the strike that killed hania but also a strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah leader just a few hours prior to that these are very provocative steps and they they seemed uh they seem aimed at widening the war not at containing it so it's it's a very moment United States is not happy about this okay uh thank you for guiding us through that so clearly I appreciate that a lot of this is is speculation but interesting nonetheless uh Barbara slaven from the Stimson Center in Washington thank you so much sure thank you
