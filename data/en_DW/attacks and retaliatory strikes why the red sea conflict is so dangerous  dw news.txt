Yemen's houthi militia has vowed to continue its attacks on Red Sea vessels after the United States and Britain launched another series of air strikes against them Washington and London put out a joint statement saying they hid dozens of targets inside Yemen which included underground weapons depos missile systems and launchers as well as Radars the strike is part of the joint us and UK military effort to deter the houthis from further disrupting global Shipping Lanes in the Red Sea and the United States says it will continue with retaliatory strikes here's White House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan it began uh with the strikes on Friday night but that is not the end of it we intend to take additional strikes uh and additional action to continue to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked or people are killed uh at this point we are still assessing the question of how many casualties there were uh among the militia groups and the our military will continue to provide the president with those assessments and for a closer look we can now bring in FAS Jes he's a professor of international relations at the lenon school of Economics good to have you on the show now as we just heard the US intends to take additional strikes after hitting Targets in Iraq Syria and Yemen what do you think we can expect next I'm afraid more of the same uh my take is that the uh Iraqi and Syrian militias will most likely retaliate against us bases in Iraq and Syria in the next few days or week and also it seems to me that American and British attacks against the houthis in Yemen had failed to deter the houthis from um hitting and targeting commercial shippings so what we're really seeing um in Iraq in Syria on the Lebanese Israeli front and in Yemen is basically a low intensity Warfare between isra Isel and the United State and the UK and some European countries and U Hamas and Iran and its allies network of allies in Lebanon in Iraq in Syria and Yemen now Sullivan did not rule out the possibility of attacks inside Iran the biggest backer of the houthis do you see that happening anytime soon I doubt it very much for two reasons uh President Biden has made it very clear he does not really want a wider War and the Iranian also do not really want a wider war with either the United States and Israel what we're really seeing is a war by proxy so Iran is using its um allies in Iraq in Syria and Yemen to increase the pressure to increase the cost on the United States for its preponderant support for Israel and the United States is trying to basically retaliate against Iran's allies What's Happening Here is that uh President Biden has to really walk a fine line between retaliation and escalation remember there is um there are elections presidential presidential elections in the United States u in the next few months so the president does not really want to get embroiled in the shifting Sands in the Middle East before uh a presidential because he's seeking a second presidential term yeah and Iran says the US has made a strategic mistake many consider the ball to be in teran's court now how do you expect Iran to respond uh the Iranians say and their allies the wall in is in the United States courot uh what we're talking about is I don't expect the Iraqi militias and the Syrian militias and theah and theis to stop their attacks as long as the war continues in Gaza um and this is why what you're seeing now is really uh the Middle East is one of the is a very volatile unstable it's a Tinder Box it reallyu takes a spark to ignite a wider fire so without um ending the Bloodshed in Gaza my take is that both side will continue to test each other will the danger lies is that miscalculation could happen and basically a trigger could really basically U bring about a war direct war between the United States and Iran even though neither side want a direct War uh between each other exactly all sides involve insist that that is not what they want that was FAS Jes from the London School of Economics thank you so much for your analysis now these latest strikes are the third time that British and American forces have jointly targeted Yemen's houthi Rebels whose attacks uh which they say are in solidarity with Palestinians in War of battered Gaza have disrupted global trade now let's take a closer look at the group and their motivations hundreds of houthi supporters on Sunday organized a military parade in solidarity with Gaza and in protest against the American and British air strikes on houthi sites they vow to continue fighting as long as there is war in Gaza Yemen's tribes are ready old and young with men and weapons to confront America Britain and Israel in solidarity with our families and brothers in Gaza Yemen tribes are defending human rights and people who are weak houthi militants have used drones and anti-ship missiles to attack vessels in the Red Sea and in one case used a helicopter to seize a cargo vessel with ties to Israel the houthis are part of the so-called axis of resistance this is an alliance of groups in Syria Lebanon Gaza and Iraq which are supported by Iran and oppose Israel and the US Iran has been accused of arming training and funding the houthis but the rebel group denies it's an Iranian proxy the houthis control much of the north of Yemen including the capital sa they've been fighting a Civil War in Yemen for almost a decade against the internationally recognized government backed by Saudi Arabia despite the latest strikes by British and American militaries whoy Rebel officials say their attacks in the Red Sea will continue let's bring in Gerald finstein a former US ambassador to Yemen he's currently with the Middle East Institute in Washington DC and joins us from Philadelphia it's good to have you with us here on DW news so how significant are these retaliatory strikes against the houthis and what impact do you think this will actually have on their operations in the Red Sea it's a a pleasure to be with you again tonight um you know I mean certainly uh the US and the UK uh know what they're striking at uh I I suspect there will be a battle damage assessment made I would assume that uh that uh we have hit the uh the targets that we were aiming at uh the issue uh is is twofold one of course is how much damage is that actually doing uh uh to their operations to their facilities to their equipment uh and second L how difficult is it going to be for the hotties to replace it because one of the things uh that I think people need to keep in mind is that as long as the Iranian resupply continues most of this material is going to be fairly easily uh replaced and uh and I don't think it's going to affect uh houti operations substantially it's certainly not going to eliminate their capacity to continue launching these uh these these strikes against shipping right now Jake Sullivan did not rule out the possibility of attacks inside Iran as well do you see that happening I think that that would be a huge decision for the president to make because uh because there's no question that Iran has the capacity to retaliate significantly against the us against us partners and allies uh it's got formidable uh capacity on missiles drones uh other kinds of weapon systems uh it's got a uh a fairly modern air defense system so that uh us attacks would not be uh without risk I I don't see that that this is a decision the president is going to make uh unless something much more severe happens that challenges us interests in the region and what uh do you think the United States is expected to do next next going forward next going forward well I think you know the president has said and and his uh his advisers have said that they're going to continue these efforts uh I think uh they're going to continue to to try to uh strike at capabilities uh for the houis in uh in Yemen as well as uh pro-iranian militias in Iraq and Syria uh if they can identify Iranian revolutionary guard facil fa ities particularly again in Iraq and Syria they may strike at those uh but uh but again I think that the president has been very clear in saying that he does not want to see this escalate into a full-blown uh regional conflict uh and that is still going to limit uh the options that he has in front of him now the houthis have insisted that they won't stop their attacks as long as this Israel Hamas War continues um in Gaza so what next do you know in terms of this Regional War potentially escalating even though I guess you see multiple countries saying that they don't want an escalation how do you see this playing out across the region well I think the biggest risk and and of course um you know what what the houis are doing in the Red Sea is U is consequential for uh the global economic security and stability and for that reason it's very important uh I know that the EU U has announced that they're going to join uh the efforts in the Red Sea to defend against uh these houti attacks uh and so that's uh that's going to to continue uh the uh the the situation North of Israel I think is more concerning uh between uh Israel and hisbah on the uh on the Lebanon Israel border as well as what's happening uh to the North and the East uh in Syria and in Iraq uh and and uh and the the potential for uh something serious as we saw happen the other day uh at the US facility in Jordan uh is uh is going to be concerning in terms of forcing the administration to take on much more aggressive uh uh measures against the uh against these pro-iranian forces I I I'm more concerned and particularly again as far as the hooes are concerned I'm more concerned that there's going to be a Mis calculation like there was with Tower 22 uh that ends up with us casualties uh and again forces the Biden Administration to undertake much more aggressive measures to to try to limit uh hooti capabilities uh but I would see uh at this point that we're probably going to see mostly a continuation of current efforts Gerald finstein from the Middle East Institute in uh Washington DC thank you very much indeed for your
