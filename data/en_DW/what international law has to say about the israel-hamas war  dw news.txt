Israel's Ambassador meanwhile to the United Nations says his country will no longer issue visas to un Personnel following criticism of Israel's conduct of War by un Secretary General Antonio gues gues drew a furious response from Israel after stating that Hamas Terror attacks didn't happen in a vacuum the UN Chief has defended his remarks saying they were taken out of context I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the security Council as if as if I was justifying acts of Terror by amas this is false it was the opposite in the beginning of my intervention yesterday I clearly stated and I quote I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of Terror by amas in Israel nothing can justify the deliberate killing injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets end quote indeed I spoke of the Grievances of the Palestinian people and in doing so I also clearly stated and I quote that the Grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by amas end quote and then I went on with my intervention referring all my positions on all aspects of the Middle East crisis I believe it was necessary to set the record straight especially out of respect to the victims and to their families thank you all right let's bring in Sergey vasilev he's a associate professor of international criminal law at the University of Amsterdam welcome to you this week the the UN Secretary General expressed concern about what he called clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza before we assess this statement what exactly are the rules of international humanitarian law uh good afternoon um the rules of international humanitarian law uh set limitations on how the belligerent parties may have recourse to uh to Warfare it sets certain limits on on the means and methods of warfare in which um the militants can engage for example uh the principle of uh distinction um uh obligates the Waring parties to distinguish between civilian and Military objectives and not to make the uh civilian um objects and civilian population the objects of attack the principle of proportionality demands that uh the war parties refrain from launching attacks um um which may result in um disproportionate incidental uh damage to the civilian uh population and to civilian infrastructure so with that in mind is the UN Secretary General right are these rules being violated in Gaza and by whom uh it is highly likely that the rules of international humanitarian law are being uh violated uh in in Gaza however uh before rushing to conclusions it is of utmost importance that uh the facts are uh established in a credible uh and impartial uh manner by the respective International um fact finding bodies we may restate uh the rules uh that apply to the armed uh to the conduct of armed conflict but the factual determinations that need to be made should be be left to um independent and impartial investigators and if need be to prosecutors and judges how then can you realistically enforce these rules on a battlefield you talk or allude to the fog of War and what options are there to punish those who violate it in this circumstance uh the primary responsibility for uh enforcing rules of international communitarian law ensuring compliance with International humanitarian law lies of course with Waring parties themselves in this case with Hamas and with Israel however if the international humanitarian law rules are violated um they may be a possibility and there needs to be um individual accountability for those who engage in such behavior and in this uh case the international criminal court is exercising uh jurisdiction uh over the situation in Palestine uh so there is a possibility that uh in the future cases would be uh brought against those individuals who have allegedly engaged in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity uh Israel is not a signatory to the ICC obviously neither is Hamas so in reality would violations like these go unpunished um indeed Hamas is not uh a party to the international criminal court nor is Israel however the state of Palestine has exceeded uh to the ICC statute and um in decision from 2021 the SEC pretrial chamber has confirmed that the court has jurisdiction over um the conduct which may amount to International crimes committed uh in in the territory of uh the state of pales namely uh the the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank including East Jerusalem so it does not matter that Israel uh is not a state party to the IC because any crimes that it may have committed in in the Gaza Strip still fall within the jurisdiction of of the I and in the same manner uh the crimes that may have been committed by uh the the Hamas Fighters uh in the territory of Israel they would also be covered by the SEC jurisdiction s filv associate professor of the international criminal law at University of Amsterdam thank you thank you for having me let's uh look at this now with Stefan Talman who's an expert on international law and joins us from Bon welcome to DW um the UN Secretary General uh this week said there had been clear violations of international humanitarian law in in Gaza we'll assess his statement uh in just a moment first though for the Layman what are the the rules of international humanitarian law the rules of international humanitarian law are laid down in the Geneva conventions and the protocols there too and uh International customary law uh the rules of international humanitarian law govern the means and methods of warfare so what you can do lawfully in a war right and is the un uh Secretary General right do you think are these rules being violated in Gaza and if so by whom the UN Secretary General in my view is correct in stating that the uh laws of international humanitarian law are violated the violation of these rules started with the attack by Hamas on Israel on the 7th of October which was a clear violation of international humanitarian law but the law is also violated by Israel in its response to that attack uh for example Israel has declared a Complete Siege of the Gaza Strip denying the civilian population their essential Necessities such as food and water or fuel and electricity uh and this is in violation of the conventions and the general rules of international humanitarian law right which among others proh forgive me for interrupting so but when um Israel uh uh retorts to that that this is essential in order for us to root out Hamas because Hamas are amongst the the Gaza population clearly you don't see that as a as a a useful defense no Israel has the right to self-defense but this right to self-defense has to be exercised within the framework of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian law prohibits Collective punishment what Israel is doing at the moment by imposing a Complete Siege on the Gaza Strip is in effect Collective punishment of 2.3 million uh Palestinian civilians living down Israel not a signatry to the international uh Criminal Court obviously neither is Hamas um do we therefore presume that any violations in this conflict are likely to go unpunished not necessarily I assume that if Hamas Fighters would be captured by uh Israel they would be put on trial in Israel but uh the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank has uh ratified the Rome statute of the international criminal court which means that the international criminal court has jurisdiction over the Palestinian occupied territories and could investigate any violations of international humanitarian law both by Israel and by Hamas Fighters because it is the place where the alleged violations happen that fall under the the the egis of this law rather than the signaries that's correct it depends either on where the crime has been committed or what nationality the perpetrator of the crime has so comparing the conflict in Gaza with that in Ukraine King Abdullah of Jordan has accused the west of double standards does he have a point I think he does because of course the the West is conspicuously silent on any violations of international humanitarian law currently going on on in Gaza uh the West seems to emphasize mainly Israel's right to self-defense which unquestionably exists but it does not point to any violations of international humanitarian law for example by Israel the West calls for humanitarian access but it does not State what the reason is that humanitarian Aid cannot get through namely the uh Siege imposed by Israel which as I said before is a violation of international law that's very clear thank you for talking us through that Stefan Talman thank you so much thank
