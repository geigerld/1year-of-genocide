the UN Security Council will meet next week to follow up on the UN top courts ruling on Gaza the international court of justice on Friday ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocide in the territory the preliminary ruling in a case brought by sou Africa told Israel to do more to protect civilians but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire in Israel's military campaign against Hamas the court also ordered the release of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the October seventh Terror attacks outside the international court of justice Palestinian supporters watch a live stream of proceedings in light of the foro some here had been hoping for more from the judges but many are seeing this ruling as a symbolic Victory with the Palestinian delegation at the icj saying it could have far-reaching consequences it is an important step towards Justice to the Palestinian people we're not here for vengeance we're here for justice and we seek Justice for our people we seek Justice for the children who were killed in Gaza and all of Palestine on the Israeli side these campaigners can't believe the genocide case brought before the court by South Africa is even proceeding the uh very solid evidence that was presented by the Israeli side two weeks ago where it was very clearly stated that Israel cannot commit genocide because what is being done there doesn't have the intention to commit a genocide this is not genocide Israel had been pushing for the icj to drop the case completely and after the ruling its prime minister gave this reaction the charge of genocide leveled against Israel is not only false is outrageous and decent people everywhere should reject it while the icj stopped short of calling for ceasefire South Africa's president is urging for more to be done to stop the fighting in Gaza in which they voiced alarm over we firmly believe that following this judgment there should now be a more considered effort towards a ceasefire and negotiations should commence on a permanent two-state solution for enabling Israel and Palestine to live side by side as independent states discernably now Israel has been asked to report back within a month on how it's upholding the orders from the top un Court although the court does not have the power to enforce the ruling let's get more on this from DW special correspondent a Ibrahim who joins us from Jerusalem hello a tell us more about how people in Israel are reacting to this ruling I think there's a sense of relief that the court did stop short of ordering a complete cessation of hostilities or a a ceasefire I think it's important to to remember that for a large overwhelming part of Israeli Society they're still sort of stuck on October 7th that trauma of that day is not over yet uh there are still hostages held in Gaza just yesterday Hamas released another video of uh hostages uh apparently showing them still alive and that's the kind of retraumatization that people here uh uh go through and so there's still a sense that the war in Gaza is a war of self-defense for people here and there was a general sense of confusion and shock at this whole case because people here feel they're on a self-defensive war while at the same time on the global stage we have seen over the past three months a growing isolation of the Israeli position and the position of Israel's allies like the US and Germany Visa V uh this war so there is a sense of relief that a ceasefire has not uh been ordered at the same time uh at least for Palestinian uh officials and Palestinians um there's still win in this uh ruling the fact that the court has said that there's a that the the genocide is is plausible of course the ruling whether or not there is a genocide happening will take years but the fact that it has said that it is plausible and now Israel is uh will have to face that accusation in court U seen as a win for uh Palestinians uh and their allies they're also um there's there also analysts who say while the court has not uh ordered a complete ceasefire some of the provisional measures that have been ordered including the prevention of genocide the allowing of more humanitarian Aid would uh require de facto some sort of uh toning down of the fighting or something close to uh a ceasefire so certainly as you mentioned at the top a polarizing uh decision but for people here in Israel a sense of of relief as they continue to live the trauma of October 7th right uh the UN Secretary General Antonio guia says he trusts Israel will comply with the icj's order now considering that Netanyahu has so far resisted International pressure is this ruling likely to change how Israel conducts this war well what Israel says and what we've heard government spokespeople say uh ever since this ruling was issued uh uh uh on uh uh Friday is that Israel is already doing its best that's what they say to uh prevent civilian uh uh casualties that Israel uh employs according to these government spokespeople measures to make sure that civilians are kept out of Harm's Way and we've heard one government spokesperson say that there's actually excess capacity for the processing of Aid into uh uh Gaza now that is a completely different picture from what we hear civilians on the ground reporting uh what we hear from International organizations as well so there's definitely an attempt by the Israeli site to frame this as well we've already been doing this but that is something that certainly uh large you know credible human rights organizations disagree with I mean we're looking at a death toll that has surpassed 20,000 according to uh the health Ministry in the Hamas run strip and uh casualties that uh that you know far exceed uh that number in a span of more than three months right PW special correspondent AI Ibrahim from Jerusalem thank you let's get the perspective from Gaza with journalist ham baloa who spent the first months of the war reporting from inside The embattled Enclave he joins us now from the Jordanian Capital am man hello Hasam the court has ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza but not to end its military operation there can this ruling really be considered a victory for the people in Gaza uh two levels we are talking about the official level um human rights organizations yeah where they consider it as a as a win uh accepting the case of genociding um against Palestinian people um U most of the Palestinian officials mentioned this and they said this is a victory and a win uh it's a a great and a symbolic step um that the icj accepting such case against Israel for the first time but on the ground level with the people they are disappointed they think this is not going to change the reality of their life the current um uh suffer and uh displacement lack of uh all uh basic needs um um I talked to a few people in Gaza and they said said that um the death and the killing will continue the operation is continued so this ruling is not going to change our reality also on the ruling the court called on Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas to release the remaining hostages How likely is that to happen it's not going to happen without a deal Hamas is it clear about this Hamas uh uh despite they welcome the the ruling and they said that the the um they need International Community to impress Israel to implement um um a seized fire in in in Gaza they they they ask for um a swap deal um Hamas one of the aims that they announced earlier when they did um the attack of October 7 that to release the Palestinian prisoners held in the Israeli prisons uh so they um no nobody is talking about Hamas freeing the Israeli hostages without exchanging them with the with the Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli prison uh you started talking about it earlier in your first uh response uh there's no ceasefire on the table for now the wh World Health Organization is now warning that the last functioning Hospital in Gaza is on the brink of collapse what does that mean for the humanitarian situation on the ground there Gaza now is is suffering from different levels of um uh uh um uh problems and and and um horrific situation and U Food level on the medical level um uh um Sheltering um the most essential and one of the basics that the the hospitals most of them they are run out of service uh the main two hospitals in Gaza Strip the one in Gaza City which is cha hospital and and and and was run out of of of service um a long time ago now partially working the the other one in kanun Naser Hospital which is surrounded by the tanks and a lot of footage and reports coming from there they are suffering lack of or shortage of um U uh of Medics um existing there their capacity is very limited so and on all levels like like the medical and the health system is is about to colls yes journalist ham Bala thank you thank you our correspondent Diane Hawker is in Johannesburg South Africa hello Diane South Africa took the case to the court in the first place how is the ruling being perceived in the country well Eddie in South Africa there is a lot of positivity around this decision many South Africans have been posting on social media and in community groups posting South African flags and images of our former president Nelson Mandela um you'll know that Nelson Mandela was someone who really was in support of the Palestinian cause and he said um that South Africa would not be free unless the people of Palestine were free and people will have a feeling that this decision and uh the South African government's move is taking that position forward Ward and in a way upholding what Nelson Mandela had fought for of course there's also an understanding here that the decision um by the icj does play South Africa to somewhat in conflict with um some other International Players uh particularly with the Israeli government who are not happy with the outcome um just a few hours after the decision was was announced um the is the Israeli carrier L all announced that it would be halting flights to South Africa um in March and this is the the airline said this was as a result of fewer Israelis wanting to travel to South Africa of course here locally um this decision has also given more momentum to protests that have been going on in support of the Palestinian people we've seen pickets and also um some uh uh protests against particular companies which are believed to be supporting um the Israeli cause the genocide trial will continue and could take months or years what does South Africa expect now from the icj well in the short term South Africa's expectations don't really look towards the icj but they look more towards the International Community as the report that played earlier on mentioned um there's there will be a talks held at the uh un Security Council uh and of course South Africa is hoping that there will be action taken there they're also hoping that other countries now that the icj has made this ruling will start to speak out and that there will be a change in Israel's uh uh uh the the behavior of Israeli leaders for example one of the things mentioned in the decision um relates to to to uh the the government stopping any kind of incitement and the the decision also mentioned language that was used by um Israeli leaders so the South African government is really expecting and hoping that there will be a change in that language um and really a concerted effort to preserve lives okay DW correspondent Diane Hawker in Johannesburg
