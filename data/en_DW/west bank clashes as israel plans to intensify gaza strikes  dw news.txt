Israel's military says it will intensify strikes on Hamas controlled Gaza ahead of an expected ground offensive more than 50 people were killed overnight in Israeli attacks according to Hamas government sources now meanwhile the Israeli military repeated its warnings for civilians in the north of The Enclave to move South for their own safety but Israel has also made clear that it plans to continue its bombardments there Israeli strikes on Gaza southern city of Khan hospitals media Reports say the strikes hit a family home near a un school which was housing recently displaced cousins seven were killed and around 40 wounded there were more casualties at a refugee camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip Israeli air strikes reportedly killed at least seven there and wounded dozens more including children a home in Northern Gaza was also [Applause] hit the air strike hit them while they were sleeping innocent children with their father and grandmother while they were sleeping what did they do did they carry weapons these are innocent children who know nothing when will this end we've been in a war for years and people are just watching Israel Wars it will increase its strikes on Gaza As It prepares for a possible ground offensive we will minimize the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war and from today we're going to increase our attacks so I called on the residents of Gaza City specifically to move South for their safety around gaza's Border in southern Israel the military buildup is visible Israel has vowed to wipe out the islamist terrorist group Hamas after its brutal assault on Israel that claimed 14400 lives but the civilian toll has been heavy with more than 4,000 people killed in Gaza so far and in the West Bank Israeli security forces have a clashed with Palestinians Israel says it's carrying out operations there as well as in Gaza to capture and kill Hamas militants the United Nations says dozens of people including children have been killed in the West Bank since the Hamas Terror attacks on Israel two weeks ago Friday prayers sound out in rala the West Bank's biggest city but the faithfuls prayers soon turned to protest against Israel's devastating strikes on Gaza this woman says her whole family is there shame for what is happening to them they slaughtered children and women we do not forgive the Arab countries because they let us down they did not stand by us they left us alone I hope someone will listen we don't need empty words we need someone that stands by us and more and more feel that Hamas is doing just that we are your soldiers Muhammad daif they chant praising hamas's military Wing Commander the West Bank is not governed by Hamas but by fut the party that controls the Palestinian Authority or PA it's widely seen as weak corrupt and ineffective and now more than ever the PA blames Israel and the West for its fragile legitimacy growing by the day don't forget last September Abu maazin stood before the general assembly he had made it clear that the International Community is failing the Palestinians that the Palestinian Authority has the responsibility and obligation to protect its people but Israel is making its actions not on void Israel is putting hurdles there are other hurdles for the PA in the two weeks since hamasa attack on Israel here in the West Bank at least 80 people have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces and armed Jewish settlers on Thursday an Israeli raid an air strike on a refugee camp in the region killed 133 people including five children anger here is growing this group of protesters may be small but it's enough for the Israeli military to take strong action up on the hilltop you can see Israeli snipers they've been shooting lives bounds of ammunition to these protesters who've been burning tires and throwing stones so far the paramedics say seven people have been shot including one of their own the West Bank is not a major focus of the Israeli military response for now but with the public losing even more faith in the Palestinian Authority and support for Hamas apparently growing there is a fear here that that could soon change let's get an update from our correspondent funny faar in Jerusalem funny what can you tell us about these reports of overnight strikes in the West Bank well there's been so much focus on Gaza Strip that people may believe that that's pretty much where the violence is taking place only but it's not the case in fact the West Bank has been in the focus also during the past 18 months uh when it comes to clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants and Israel is saying that they struck basically what appears to be an operational compound underneath a mosque which again is located in jine refugee camp in occupied West Bank now that refugee camp is seen basically as a stronghold of various militant groups including Hamas militants but also Islamic Jihad now they conflicting numbers just how many people have been killed we're hearing several and as I have to say once again it doesn't come by surprise because as the situation is evolving here in Israel there is vence flaring up on different size here being on on the North uh Israel bordering Lebanon in the South obviously uh where there's a lot of focus on and when it comes this to the situation in occupied West Bank it's really unclear in fact how it's going to go on from here and also whether other stakeholders here are going to get involved in fact we are just hearing media reports from Syrian State media which we cannot verify that apparently Israel has struck several airports including the Damascus and the Aleppo intern airports in Syria once again we cannot verify but certainly all of this can be seen in the context that it is extremely becoming complex and dangerous uh how uh the dynamic is evolving as Israel says they're getting ready for the next face with what they call is a war against Hamas militants and let's look more closely at the situation in Gaza then the IDF has again asked residents to move toward the south of the Gaza Strip are people taking heed well according to official numbers at least Israel says that 700,000 people have already left Northern Gaza and uh in in the southern the Central and the southern part of Gaza Strip but if you do the math that would mean that about 400,000 people are still in Northern Gaza we're talking about elderly people we are talking about doctors who obviously do not want to leave their patients behind and we simply talking about people who cannot go to the South because there's no way for them to uh get a way of transportation and also once has to understand while Israel is calling for that evacuation there's constant bombardment of Gaza Strip so it's a really difficult situation however when I start the line and uh I've been uh hearing about Israel calling on people in Gaza Strip to evacuate now for days that this is in fact the first time where I would say really indicates that the next phase of the war is imminent because IDF basically said that they want to make sure uh that that those who can leave basically leave before they're going to uh uh step up the operation and quote increase attacks now the UN has pointed out that there has to be a ceasefire however and we have seen that that there at the Cairo peace Summit there's been no agreement whatsoever calling for a ceasefire to the situation for the people in Gaza Strip in fact regardless where they are but specifically in the north especially it's getting increasingly dire increasingly dangerous and they're just trying to survive funny thank you for that update that is funny forar for us in
