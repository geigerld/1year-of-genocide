well a ship carrying 200 tons of food for Gaza is still waiting to sail from Cyprus the Open Arms will be the first vessel to use a new Maritime Corridor set up to bring humanitarian supplies into the territory cypriate authorities say the vessel has been cleared to sell but there are problems over unloading and distributing the aid DW's Rosie burchard reports from Cyprus we're flying into larica the cypriate city that's become the new gateway to Gaza Aid groups have been busy loading a ship with much needed food for the besieged territory we are ready with almost 200 tons of food ready to be delivered to people of gasa we have rice flowers beans tuna and other products ready to be distributed in gasa the first of its kind sea delivery is part of a new Maritime Aid Corridor a deal carefully brokered by the cypriate government alongside the European Union the United Arab Emirates the United States and others cypriate officials check the Goods with Israeli oversight and monitor the passage from this coordination Center to try and ensure they get to Gaza safely the first thing and where we focus currently is to have a successful uh first journey and then of course we already have stored more quantities of humanitarian Aid in Cyprus we hope to establish the corridor to really um be in a position to deal with the dire situation on the ground this is not a swift or simple route one of the Charities involved is building a makeshift Jetty to receive the aid and separately the US plans to build a bigger temporary Pier the United Nations is now warning Gaza is on the brink of famine it's some 400 kmet from here in Cyprus and the roundtrip takes days there is a quicker and easier way to get Aid in through Road Crossings Israel says it welcomes this sea Corridor and that it's committed to getting food to gazin but it's also faced heavy criticism and accusations of blocking Aid entry by land the new C Corridor will bring some relief but given the enormous need at its final destination it's just a drop in the ocean let's get excuse me let's get more from our reporter Felix tamsut in Jerusalem welcome Felix so as that a ship waits to set sale bring us up to date with the situation in Gaza at the moment well the situation seems to be ever worsening when it comes to the lack of food and other necessary products hunger seems to be becoming an Ever growing problem and at the same time uh we have to bear in mind that the uh Israeli attack in the southern city of Rafa uh looming over um on the one hand we have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying uh that such an attack is uh essential for Israel for Israel reaching its Target of eliminating Hamas RAF is where more than 1 million Palestinians are currently centering on the other hand there are also reports that such an attack is not imminent one thing is clear uh the eyes of the world are watching and uh this is going to remain uh the case in the coming days and weeks okay so as the the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins what is the atmosphere like there in isra well I would say that Israel is currently on age when it comes to the uh security aspect of Ramadan um the uh the security Arrangements in and around uh Jerusalem and the holy sites um is currently being widely reported in the news here and everyone seems to be talking about whether there will be uh uh certain restrictions uh as the month of Ramadan uh keeps on going um at the moment it seems like the situation is relatively calm there have been some clashes between Israeli police and Muslims wanting to pray uh but at the same time I think I think everyone's eyes are towards Friday this is when uh things uh could get tricky for the Israeli Security Services um and um everyone is uh here talking about whether that's going to be the case this coming Friday and uh what can you tell us about these reports that Israel has killed a high ranking Hamas official uh who was believed to have been directly involved in the October 7 Terror attacks well we are talking about Maan Isa a very high ranking Hamas official um those reports uh are currently widening in Israel that Israel believes that he had been killed in the attack um this hasn't been confirmed as of yet uh if confirmed this would be the highest ranking Hamas official to be killed by by Israel since October 7th uh and Israeli officials according to reports here in Israel believe that uh this would be a significant step uh towards achieving the uh War's goals but at the same time it needs to be said that no official confirmation has been received so far um such an such a confirmation um could be received in the coming days sometimes even weeks um and we're going to stay uh on top of those reports and uh should this information be confirmed this is a big step um and a big stepping stone in this war absolutely thank you for that Felix of Felix tamot in
