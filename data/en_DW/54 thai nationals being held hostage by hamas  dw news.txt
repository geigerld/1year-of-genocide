some 54 of the more than 200 hostages held captive by Hamas are from Thailand Thailand provides almost all the foreign Farm labor in Israel as part of a 2012 agreement with the Israeli government the Thai hostages taken by Hamas were working in farms near the Gaza Strip scenes of Devastation at the kabut berry in southern Israel after the terror attack by Hamas gunmen killed more than 100 people here among them many Thai migrant workers ties are the largest single group of foreign dead and missing after the massacre with 24 confirmed killed and 21 unaccounted for and a quarter of the more than 200 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are Tha taant organized evacuation flights for survivors who tell of a desperate struggle to stay alive I hid in a small room with 11 other people we could hardly breathe we took turns breathing through a small hole then three to four Hamas guys came back and they tried to unlock the door but there were two locks they tried to open the top one but we all helped to hold on to the bottom lock they started shooting through the door but it was too thick then Israeli soldiers arrived to help thailam provides almost all the foreign Farm labor in Israel about 30,000 ties work in the country's vegetable fields and dairy farms I talk this over with my family I won't return I'll settle down at home a lot of things are still bad my mental health is still bad around 5,000 ties were working in the area worst affected by the violence one of the hardest hit agricultural areas was at the near o kabut where ties were among the hundred people killed or or kidnapped Israeli volunteers have had to step in to keep the milk supply going most of the staff of the dairy farm were Thailand and they were Massacre um just comes to sh like the Hamas terrorist that came in they killed everyone there are fears that if ties choose to stay away long term it could have a devastating impact on the Israeli economy for many from Thailand staying away is not really an option often they'd have to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to go to Israel these ties may have escaped the gunmen but now it's a tough choice between staying safe and securing their livelihoods and joining me now for more context is punat Guna she's an assistant professor of anthropology at the nakon PanAm University in eastern Thailand Professor Guna how has news of Thai casualties in the Hamas terror attack been received in Thailand um first of all since um early October this month right um as the northeastern villagers all the Thai citizens we are so sorry to hear about this news is a bad news actually um I think we were so shocked about the incident uh as I heard that many time migrant workers es especially from my hometown the cap province in the northeast of Thailand they have you know bad lucks and they will host hostage and some of them are are lucky to come back to their countries but a lot of the population still uh in the uncertain condition we we are still hope that they are will be free right soon how how important is working in Israel for Thai Farm Workers you know you have to understand that living and working in the northeastern region of Thailand we have poor condition we don't have much opportunities to make a decision uh living condition is so difficult even to do Agri culture even to be as a farmer we have uh been neglect by the Tha State and don't talk about the social welfare we are very poor with some of those resources that's why e economic reason Drive the migrant workers to go far away from the countries and decide to go to the Middle East to find another job to find a new life and send the money back to that countries which is Thailand do you think that following this attack this terror attack by Hamas Thai workers will reconsider if they should go and work in Israel given the dangers that are U that are apparent over there you know it's a good question I've been asking and I if I have a chance to meet up with all the timean workers who just back from the Middle East especially from Israel you know some of them can be divided into two groups the first one who have encounter with the negative incidents they would not decide to go back to Israel but for those who still um seek for uh New Life who still want to get a high income to work in the Middle East they still want to go back to Israel you know as we speak there's at least 54 tie workers who have been held captive by Hamas what is the Tie government doing to get them back I think the Tha government led by prime minister set to and all the cabinet I think they try so hard to try so many channels so many ways to negotiate uh as uh I think they try to use two different levels of neot negotiation the first one is formal diplomatic negotiation and the second one which is the um uh prime minister and the minister of the Foreign Affairs just uh uh spoke out to the media to the Thai Medias actually that the Tha government also tried to use the informal negotiation try to send the representative of the Tha government back to isra and negotiate with uh representative of the Hamas group right we'll leave it there uh for the time being and hope that there is better news for Tha migrant workers and their families in Thailand thanks so much for joining us today with all of that context Mrs punat Gia bu thank you so
