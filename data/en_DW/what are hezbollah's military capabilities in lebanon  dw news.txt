tensions are soaring in the Middle East after the leader of the pro-iranian Hezbollah militia threatened a fight with no rules if a broader conflict with Israel breaks out in a televised address Hezbollah leader Hassan nazala warned that nowhere in Israel would be safe in the event of an allout War he also threatened to attack Cyprus if it opened its airports and bases to Israeli forces earlier Israel threatened to destroy Hezbollah the Israeli Army and Hezbollah have clashed almost daily since the start of the war in Gaza in October let's get the very latest from our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya give us the very latest if you can from Israel well we've seen such crossb attacks actually since October 7 the terror attacks then and they have escalated uh between uh hasah and Israel in recent weeks now um they reach deeper you know his follow attacks have reached deeper inside Israel but also Israeli attacks have reached deeper inside uh Lebanon and then on Tuesday hasb has published a video uh footage that shows a 9 minutes long video that shows a um a hia the northern Israeli city a major city there in the north and showing uh sensitive sides such as the port uh such as residential areas and other uh sides and in in very much detailed of this city and that is basically as seen here as a message by hollah we can reach everywhere and that is of great concern uh to Israelis that something like that could actually happen and of course rcks uh went up again after that we heard the foreign uh Minister Israel Cuts saying uh the time is close to a decision that there could be an allout war and now we heard of course Hassan nzala also speaking uh from Lebanon that Hezbollah could reach anywhere now such resurrect is not something new uh between Hezbollah and Israel but it comes at this particular time it's very much uh a very tense time here between uh Hezbollah and Israel and of course um uh in Israel adding to that you know since October 7 tens of thousands of Israelis have been relocated from the border areas there simple ghost towns in in Northern Israel and that's something Israel cannot live with uh uh for the long term there have been uh diplomatic of course uh um attempts we had seen uh on Monday and Tuesday the US enoy amamos Hawkin uh he was in the region Israel and in leanon trying to diffuse uh the tensions but also uh we've been hearing from Israeli officials they would be favoring a diplomatic solution but at the same time we've been hearing also very strong calls here in recent weeks uh that if such a diplomatic solution could not be reached uh the the only solution would be a military Invasion or military solution to this problem Tanya Kramer with that update for us from Jerusalem thank you so much as always and let's get some analysis with military expert Marina from Kings College London Marina good to see you given these events of the past few days How likely is a war between Israel and Hezbollah good evening well what we're seeing right now is the height of the tensions between is Israel and Hezbollah especially after the appearance of the Drone footage which made Israel feel more vulnerable it is not known whe when that footage was recorded however it shows that hasah has the ability to penetrate Israeli defenses and might reach its um critical infrastructure meaning that Israel is feeling now a strategic vulnerability and wants to preempt any potential war with Hezbollah but is it a good time for Israel to commit to a new war and open a new front is questionable and I think it will depend a lot on outside players who might try and help mediate some sort of agreement in order to avoid expanding this war towards Lebanon well Marina that very much goes to my next question Israel of of course uh fighting the war in Gaza if if this does turn into a war it would mean fighting on two fronts what would that mean from Israel's perspective I think it's going to be very difficult for Israel firstly we have to understand that both Hamas and Hezbollah have adjusted their mod ofandi they have improved their technological skills and specifically Hezbollah it's one of the best AR non-state actors up to date this means that it will be not as easy or it hasn't been easy for Israel to face Hamas and Gaza it will be even more difficult for the IDF to face the hasah fighters on their own turf and some reports estimate that hasah has some 100,000 Fighters Hezbollah also receives support from Iran so it's quite a powerful force we have to understand that and we have to understand that the Israeli military is now also being exhausted from its operations in Gaza it's not ending and opening another front in the north fighting in Lebanon might not bring about the desired results I don't think that the military is a correct tool here to look for a solution to a political problem we spoken about Hezbollah as a well-armed non-state actor but but what about Lebanon and the Lebanese government is it possible to say how they would factor in here well it is possible that the Lebanese armed forces would provide some sort of support because um they are at odds with Hezbollah and they have been for many years and the United States has been providing help to the Lebanese Armed Forces however I don't think that they play a they can play a major role in this equation in in terms of their military capabilities therefore I don't think that we should um count on the fact that the Israeli IDF will be closely coordinating their operations with with the Lebanese Armed Forces Marina thank you as always that is military expert at Marina  let's get a view from Lebanon with bran shata host of the podcast the Beirut banan which deals with modern Lebanese history a warm welcome to you Hezbollah and Israel have been trading almost daily fire since October as we've heard how much do you fear that the situation could escalate now and and tell us a little bit about why in my assessment that this is cautious escalation from October 8th until today even with the Bluster coming from both sides of the Border whether it's the Israeli foreign minister who threatens regularly to take Lebanon back to the Stone Age or whether it's Hass threatening Cyprus in my opinion I think this is still a measure of psychological warfare and escalation but in terms of the tit fortat fighting that is happening at the moment there is a military escalation that is reminiscent a bit of July 2006 but it has not degenerated to the point of allout War so tell us how strong Hezbollah is in Lebanon and and who there is really charge that's actually a great question um has is many things at once first and foremost it is Iran's Shadow Army based in Lebanon and it is a guaran of Iran's security interests in Lebanon and in the region it is also a Lebanese political party with a Lebanese base and it plays by Lebanese rules in terms of domestic politics meaning has concerns and those concerns can be shared by other Lebanese parties but its priorities at the moment in terms of War are to make sure Iran gets what it needs from this round of War and the reason I'm taking the conversation directly to Iran is because unlike hasah in terms of its earlier career in Lebanese history on the battlefield is hasbalah is playing by rules that are probably best defined as cautious pragmatic and not seeking full out War which only proves one issue which is that Iran at the point of time right now still does not want a regional war that includes this is a group that has been a very very carefully uh owned machine for the last four decades and it is still the crown jewel of Iran's security needs and I do not think Iran is willing to risk or expose to further danger and do you think that would change should we say see Israel launch a military operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon if the Israelis were to consider crossing the blue line which is the deao border between Lebanon and Israel it means that we are expecting a long term War but I do not think that means full out War meaning it is hard to imagine the Israelis reverting to 2006 when they bombed Lebanon relentlessly for 34 days and that included infrastructure institutions failed and the Lebanese State paid an immense price and I don't think the Israelis will ever seek something like 1982 when they laid Siege to Beirut in the summer of 1982 over 10,000 Lebanese were killed that summer as Ariel Chiron sought to dislodge yeser Arif from this country it is very difficult to see that happening but that said there's something very different from today than 2006 which is that the Lebanese government today is playing no rule in 2006 there was a fledgling post Syrian occupation government that was trying to reclaim a semblance of Lebanese sovereignty and actually negotiate with hasbalah and bring them to un Security Council resolution 1701 that is a Lebanese crafted Security Council resolution and that's 18 years ago today the Lebanese government is absent from diplomacy and that is a striking difference because now you have diplomats that visit this country and speak to politicians that Pander to hasah rather than trying to create a form of stability that's good for Lebanon and not good for Iran well thank you so much for your time and that analysis that Isani Chata
