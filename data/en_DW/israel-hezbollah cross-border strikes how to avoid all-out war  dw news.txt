Israel says waves of its warplanes have carried out preemptive strikes against Hezbollah militant Targets in Lebanon where authorities reported three deaths Hezbollah says it has launched drones against Israel in retaliation for the assassination of one of its [Music] commanders early morning in Northern Israel the Iron Dome Springs into action as hasbalah begins what the militant group calls phase one of an attack on his is hundreds of rockets and drones fired towards 11 military sites it says it's in retaliation for the killing of one of its commanders in Beirut last month in a statement Hezbollah said all offensive drones were launched that their designated times and from all their positions our military operation for today has been completed the enemy's claims regarding its preemptive actions the targets it allegedly hit and its supposed disruption of hezbollah's attack are baseless and contradict the facts on the ground Israel says it began preemptive air strikes on Sunday against Hezbollah Targets in Lebanon after they detected plans of an attack against its territory the IDF claimed 100 fighter jets have struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels aimed at Israel it also released these images it says are of a Hezbollah drone being intercepted Israel's prime minister issued a warning after an emergency National Security cabinet meeting we are determined to do everything to protect our country return the residents of the north to their homes and continue to follow a simple rule whoever hurts us we hurt them Sunday's escalation further heightens tensions as talks continue to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza for more let's bring in our correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya ker Tanya described the state of emergency in Israel right now well somehow you know people anticipated a retaliation by Hezbollah and also at some point by Iran after the high uh profile targeted killings in Beirut and tan last month that were attributed uh to uh Israel so Israel has been preparing uh for that and it was not a matter of if but when and how these counter strikes would look like whether they could be limited or contained or whether this will lead to an allout war in the region now Israel said they had launched at shortly before 5:00 a.m. in the morning with over 100 war planes of fighter jets uh these what they described as preemptive strikes uh at launching uh sides they said they targeted about 40 uh different areas uh there and Hezbollah has said they had been successful in launching over 300 missiles and drones at Israel they said they targeted military targets now we have heard now here from the Israeli side that they reject the uh claim that military targets were actually hit now uh Hezbollah has said this first phase is concluded but what does it mean here for people now we've been seeing in the early morning there was a uh security cabinet meeting an emergency mode uh uh was um said to be installed now the uh air traffic also Boron was then for some time being interrupted now it has been back on track now but some of the there are still delays being said some of the uh major foreign Airlines have now extended their suspension of air of of their flights to Tel Aviv also the home front command this morning was changed for people especially in Tel Aviv and the northern area of course um they had been restricted but those restrictions have now been lifted as of 12:30 uh local times they have not been lifted for people further up north they have been living with crossborder attacks between Hezbollah and Lebanon you know for many many months now since October last year we know that approximately 60,000 people have not been able to return home also in all these months this is of course also a situation that is not really acceptable for Israel now we have to wait and see of course what the next moves will what are the next moves thank you very much for bringing us up today Tanya ker in Jerusalem for us and let's go over to our correspondent Muhammad sha who is in Lebanon U Muhammad Hezbollah called these attacks a strategic Target give us some more context wellah said that it launched more than 300 missiles to disrupt Israel's aerial defenses Paving the way for tens of attacking drawns to cross toward uh military bases in Northern uh Israel now in a series of statements uh issued by uh the militant group said that it hit what it called a strategic Target uh that will be revealed uh soon that was the sentence used in a statement and more information about this is expected in a speech by the party leader Hassan nah uh this evening but several security sources and media reports said that the party attempted to hit a uh security uh facility or security facilities near Tel Aviv including a secret base used by the mosad now whether it hit the target or not is yet to be uh confirmed uh media reports coming out of Israel suggest that the attack did not reach U Tel Aviv whatsoever this was the largest attacks from Lebanon on Israel since the uh outbreak of this conflict in October and otherwise uh what else have or how else have people been reacting uh to these attacks well it's it's looking quite normal uh for a Sunday here in in Beirut the attacks brought about anxiety in the morning and fears that uh an Israeli response now could widen the conflict further but soon as hasbalah announced the completion of uh this military operation also reports coming uh uh from Israel in the same direction meaning that uh Israeli response to this incident is is over the front gradually went back to the daily routine of ticks for tax and uh intermittent crossb uh shelling between both parties so life went back relatively to the usual here in Beirut some Airlines canceled flights uh to and from uh beirut's airport the caretaker government also met in the morning to discuss the development and um the spokesperson said that it it's reaching out to mediators to deescalate the situation and the latest there from DWS Mahammad sh thank you and more context on the latest developments now from Christopher Morris he's a security expert at the University of Portsmouth Israel's military says it foiled a much larger attack with preemptive strikes but heesa denies they had any impact and says it managed to hit Israeli military targets although Israel called that damage small scale what's your take I think more than anything these latest wave of attacks really Hammer home the effectiveness of the Israeli air defense system it has proved incredibly Adept at intercepting the vast majority of strikes coming from Hezbollah of course it's also the case that their preemptive strikes carried out on the basis of robust intelligence will have significantly degraded Ed the planned attack by Hezbollah but Hezbollah says this is just the beginning the military group recently released videos of its huge tunnel Network what threat does it pose to Israel um well of course the a lot of interesting things going on with hezar at the moment not only they said that these latest wave of attacks are simply phase one of what is likely to be a far larger and more sophisticated operation they have also released some interesting footage of their extensive tunnel Network within Lebanon now with this they're probably sending a number of messages first of all they're saying that you know we have extensive networking storage and concealment and we can continue doing what we are currently doing for an extended period of time they're also kind of I suppose telegraphing the risk of infiltration and you know it's a real show of force from Hezbollah which is interesting to see at this juncture Yemen's iran-backed hoodie Rebels uh praise the hezbo attacks and renewed threats to launch their own what do you make of those statements now one of the biggest concerned in both you know the interest of International Security and on behalf of Israel at the moment is going to be coordinated pressure coming from Hamas Hezbollah and the houthis at one time now coordinated efforts on any scale would present a major challenge it's something they've struggled to do so far but given their common backer in Iran that is going to be a key concern over the coming months isn't that exactly when Israel has its back up against the wall when it's attacked on multiple fronts simultaneously yes of course and their biggest fear is going to be another large Iranian attack and a combination of attacks from kind of like the triple hes happening at once that could be enough to is overwhelm the extensive Israeli air defenses and that would present a major challenge How likely is this so-called attack or reprisal attack from Iran uh right now considering everyone's been bracing for this for some time after the killing of course of hamas's political Chief is hania in tan of course yes so there is increasing concern that there is going to be an Iranian response uh so far we've seen that well we've seen the large scale attack and we've also seen intense pressure stemming from its proxies across the region now again coordination is going to be a major issue there if we were to see a large Iranian attack again I would expect the US which maintains a heavy presence in the region to get involved in intercepting any strike so whilst it is a major concern there are I suppose International forces to consider in the region as well well the US also has carriers that have uh arrived in the region but just summing up how would you rate the risk of allout War now considering all of these developments it's a precarious balance on the one hand nobody wants to face another front a ground war in Lebanon and everybody is mindful of escalation on the other hand we have this persistent need on behalf of everybody involved to maintain face and that seems to be one of the the key aspects driving the conflict at the moment so it's a very precarious balance that we're in at the moment is that the only hope for deescalation Saving Face um well it's actually I would say Saving Face is what's driving the violence you know you have this persistent need on behalf of Hezbollah Hamas houthis to respond to Israel and to demonstrate strength failure to do that would carry you know immediate local consequences and of course it would be a concern for their major Ally Iran so I'd say it's probably one of the factors that's really driving the conflict more than anything so so what else do players need to uh do in the region or elsewhere abroad uh to ensure that this doesn't reach an all our war um well hopefully Lebanon can be an absolutely key but the I'm talking about the Lebanese State here can be an absolutely key partner here um in terms of like relieving pressure uh it's going to be on I suppose the US and Iran as external parties to really kind of I suppose reign in uh the tensions in the region exactly how that might happen I am unsure but it's definitely something that the International Community needs to continue to watch with Incredible interest great to get uh your insights Christopher Morris from the University of Portsmouth thanks for being on DW thank you so much
