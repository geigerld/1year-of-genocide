after 5 months of conflict between Israel and Hamas the UN is warning that at least a quarter of gaza's population is at risk of famine since the Hamas attacks of October the 7th Israel has periodically blocked the flow of humanitarian Aid into the Gaza Strip the UN says it is trying to find a way to deliver more supplies using an Israeli military Road bordering the territory the US Egypt Jordan and the United Arab Emirates are airdropping Aid into the territory but officials say air drops are a last resort and aren't enough to prevent starvation waiting for food to fall from the sky this is what an A Drop in Gaza looks like each one sets off a race and there's no prize for the losers since the morning the plane has been dropping eight and I've run after it we went to the sea to the east to the West we went to Al I got nothing according to the UN is Isel has blocked some humanitarian Aid sent by land to Gaza they say Aid drops are far from the best solution we have to have a a plan that allows us to you know prevent famine that we need to significantly scale up the humanitarian assistance in there and we have to get up at least 300 trucks a day right now we're lucky if we're getting about 150 the few resources that are getting in are not enough to feed the millions who are in at least 20 children have died of famine in the territory so far we eat breakfast I bring each of my daughters a piece of plain bread to make them feel a little full we can't eat anything else there's no healthy food all our food brings us diseases there is no food to enable me to breastfeed my child and I can't buy her milk according to the h Lo run Gaza Health Ministry the Palestinian death toll has now reached more than 30,000 without a rapid humanitarian solution for starvation that number could soon climb Salam alen founded the humanitarian Aid organization team Humanity he joins us on the line from Gaza welcome to DW I understand you arrived there just over 24 hours ago what have you seen in that time yeah um what I've seen is um people asking for help everywhere where we go uh today we've been in RAF we were in we were near the north Kaza and we seen children uh like without shoes most of the children don't have shoes we seen people asking for food diers a lot of children need baby milk like this whole city needs everything that is possible to help these people and what have you brought with you to Gaza how are you helping so we have sent trucks with aid from Egypt until now we have sent 120 trucks trucks is on the way trucks arrived and we're doing our best to distribute uh the food the aid we brought uh there is hygiene packs there is uh baby milk all kind of help uh that is needed in Gaza right now now the UN estimates that most of gaza's population that's around 2.2 million people are on the brink of famine some trucks they say are are getting through and the US and Egypt Jordan and the United Arab Emirates they're all airdropping humanitarian Aid into the territory why isn't that enough because there's a lot of people like you said there's over two million people that really need help with everything uh today uh we saw how people were asking we're just walking the inside the refugee camp and uh people were begging us for help like everybody came and just asked we need this we need this we need this so I understand um that the need is very huge here and of course it's not enough just playing we need trucks we need many many trucks uh we need a daily 500 trucks to uh get going through the day um it's the situation is horrible like we saw a uh six toilets six toilets for the whole refugee camp where there was over 18,000 people six toilets is not enough so people are are making their own toilet so it's it's horrible I cannot even explain the situation it's really really bad here and how were you able to get access to to Gaza when so many other organizations have been turned away and as you say one of the reasons there isn't enough is that there aren't enough trucks getting through so one thing is sending trucks the other thing is receiving it and distributed it in uh in way in human way uh as you heard when trucks going inside Raza uh they've been looted and things disappearing and uh what we are trying to do is help as much as possible that those trucks will be uh delivered uh the aid will be delivered to the people that is in huge need of this and uh as we know uh you can also send trucks from Egypt or from other countries you don't need to be here and uh the only way we did it is just officially and ask for for approval and the Israeli government gave us approval to get inside and distribute a well thank you for uh joining us and talking us uh through that terrible situation Salim Aline from the humanity and for more on this Let's cross to journalist bik sladin in Tel Aviv bik you've been talking to people inside Gaza what are you hearing from them about the situation there well Jihad um to say that the situation is very bad is understatement because of the lack of the humanitarian Aid and the food scarcity all over Gaza the source is telling me that prices has jumped for food and medicine 500 to 600% so what was a one shekele is now 600 isra shekele so some people actually paid all what they have in order to buy some food for the families um he's also telling me that people are literally killing each other they are attacking each other with knives while fighting all over flour and food and that situation actually made some sort of gangs all over Gaza so groups of people turned into gangs uh to steal as much as possible of the aid that comes in because there's not many for everyone and to secure the food and the medicine for their own group but some also are selling that in order to have some money to buy uh for the future so families that were uh suppressed by Hamas during their rule so we're talking about the Clans uh uh during hamas's rule were suppressed but now because Hamas is not president they are back again each wants to secure food and medicine for their own people and the latest airdrop that was from the Au uh sorry from the UAE it was fine that's what they're telling me but the previous ones we're talking about the air drop from the US in partnership with the jordanians they didn't know why the air dropping was on the seashore they're telling me that many of the aid was actually carried by the wind inside the sea uh sarcastically they're saying that the fish in the sea got more of what we have gotten so the situation is very very bad and that's an understand well South Africa has filed a new request to the international court of justice what have the reactions been from inside Israel well not many officials talked about this but uh we've seen that the firm Ministry actually asked the court to dismiss that uh request um as we see that this is the second time that not many uh you know uh uh titles here and talks about what South Africa is trying to do uh in the ha because Israel maybe knows right now that the court can't actually have any uh uh abilities to stop the attack on Rafa or call for a ceasefire so right now we have only the forign ministry asking the icj to just dismiss this request something that probably is going to happen the journalist balik sline there in Tel Aviv for us thank
