Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls from protesters for his resignation he said early elections would only benefit Hamas and jeopardized negotiations for the release of hostages huge crowds of protesters blocked roads in Jerusalem on Sunday as they marched to the parliament adding to the pressure on the Prime Minister tens of thousands gathered in Jerusalem for the beginning of a 4-day rally it's the largest anti-government demonstration since the October 7 terrorist attack many are fed up with the failure to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas among other things and are calling for an early election so what I'm doing here is trying to change the government because this government is a complete and utter failure and the only way they will lead us into the abyss that we will never come out of faced with increasing pressure to resign Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is standing his ground the calls for elections now during a war right before a victory would paralyze Israel for at least a half a year it would paralyze the negotiation for the release of our hostages and it would end the war before its objectives are completed the first one to benefit from this would be Hamas keeping up the military pressure coupled with quote flexibility in the negotiations is netanyahu's plan to secure the host's release a key part of that plan is Rafa Israel's planned operation there has sparked International concerns warning of a humanitarian catastrophe but Netanyahu insists Israel will go ahead with its plan we will go into Rafa and eliminate the humus battalions there there will be no Victory without the operation in Rafa and there will be no iory without the elimination of the hamus battalions there as the fighting goes on Israel's delegation has arrived in Egypt for fresh ceasefire talks but both sides have cast doubt on whether there will be a breakthrough this time they say the gap between their positions is still too wide joining us is Simon Mayon a Middle East Analyst at Lancaster University good to have you with us uh Netanyahu just criticized protesters taking to the streets to demand these early elections saying it would just benefit Hamas if you could start with your thoughts on those words yeah I I think we need to contextualize this in the sense that there has been a lot of anger directed of Benjamin Netanyahu over the past however many years uh most of his time in office has been characterized by anger frustration political divisiveness and none more so than the past couple of years he faces challenges from the right from the religious right from people who are frustrated at the religious right there are pro uh protests and and growing anger at the exclusion of military service for members of the hered community and so to say that this is all about the the Hamas situation or the inability to get the hostages back I think is misguided and I think it points to a much deeper frustration that is brewing within Israeli Society at net Yahoo's political Acumen and his political maneuverings so Simon the the the pressure is mounting the frustration is mounting but is there any sign of it getting to him at this point well we've heard reports that he is due to undergo a medical procedure um an unexpected one perhaps that is his body responding to to stress in some way shape or form but aside from that he is maintaining his confident Cor outward forceful Persona that has characterized his his style of leadership he is defiant in the face of seemingly Global criticism of Israel's military offensive in southern Gaza and he's defied in the face of these protests which is surprising given the scale of it and yet not surprising given that if he would be removed from Power then his legal battles his own personal legal battles would once again become Central in his life an Israeli delegation suon arrived in Cairo for truce talks but while that's happening Netanyahu is saying that there will be no victory over Hamas without a military operation into rougher so where does all that leave hopes then of finding an agreement well I guess this is why diplomacy is the ultimate answer here there has to be a diplomatic breakthrough the Li of of huge numbers of people are being directly affected by ongoing military action in Gaza the the hope of a ceasefire right now is not looking good but I think it's imperative to keep the talks going the the growing pressure on all sides to find some type of diplomatic solution increases day by day and I would imagine that is the hope of the International Community that's certainly the hope of Joe Biden and others that growing International pressure will put a stop to any Israeli plans to go into Rafa but also to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages as well so it's it's growing diplomatic pressure I guess so again it's a case of the pressure mounting everyone acknowledges the need for an agreement but what is needed then to find that to break the deadlock here and find agreement in your opinion well I guess the most important thing as in all peace talks is trust you need to be able to trust the other party involved in the talks and right now there is no level of trust there is no degree of trust so in the absence of trust there has to be someone to act as an enforcer someone who can guarantee that the terms agreed will be followed through on and I guess that is is what people have been trying to figure out who that could be would it be gatar would it be the UAE would it be the us we still don't know exactly who that that broker will be Egypt has tried to play a role as well of course so that's another important step and then it gets to the nitty-gritty of what the various sides want Israel of course wants the hostages returned and that would be an imperative that is a fundamental step that has to be taken and then on the other side Kamas wants to have irreversible steps towards a two-state solution and whether both sides and the leaderships on both sides can agree to those and what order they can agree to those steps that's what is going to be really tricky to figure out how can both sides move forward maintaining the necessary levels of trust making sure that those steps are being enforced and monitored by outside parties so that the trust and the the dialogue and the movement can be all flowing in the right direction Simon mayborne Middle East Analyst at Lancaster University great to get your thoughts thank you thank
