[Music] the death tool is rising nonstop as Israel intensifies its strikes pushing into Central and Southern Gaza the Hamas ran Health Ministry says over 21,000 have been killed and the vast majority of gazin are displaced it's just destruction around us as you see the buildings are destroyed this is not a war it's a genocide it's more than a war we can't even describe it the war has left much of Gaza and ruins destroying nearly one in five buildings and there's no end in sight said on eliminating Hamas Israel's military said it is expanding its ground offensive and released footage showing its Elite troops in Gaza the fighting is taking place in a complex area therefore the war will continue for many more months and we will work with different methods so that we can hold on to our achievements for a long time on the other side in Jerusalem a former Israeli settler hopes a long-term plan will also include her return to Gaza she was forced to leave the strip nearly two decades ago when Israel withdrew all its security forces and settlements there's a deep emotional tension Because deep inside we dream of returning there this is our home but do I know what will happen the return of Israeli settlers to Gaza is not part of Israel's plan so far but some here say it needs to be part of Israel's strategy to maintain long-term rule they're not talking about it yet in the Israeli government but this is something that can happen because there might be no choice the IDF will have to rule in Gaza in any case you can't rule if you don't have settlements there it is still not clear who exactly would govern a postwar Gaza or what Israel's plan is for lasting peace let's take a step back and take a look at the human Arian situation currently in Gaza I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Margaret Harris from the World Health Organization for more on this it it has now been more than 11 weeks since the fighting began in Gaza last Friday the UN Security Council passed a resolution urging more humanitarian Aid uh quickly delivered has it become easier to get that kind of humanitarian assistance to those who need it no because there's ongoing War air strikes damage to the roads it's extremely dangerous to move around it all we are sending um missions to the north to the center taking enormous risks our staff are telling us of the losses of their family members and and when we take our medical supplies to hospitals our trucks are stopped surrounded by starving people uh just wanting to know if we've got food and opening the boxes to see if we've got food it's at becoming more and more difficult every day because the bombardment continues and the starvation continues and the illness increases now I want to put to you uh something that was brought up by the Israeli government uh today a spokesperson uh today blamed blamed the UN and Hamas for Aid not not reaching Gins he said Aid simply isn't reaching the people who need it because Hamas is hijacking it Andra covers up for it what is your response to that we have not seen this we send our missions and as I said it's not getting the a the getting the a across is difficult because of the complexities of the checks it's a very slow process but the real difficulty is Distributing it in Gaza because this is a very dangerous place there are bombardments all the time if we truly and if all sides are truly committed to providing genuine Aid to the people of Gaza there would be a ceasefire right now and give us a sense of the humanitarian situation on the ground I know I've asked you this question many times before but 11 11 weeks into fighting having started can you tell us how things are looking in Gaza worse and worse by the Day by the minute uh the hospitals are doing what they can but they are uh overwhelmed they're the ones that are open at the moment we've been able to support up to 13 Hospitals now to just keep going a lot of them are not even able to accept new patients but are trying to look after those they have what they've also become is shelters Refugee shelters you mentioned the hospital Al alal that had a a bombardment nearby it's got 14,000 people just Sheltering there because they don't know where else to go they've been displaced over and over again um and and and as I said people are starving they dehydrated they're living in filthy conditions really really filthy conditions and we're seeing the diseases that are created by that uh we're seeing a huge rise in in diarrhea cases we've reported more than 130,000 of those we're seeing um huge rise in respir problems bronchitis coughs colds especially among the small children with more than 150,000 cases of that but also uh jordis which is probably hepatitis menitis many many severe diseases and also we're seeing surgeons having to amputate limbs because there is nobody who can do the the complex work to save those limbs so basically the people of Gaza are being bombed back into the middle AES well thank you for taking the time to speak with us on DW that is Dr Margaret Harris from the
