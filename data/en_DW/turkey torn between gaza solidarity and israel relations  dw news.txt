now Joe Biden's visit is part of a huge International diplomatic effort to keep the conflict from drawing in other Regional actors the Turkish government led by President reup Ty erdogan was one of the first last week to offer mediation officials in anara say they're involved in negotiations to release the 199 people abducted by Hamas from Israel on October 7th but efforts are being Complicated by the escalating violence in Gaza which is also Echo echoed on Turkish streets where than 60 people were reportedly injured during a major protest in Istanbul on Tuesday our correspondent Yulia Han has more it's been a night of Rage here in Istanbul Police use tear gas and water cannon to disperse crowds protesting outside the Israeli consulate some tried to storm the building others through fireworks and Stones the protesters blame Israel for the deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza Palestinians they are not alone we are with them people are being killed in hospital women's and CH women and children you got to wake up the Palestinian people have been struggling for the last 70 years and you turn a blind eye on them Turkish president Reb T ardogan was also quick to assign blame he called the hospital blast quote the latest example of Israel's attacks devoid of the most basic human values meanwhile the Israeli military says it can prove that a rocket launched by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad is to blame Islamic Jihad was responsible in any case consequences for ties between turkey and Israel could be be dire we did an immediate review recently Adan has been working to repair relations with Israel which have long suffered from his support for the Palestinians a few weeks ago at the UN General Assembly in New York he even met prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu in person for the first time but now the fragile rapoon could be over what we're starting to see increasingly is erdogan and the government of turkey taking a very strong anti- already position to the extent that I think eron is more interested in abandoning this so-called lukewarm roson which was never credible and realistic to begin with one of the major reasons analysts say is adan's relationship with the islamist Hamas just in July he held talks with hamas's political leader isma Han in Ankara the two men have met many times over the years and Israel has accused turkey of providing a safe haven to members of the group during his more than two decades in power Edan has always been a fervent supporter of the Palestinian cause and it resonates well with many here in Turkey to this day he refuses to classify Hamas as a terrorist organization unlike most of his Western allies along with Iran and Qatar turkey is is a central actor that enables hamas's activities on an international scale you know erdogan moved systematically to essentially ensure that Hamas found office space uh diplomatic recognition and harboring of Hamas leaders and operators inside of turkey following hamas's atrocities in Israel on October 7th adwin has been trying to use his ties with the militant group to play a mediating role Turkish officials say they are negotiating the release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip but how much influence does adan's government have that remains to be seen my my own view on this would be suggest that turkey's influence with Hamas um is negligible but also turkey offering itself as a mediator between Israel and the Hamas authorities is in insincere simply because turkey's relationship with Israel is is tenuous at best the Israeli government and Israeli authorities do not trust the intentions of Arana while Pro Palestinian groups are calling for more protests in the coming days Israel has told its citizens to leave turkey immediately amid fears of reprisal attacks so let's first talk to Yulia Han she's our correspondent in Istanbul Julia what can you tell us about the protests in Turkey well turkey is a country with a predominantly Muslim population so historically there has always been a lot of solidarity with and support for the Palestinian people for their humanitarian situation their suffering and that often comes with anti-israeli sentiment um but the question is to which extent is that being used for politically for political mobilization particularly in the current uh conflict and uh the Gaza hos Hospital blasts really has uh pushed public anger here to a new level many people directly blame Israel without questioning even though the Israeli military says a failed rocket launched by islamists inside Gaza is to blame the Turkish president was also very quick to speak of an Israeli attack he has now declared three days of national mourning in support with the and solidarity with the Palestinian uh victims and for the past two nights we have seen protests outside the Israeli consulate here in Istanbul and in other Turkish cities turn violent with dozens of people injured uh during many of these protests you can also hear outspoken support for Hamas and uh the Israeli government has issued a new travel warning for turkey calling on its citizens to leave the country as soon as possible so tensions are running very high and amidst this the Turkish government has offered to mediate in the conflict between Israel and uh Hamas given what you've just told me the protests and the statements that the government's been making would the Turkish government be regarded as an honest broker as a as a fair mediator well Turkish president ad and you have to know even though he's been recently trying to mend long strained ties with Israel he has always been a fervent supporter of the Palestinian cause and he does not consider Hamas as a terrorist organization unlike most of his Western allies in the US uh the EU that being said yes he was one of the first leaders to offer mediation um there have been many diplomatic calls with regional and global leaders the Turkish government is calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and they say they are negotiating with Hamas for the release of hostages held by the islamists inside the Gaza Strip but as you just said uh analysts I spoke with have doubts uh first of all over how much influence turkey really has over Hamas uh if you compare it to for example to Qatar or Iran then of course the second big question since this conflict now is casting a huge Shadow over Turkish Israeli relations do uh the Israelis the Israeli government do they consider turkey to be an honest broker and there are doubts as as as you mentioned Julia thank you very much that was our correspondent juliaan in
