and US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Turkey as part of a diplomatic Dash across the Middle East to try and find solutions to the Israel Hamas conflict he's been meeting with his Turkish counterpart hakan fidan in Ankara the visit comes amid heated relations between Israel and Turkey with anura urging Israel to stop its attacks on Gaza and earlier blinkin made an unexpected stop in Iraq he's warned against other parties becoming embroiled in the conflict it was very important to send a very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our Personnel uh here or anywhere else in the region don't do it uh I made very clear that the attacks the threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran are totally unacceptable and we will take every necessary step to protect our people we're not looking for conflict with for Iran we've made that very clear but we'll do what's necessary uh to uh to protect our our Personnel uh be they military or civilian so let's take a closer look at blinken's trip to Turkey and speak to our correspondent Dorian Jones joining us from Istanbul adorian what do you think we can expect from blinkin during his meeting in the Turkish Capital well I think blinkin will be under a lot of pressure from his Turkish counterpart hakam fidan to press for the urgency of the ceasefire in the ongoing assault on Gaza turkey has been very much in the Forefront of demanding a ceasefire but given the fact that in despite these growing international calls Israel is stepping up its assault on the Gaza Strip the I think blink's message will be that we have to contain this conflict that's been the message throughout his tour of the Middle East importance of especially keeping Iran out of any further escalation in the conflict now turkey does have good relations with the Iranian regime Iran's foreign minister was here last week and the Iranian president is expected to pay a visit sometime this month so I think blink will be pressing on the importance of containing the conflict something he will say that this is in turkey's interest as well given the fact his economy is would be expected to be devastated by any major regional conf configeration so I think that is the main focus of talks will be to just to maintain some kind of containment of the conflict and Dorian what about relations between turkey and Israel I mean they had been patching up relations uh before Israel's war on Hamas how are things looking now well I mean they're pretty rock bottom and um yes you're right there was this raoon effort uh before the the outbreak of this latest conflict in the Middle East in fact Turkish president Reb T erdan met for the first time with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September then everyone was saying that this was a positive sign that there could be a new chapter in relations but all of that has collapsed now especially for following erdogan's statement declaring Hamas is a Liberation movement despite most of turkey's Western allies designating as a terrorist group that has saw Israel pulling out its Ambassador and turkey has retaliated over the weekend withdrawing its Ambassador although it has to be said erdan much of his language against Israel is directed at the Israeli Prime Minister himself rather than Israel saying this is a man we can no longer work with in fact he said he's written off in the minds of turkey but erdogan stressed the importance of maintaining diplomatic relations he said there isn't a severing of relations and the fact that we need to keep on talking and I think that's a sign that turkey eyes itself playing some kind of mediating role sometime in the future indeed uh how important of a role could turkey play in securing for example the release of hostages being held by Hamas well according to Ankara Turkey has been working very hard behind the scenes to secure the release of the hostages and in fact that's the front person is turkey spy chief Chief Ibraham cullin and according to erdan over the weekend he said Colin has been in talks with the Israeli count his Israeli counterparts and also with the Hamas leadership now turkey does have good relations with Hamas over the past much of its political leadership was here at some point in Turkey so turkey says it can possibly play some uh role in the release of hostages although it has to be said at the moment it doesn't appear they've made really any progress Dorian thank you very much for that DW's Dorian Jones reporting from Istanbul and we can expand on this with Boris Foreman a political science professor at Bard College Berlin uh good to see you there secretary blinkin has been wrapping up what has been a pretty grueling tour it's taken him from Israel to Jordan uh to Iraq just to name a few what do you think the main goal of this shuttle diplomacy was well I mean as you said it was a grueling tour he met a lot of State leaders um he I think has multiple goals at once one one of them obviously was to deescalate and try and contain uh the the conflict itself uh for it not to spread in the region the other goal was for there to be a pause of fighting in order for humanitarian Aid uh to be delivered and we hear also that some of the talks were about trying to think about a possible postwar regime with other state leaders now at least on one of these um the US calls for a humanitarian pause in Israel's bombardment of Gaza um that that has not been heated so far do you think Lincoln's trip can be considered a failure in that regard difficult to tell I mean as we just uh saw I mean there there are multiple objectives some of them might have been more successful some less some of them we don't even know because a lot is going on behind the scenes a lot of the discussions are not public um well the the conflict at least hasn't spread beyond the borders of Israel and and the pales inian regions yet but um yeah it's a very difficult situation and uh I guess we need more time to be able to to Really assess if this trip was a success or not look it's a very limited success I would say Okay limit limited success looking at America's uh role in the region I mean how how useful of a uh Power can they be in trying to achieve these goals do you think there's a certain message that the US is trying to send uh just by the fact that lincol is there uh on this shuttle diplomacy yeah I mean I think this is an important point if we zoom out from this conflict immediately we are noticing that the liberal order that has been stable at least for the well let's say last 20 years but we could even say since the post World War II order uh started in 45 uh and now is certainly crumbling and we see many different conflicts in many different places and I think we have to situate this conflict which of course has important an internal Dynamics into this broader context and so what we're seeing is an attempt by the US also to signal that it's still an important or the important uh hegemonic uh state in the International System but we are seeing that it's losing some of its Cloud also in the way that it can only partially influence the Israeli government and we are seeing a rebalancing of the International System thank you so much for sharing your insights that's uh Boris Foreman from Bard College Berlin really appreciate
