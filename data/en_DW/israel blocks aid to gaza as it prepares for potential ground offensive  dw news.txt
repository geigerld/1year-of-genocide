been devastating to the densely populated territory as concerns of a humanitarian crisis grow Agony fills the air these people are desperately looking for survivors while pulling bodies out of the Rubble dawn has brought the site of new destruction to Gaza with entire blocks raised by overnight strikes the houses of my family my neighbors and mine were hit I came out of the house to find my children injured the whole Square was completely destroyed these are children children they show no mercy the Palestinian territory one of the most crowded places on Earth has been under siege since Saturday in a near constant bombardment Israel says its hitting targets linked to the terrorist group Hamas in retaliation for its attacks over the weekend that killed more than a thousand people the Army has deployed tens of thousands of troops to the Border As It prepares for a ground offensive the pressure is steadily Rising so far the entry of food water fuel and Medicine into Gaza has been halted increasing concerns about a humanitarian crisis Jordan has sent its first aid package to Gaza but Israel's energy Minister says there will be no break to The Siege until the dozens of hostages held by Hamas are freed humanitarian Aid to Gaza no electrical switch will be lifted no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home humanitarian for humanitarian and nobody should preach us morals as the situation escalates diplomats are seeking to stop the spiral of violence and the release of the hostages held in Gaza we can now speak to uh hm baloa journalist based in Gaza he joins us on the phone uh just tell us what's the situation there um what's happening right now where you are um it's it's very hard um terrifying um um the the bombardment is um continuing since early morning overnight um today there was like um a places were intensively uh targeted more than other places um the main two areas uh called Alama in the northern of Gaza City um andat area attached to it um many areas where um had as well but this one was one of the the most intensive one many buildings reported uh were destroyed um there was a strike in the beach camp um and some people were killed while they were in in in the house um situation in general is very um is very hard very people don't know um uh what to do where to go um there's no electricity uh since yesterday complete FL out power is is shut the two sources of electricity is out of service um the the telephone um the telephone services is very limited it keeps cut um most of the places have no internet connection the water supply was affected um many people who don't have drinking water or clean water for washing um it's it's the ra Crossing is still closed and people are not able to leave um in case they want to um sometimes there is way the Army is telling people to evacuate area in order to to attack it sometimes today they were they dropped leaflets on um on certain areas that they want the people to leave it some people go to Ana schools honora is talking about over 200,000 people uh taking honora schools at shelters um um with very limited sources there um the Ministry of Health in Gaza hospitals are in in at risk as well they I'm afraid I have to cut you off here because we're running out of time time thank you very much the journalist hen Bala there in Gaza for us who speak to again to you in the next hour and earlier I spoke with Abraham Berg he is a former speaker of the Israeli Parliament and a vocal critic of prime minister Netanyahu and his policies and I asked him if he were still speaker would he support netanyahu's new wartime Unity government that's a very petty little political question because it's not about who sits around the table but what is the end game what is the strategy it looks now that the strategy of Israel is anger and revenge and I do not support neither anger nor Revenge as a political advisor yes there is a lot of soreness in this Society there is not even one home that doesn't know somebody didn't lose somebody didn't lost somebody have people host kept hostages in Gaza and the sorrow is is so deep and so profound yet it does not justify all means going after the leaders of Hamas and the soldier of Hamas it's a legitimate Target going against an innocent population in masses in a kind of a collective punishment the answer is no so whether I am a simple civilian like I am today or a political leader like I used to be my value system is the same enemies are to be F and innocent people are to be engaged with the process of Peace but if the government does not have second part it does not have a legitimacy for the first part now the language coming from Israel at the moment to crush and eliminate Hamas are you behind that or not listen language is very important because it's a mirror it's a reflection of the Soul a lot of what I know about Israel today is not coming through the Israeli media it comes through the Fantastic media report and journalism report done by Foreign agencies like your amazing Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem that through her reports I know what happens couple of kilometers away from my home and when I see the pictures my blood boils but when I listen to the language I cannot accept it I do not accept any human beings defined as an animal nobody is an animal because if my enemy is defined as an animal it is as if a relief an excuse from responsibility and I say no these are human beings with evil Behavior with awful upcoming uh upbringing that I have to address them as the worst expression of humanity and I have to to admire the other voices which are not like them and address them as the peak of humanity but nobody should be addressed as animal as un or menion because this kind of language is not a one that either describes the reality or help us to move onwards Mr bur you you said earlier that you do not support the the strategy currently being being taken by Israel like the what some call The Siege of Gaza what is then the alternative for that what will would be a valid strategy uh in in your opinion first there is no strategy there is only very aggressive and very violent tactics go after them kill them it is as if to satisfy the political base or at least to restore some International Macho position and I do not believe that's a real strategy a real strategy should be actually one that is divided into three elements the first one is yes to put down as as much as possible active Hamas militant individuals the second is to engage those Palestinian either peace peace lovers or people who are committed to the political process be them in romala and even hundreds of thousands of them in Gaza to engage them politically speaking and publicly speaking into a different process between Israel and the Palestinian real and the Palestinian people people and the third is the International Community only a coalition which goes from Egypt and Jordan the Abraham Accord countries the Emirates Morocco Saudi Arabia now United States of America and the European Union only them together to come and enforce the sides to sit down together and actually put down swords and raise up alternative political systems so it's in International involvement separation between bad people and good people and a political process uh let's change the subject ever so slightly do you think this war could have been prevented and or could have been foreseen this is the kind of wisdom that I always have the facto the jury it's a bit more difficult but a put it as follows two kinds of shortcomings of my government made it possible not made it responsible but made it possible the first is the fact that constantly for years now Netanyahu is under his leadership though I do not think he's a real leader I think he's being led by his own personal uh criminal agenda but through his so-called leaders ERS ship preferred the Hamas over the Palestinian Authority and he actually nourished this Hamas people in order not to negotiate with the PLO people with the Palestinian Authority people because dealing with the Palestinians who are the politically elected or appointed or selected or recognized Palestinian Representatives means a Palestinian State and this is something that he didn't like so he preferred the extremist of the moderate and now his investment pays back so painfully the second is Netanyahu is frightened to death from his political base which are the settlers and mainly the aggressive religious fanatic settlers in the West Bank and he abandoned all the Israelis around Gaza and he abandoned all the other Israelis in order to save his sacred settlers in the greater land of Israel in in the West Bank and take these two together prioritizing the settlements and negotiating and promoting Hamas makes him very responsible it could have been prevented if Israel for the last generation and most of this political generation was under the prime ministership of Netanyahu would have built a very viable Palestinian alternative which is not religiously Zealot which is not fundamentally fanatic and the fact that we do not have this alternative is actually the blood on the hands of the Prime Minister though we have to remember that the real killers and the real villains here are this malicious diabolic barbarians that committed the you the atrocities of the last weekend I remember thank you so much for your time thank you very much the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United States stands with Israel as it reels from Hamas Terror attacks during his visit to Israel blinkin has also been meeting with survivors of the attacks and families of Israelis who are being held hostage by Hamas he says the US is working to secure their release blinkin described Hamas attacks as depravity in the worst possible way he will travel to Jordan tomorrow where he is scheduled to meet with the Palestinian Authority president Sami Sak is a freelance journalist he joins us from Jerusalem Sami what more can you tell us about Anthony blinken's visit today yeah well this was a very emotional visit the kind of visit that the Israelis very much expected to hear uh we know that he was shown pictures of babies who were killed in in in one of the kibot inside Israel I must say that that Hamas today has announced that they're not Behind These atrocities and that maybe someone else was there but in any event what we heard from blinkin is reiterating the Israel position equating Hamas with evil with ISIS he was talking about the Holocaust he was talking about prrs and and and and this is the kind of things that Israel wants to hear now especially as it's preparing the public and the and the International Community ahead of this campaign that we're expecting to see and that is ongoing um blink's visit is a show a display of the presence of The Americans in the region and we're also seeing these other visits in the in this area the meeting with the with the qataris not only is he dedicated to help and assist and release the the hostages but it's showing all the players in the region that the United States are are here and they and they're going to play an active role in this coming period now prime minister netan who also just spoke in the knesset how close is Israel get getting to a ground offensive into Gaza yes exactly in the keset uh there swearing in a new cabinet uh with the entrance of Benny Gans who was the chief of staff and he will be in this small War cabinet uh this is in order to have a leadership that the Israeli public will trust and uh so is to kind of kind of break the opposition it's true that the uh head of the uh opposition party ID refused to join this government but nevertheless the entrance of guns this is the kind of thing that is preparing uh the public and what we hear is that this campaign is going to last for months uh we hear that this going to be a major campaign inside the Gaza Strip where they will go from house to house they will be destroying the tunnels they will dissect the Gaza Strip I mean this is the kind of scenarios that you hear in the Israeli media from military experts and the Israelis know that they will also have to pay a price during this campaign Sami Sak there in Jerusalem for us thank you very much blink's words come as the UN says nearly 340,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Gaza with fears of a humanitarian crisis growing as Israel continues to launch air strikes on the territory Israel says its hitting Hamas after its unprecedented attacks over the weekend that killed at least 1200 people in Israel meanwhile Palestinian authorities in Gaza say more than 14400 people have been killed by Israeli strikes here's what Netanyahu and blinkin had to say President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil Kamas is Isis and just as Isis was crushed so too will Kamas be crushed and Hamas should be treated exactly the way Isis was treated they should be spit out from the community of Nations no leader should meet them no country should Harbor them and those that do should be friend I say to you I say to all of us there will be many difficult days ahead you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but as long as America exists you will never ever have to we will always be there by your side Israel has the right indeed the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again as the Prime Minister and I discussed how Israel does this matters we democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard even when it's difficult and holding ourselves to account when we fall short our Humanity the value that we place on human life and human dignity that's what makes us who we are and we count them among our greatest strength that's why it's so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians and that's why we mourn the loss of every innocent life civilians of every Faith every nationality who've been killed and we are currently waiting on another press statement by Anthony blink and we'll bring you that live as soon as it happens but first earlier I asked the W senior International correspondent fun faar about the message that blinkin is bringing to Israel basically that the US stands side by side with Israel US Secretary US Secretary of State blink there saying that basically Israel has the backing as long as it's necessary H as long as in fact the United States exists he said now while he reiter ating what he already said before embarking on this mle e stour people are of course wondering what that actually means in terms of the next steps forward in this War what was also important though in that statement that we just heard there that blink also emphasized the value of Civilian lives so by that indirectly appealing to Israel as well to show some restraint when it comes to basically bombing a Gaza what is happening right now as we are speaking so people there Palestinians ordinary citizens are fleeing basically for safety but where to go it's such a densely populated area Gaza Strip and also uh there's no way out in fact there's a lot of conflict conflicting information whether that very important rough border between Egypt and Gaza is going to be opened for civilians to be able to leave and if not to actually just at least make it possible that Aid can come in so while there's of course this very strong rhetoric here by Mr blinkin and as we're speaking he's actually speaking to to Israelis who are trying to deliver some Aid to those who are displaced within Israel because of the conflict people wonder what his presence in Israel is going to have uh in terms of a consequence beat for uh the potential release of uh those hostages being held captive since Saturday since Hamas uh militant Hamas has Unleashed its terroristic attack on Saturday but also when it comes to Gaza what kind of action is going to be undertaken to make sure that that civilian life that Mr blinkin is pointing out on both sides in this conflict that civilian life is being protected uh fun blink will also go to Jordan what does he want to achieve there basically he wants to make sure that the presence of the United States being here in Israel H and and the Diplomatic tour that is to follow because he's not just only going to meet the uh leader of Jordan but also the leader of the Palestinian territories of the Palestinian Authority Mr Abbas so what he's trying to do is make sure that actually all the Diplomatic attempts that were that the US was pushing for prior to all of this on Saturday are not going to fall back to square one namely for example the United States was pushing a lot for some sort of a a warming up of ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel now that of course is in Jeopardy as uh Israel is bombing Gaza and by that of course uh many people in the Arab world are wondering whether that actually makes sense that there is a a a tie to be forged between Saudi Arabia and Israel so what blinkin is trying to do here is showing to the world that the US has a very important diplomatic standing when it comes to mediate this conflict while at the same time of course we do not now know how Iran for example is going to react to this h a physical presence as well to of the United States uh represented by Mr blink in Israel and how the war as such is going to continue against Gaza funny fa there reporting from Jerusalem thank you
