in a strike on Monday but provided no further detail Lebanese security sources said he was a member of hezbollah's Elite radwan Force and that he died in an attack on a vehicle in the Southern Village of Ketel near the border with Israel this is the second high-profile killing in Lebanon in 2024 to be blamed on Israel last week hamas's Deputy leader Salah aruri was killed in a blast in a Beirut suburb and we can join the DW correspondent abas alali who who's in the Lebanese Capital Beirut uh welcome tell us more about hezbollah's reaction to the killing of wisam Hassan Al good morning hisbah him yesterday called him Commander Alta became member of the Islamic resistance since 1989 hisbah posted photos on its own website of Al with leaders including Secretary General s Hassan nasah and Imad M its military commander who was killed in Syria in 2008 another photo showed him sitting next to the former leader of the Iranian Al Force kasim sumani who was killed by a us drone strike in Baghdad for years ago was a commander in hisbah Elite radan forces and the most senior hisbah Commander killed so far in the conflict right now Israel hasn't commented on this strike but why would it be interested in eliminating hisbah leaders Hezbollah stating from the beginning that it's goal to alleviate pressure on Gaza and Witham being one of the leaders in hisbah responsible for the operations in the South yesterday a senior Source in libanon said he played a leading role in directing its operations in the South right so how would his elimination affect the the war in Gaza look there are many developments happened since two months top commander in Ran Force killed in late November the top Irani Commander R Musa was killed in Syria salahi Deputy head of the Hamas political per was killed last week in Beirut the targeting of commanders and leaders of hisbah and its Al can lead to exacerbate the situation along the southern border of leanon and the fears of further escalation is existing here in Beirut and Lebanon but one of the security sources in Lebanon said about the strike yesterday this is a very painful strike and another one say things will flare up so we don't know what will happen the next hours on or or days uh you know that um the people here are looking for a peace and uh the situation is very critical right and so How likely then we just just pick up that point about escalation because that's what everyone is looking at um How likely is that to inflame what is going on and and escalate the the conflict in the region um you know it's depend on the both side on isra and hisbah the possibility to escalate the situ is here but it's one of the newspaper uh Lebanese newspaper wrote today it's look like a race between war and diplomacy uh the officials here in libanon they try to do the best to Des escalate the situation and depending on the diplomacy till now okay thank you for that DW correspondent abas alali in Beirut you you're welcome you're welcome US Secretary of State Anthony blinken is in Israel as part of a week-long diplomatic tour aimed at trying to prevent an escalation of the war in Gaza he arrived in Tel Aviv late on Monday he's due to meet Israel's president isak Herzog before meeting prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his War cabinet Mr blinken's expected to push Israel to do more to protect civilian lives as it fights Hamas which the Us and other countries have classified as a terrorist organization the US also wants more aid for the people of Gaza secretary blinkin spoke to reporters in Saudi Arabia before boarding his plane to Israel I'll have an opportunity to share with Israeli leaders everything I've heard thus far uh on this trip and also to talk to them uh about the future direction of their military campaign in Gaza uh I will press on the absolute imperative to do more to protect civilians and to do more to make sure that humanitarian assistance is getting into the hands of those who need it our special correspondent a Ibrahim joins us from Jerusalem welcome a um how is Israel likely to view Anthony blinken's visit well it is his fourth visit to the region since October uh 7th and before coming here to Israel the Secretary of State uh has had a tour of the region where he has listened to the concerns of uh Arab leaders about the ongoing War uh in in Gaza um he will likely be trying to bring uh the message that the that the Biden Administration has been echoing for the past weeks that Israel needs to um pay more attention to civilian life in its conduct uh of the war there will also be discussions about the proverbial day after uh the war we've seen in the past uh two weeks or so different ideas coming from different ministers within the Israeli cabinet no official policy yet about what should happen in Gaza after the war uh but we have seen the defense minister lay out uh plans that include uh no civilian uh presence in the strip whereas the Finance Minister and uh um the uh National Security ministers have said that they want to see The Return of Israeli settlements uh uh to the strip so it's going to be a tall order on his uh uh visit discussing a combination between the what should happen in the war but also bringing the wishes of the region to Israeli leaders as to what should happen after the war as well right and and despite being Israel's biggest backer you you you touched on the significant disagreements that there have been between these two allies um how much influence does the US have on Israel that's correct the US Israel's biggest Becker is so one would think that if anybody has an influence on Israeli leadership it would be the United uh States uh the but Israeli leadership has says that they will conduct this War uh the way that they see fit uh to achieve their uh sort of professed goals from uh the war H at the same time uh we have heard President Biden uh for example say that he has been quietly trying to get uh Israel to significantly reduce its presence uh in the strip and there are signs even from Israeli leadership now that the strategy the military strategy within the strip is uh changing uh that in the northern part uh the IDF will be focusing on raids and the destruction of tunnels while uh targeting Hamas leadership in the South now this doesn't really you know necessarily give any comfort to the civilians in the Gaza Strip most of which are now crammed in the South and we've seen how in precise Israeli strikes be in targeting Hamas leadership often times taking um you know large numbers of casualties so-called uh collateral damage in the targeting of this of Hamas leaders okay thank you for that a a Ibrahim in
