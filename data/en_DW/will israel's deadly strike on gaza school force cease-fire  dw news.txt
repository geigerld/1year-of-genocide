senior EU officials have joined a growing chorus of condemnation after an Israeli air strike on a School Compound killed dozens in Gaza City the eu's top Diplomat Joseph Burell expressed his horror at the attack which gazan officials say killed more than 90 people Sheltering in the school Egypt and Qatar are demanding an urgent investigation and the US has said it's quote deeply concerned about the strike Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas uses schools as cover in the wake of the October 7th Terror attacks tabin School reduced to ruins after an Israel air strike in Gaza according to an official from gaza's Hamas run government around 6,000 displaced people were seeking shelter in the compound at the time Witnesses say the school came under attack while people were offering Dawn prayers Israel as usual didn't give a warning it strikes regardless of whether they're children women young or older adults these were peaceful people in the mosque people were praying washing some were sleeping upstairs including children women and older people the Missile hit them without any warning first one missile then another one we recovered them as body parts the Israeli military has confirmed the strike saying it hit a Hamas command and control center embedded within the site it says numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians many of the casualties were rushed to Gaza City's Al Ali hospital they dropped a missile on them while they were just [Music] praying fear God people fear God Arabs fear God the strike comes at a time when mediators Egypt Qatar and Saudi Arabia are pushing to resume ceasefire talks but Egypt's foreign Ministry says that quote the deliberate killing of Gaza civilians shows Israel has no intention of ending the war let's hear now from Laura blumenfield a Middle East analyst best-selling author and former senior policy advisor at the US state department where she focused on the Middle East peace process welcome to DW news now how does the US reconcile its stated deep concern for the welfare of Gaza and civilians with its ongoing military support for Israel uh a deep concern indeed I mean this is one of these examples where the law of unintended consequences in war uh created some just disastrous consequences um you know as as the White House said today although we understand and recognize that Israel needs to Target terrorists um that they're deeply concerned um and that Israel needs to take more precautions to protect civilians from the American point of view what they're using this for hopefully is to kind of give some more momentum for the uh ceasefire hostage deal that it kind of underscores the urgency it's kind of a Now or Never time which is we're hoping to have a kind of diplomatic train of representatives from the United States uh with this August 15th date set for this week uh to finally bring the table the parties to the table and reach agreement but when it comes to putting pressure on Israel has the US lost its opportunity now to to to push Israel to changing course in a very sad and tragic way today's event gives the United States additional leverage and pressure because while the there is this tragedy that took place this morning in Gaza there's another disaster looming on their northern border with Hezbollah uh you know the Israel understands that they need the United States to back them up right now while they're standing and bracing for retaliatory taxmen both Iran and hisbah they're heavily dependent on the United States for weapons and other assets intelligence so what in the best case scenario uh this morning's event can do is to create some kind of momentum and an incentive for the United States to say to Israel look we need some concessions from you to reach that ceasefire in Gaza you need us more in fact than we need you at this point and Netanyahu it's time to seal the deal that's the best case scenario but do you think the Israeli government is interested in a ceasefire agreement at this stage um it's fascinating they they they would welcome a kind of Hostage release right and security and the question until now has been you can't have both Netanyahu has been saying you know we must pursue uh this war to the very end um and we can't stop short of and agree to a hostage deal if that limits us what we're looking at now is potentially ironically or interestingly these hostages which are held in captivity do hold the key to unlock the region to peace because if you do have that ceasefire deal Iran will back off you heard the Iran's representative to the UN saying we don't want to stand in the way of a ceasefire deal so perhaps Iran will back off from its retaliatory strike hisbah I don't know if we can stop that train but it's our best chance um and of course the war with Hamas would at least come to a pause if not a final resolution so there is this very fragile moment and by the time we finish this interview it could be blown there could be a preemptive strike by Israel in the north of heala then all bets are off but for the moment anyway my fingers are crossed uh President Biden says he wants the war to end by the time he leaves office I mean considering for example the US has just uh you know provided this support this military Fresh Military supports to Israel is that kind of uh dream realistic I think either way whoever takes office in January is impatient for for former president Trump if he becomes president his sort of message to the israelies is finish up and win right he likes winners not losers he doesn't like this idea of a kind of a wishy-washy Netanyahu he likes somebody's strong and decisive and in control and then the same thing for the Harris campaign it's slightly different they're saying you know we set down this red line in Rafa months ago that turned out to be our Finish Line we would like it to end without the kind of pressure for this absolute Victory take the win you've accomplished enough it's time to move forward so I think either way there's an impatience in Washington with Israel and Netanyahu realizes that which is why these kind of final string of assaults somebody asked me are these in basketball terms are these warm-up shots or are they buzzer beaters before a game over and I think and I believe that the reason why the Israelis have have been this kind of Blitz of assassinations is they're sensing that this is their last chance you know go big and then go home okay Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld thank you for your insights thank you
