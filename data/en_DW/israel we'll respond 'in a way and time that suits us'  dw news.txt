Israel is weighing up its response to Iran after it fired hundreds of missiles and drones at the country over the weekend as world leaders call for restraint Israel's war cabinet met without announcing any definite course of action but said it would respond at a time and in a manner of its choosing Iran says its assault was an act of self-defense after several of its generals were killed earlier this month in an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria a crater left by Iran's aerial attack Israel's military says this Desert Air Base sustained only minor damage Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles Israel and its allies shot down nearly all of them despite Decades of intense enmity this was Iran's First Direct attack on Israel while War leaders call for calm and restrained Israel's president says options are open this is like a real war um I mean this is a declaration of war not not because we are restrained and because we know the repercussions and because we have deliberations with our partners we are considering all options and I'm quite confident that we will take the necessary steps that are necessary to protect and defend our people we are not war Seekers I think I would leave it at that the US says it will support Israel's defense but it will not take part in any military retaliation against Iran it's going to be up to the Israelis to decide uh what what the next step is here I would just say this President Biden since the beginning of this conflict has worked very hard to keep this from becoming a broader Regional War Israel's war cabinet met without announcing any decision as the world waits to see what comes next let's go over to Jerusalem for our DW correspondent Tanya ker the Israeli War cabinet agreed upon retaliation not about scale or timing what else can you tell us well I mean usually these decisions in this smaller War cabinet are not publicized but you can imagine this is also of course on everybody mind here uh in the country how Israel will retaliate to this massive strike that came for the first time directly uh from uh Iran now from what is discussed here in the cabinet uh in the farri cabinet is some of the voices are of course louder we heard from some far-right cabinet members there should be a strike that is will be remembered for generations to come uh others are more um measured so some say they could be uh you know a strike that's being used against Iran's nuclear facilities that has been of course uh um between the two countries for for many years uh a sticking point but also others say there might be a measured response because Israel needs uh the uh international support uh for such a strike and uh as we just heard this is not uh really given but in any case uh Iran has said uh they see this uh as a rep strike uh what they did on Saturday night um for the attack on the Iranian compat in Damascus they see this as completed but they have also said uh that uh basically if Israel will strike back there will be an e an even harsher strike back on Israel what would Israel gain from a response I think it's all about deterrence and Israel had said even before uh this reprisal strike by Iran uh that they will strike back in particular uh if this uh strike would come directly uh from Iran and not just through its proxies uh such as Hezbollah from Southern Lebanon or from the houthis in Yemen or uh militias uh in Iraq and of course I mean for a few years now um you know there has been this a shadow war between uh Israel and Iran over its nuclear Iran's nuclear activities but this is now uh out in the open and that is seen here also uh as a new uh equation now um as I said the Iranians said at least on a diplomatic level that they see this as completed but there's a lot of pressure here also domestically for Israel to respond to that as far as international support goes though uh the US has said uh it wouldn't help uh Israel in hitting back well I mean we've been hearing uh from especially from the United States uh that were very much involved as they said after you know uh shooting down all these uh these massive amount of drones and and missiles that were directed and launched at Israel uh Saturday night uh that they don't want to see uh a wider conflict they actually urged uh uh the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call with US President Joe Biden early on Sunday morning here local time that they should see this as a success that most of the uh um missiles and drones were actually uh shot down there was a real active defense Shield they don't want to see this are developing into a wider regional conflict they also have of course especially the United States they have assets here in the region they have their own interest but also the other countries here in the region they want to see they don't want to see see this becoming a wider regional conflict Tanya thank you very much for bringing us the latest from Jerusalem at a United Nations emergency meeting called to discuss Iran's attack on Israel both Israel and Iran accused the other of being the main threat to peace in the Middle East they accused fellow UN members of ignoring the threat that the other posed to its security un Chief Antonio gues called for restraint [Music] a verbal Showdown following a night of drone and missile attacks ambassadors from Iran and Israel faced off at the United Nations gues for his briefing Iran's Envoy Justified the assault as retaliation for a strike on its Consulate in Syria which it blames on Israel faced with such circumstances the Islamic Republic of Iran had no choice but to exercise its inherent right to self-defense under international law Israel called on the UN to impose all possible sanctions on Iran this attack crossed every red line and Israel reserves the legal right to retaliate the Middle East is on the brink the people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating fullscale conflict now is the time to diffuse and deescalate now is the time for maximum restraint the UN Chief is not alone in urging restraint Jordan was in the flight path of the wave of Iranian missiles and drones and downed some of them King Abdullah told us President Joe Biden that any further action by Israel would widen the conflict in the region the US and allies including the UK and France also helped Israel fend off Iran's attack at a G7 video meeting the focus was on condemning Iran and containing the conflict Iran's actions risk provoking an uncontrollable Regional escalation and this has to be avoided we will continue to work to stabilize the situation we call on Iran and its proxies to see completely the attacks all parties should exercise maximum restraints We Stand by the security of Israel and The Wider region which is of course important for our security here at home too what we now need is for calm heads to Prevail Israel says it has not lost sight of its objectives in Gaza that imperative and pressure from its allies May yet be enough to persuade its leaders to hold back Mike Martin is a war studies senior fellow at King's College London Israel says this is not over in terms of a military response what are its options uh so I mean we can look at history here and see what the Israelis have done in recent history so they've got a very potent uh cyber offensive capability and we've seen that used a couple of times particularly against the Israeli the Iranian nuclear program and then of course as we saw with the attack on the consulate the Israeli Air Force is able to strike targets deep with inside other countries so Israel has got a number of military options that it could choose to use what sort of targets otherwise besides consulates uh could Israel be considering so at at the moment we're in a situation where both Iran and America have said that they consider the matter closed they don't think that there should be any further strikes Israel should you know draw a line under that um and so Israel if it's sensible will try to keep its response well within what the Americans would consider uh part of their foreign policy so I would expect that any potential Israeli strikes would be confined to Iran nuclear program and the reason for that is because that's well within American foreign policy so even though the Americans have said they don't support any further strikes it is hard for them to really go overboard and criticize Israel providing it keeps its response limited to the nuclear program and also a limited response because Israel would have to go It Alone absolutely and as we saw in the attacks on Saturday night uh a large part of the work of Defending Israel was actually done by the US Air Force in Jordanian airspace and it's not just you know we saw something extraordinary on Saturday which was the jordanians the Saudi Arabians and other Arab allies supporting Israel against Iran and Israel risks fracturing not just its relationship with America but perhaps more importantly its relationships with some of its Arab neighbors and so there is a a limited degree to which it could strike targets say within Iran it's much more likely to go uh if it can against some of those proxy targets but Mike bring this into perspective for our viewers given the minimal destruction caused by the attack was Iran trying to cause real damage I don't think so no I I think uh it was a massed Air Attack it was designed um to uh demonstrate Iranian capab ability and none of the things that we saw whether it was the drones or the cruise missiles were particularly new technologies um in addition Iran signaled several days in advance that it was going to respond and and that there would be an attack coming both to the Americans through the Turks and also directly to Israel and I I think if Iran had wanted to be successful we can look at some of the other attacks that it's conducted against say facilities in Saudi Arabia and they were successful and so I I think that Iran was very clearly trying to make the point that it could respond it did respond but as it said now immediately releasing a statement afterwards saying we now consider that the matter is closed so Mike are there winners or losers after this weekend I I don't if I may I don't think that's the right way to look at this um this is a 203 year um confrontation and it's akin to a game of chess um on Saturday Israel responded uh sorry Iran responded it demonstrated its intent it also gathered a lot of intelligence um on American and Israeli capabilities but equally it now risks an Israeli response which which you know could be very damaging for Iran because as we've seen from the media World opinion tends to Rally around Israel it's totally shifted The Narrative from what was happening in Gaza um to now being about Israel being under attack so really it's very hard to say at this point and you know we won't be able to know uh for several weeks or months exactly how this is going to play out for years Israeli officials have argued the way to contain Iran was by brute force does that need a rethink um I I think what's changed is there was before October 7th the these terrible attacks by Hamas there was more of a conversation within Israel about exactly how to respond there was obviously the nuclear deal and you know Netanyahu has always been very Hardline in arguing that they need to use military strikes but there have been other voices and I think what's changed since October the 7th is those other voices are much quieter and within the Israeli leadership and in the Israeli cabinet you know the far-right members of the Israeli War cabinet there is a much stronger uh more united voice arguing that actually war is the only way to deal with this but it as with all wars they're unpredictable and when you start them you don't know how they're going to finish and so whilst they may be pushing and arguing for war and I think that is what the Israeli leadership is doing at the moment you can see the reports of the Israeli cabinet discussions um I would urge caution because you never know how Wars are going to finish once you start them military expert Mike Martin thank you very much for chiming in great to have you on the show again thank you let's talk about that with journalist Kristen helber and an expert on the Middle East Christen great to see you again uh tell me first of all uh more about Benny gun a member of the war cabinet uh he has said that Israel will exact a price from Iran in a way and time that suits Israel what does that mean for you I think they themselves still don't know you have the radical cabinet members that we just heard there asking for a fierce response at the same time you have the whole International Community asking Israel for restraint so what could be possible is that Israel does more of the same that they have been done for the last few years which is attacking revolutionary guards uh commanders Hamas commanders even outside Israel it could be maybe limited attacks on nuclear facilities within Iran not threatening the sheer existence of the Irani regime because this would take us to another level but this is all not sure for now they are discussing it and that's a good sign they are considering what to do um and what do you think about the position of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu right now considering the international pressure the domestic pressure as well actually prime minister nany would have three reasons or motives to widen this war because first of all he wants to reassure the support of the International Community which has worked out already he wanted the US to get back by the side of Israel and this has worked out at the same time there have been long uh term plans within this radical right-wing government to blow or to to deal a major blow to its enemies in the region hisbah and the Iranian regime so they could consider this the best moment to do so because now having the solidarity of the International Community to go for this major blow and to escalate the war and the third motive obviously is to distract from its own failure in Gaza where he could not deliver and he could not reach the two AIMS in this war even after more than six uh months which means to finish off with Hamas on a military level and to uh get the hostages back so it's a failure and he's distracting by escalating with Iran this could be his uh idea uh so limited uh retaliation so many political motives here at play but uh what about the risks is there a real risk right now of things getting out of control I think the risk is very much if Israel decides to strike a blow that Iran would consider to be existential because Iran has made it very clear that we have an equation now and that whatever Israel does to Iran Iran will answer and Iran has also made clear let clear that it is ready to move from the role of a string puller or a mastermind behind attacks using its proxies in the region to uh become a direct participant in the war this has been shown with this attack on Saturday so this is a dangerous Gamble and I think Netanyahu would be wiser to go also for a diplomatic response and to listen very carefully to what his us partner is telling him and it's the first uh direct attack from Iran on Israel it's something most people were expecting many countries had warned of I mean people there were Travel warnings out and uh it was pretty much clear that this was going to happen but not in what scale um tell me more about what's going on in Iran right now as far as this response is concerned Iran had to reate for the April 1 attack and Ayatollah ham the religious leader of Iran had made it very clear that he considers this attack on The Diplomatic compound in Damascus an attack on territory on Iranian territory so it's very logical to react in the sense that you know to have this massive response in the sense that this is the first time that from Iranian soil these missiles and drones were uh launched and at the same time not only launch slow flying drones but at the same time missiles to show their own force and um at the same time to have a limited reaction by its allies hisbah from Lebanon the houthis from Yemen they were taking part but on a limited SC so this is just to show everything that is possible from an Iranian perspective without really going for a full escalation because the whole message is here that we have a massive response but it's under control we didn't want to you know cause major harm they didn't do this to show that they are not interested in a full-blown war with Israel or the us but is Iran in control of its proxies well it's not that easy it's not that every attack that hisb launches is uh you know that it's being coordinated in Taran but there is a very strong coordination and hisbah is the life insurance of the Iranian regime so in case there is full out War being launched on a further escalation from the Israeli side this will be the response to have hisbah answer with their 150,000 rockets that could fly over Israel and this would uh put Israel in a very dire and very difficult situation to answer even with its high technology um um yes uh that we have just seen at place are there some positives in all of this are there positives as as far as the war in Gaza goes well there are voices in Israel that are saying that this would be a chance for Israel to build on that security support that they have just gained to go back and talk to its allies to take Serious what these allies have been saying and I would argue that any deescalation in this uh war between Israel and Iran starts in Gaza you know it has to start with the ceasefire in Gaza it has to start with the release of hostages and this is what president President Biden tries to tell netan to say let's declare Victory with Iran and go back and solve the problem with the Palestinians because what what the West should not do is fall for this Narrative of the Israeli government that had it has been displaced for years saying that you know forget about the Palestinians we are in control of the Palestinian meds isra Iran is the major threat troop please just help us to F of Iran this is short sided because it all comes in one big package and so the escalation starts in Gaza what else do we need then from the International Community very clear words at the moment everyone treading carefully what do the next steps need to be though I think the G7 has made it clear uh that there need to be some diplomatic responses there need to be a strong and harsh condemnation towards Iran this has been shown I mean Israel was uh had received all the support and Iran seems to be internationally isolated the EU considers to designate the Iranian revolutionary guards as a terrorist organization which the US has already done so in 2019 which would be one step um to you know further pressure the Iranian regime but at the same time it should keep the Diplomatic channels open it should talk to the regime the regime in tan is not interested in a direct confrontation we should take the serious and we should go back and really look for a way out in Gaza get the hostages out ceas fire and improve the humanitarian situation for the people in Gaza that have been neglected for at least two days now nobody's talking about their situation and their hunger their hunger Christen h back thank you very much for giving us the bigger picture and bringing in all those strands in a very complicated story
