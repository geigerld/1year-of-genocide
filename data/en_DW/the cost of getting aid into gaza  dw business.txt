the UN has warned that severe fuel shortages May force it to stop delivering food supplies to civilians in Gaza Israel has refused to allow gasoline into the territory saying it would fall into the hands of Hamas the UN is also calling for significantly more Aid deliveries a first Convoy of 200 trucks crossed from Egypt into the territory last weekend but UNICEF says at least that many trucks is needed every day around 450 per day were being allowed in prior to hamas's attack on Israel earlier this month well we can now speak to Tomaso delonga from the International Federation of Red Cross and red crescent societies thanks a lot for being with us on DW business I think it'd be good to just start off by understanding how the red crescent funds its relief efforts in Gaza where that money comes from what it's relying on as sources for that yeah thanks a lot for having me today well um there are different uh streams of funding so of course as International Federation of Ross and recent usually we are in typically in every emergency response we are supporting our National Society in this case the MAV VI in Israel and the Palestine recent in Palestine so there are um funding that mainly we are calling through the emergency appeals so we had a we called for a regional Appeal on neighboring countries which is uh uh we appeal for 30 million Swiss frank and then we have a different we have a second tool that we are using in this kind of emergencies which is the uh disaster relief emergency fund which is mainly a very quick way to transfer fun to to our National Society and in this case we transfer 1 million Swiss frank each National Society to respond to the first needs right after the beginning of the conflict and in terms of Gaza is there enough of that money coming in well of course I mean as we all know the situation in Gaza it's it's catastrophic for different reason I don't think that it's just a matter of money the the the Gaza Strip is sealed uh only only some trucks are entering in Gaza so of course needs are enormous and it's not enough of what is happening at the moment what we do hope is that we will be able to transfer humanitarian to bring humanitarian Aid inside the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and together with this we will also able to found raise more and give more funds to pales Crescent in this case obviously you need the funds but you also need to be able to get hold of the resources that you buy with those funds how easy is that at the moment in the situation that that's taking place around there uh it's very complicated it's clear that I mean usually typically we also work through the local markets or Buy in the local markets also to help local communities after a disaster let's say any emergency of course in this situation is not possible because Gaza Strip is running out of literally everything so of course we are working a lot on the Egyptian side because the Rafa border at the southern part of the Gaza Strip is the only door open at the moment but then again if we are not able to enter if we're not able to get a safe access everything is becoming more complicated and once you've gathered those resources obviously you then need to distribute them and get them to the right people how do you make sure that you do get them to the right people and they don't fall into the into the wrong hands for example like those of Hamas you know Israel has said it doesn't want it doesn't want petrol getting into to to Gaza if it's going to go to Hamas for example I mean how do you how do you go about making sure you do get it to the people in need well as a International Federation of rrent we have of course our principal code of conduct and all the policies in place and of course also all our National Society are banded by these rules and first and foremost I would say neutrality but also Independence so mainly what we are sure about is is that once humanitarian Aid is in the hands of the palestin Crescent they will distribute Aid based on their independent assessment to the people more in need so this is uh this is what we are doing in every kind of Emergency Response as well as in Gaza and then of course there is um there are a system in place to make sure and to control that this is happening what about the money that's actually needed within Gaza I mean the UN said that Gaza was already short on billions of dollars before the latest war broke out how much money is needed there now to just keep the basic Services going I think that speaking about a figure at the moment it's almost impossible it would be much more speculation rather than a proper figure because we are in a situation where even need I mean the assessment of the needs in the in in the field it's it's still very complicated I mean we know that food and water are running short we know that fuel is not anymore there for electricity we know from our people in the hospitals in our two hospitals that medicines and medicinal supplies are not anymore there but then speaking about a figure at the moment it's really complicated what I can say is that needs are growing day by day so the more this conflict will go ahead the more this figure will will grow I that's the problem isn't it that that it's getting deeper and deeper and as infrastructure gets destroyed and hospitals run out of important equipment how can you even begin to start to repair and replace things like that well I think that in this phase it's really much more uh to make sure that we have a life-saving line of supplies medicines food and water fuel as I said that are really getting the basic to the to the people in Gaza then we we will think about reconstruction of course I mean what I can tell you in the hospitals at the moment we are talking about empty shelves we are hearing stories of surgeries made without paining heers so we are really at the moment we are really at a stage where the basic are lacking so H it's difficult to see to I mean to speak about reconstruction we do hope that when we'll have a pause on on on the fighting we will be able to talk about that and you're right to say that obviously it's more important to focus on on what's going on right now than the the eventual reconstruction so let's talk about for example medical supplies and such is there enough out there and in the region to be able to support Gaza out there yes I mean we have I mean the needs are so enormous that we will always uh be in need of something sincerely speaking now reality is that at the Rafa border again on the Egyptian side there are cues of thousands and of trucks ready to go in uh and this is why we are calling on all the parties to make sure that this access is not only like 10 trucks per day or eight trucks per day but it's really much more continuous and sustainable and again to have a safe humanitarian space where to deliver this this humanitarian Aid we saw a great wave of solidarity I have to admit on both sides uh different partners and donors ready to to help and ready to react but then again in the case of of Gaza Strip if we don't have access it it's really complicated to bring this humanitarian Aid so access it's really the key at the moment well indeed and one of the the key fears for the conflict is that it does spread Beyond you know the immediate territory that it's currently in and into to neighboring countries if that were to happen would that make getting the necessary Aid to Gaza almost impossible you know as a humanitarian I want to stay all the time optimistic so I'm sure that even in the worst case scenario we will not spare any effort to bring humanitarian a inside Gaza Strip I think that the problem here is really to be of course prepare to the wars and this is uh what we are doing also with our regional appeal to make sure that also neighboring countries and our national Societies in neighboring countries are ready to react and to respond in case of any emergencies but the hope is also that together with being prepared it's spare no effort to avoid the situation will go worse okay Tomaso Del longa from The Intern Federation of Red Cross and red crescent societies thank you so much for joining us on DW business thank
