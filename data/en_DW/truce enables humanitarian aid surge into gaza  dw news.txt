Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas have agreed to extend their 4-day truce by another two days qatal which mediated the deal confirmed the extension hours before the ceasefire was due to end on Tuesday the extension opens the way for the release of more Israeli hostages being held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails now Israel has received a list of 10 more hostages to be released today 69 Israeli foreign host es have already been freed under the terms of the original deal between Israel and Hamas in exchange 150 Palestinian prisoners have been released from Israeli detention now Israel says 239 people were seized by Palestinian militants on October 7th about 170 are believed to still being held in Gaza on Monday 11 hostages arrived back in Israel and have been reuniting with friends and family more Israeli hostages finally free women and children again made up the latest group to be released by Hamas the release filmed by the militant group before they were quickly escorted back to Israel and flowing on to hospitals and waiting families this is an exciting and heart feeling moment but we also understand that is the beginning of a difficult Rehabilitation process for sain Aras are still young and have been through an unbearable experience dual Nationals of France Argentina and Germany were among those released including French Israeli itan yahalomi who was finally able to reunite with his mother Palestinians are celebrating homecomings too with 33 more women and young people released from Israeli prisons as part of the exchange it's an Indescribable Joy I'm very happy I hope that others will soon be released from Israeli prisons my friends my cousins 150 Palestinian prisoners have been freed in recent days a last minute extension of the PO and fighting is expected to bring further releases on both sides Israel has already received a list of 10 more hostages due to be freed by Hamas today Israeli troops continue to patrol gaza's border amid the truce which is now set to expire on Thursday but International pressure is growing for it to be extended even further Israel has received a list of more hostages due to be freed by Hamas as the truce extends into a fifth day DW correspondent Tanya Kramer is covering the story from Jerusalem and told us more they have received a list of uh more hostages we don't know exactly um the number yet so this is part of the extended uh truth agreement that was um you know agreed upon on Monday so basically what is happening now is that the authorities here are reviewing uh this list and then they notify uh the families of course this is good news for the families because it means now that potentially uh we will see at least 10 more hostages uh uh that are would be expected to be freed later today in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners that also will be freed than later today Tanya how did the extension of the truce come about and and could we potentially see it extended [Applause] further well I think both sides had signal that they would be interested in extending uh the truth each side of course for their own uh interest so we've been seeing that the original agreement provided for this extension saying that for each additional 10 hostages that Hamas could release uh and uh the willingness of Israel also to release more Palestinian uh prisoners uh the truth could be extended uh for one more day and this is what we've been seeing now so it's just an extension uh for two days uh um that has been agreed upon on Monday uh under the mediation by Qatar Egypt but also uh by the United States um Israel has said that they have now approved a list of 50 more potential Palestinian prisoners that could be released putting it to 350 so far they have 150 Palestinian prisoners they have released from uh Israeli prisoners and Israel has also uh Hamas has also agreed to the same uh terms but of course it's all a very fragile process uh I think there will be a lot of international pressure we also expecting that the US Secretary uh of State uh Anthony blinkin uh will is expected to arrive again in the region on Thursday just when uh this new extension uh might expire so um you know it's seen here day by day today to see whether these hostages will be released without further delay and then we have just to wait and see whether there will be another extension okay thank you that's our Tanya Kramer reporting for us in Jerusalem the truce in Gaza has been extended by two days giving the people living there a temporary sense of relative calm and a better chance to access humanitarian aid but Aid organizations warn the situation for civilians across the Gaza Strip remains dire these kids Brave the weather and still play outside but the cool and riny conditions are an additional burden for many in the makeshift shelters in Gaza the rain and cold have worn me out and I can't do anything my clothes are all wet and I can't change them I have no clothes no food no water I haven't drank water in two days and there's no bathroom to use and that where is eight [Music] organizations then of course you've got you know hundreds of thousands of children who are not in school who are in very overcrowded camps who are cold it's starting to rain who do not have enough food do not have enough water who are now at risk of of a disease outbreak it's a horrendous situation gaza's Health Service has been facing chronic shortages since the fighting started as patients are transferred from the north to the South hospitals there are overwhelmed the situation is very very tragic the hospital can't bear this burden of cases there's no capacity it means that the equipment is insufficient tools and consumables are lacking and there is a shortage of medical and nursing staff but thanks to the extended POR in fighting some Aid is getting to where it's needed I would say it's a glimpse of Hope and Humanity in the middle of the darkness of war and I strongly hope that this will enable us to increase even more the humanitarian Aid to the people in Gaza that is suffering so much knowing that uh even with that additional amount of time it will be impossible to satisfy all the dramatic needs of the population in Gaza these civilians have a Lifeline as long as the guns stay silent and I can now speak to K West Bank and Gaza country director Hiba Tibi who joins me from ramala in the occupied West Bank welcome to DW um there has been a surge in Aid that's entering Gaza is it is it making a difference good morning dear yes of course it makes a difference every drop of water every bag of wheat makes a difference unfortunately as since weeks now we have been waiting for the moment where we can cover the needs of people on the ground uh an all Gaza Strip and the level of hunger the level of thirst the level of diseases uh the level of uh uh displacement is massive any entry of of food assistance of water of medical supplies of fuel will make a huge difference but of course it is not sufficient what happened over the last four days and of course with we were having the clock ticking towards the end of the day everyone was terrified that the truth will not be extended uh we were so reliefed to have additional two days but 2 days and 4 days and 10 days are not enough uh a long-term ceasefire will allow for a more sustained intervention that would help in the covering of the needs of people in the north and in the South and here speaking of people in the north is Aid reaching them it is reaching them water has been distributed but it's in a very very limited quantities and what we have seen over the last days is even if they receive the aid it will be for that specific day or for the other the the coming two days so maximum for days so for instance if they are receiving bottled water it will last only four days what we hope is that uh um for instance the fuel H is is entering Gaza in sufficient quantity Where the desalination units fully functioning there are also some attempts for the main uh uh unit in Gaza which also makes a difference there are also some wheat flow as you can see in the in the on the report on the screen bakeries are opening again but but of course the the quantities are are limited and not enough for the demand that exist winter is is is approaching uh in the region so so what needs to be done uh to mitigate the impacts of of that cold and rainy weather uh for people especially those who are displaced so not traditionally normally in in in in Winter whether we like it or not not we get diseases we get uh our immune system gets a little bit affected by the weather imagine being in crowded places lacking hygiene practices with no medication malnutrition is happening across everywhere and of course no way of of uh um energy to to warm up the places being un under uh uh under constant train over the last week and the last uh we had over the last two days last week also we had lots of rain all of that is is unfortunately making the situation very terrifying where we are very afraid that that spread of diseases uh um is going to influence people's life as as H even more danger in a more dangerous way compared to bombing and air strikes Hiba we're almost out of time but if you could just quickly tell me um how your staff on the ground are preparing uh in case this truce is not extended what we have done so far is that we secured uh um supplies in the north and in the South today by while we are speaking these are being distributed our partners my staff are all on standby we have secured Water bottled water not in huge quantities but it makes a difference as I mentioned medical supplies for the hospital and what we call Hygiene kits in addition to shelter items tents blankets any materials that would make the people at least under the cover from that direct train right we appreciate that Hiba TB she is K uh excuse me K West Bank and Gaza country director and all the best to your colleagues on the ground in Gaza thank you Hiba thank
