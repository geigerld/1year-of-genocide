Yunis and it is also believed that there
 

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.389 align:start position:0%
Yunis and it is also believed that there
is<00:11:50.880><c> an</c><00:11:51.120><c> extensive</c><00:11:51.720><c> network</c><00:11:52.680><c> of</c><00:11:53.000><c> tunnels</c>

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
is an extensive network of tunnels
 

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.990 align:start position:0%
is an extensive network of tunnels

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
underneath the city and so now we're
 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.509 align:start position:0%
underneath the city and so now we're
seeing<00:11:56.440><c> that</c><00:11:56.600><c> the</c><00:11:56.760><c> north</c><00:11:57.360><c> has</c><00:11:57.680><c> more</c><00:11:57.880><c> or</c><00:11:58.240><c> less</c>

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
seeing that the north has more or less
 

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:01.550 align:start position:0%
seeing that the north has more or less

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
been clear this and and now IDF is
 

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
been clear this and and now IDF is
proceeding<00:12:02.200><c> with</c><00:12:02.440><c> the</c><00:12:02.760><c> South</c><00:12:03.760><c> and</c><00:12:03.959><c> the</c><00:12:04.200><c> idea</c>

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
proceeding with the South and the idea
 

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:07.230 align:start position:0%
proceeding with the South and the idea
is<00:12:04.800><c> then</c><00:12:05.000><c> to</c><00:12:05.240><c> expand</c><00:12:05.800><c> these</c><00:12:06.079><c> areas</c><00:12:06.519><c> so</c><00:12:06.720><c> to</c><00:12:07.000><c> push</c>

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
is then to expand these areas so to push
 

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.750 align:start position:0%
is then to expand these areas so to push
out<00:12:07.720><c> Hamas</c><00:12:08.720><c> as</c><00:12:08.880><c> much</c><00:12:09.120><c> as</c><00:12:09.279><c> they</c><00:12:09.480><c> can</c><00:12:10.079><c> probably</c>

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
out Hamas as much as they can probably
 

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.110 align:start position:0%

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
Central Gaza and so um the idea here is
 

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.430 align:start position:0%
