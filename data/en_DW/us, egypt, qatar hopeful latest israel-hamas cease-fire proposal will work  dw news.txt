Egypt Qatar and the United States have released a joint statement after two days of talks in Doha backing a so-called bridging proposal they hope the new draft will bring Hamas and Israel toward a ceasefire deal Hamas which did not take part in the talks uh is accusing Israel of negotiating in bad faith the talks are aimed at ending the 10-month long war in Gaza securing the release of Israeli hostages and averting a wider Regional configration and negotiations are set to resume next week in Cairo speaking to reporters in Washington US President Joe Biden expressed optimism about the new deal I'll say one thing about one of the reason why I was late for you all was I was dealing with the ceasefire effort in the Middle East and uh we are closer than we've ever been I don't want to jinx anything may have something but we're not there yet but it's much much closer than it was 3 days ago so keep your fingers thank you let's get more on this with journalist balik sadine in Tel Aviv who's been following the story for us so Biden there sounding quite optimistic Israel has now also put out a statement saying it appreciates the mediator efforts to convince Hamas to agree to a deal what do you think this statement tells us about Israel's thinking on the way the talks are going so far well um that takes us back to the um position that the Prime Minister holds that the few not changes exactly but more clarifications that Israel has requested from the mediators should be actually um accepted by Hamas and uh he is hoping or Israel is hoping that the mediators will put more pressure on Hamas in order to reach that deal in Israel there are some talks that the fact that the ation that went to CYO on Thursday stayed one more night it was supposed to come back in the same night but stayed one more night because of the impression that D Bara the head of the mad and the other members of the delegation when they met their Qatari counterparts and the Qatari officials saying that or at least according to sources they are putting more pressure on Hamas and that's why they stayed one more night and they made more talks on the topic on Friday as well so today as well and the talks as I said are uh that as you said excuse me are presumed to um resume on Sunday Cairo and supposed to be um dealing with or focusing on the Philadelphia Corridor issue yeah tell us more about that what are these remaining gaps that the mediators are hoping to address well two main issues and the third bigger issue let's say the first two issu issues that are being uh um dealt with right now is the Philadelphia Kor prime minister Netanyahu wants the Israeli Army to stay in the Philadelphia Corridor uh in the first um uh phase of the deal the deal is supposed to be three phases so the first phase the humanitarian phase naan wants Israeli troops to stay in Philadelphia Corridor Because he believes and of course the other um Security Branch in Israel believe that Hamas will be able to rehabilit themselves if Israel gets out of there through the tunnel networks and through smuggling of Weaponry that's first the second issue is the Narin Corridor the same Corridor that Israel made that splits the Gaza Strip into two parts uh natany wants to monitor wants some way some system to monitor the people that go back to their homes to the north of the Gaza Strip not to carry weapons with them so not militants only civilians until now there's no solution for the monitoring issue and Hamas of course refuses that and the bigger issue is the fact that Hamas still wants Israel to declare the end of the war at the end of the first phase that's another bigger issue I guess these are the sticking points thank you for laying those out we know US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is flying to the region and he set to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do we know anything about what might take place in this meeting well this is his eighth or ninth if I'm not mistaken visit to the region blinkin um supposed to come but like I don't think that he has anything new uh to offer just the same as Hawkin in Lebanon a couple of days ago he didn't have any have any new to the Lebanese and to the Israelis with his um visit and that's I guess is going to be the same situation here of course when Friday we are in Friday night in Israel so it's the Shabbat Israeli officials don't um put out statements about this uh in this time but um in the blink supposed to meet the Israeli officials on Monday morning Israel time and uh um to uh uh try to convince the Israelis to go for this um ceasefire deal and put more pressure on Israel the Americans their main concern right now is not to uh drag not to be dragged into a fullblown out war between Israel and Iran and they see an opportunity here if Israel and Hamas of course agree to that ceasefire deal maybe that will be avoided and even the entire strike that Iran is uh vowing to uh um to conduct maybe could also be avoided let's get the very latest here from journalist kareim Al goari following that story for us from Cairo good to see you again after this second day of talks do we know what is contained in this so-called bridging proposal yeah we don't have really any details it's said that it's closing the gaps and it's based on an old proposal that's on the table since uh May basically in this proposal we have several phases uh in which uh Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages are exchanged first for a six weeks Fe ceasefire then for a permanent ceas fire this proposal Israel rejected it because they didn't accept the idea of a permanent ceasefire and Hamas wanted to have a full withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the Gaza Strip now what means here closing the gaps we really don't know yet but it seems to be that there's enough in it that all parties will meet again end of next week in Cairo so parties meeting again in Cairo is it too early to say what kind of reaction we've seen from Hamas and the Israeli side uh to what's been discussed so far yeah I think maybe it is too early because uh the Israeli delegation is leaving Doha now back to Israel where they have to of course bring this back to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin netan who is going to meet also on Monday the US Secretary of State anony blinkin and of course Hamas has to bring back the proposal to um uh Yahya Sinar in Gaza in order also to say what they say about it there's a first statement in officially by Hamas saying that this is not what was agreed upon until now but that as I said is an inofficial statement we really have to wait what the leadership itself is going to say about this so still waiting as you say from That official statement from the Hamas leadership talks are due to continue next week in Cairo can you just spell out for us a little bit more where we think we are going to see these remaining obstacles well um I mean what is interesting is the pressure the pressure that is done now mainly I think by the US it's interesting that um the US was the US was the one who blocked VTO ceasefire ideas in the UN Security Council for many months now it seems that a ceasefire cannot come fast enough for the US uh of course that has mainly two reason there is the fear of a real escalation in the with Iran with hisbah in South in in Lebanon and with the hes in Yemen that's one fear and there's the upcoming US elections I think this is why the US is trying now very very hard to bring all sides together because they need this success but as I said we don't know until now what closing the gaps here really means by substance we have heard quite an optimistic tone coming from the US I must say at the national secr excuse me security spokesperson stressing earlier today that these remaining obstacles can be overcome do you think we're seeing that same optimism coming from other mediators well that remains to be mediators maybe I mean the decisive thing is what Israeli Prime Minister Ben and what Yahya senar from Hamas is going to say about it they have the ultimate say about it but obviously all sides are now under enormous pressure by the US and also by the other mediators by Egypt and byat who are really afraid of a further escalation in the region if this deal doesn't come to a close and that would be an escalation that might be very very difficult to control well thank you so much for joining us today on DW news that is journalist kareim alohar in Cairo you're welcome
