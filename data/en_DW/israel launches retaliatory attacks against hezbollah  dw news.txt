fears are growing of an escalation in the fighting along the Israel Lebanon border that's following Saturday's deadly rocket strike on the Israeli controlled golen Heights at least 12 children and teenagers were killed and dozens more wounded after Rockets hit a football field in an Arab Drew Community Israel is blaming Hezbollah for the attack but the iran-backed militant group denies any involvement the funeral procession through the streets of maal Shams was thousands strong the rocket strike that killed 12 people on a soccer field was the deadliest attack in months since then exchanges of fire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have escalated for the local Drew community in the Israel occupied Golan Heights it's a shock we are not more precious than children who are killed anywhere else in the country nor than the innocent killed in southern Lebanon more than innocent children killed in Gaza our children are not more precious than them we're human beings we live our lives in peace and Tranquility we need to strive now to sign a deal and stop this damned War we want to live we don't want to die despite regular crossb hostilities Hezbollah denies attacking the football pitch where the victims were playing but Israel's Army Chief says they have evidence proving otherwise this ISB rocket whoever fires Rockets like these into an urban area wants to kill civilians wants to kill children Israeli Defense Forces reacted just hours later they say this footage shows air strikes against Hezbollah military Targets in Southern and Central Lebanon we are significantly increasing are read for the next stage of fighting in the north at the same time we are fighting in Gaza we are also able to attack very far away from the state of Israel there will be more challenges we will increase our Readiness we will act strong when needed Lebanon has warned that a significant attack by Israel would lead to a regional War we can now speak to DW correspondent Tanya Kramer she joins us from maal Shams which is of course the sight of yesterday's rocket attack so Tanya can you give us a sense of what the situation is right now where you are well this is certainly a town in shock and in mourning we saw the funeral processions and the 11 children were laid to rest we understand from police sources a 12th child is still Officially Missing and they're uh uh trying to identify uh uh the child now we're standing here here at this football uh pitch uh where it all happened and people talking to us here they said it all happened very fast there was an aid saren and just a couple of seconds later they heard a hit uh when those children here all aged between the ages of 10 to 20 uh were killed and many were were injured uh some of them are still some of them seriously injured uh in a hospital so uh they almost didn't stand a chance you know to run for a small shelter which is over there uh to run uh for their safety so um people here are still very worried what there's to come but also of course today it is a day of morning here and now Tanya as we've mentioned Israel already launched a number of retaliatory strikes on presumed Hezbollah positions in Lebanon can we expect more yes the Army has said they had uh carried out retaliatory strikes already overnight as they say deep inside Lebanon but also in southern Lebanon on infrastructure uh hasola infrastructure but of course right now everybody's waiting uh to to see what if if you will hear from them the uh Israeli security cabinet it has been convening this afternoon prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu came back from the United States what they will decide there's a lot of pressure inside from this government to retaliate forcefully but we also understand from diplomatic forces that they don't want to see a wider escalation so it all depends in what scope uh uh Israel it's expected they will retaliate but in what scope and and and when this will happen because all of this of course as you rightly said there are uh concerns that this could lead uh to uh a wider escalation even a wider war that was DW correspondent Tanya Kramer reporting for us from majal Shams in the Golden Heights Tanya thank you Marina Miron is a military analyst with King's College London and a short time ago I asked her why Hezbollah is denying the attack on the Israeli controlled Goen Heights well first of all if we look at the Dynamics of the conflict between Israel and hasah we have seen these Ted fortad attacks going on but both sides were sticking to so-call UNR Rules of Engagement and trying to hit only military Targets on both sides and I do not believe that hasah has any interest in escalating this conflict and perhaps Israel doesn't either because this would spark a uh bigger conflict in the Middle East with a potential involvement of other actors such as Iran and therefore for for Hezbollah it wouldn't be the best time to start this conflict its aims are fairly limited and I think uh from a logical from a military perspective and as we've heard before um the missile might have been misfired and there is there was a military installation very close by they um they they wouldn't want to Target civilians waste their missiles on targeting civilians so it would seem a little bit out of character for hollah and so I think what they're trying to do is prevent the further escalation to this conflict we've already seen Israel retaliating with a number of strikes on Hezbollah Targets in Lebanon but we did hear the Israeli government warning that Hezbollah will pay a price for this loss so is there going to be more what could uh this kind of additional retaliation look like well that's actually a good question because uh what we have seen so far as the um Israeli strikes on Lebanon are not meant to be um carried out as retaliation for the earlier strike by by supposedly by Hezbollah so we are awaiting a wider response and nobody knows what this response will be like and of course it is a huge concern for the United States and as other allies of Israel therefore I think before Israel can formulate a response um the Allies will exert pressure in order to ensure that the conflict doesn't escalate and specifically I'm talking about the United States because um we know that next week there should be uh ceasefire negotiations in Rome and that could undermine those negotiations and potentially prolong the conflict in Gaza that was Marina Miron a military analyst with the war studies department at King's College London Marina many thanks indeed for your insights well we can now bring in DW Beirut bureau chief Muhammad sh Muhammad good to see you what can you tell us about Israel's strikes on Lebanon and about possible reactions by Hezbollah well Israel has been striking Lebanon over last night it carried out at least five different attacks including an air strike deep inside Lebanese territory near bbeak a city in Northeast Lebanon nearly 70 k away from the border with Israel usually this is followed by retaliatory attack byah on Northern Israel and and that has been the case uh this afternoon hasah um claimed two attacks at least up until now on Israeli uh positions in Northern uh Israel the the the armed group is on high alert here in Beirut we've been hearing uh that it cleared out some key sites in both lebanon's South and Eastern baa Valley in the event of a possible attack by Israel following the deadly attack on the Israeli occupied Golan Heights which Israel is blaming onah and hasbullah is denying yeah so um you know indeed we've heard uh already for several hours the denials from Hezbollah that it was responsible for that attack on the Drews Community what exactly have they been saying well we know that hasah claimed did claim uh uh that it carried out at least 12 attacks on Israeli positions yesterday including two attacks on Israeli positions in the gulan Heights one of which is really close to M sham so it could be that the missile did wrongly hit the soccer field in Mah is is denying this it also could be that the Israeli interception um Iron Dome U fired a missile that hit that soccer field Israel is uh obviously denying uh this as well but this has been widely uh uh shared opinion in in Lebanon and across uh the the region so M CHS is prominent predom predominantly um resided by um Arab Drews and that's that's a major reason uh why hasah wouldn't want to Target this Arab uh community and that's why it's it's denying any responsibility for the attack and now Muhammad what has been the official reaction from Lebanese officials and also can you give us a sense of how ordinary people feel about this latest escalation well certainly tension is building on on this front and that brings about anxiety in in beut and fear from a wider confrontation you know an allout War cannot be ruled out in in such very tense times however it is still like it feels like a a contained confrontation at least for the time being and this has really been the case since October so the front looks like U very tensed on on the edge of a an allout War but then it goes back to calm and the to the daily routine the usual tick for tack between buah and the Israeli Army now we know that political and diplomatic um um calls and talks with Lebanon and Israel have been already established to deescalate the situation particularly from the US and Lebanese uh foreign minister said so he said that the US asked uh the Lebanese government to curb hasah and in return the Lebanese government asked uh the US to um ask Israel to actually exercise restraint that was DW beu bureau chief Muhammad traa Muhammad thank you so much for your reporting we appreciate it
