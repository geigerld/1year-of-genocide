the Hamas militant group has handed over another batch of hostages the 13 Israelis and four Tha Nationals are now safe in Israel after the Red Cross escorted them from Gaza the release was delayed after Hamas accused Israel of preventing Aid tracks from reaching Northern Gaza afterwards Israel released another group of 39 Palestinians who had been held in Israeli prisons they are seen here in a Red Cross bus arriving to a welcoming crowd in the West Bank Town of by tunia this was the second group of Palestinian prisoners to be freed as part of the 4-day truce between Israel and Hamas Hamas has only agreed to release 50 of about 240 hostages they are believed to be holding family members described an agonizing wait for the second release late Saturday night as negotiations dragged on for hours the deal almost collapsing before the captives were released DWS Ben fulan spoke to some of them gaed in central Tel Aviv who say they won't rest until all the hostages are freed they're here to give the hostages left behind a voice the demonstrators want the Israeli government to do more it's been 50 days that's why rally organizers called up a 50,000 strong crowd they say a 100,000 came to what's now known as hostage Square including family and friends of G chansy Hamas terrorists took her captive on October 7 later killing her brother this 13 years old girl who doesn't know that her brother was killed her parents didn't even do a funeral yet because they're waiting for the girl so we're really worried and we want them home she's one of so many still in captivity with the clock ticking and a ceasefire that could break any [Applause] time that's not stopping a nation from uniting people who have um family members who were murdered are here to support the people whose families are are being hostage and I think that means everything uh the Israeli Society must rise from this moment and I think this evening here shows that even relatives of those already released to his tonight this symbolic banquet table finally beginning to fill with its guests the freed hostages like Adena Moshe we are all excited so excited H the joy of everybody in the family was amazing yesterday we had shouted of joy and cheerful once we heard that she and we saw her a picture through the Egyptian TV in the vcle of the Kamas going to be released and you know we prep prep this type of shirts which we are not going to use anymore but uh today we come here to stand by with the whole families of hostages because we are one big family and though they released ad Moshe they are still over 200 hostages still in Gaza strep and my family we came more than 30 people to support and will continue come we know the whole families will stay together until everybody is going to be released and your aunt is quite defiant I my aunt is amazing she's powerful lady even though she's 72 years old when she go out of the Kamas vle she slapped the Terrorist on his hand which become viral everywhere so maybe she's weak in body but they never managed to break a spirit she's powerful one something to celebrate [Music] tonight because who knows what tomorrow will bring the roller coaster of emotions continues and this is far from over it's a difficult situation everyone knows people down here have told me it's uh they're leaving it up to the government to do their job but uh prime minister Benjamin n who repeated it again today it is one of their priorities uh releasing these hostages of course he also wants to defeat Hamas but releasing the hostages is not the number one priority and that's what families down here have a problem with DW's Tanya Kramer is standing by in Jerusalem hello Tanya a huge turnout for that rally at hostage Square in Tel Aviv is the public pressure on prime minister bamin Netanyahu increasing or easing due to the hostage releases by Hamas well I think it is both and then we we heard it in this report I think right now the focus is on really getting those uh 50 hostages that were agreed upon in this uh uh agreement uh out from Gaza today is the third day uh that we're expecting again more hostages to be released in exchange for uh Palestinian prisoners but of course the pressure on the government will not subside and and the huge turnout uh on S night uh at in Tel Aviv shows that because what people are really concerned about is that for now it's you know those 50 hostages um there's still also uh it's very clear it is a very fragile process we saw it on Saturday when you know the hostage uh uh the freeing of the hostage was uh of the hostages were was delayed and uh there will be uh afterwards still almost 200 hostages that will be still being held uh in Gaza so families there are very concerned about it but we've also seen a bit of a smaller demonstration in Jerusalem in front of the prime minister's residence uh on Saturday night uh with people calling for his resignation and I think at the moment the focus is of course that the nation comes together to free those hostages but the questions how the government handled it and what has been uh done these will not subside and they might grow stronger once you know the hostages are brought back home as you said it's a very fragile process there was a lot more tension on Saturday with a release process what went wrong well the delay came after Hamas accused Israel of violating uh the agreement uh we know publicly Hamas said that uh Israel was on the one hand interfering in this selection process how the Palestinian prisoners that are slated to be released that is also every day um uh were selected and they also said that no Aid was arriving actually in the north of Gaza Israel had denied that and Egyptian and uh katari mediators interfered they were mediating and they said they finally solved the issue and uh the hostages were released and very late uh on Saturday night they were handed over to the International Red Cross uh then were brought uh on the isra side to the hospitals and they were overnight then reunited uh with their families so at one point the Israeli defense minister said if Hamas would not release hostages as planned yesterday negotiations would continue quote Under Fire was the Israeli military ready to restart hostilities you think well I think this threat is always there because Israel has made it very clear that you know even once the four days that have been agreed upon although there are talks now that they might be extended that maybe more hostages might be released uh in exchange for Palestinian prisoners but that the war will resume one way or another and this has been talked about here they have been very open about it because their goal is uh to eliminate Hamas and to dismantle their infrastructures so this threat is very much always there before you go Tanya can we expect another exchange today that seems to be the plan right that is the plan um we understand the the prime minister's office has released a statement that they have again received a list of names of the hostages that are expected to be released today we're expecting it maybe in the same time frame again in the afternoon we're not uh yet having all this uh information about it of course uh this is a good news because it means the process is ongoing but it's also very necessary because humanitarian Aid organizations are saying they need also this time to get the aid that is also part of this uh agreement uh into Gaza and they're hoping of course that the time will be extended for that okay did abuse Tanya ker thank
