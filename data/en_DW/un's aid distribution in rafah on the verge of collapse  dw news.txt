the United Nations is warning that humanitarian operations inside Gaza are nearing collapse the organization says it's no longer able to distribute food Aid in the southern city of Rafa due to a lack of supplies and fears over safety it says its main Aid Agency for Palestinian refugees unra and the world food program are unable to access their warehouses in Rafa because of Israel's ongoing military operation after fleeing Rafa many come here to De albala camp in central gasa but the situation here is not much better people cue for basic supplies as temperatures sore they're desperate for water if there is no water we can't shower if there is no water we can't drink if there is no water we can't do the dishes we can't do anything life stops we're suffering a lot with heavy fighting around Rafa the Israeli military says nearly 900,000 th000 people have fled the area these satellite images show the scale of the movement in recent weeks hundreds of tents and shelters have been removed the UN says humanitarian operations in gasa are near collapse as almost no Aid can enter and they no longer have access to its warehouses in Rafa our colleagues at Ana report that today the agency's Distribution Center as well as the world food program's warehouses both both in Rafa are now inaccessible due to ongoing military operation Ana says that its Health Centers have not received any medical supplies for the past 10 days despite this healthc Care staff continue to provide thousands of medical consultations each day at health centers that are still operational people had hoped the pier constructed by the US would bring some urgently needed relief but so far it hasn't been nearly enough we have been waiting for this aid for hours and we have not received anything it just doesn't reach us I Ask America the International Community and all the Muslim world to end this war all we want is for this war to end the US says is working on creating alternative routes to speed up Aid deliveries until that happens many people leave here empty-handed let's bring in our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca ritters uh for the latest Rebecca we just heard the UN there saying that Aid distribution centers in Rafa are now inaccessible can you tell us why Israel is blocking Aid operations in Rafa well Terry Israel maintains that it isn't blocking uh the distribution of Aid or it isn't blocking I should say those Road Crossings uh into Gaza and by its own statistics says that on Monday for example more than 400 trucks were inspected Ed and transferred to Gaza though when you drill down into those numbers it looks as though some 40 trucks were crossed into Gaza through that Northern Ares Crossing and the other numbers that they refer to um are mainly these the ashdod port for example and crossings uh with the Jordan and the West Bank that then come through and to be transferred into Gaza of course they also include numbers from this jots this temporary Pier that the US have built that you just heard about in that report there uh so much fewer than the 400 trucks really getting into Gaza and we're seeing from un figures that only 69 trucks have made it through since the Rafa uh incursion began some two weeks ago so really kind of um discrepancy in the figures there and of course as you hearing real real distribution issues uh even once the aid does pass in and trying to get it to those desperate people who desperately need it um so when we look at the numbers when we we're looking pre-war 500 trucks a day going into Gaza uh you know humanitarian organizations saying 600 trucks a day minimum are needed to avert some kind of this humanitarian catastrophe that we're seeing when you look at the figures you can see the discrepancy in numbers of what's needed and what's getting in Rebecca can you briefly bring us up to date on what Israel is doing with its military operation there in Rafa we heard in our report 900,000 people have already left that southern city well that is what we're hear ing some 900,000 that's uh very close to the number of just over 1 million who were Sheltering there so a large percentage of that population now having left we're hearing though where they've gone to is also a dire humanitarian situation the Israel Israelis saying that they've set up these humanitarian zones but people on the ground humanitarian organizations saying that they are uh not satisfactory and not able to cope with the huge amount of numbers of people who are trying to head there uh the operation continues and we've seen time and time again that Israel is adamant uh on continuing its operation in Rafa though it has in recent days said that it is going to try to mitigate or uh under pressure from the United States limit these operations in Rafa as opposed to going into a full scale operation as we saw in other cities Rebecca thank you very much our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca ritters there here's what the head of the un's humanitarian Affairs office for the region had to say about the situ ation on the ground the closure of Rafa cring as severed access to fuel for humanitarian activities the entry of critical humanitarian items and curtail the movement of Staff protection of Civilian for us remain essential of course as it is humanitarian asset and supplies uh and we are seeking assurances from all parties to the conflict uh that that they should help us to protect those uh and ensure respect of of civilians let's bring in our Washington correspondent Janelle Duman Janelle what's the latest you've been hearing from the UN about the situation unfolding in Rafa yes so as we heard the UN has suspended food distribution in Rafa their warehouses are inaccessible to them now earlier we actually reached out to the UN to ask if they had any indication of when they might be able to restart delivery they quite predictably said no they don't it would depend very much on the security situation in Rafa and how it unfolds now we don't know for certain how many people are in Rafa exactly some 800,000 people are thoughts have fled since Israel started its operation there some two weeks ago it's however thought that several hundred thousand people are still there and the situation of course is very dire we heard from a spokesperson of the world food program who said that uh food Aid distribution had to be stopped in Rafa as well amid exhausted food stocks she said that food Aid distribution is ongoing in central Gaza which is of course where many of those who fled Rafa fled to but dwindling stocks there also means that they may see they may soon see that Supply exhausted as well she said that if supplies and food aren't restarted in Gaza in massive quantities then famine likee conditions could certainly be expected there and there was this pier being built by the US military That was supposed to provide an alternative entry point for Aid what's going on with that because it appears to have stalled indeed now that us built Pier on uh that us built Pier on the gazen coast was meant to accelerate deliveries and on Friday the first 10 trucks did roll off of a ship onto that Pier but over the weekend on Saturday 11 trucks were stopped by a group of Palestinians needing food and Aid and in the end only half of that Convoy made it to the warehouse and there were no more deliveries on Sunday and Monday now the world food program made the point that this issue of people taking aid from the convoys and not waiting for that Aid to be distributed this is going to be an issue that keeps recurring unless uh the consistency of food Aid distribution is guaranteed the fact of the matter is they see a truck they see a chance to eat they don't know when they're going to get another so the world food program is looking into alternative routs within Gaza it's looking to reexamine its Logistics and security measures but of course this is a very challenging Endeavor at this particular time time and Janelle of course there's the US presidential election looming um how much of an impact is this having on the campaign particularly for President Joe Biden well it's a very big problem for Joe Biden starting within his own party you have the more Progressive voices of his own party critical of Israel and critical of Biden's handling of the conflict between Israel uh between Israel and Gaza and um they are going to have a problem rallying their base and convincing them to vote Democrat come election time also worth noting we've seen weeks of Campus protests here in the US as especially young people are shocked uh by what they see as Washington enabling suffering in Gaza as it stands by its military ally Israel we don't know how that will impact the vote exactly but we do know that that is an expression of a widespread dissatisfaction at Joe Biden's policy and that will follow him to the election okay DW is Janelle Dalal L
