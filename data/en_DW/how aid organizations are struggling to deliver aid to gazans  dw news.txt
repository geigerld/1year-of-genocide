we begin in the Gaza Strip where the World Health Organization says not enough Aid is reaching civilians intensified fighting in Northern and Central Gaza has also halted several deliveries of medical supplies and fuel to hospitals Israeli troops are trying to root out Hamas militants who carried out deadly Terror attacks in Israel three months ago grabbing all they can from a Truck west of Gaza City bags of flour boxes of can [Music] food throughout the territory gazin face Mass hunger and disease the UN says one in four are starving the majority of gaza's population has been displaced at least once since the start of the war most depend on crossborder aid for survival those displaced say they are living in absolute desperation we have lost hope we've been listening to the news for 98 days hoping that the war will end but there is no hope all we see is this difficult situation we are in we have no water or electricity since water is scarce we can only show once a month it's taking a toll in our mental health and there are diseases spreading everywhere pressure to allow more Aid into Gaza is mounting on Israel the opening of a crossing at the Israel Egypt border has not significantly increased the rate of deliveries Aid trucks are often delayed waiting for security checks but Israel's military says it has now increased its capacity for screening we are ready and willing to facilitate as much humanitarian Aid as the world will give especially essential Aid like food medicine and shelter we do security checks on humanitarian Aid trucks Tru for weapons before they enter Gaza we have increased our screening capacity considerably but even when Aid gets through distribution is another problem the absence of security guarantees and intensified offensives around hospitals in Northern Gaza vital medical supplies can't get to people who need it most it means that hospitals don't have fuel it means that patients don't have food it means that um there aren't supplies to care for the patients un agencies say humanitarian corridors for Aid are needed now to save lives and earlier I spoke with Christian Lind meire from the world's Health Organization I asked him whether his staff were noticing a difference on the ground after the Israeli Army said it would facilitate more Aid into Gaza uh so the willingness is of course great but no we have not seen any change changes on the ground the words have yet to um translate into action on the ground the problem for us is the any permissions or any Aid coming in or evacuees going out is way too ad hoc it cannot be plan convoys sit for days waiting to get in convoys sit inside Gaza wanting to go to the north uh and are waiting for permissions although everything was planned as according to the instructions giving the at hoc situ that's the problem we're dealing with and of course in a in a short amount of time in a short window there can never be enough help brought to people even if the roads are then clear of attacks clear of bombs and clear of debris uh in order to bring material in or further up into Gaza what is most urgently needed at the moment that's a tricky question it's nearly everything I mean first of all right now it's really food and water for the people people patients including the patients on the operating tables and then right after surgery are begging for water and for food uh it needs fuel of course to uh to run the hospitals to run the generators uh to run ambulances and then it needs a lot of medical equipment from simple bandages and wound dressings to anesthetics uh in order to have amputations to be done under anesthesia and not without um to anything in between so but this is there it's there and that's the important part it is ready it's outside all the UN agencies are ready to deliver the convoys as your pictur show are a miles long partly waiting outside it needs to get in that procedure needs to be speeded up um and then of course inside Gaza the distribution is crucial and that was Christian lindmeier from the World Health Organization meanwhile the US Secretary of State is in the occupied West Bank for talks with Palestinian leaders Anthony blinkin has been meeting with the Palestinian Authority president mmud abas in rala Washington hopes that the Palestinian Authority could govern Gaza after Israel's war with Hamas Lincoln is on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East to try and prevent the conflict from spreading he earlier urged Israel to reduce the number of Civilian casualties as it battles Hamas militants earlier I spoke with DW correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem and asked her what blinkin wanted to achieve there while US Secretary of State anony blinkin has said he wanted to talk to the Palestinian leadership in particular Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas about post scenario post-war scenarios for Gaza what the role of the Palestinian Authority uh could be he also talked about that he wants to talk about reforming uh the Palestinian Authority for it to be able uh to play uh a role in such uh scenarios now you have to understand the Palestinian Authority has only limited governing uh control in some parts of the occupied West Bank they haven't been in uh Gaza since uh Hamas seized power there in 2007 but in general the Palestinian Authority has lost a lot of popularity also among ordinary Palestinians uh there have been no general elections since 2006 now for uh Palestinians there in Amala they of course want uh to to hear from the Americans what they are doing to end the war in Gaza but also what are they doing to protect the civilians their civilian population not just in Gaza but also in the occupied uh uh West Bank uh where there has been an increase in settler violence and we heard anony blinkin talking about that in his remarks on Tuesday evening he said he condemned uh the uh Violence by extremist Israeli settlers but also uh displacement by communities uh in the occupied West Bank and demolition and another very important uh issue for Palestinians is uh that the Americans will pressure the Israeli government to release uh tax revenues they withholding they needed uh for a functioning Palestinian Authority and that's also in the interest uh the US Secretary of State said in for Israel uh that the Palestinian Authority is not further weakened but strengthened to play its role blink also calling on Israel to be a partner to Palestinian leaders um but you mean you've highlighted it there in the face of this open conflict now with Hamas can the two sides find Common Ground I think there's not much common ground right now uh um because also we've been hearing repeatedly from the Israeli government from officials there that they don't see a role for the Palestinian Authority uh in Gaza or they have been very vague when it comes to plans uh how uh this will look like they're talking about Palestinian entities governing Gaza but they're not very clearly on who they mean by that also uh that is very much on the uh us agenda uh uh Anthony blinkin has talked a lot about the prospects or that they should be a pal the creation of a Palestinian State on the horizon he has also held talks in the region with other leaders uh he has been to Saudi Arabia there and he says there is a framework in place but it needs to have this uh Palestinian state um on the horizon uh that is what's needed uh to uh to achieve security and peace uh in the region and that uh this needs uh you know also the support uh of Israel they have to make some hard choices there Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem thank you and here are some other stories making news around the world the German foreign minister analina barbach is in Lebanon where she has been holding talks with the country caretaker prime minister najib maati they discussed tensions between Israel and the Shiite Lebanese Hezbollah militia barbach
